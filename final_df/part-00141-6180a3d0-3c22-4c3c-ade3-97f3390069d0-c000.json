{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"twobitcoder","summary":"Best console turn-based game of all time!","reviewText":"This is, without a doubt, the best turn-based console game I have ever played, with at least 40 hours of compelling gameplay. It has some extremely deep strategic gameplay that you just won't find in very many games today, and as such, it stands apart as an instant genre-busting classic. I am glad the 2K/Firaxis took a chance with this game. Like Civilization Revolution before it, this is glorious turn-based strategy (TBS) action for strategy fans, and should appeal to real-time strategy (RTS) fans as well.This game is quite hard, actually--or maybe I'm just not very good. I played through on Normal difficulty, and it took a while to get the hang of it, at least to where my soldiers don't die often. I was doing one really hard mission--can't recall the name--but it was the one where you first meet the behemoth battletech-like robot. It took about 4 hours. Ugh! But my peeps kept getting wiped so I'd have to reload. Finally managed to finish losing only one--my MEDIC, who I'd had for 15 missions. Very sad. You do get attached to the squad after so many missions, so one thing this game does exceptionally well is to engender empathy in the player. I do not want to lose my troops, not just because of the cost and training, but because it's like losing a primary character from a good TV series.There are some notable bugs, but they are not so distracting or ruinous that one would focus on bugs to the exclusion of the awesome gameplay to be found here. First, the most annoying one involves the camera. It usually does a fair job of keeping your characters in view but too often it fails and leaves you with a top-down view while they're in a building (when that happens, use the D-Pad to drop the POV level up or down). And in one case of uber-camera-fail, the camera went into orbit on me, to where my units were specs and I could see laser fire like tiny lines. This happened when I had the whole squad set to overwatch and a bunch of aliens landed in the middle of them.Another notable bug involves aliens spawning in the middle (or on top) of your squad. There are spawn points in the game that are used if you can't actively see the spot, but if it's in view then they won't spawn. But occasionally they do appear out of nowhere in the middle of a battle--quite unfair, too! Wish I could just \"magically appear\" right behind the enemy! That's a pretty big fail on the Suspension of Disbelief angle.The next noticeable bug involves the timing of notices in the base/hologram Earth room. Too often, an alert will come up, and while your dropship is flying to the destination, a second alert will come up and interfere with the pending new mission (such as: \"Egypt wants Thin Man corpses and will pay handsomely for a few...\"), with a pair of buttons: Dispatch or Later. It hasn't ruined the game, but seems like it could potentially do that if it appears while you were about to launch a mission, causing you to hit the wrong button.Once in a while, when the camera view shifts to \"first person\" while a soldier is shooting, the character will be facing in the wrong direction to where the weapon is firing.Fortunately, most of the bugs are user interface/camera issues, while the A.I. seems to justify the term most of the time. Characters do tend to walk intelligently to their destination. The Enemy a.i. works pretty well most of the time, that is, it can be really hard to defeat. But then, sometimes it fails badly too. One pretty bad bug involves the enemy \"seeing\" your troops through solid walls (not just an edge issue, but through untouched structures), and shooting said walls to obliterate them. Yay for destructible environments; boo for x-ray vision (there is no such \"tech upgrade\" as far as I know). The behemoth also seems to get confused while navigating interiors.Personally, I'm pretty hard on games in my reviews, and this one has kept my attention for the long term, like it's older sibling, CivRev. There is also quite a bit of replay here too, due to Xbox achievements and the obvious ability to play again after learning how to best make use of resources in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2013"}

In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith - and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.    Mirror&#x2019;s Edge delivers you straight into the shoes of this unique heroine as she traverses the vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"Practice makes perfect","reviewText":"It's not hard to believe why Mirror's Edge has such loyal fans that demand a sequel; this is one heck of a unique game. While there are several things that could be refined, a game like this is hard to come by. Here's my review:Story: 2/5Not one of the most gripping stories in existence, you play as Faith, a Runner. In a city that's tightly controlled, Runners are couriers that serve to deliver information, maneuvering across buildings and leaping from ledge to ledge. One day, Faith's sister is framed for murder and it's up to you to uncover the truth and set her free. Honestly, though, the finer details were hard for me to grasp, and I never really cared for any of the characters. The plot details just seemed to be convenient ways to explain why you went from area to area.Setting: 5/5Mirror's Edge sets itself apart from other titles with its intriguing art style. The city is 80% white. This probably has as much to do with symbolism as it does with signature style. Regardless, it worked for me. Structures like vents will obviously be black or blue, and the objects you'll interact with are red for ease of navigation. In between levels, cutscenes will feature a look that reminds me of E-Harmony commercials. It's all very stylistic and really makes the game stand out. Most of the time you'll be outdoors on rooftops, but sometimes you'll scramble through warehouses and other interior locations.Gameplay: 3/5Parkour. Lots of it. This game is almost all about agilely moving from one place to the next. Your move set includes actions such as wall-running, sliding, climbing, wall-jumping, rolling, coiling in the air, and of course sprinting. Little things in a video game are as thrilling as pulling off moves in Mirror's Edge smoothly. You'll be getting lots of feelings of accomplishment from this game. There are tidbits where you'll need to engage in combat. Needless to say, these segments are nowhere near as fun. Shooting mechanics are subpar; bullets have no impact on enemies up to the moment you kill them, and you throw away a gun as soon as its clip runs out of ammo. You can perform disarms on enemies at very specific instances, but the timing is just so awkward.  You do, however, have the option of meleeing your opponents, but again, the game falls short of spectacular on this front. Melee consists of a 3-hit combo, a jump kick, and a slide kick. That's it. Did I mention that 90% of your enemies are guys wearing S.W.A.T.-like suits?Missions: 4.5/5-CampaignThe campaign is 9 acts long; you can reasonably finish it in 1 or 2 days. That's not to say it's too short, though. You'll feel like the length is decent for this title. The levels are well designed and moments vary from peaceful to hectic. There's only one thing to do aside from just playing through the game, and that is collecting Runner Bags. These are the game's collectibles, but they're such a letdown. These serve no purposes except for earning a few trophies. I repeat: NO in-game reason to collect these.-Time TrialAn AWESOME mode. Time Trial takes short segments from the main game and require you to get through as quickly as possible. You'll earn Stars for various times, with 1 star being the lowest rating and 3 being the highest. For those that are interested, there are leaderboard spots to compete for. To obtain 3 star ratings, you'll often refer to Youtube videos to see the champs get through. In doing so, you'll learn valuable shortcuts that would have never occurred to you. This is an ingenious way to get players to learn the game inside and out.-Speed RunBasically, these are campaign levels again, except with a time counter. Your object is to finish below the target time. I recommend doing Time Trials first, to learn shortcuts for the full campaign levels. Essentially, Time Trial teaches you to better go through Campaign and Speed Run. It's worth noting that Time Trial and Speed Run demand both skill and patience.Overall: 4/5A very worthwhile experience. The plot is iffy and filled with characters you won't care about in the slightest, and combat is laughably horrendous, but you'll be treated to a one-of-a-kind setting, exhilarating parkour, and addicting game modes that ensure you get the most out of Mirror's Edge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"D. Ferrari","summary":"Amazing RPG completely addictive","reviewText":"We've all heard the saying \"This isn't your father's __________.\"  Well, this actually IS your father's RPG.  Dragon Age: Origins is a classic RPG.  It is heavily story driven, you can interact with almost every NPC you come in contact with.  The combat is turn-based so this isn't a button masher.  You set your strategies and the party will follow that unless you interrupt it with a special ability/spell or something which is simple to do with a pull of the trigger and a press of a button.  I will say to ignore the trailers and commercials with regards to the graphics of this game as they are average at best.  The game is completely emersive and you will find you've played for 3+ hours without even realizing it.  If you're looking for action this might not be the game for you.  This isn't Fable or Fallout 3 where you are going to encounter danger around every corner.  Think Knights of the Old Republic, or Final Fantasy VII.  The game is hugely replayable with 6 unique origin stories, and different endings based on your decisions during the game.  One more piece of advice that fits for all classic RPGs - SAVE OFTEN.Pros+ emersive story+ outstanding party members+ morally ambiguous conversation options+ replayability+ combatCons- graphics are dated- minor glitchesSo overall I'd give 4.5 stars and say if you like classic RPGs I highly recommend this.  If you are not sure rent it first.***UPDATE***My wife actually yelled at me this weekend for how much I have been playing this, so I only played for another 2 or 3 hours.  It is completely addictive and is refreshing in that the past couple games I have bought (Halo ODST, and CODMW2) took less time to complete combined than I have spent playing this masterpiece and I haven't even put a dent in this one yet.  The only reason I want to finish this one so badly is so I can play it again with one of the other races/classes.***NEW UPDATE***I had read on here about a bug in the X-box 360 version that caused all your save files to become \"corrupted\" and lost.  This raised a little concern for me as I was only about 35 hours into the game at the time and this supposedly happened near the end.  I am happy to say that I completed the game in a little under 60 hours without losing a single save so this (if it isn't actually haterade from PS3/PC fanboys) seems to be isolated.  This is still the best RPG I've played since the original KOTOR.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"The longest game you barely play in","reviewText":"Back in 1998, Square released Xenogears, a massive game that caused a stir due to its heavy religious and philosophical overtones. It was also a great RPG with some memorable scenes and a rather interesting but heavily complicated story. Flash forward couple years and Monolith announces that they're making a \"prequel\" to Xenogears, and it'll come out in 5 parts and probably span 3 systems by the time they're all finished. Reason why I say prequel in quotes is that it's not an official prequel like Resident Evil Zero let's say.Story: The story picks up when archeologists find a massive artifact somewhere in Africa. Many many years later it's discovered in space and a ship captures it with some casualties due unknown energy. Meanwhile, Shion Uzuki is developing KOS-MOS, a Realian(basically human-like robots) that could fight off the Gnosis, a ghost-like alien race that absorbs the energy of whatever it touches and crystallizes them and shatters them. They're like ghosts so you can't shoot the things, so that's where KOS-MOS comes in. Of course, the Gnosis attack and they have to escape the ship and that leads them on a quest on finding out what was that artifact and what the Gnosis are after.Graphics: Took a long time in development so the graphics don't have that finesse of Final Fantasy X but it looks pretty good.Music/Sound: Done by Yasunori Mitsuda(Chrono Trigger/Cross, Xenogears) and with the London Philharmonic Orchestra so the arrangements are definately epic...whenever you hear them anyway. Levels tend to be devoid of music sometimes so all you hear is your footsteps going \"clank clank\".Gameplay: Pretty much typical RPG-fare. Going into A.G.W.S(pronounced like eggs) take the replacing of gears and they're the same thing only different name. Unlike in Xenogears, enemies appear on screen and also there's damage effects where you can lead them somewhere, blow something up and the resulting explosion will provide a bonus for you in the fight.As for the cutscenes? There's a LOT. Well, I'll put it this way: there's cutscenes but they're not like 50 5 minute ones, more like 20 15-30 minute ones. Seriously, some of these seemingly go on forever. You'll be hard-pressed to ask \"oh, I can play now?\"  Then you play for 10 minutes and there's another one! Go you! You're watching a movie with some gameplay thrown in. But honestly? The plot's so interesting-and just like Xenogears, oh so complicated-that you wouldn't mind but then you start getting itchy fingers and want to play some more.I often found books to be the best form to tell a story. You can be as long as you want like Wheels of Time, which still hasn't ended or short like Lord of the Rings with just 3 books. You can't see it and that's where games come in. With Xenosaga, this would be one of the most interesting and longest books in quite awhile, but because it's a game, you have to actually play it to get there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Serene Night","summary":"Hours of entertainment!!","reviewText":"I'm a girl gamer and although I am not a big fan of Star Wars, I LOVED Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic game.

There are dozens of ethnic models to chose from, and you get to play as either a male character or a female character. Both genders have several unique subplots, including a small but sweet romance. (Oooh, gotta love that Carth).My only peeve? The turret game! I might've been able to ace this one on the console, but it was super hard on my laptop trackpad. Since the game is mandatory and not 'skippable' I washed out several times before I hooked up an external mouse and learned that you need to aim your 'cannons' in FRONT of the ships you're trying to shoot. This allows for a greater margin of error. Still, I did find this a minor annoyance in an otherwise BEAUTIFUL game.What a fun and entertaining game!

{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Not Bad At All","reviewText":"NiGHTS Into Dreams is a beloved SEGA Saturn classic, and for good reason, as it happens to be an absolute classic. Fans have waited years for a sequel to the game, but NiGHTS Journey of Dreams came out and received a pretty mixed response from ardent NiGHTS fans. Some thought it was good, others thought it was a big diappointment. Me? Personally, I'm mostly part of the former group. Let me explain why.NiGHTS Journey of Dreams retains the fantastic music, enviroments, and for the most part, gameplay, of NiGHTS Into Dreams. To get the best experience, either opt for the Classic Controller or Wiimote+Nunchuk combo, but just don't use the motion controls, as they're frustrating at best. As NiGHTS, you'll fly through beautiful environments, going through rings, collecting items, etc. The core structure is pretty much identical to that of NiGHTS Into Dreams. It works well and it's fun. Some people have criticized the gameplay segments where you play as either of the two kids, but I didn't find it that bad. It's certainly not as exhilarating as the flying gameplay, but it's not bad at all. NiGHTS Into Dreams also had you controlling either of the two kids at times. Like NiGHTS Into Dreams, the boss fights are excellent in this game and quite imaginative.The graphics are mostly beautiful. While environments amaze with their attention to detail, the cinematic cutscenes leave quite a bit to be desired and are of low quality. The voice acting is this game's biggest downfall, as it's poorly done and sounds pretty childish.So I've listed the pros and cons to NiGHTS Journey of Dreams, but the best thing about this game is the music, as it happens to mostly live up to the incredible music in NiGHTS Into Dreams. Just beautiful all around.Honestly, I don't get the complaining with this game. Is it as good as NiGHTS Into Dreams? Nope, definitely not. However, it still pays pretty good homage to that game and delivers on the core NiGHTS experience. It definitely has some nuisances, like the poor voice acting, but it's forgivable due to the nice gameplay, environments, music, etc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0029MAXS6","reviewerName":"Fani","summary":"Best console this generation","reviewText":"I have an Xbox360 from early 2006 and I have loved that console very much. It had one RRoD that was fixed my Microsoft for free in about 10 days. It has a really good selection of games and Xbox live is unparalleled and the best this generation. Paying $50/year for it is totally worth it.I recently bought this as a gift for someone and he loves it too. This is a great system overall and worth every penny.Game selection is really good ( with excellent exclusives like Halo, Gears of War etc. before and cross-platforms coming out before the PS3 version e.g. DLC for GTA games ). Even now there are some good exclusives like Splinter Cell: Conviction. The PS3 is no slouch either and I have both the PS3 and the Xbox360.I love the PS3 for media streaming and playing PS3 exclusives like God of war, Demons Souls, Killzone but for everything else, the Xbox360 rules ( gaming, media center, Netflix, co-op gaming, cross-platform games etc. )Anyone waiting and debating on this system shouldn't. The Xbox360 is a phenomenal system and truly worth your gaming $$. You must get Live to get more features and I feel its definitely worth it.I haven't heard of any RRoD errors for at least 1.5-2 years now. Sure, there may be failures now and then but MS fixes them promptly for free. Newer systems have HDMI as well.If you're not buying an Xbox360 ( go with the Elite for the most price efficient purchase ), you are really missing out on a phenomenal gaming system. Older games are now dirt cheap but still really good to play - Rainbow Six Vegas, GRAW, Conan, Crackdown, Virtua Tennis, Oblivion etc.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2010"}

Some new goodies have been added - the much-hyped armor abilities, the awesome DMR rifle, and some new multiplayer modes - but this is really just improving on an already great formula.The campaign is somewhat on the short end - I picked it up at 2 and was done by midnight, and that's including a nice dinner break. That said, the campaign's story is top-notch, and with the possible exception of the first has the best plot, and wins hands-down in the emotional aspect (like ODST, your character's face is never seen but your teammates' are, but unlike ODST you really get to know them). I also like that when you customize your armor, it appears in both the campaign and the multiplayer games - I was pleasantly surprised for the opening visual to be my green-and-white Recon helmet.Multiplayer is the best experience I've had yet. Matches are quick and easy to find, playlists are varied, and every game is voted on by the participating players. The new modes - Invasion and Stockpile to name two - are exciting to play, and now players have the option to boot teamkillers and frequent quitters are penalized by having to sit out a given time period.All in all, this is a great game, and in almost all respects lives up to the hype.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

Ram","summary":"Is the third time a charm?","reviewText":"Ninja Gaiden Sigma is the third version of the \"new\" Ninja Gaiden that first appeared on the original Xbox (and was later re-released on that system as Ninja Gaiden: Black). For the most part, it's much the same game; the storyline and settings have mostly been untouched, and while the camera has been improved, it still gets stuck or swings wildly at times. The gameplay is as fast and fierce as ever, and in fact the game is more difficult than I remember, as there are more boss fights and ninpo (magic) seems much less powerful than it used to be. Then again, there's more satisfaction in beating harder enemies.Aside from the graphical upgrades, there are other things that spice up the experience for those who have played the older versions of the game. The biggest addition is in a few levels where you play as Rachel. While it's interesting to kick butt as a sexy, warhammer-wielding vixen, the fun wears off quickly - her levels and enemies are the same as Ryu's, she only has one weapon and a limited moveset, and she attacks very slowly. Those levels feel like padding rather than a new experience.Other differences include new weapons (dual katanas), a few new enemies and bosses, different/moved/new music at times, and a few changes to previous areas. Some of these are welcome changes...for instance, the water level after the aqueduct is much shorter and features less fetch-questing, and you no longer HAVE to climb the floating pyramids after fighting Doku the first time. There are still annoyances though, like the ghost fish and other enemies who attack in ravenous packs (like the cat-people from the mission mode in Black). The puzzles in the pyramid have been removed and replaced with three tough enemies, and there are other places that have been made more difficult (especially since you can't initially change the difficulty, unless you die several times and continue as a \"Ninja Dog\").Although the in-game graphics look solid in HD, the original cutscenes have simply been ported over and look noticeably poor (they were great before, but on the PS3 they look blurry and jaggy, like they were re-sized to be larger.).If you've played the Xbox versions and want to know if it's worth it to play through Sigma, it is...to a point. The improved graphics make it more enjoyable, but don't expect anything groundbreaking in terms of design.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Sun Jian \"Tiger of Jiang Dong\"","summary":"Great game, loved every minute of it.","reviewText":"It's really fascinating to see how many supposed hardcore fans of the series got their knickers in a twist about this game. Final Fantasy games have been evolving for years, and Final Fantasy XIII corrects many of the mistakes Square-Enix made in FFXII.FFXII had no character development, or story, it had too much of everything; a battle system cluttered with pointless macros, constant running around doing pointless side quests that gave little to no reward most of the time, and probably the worst soundtrack in the history of Final Fantasy.Now, FFXIII pretty much corrected all of those things. The battle system is smooth, enjoyable, fast and creative. There are side quests and mini games, but they're not annoying, nor do they get in the way of the actual story. The soundtrack is amazing, it's very reminiscent of FFX's blend of techno and instrumental. The vocal tracks, which are a constant throughout the game not just the cut scenes, are absolutely gorgeous. Probably the best thing about this title is that the characters actually change during the story. The only other FF that had this much character interaction was FFX, but the voice acting in FFXIII is much better, and thank god that the main character for this title is a woman, not a whiny teenage boy like every other modern FF game. The party banter that goes on during fights is a nice addition, it's awesome to hear someone respond to getting a heal when they're critically injured.The biggest complaint about this game seems to be that it's linear. Well, every FF is. You didn't make any choices in FFVII, or VIII, or IX, or X or any other FF game. The good guys always win, the bad guys always lose, the world is saved, sometimes there's a sacrifice that's made for it, but in the end, every FF game is linear. It's true that with character development and environmental interaction the game could really improve. They should have made the Crystarium a bit more diverse, instead of making it a grind to get all of the crystals for all your roles. Then again, it's not that bad either, since it saves you from wasting half the game getting the wrong abilities. I remember how confusing and completely terrible the character progression in FFX was. I always ended up making the wrong turns and spending a lot of time trying to correct it.With that said, FFXIII really is quite friendly to new players. Not having to start over completely when you die, having the option to restart encounters when you mess up, having a mostly linear ability progression, and having an auto-battle system that isn't completely fail will help new players get into RPGs. My wife, who has never played an RPG in her life absolutely loves this game. I tried to get her interested in other games, but she never cared. Teaching her about strategy and paradigm shifting while watching her play is actually one of the best gaming experiences I've had.Like every other FF game, you have to grind for items and crystal points to make your characters awesome. I really don't see that as a chore, it's something that's part of just about every RPG. It's nowhere near as bad as FFVII where you spend 70 hours leveling up your damn materia.My last point is regarding graphics. I honestly have never played an RPG that looked this good. The transition between cut-scenes and actual gameplay is barely noticeable. The FFXIII world is gorgeous, and the art department really went out of their way to make it looks alive and realistic. The monsters and bosses have meticulous detail, the characters, including the NPCs, have amazing facial expressions and the clothing and hair look realistic, which isn't easily accomplished.I love this game, I loved playing through it twice, I enjoyed the experience and I hope future Final Fantasy games can take all the positive and wonderful things for this title and make it even better. To me it's a huge improvement over the last FF title, and I look forward to future FF games since Square-Enix really impressed me with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2010"}

B","summary":"Why Call of Duty 4  is better then Halo 3  .","reviewText":"For the sake of argument i'm going to compare this game to Halo 3, simply becaue i believe that if you are looking to buy this game or have done so already, chances are Halo 3 is already in your gaming library.THE GOOD-1st off, if you don't have multiplayer, you still have a reason to buy this game, the single player campaign is great, albeit short(about 6-7 hours straight through), ofcourse if you spread it out, about a weeks worth.  Halo 3's single player campaign was...rushed and dirty(one driving level i'm thinking of towards the end was straight crap), it felt more like a multiplayer game with a single player add-on.-Great graphics and sound, being in a massive gun fight and seeing dogs run towards you or rockets fly by is pretty intense.-Some great scripted sequences.-Multiplayer is some of the best FPS you'll do online, with a ranking system similar to Halo, but extremly deeper and more gratifying.  Where in Halo you really only move up in Rank if your team wins the match, so if you're playing a team slayer for 15 min and loose, then that's essentially 15 min wasted.  But in COD 4, you gain XP for doing almost anything, shooting someone through a wall, falling 250ft, running a certain distance, my point being, even if your team looses the match you still get XP for how well you played regardless if you win or lose, meaning that your character bumps up in rank much faster.-Let's just say there is a lot of unlockables in multiplayer by moving up in rank, which is an added addiction.  Also, the rewards for getting 3, 5, 7 kills in a row without dying is awesome( i don't want to ruin the surprise)!  The fact that they help your whole team and not just you is a great touch!THE BAD-One of the huge advantages of Halo 3 compared to COD 4 is their save/film/picture system which allows you to go back and watch your multiplayer and singleplayer games like a movie.  That was a great idea Bungie.  If there was that great moment where you sniped a grenade in mid air, or blew 5 guys up at once, well you can relive it and show all your friends.  There is nothing like this in COD 4.-Halo 3's multiplayer maps are more open, focusing a lot of the action out in the open, which i personally enjoy more, COD 4 is more of a creeping through rooms and sitting in bushes and waiting type of game, not to say it's not action packed, it's just that when the action goes down, it's quick.-Halo 3 has vehicles, COD 4 doesn't.In short, if you are a serious gamer, play games has a hobby, or just play occasionally for fun because you have nothing else to do, this game is a must, especially if you enjoy first person shooters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2007"}

The game has a plot almost obscenely ripped off from star wars. Where the other games had nods to the great American epic, this title blatantly pirates the themes. Here let me give you a run down of the story.A young kid(Luke) goes on a great quest to stop the evil empire, and on the way he enlists the aid of a sky pirate(Han) with a ship(millenium Falcon)and his inhuman sidekick(chewbacca) and together they storm the emperial fleets flag ship(star destroyer) To rescue the princess(leah) who is the leader of the resistance(rebel alliance). Along the way they are chased by a man in full armor and mask with a deep hollow voice(vader).  Does any of this sound familiar to anyone. Christ you even start out in a desert city!!!Next point. While the graphics are amazing 12 has made the same mistake that 10 did. RPG are about freedom and exploration not about graphics. The areas in the game while rich and beautiful start to feel an awful lot like levels, with no world map or things to interact with. Its more or less a straight shot along a fairly linear path. You cant explore anything.battle system. Here is what really pisses me off. The FF series has slowly but sure begun selling out to the obnoxious throngs of action platform and fighting gamers. ITs an RPG its supposed to be strategy driven. Now you dont even control your part members. Everyone runs around and fight on their own and most of the time its utter chaos. equipping your party to simply overpower enemies is your only real strategy. The gambit system while fun to customize makes no sense and takes away most of the action from you. The game has more or less started to play itself!! It has basically turned into diablo with airships with the addition of random treasure chests and repetitive battles against the same monsters. Most of the time the game turns into a blur of lines going everywhere and you just have to hope your characters arent doing something stupid.The characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting. Never since ff8 have I seen such boring characters. The sky pirate is about as interesting as it gets,and more or less ends up being the main character. The voice acting makes ff10's wonder years cheese seem welcome. Everyone sounds like they are dosed to they rafters on valium. Oh but dont worry there isnt much character interaction. The group is just haphazardly strung together and they all just sort of go with it.The ability and magic system is really really nice for the first part of the game. You get points to spend in order to customize your people and if you are like me you try to do it in a way that makes sense for the particular character. You can even choose the weapons and armor they use. However, and this is my big gripe since 7. With the lack of a class system, all of your characters start to lose their nich towards the end of the game. When any of the characters can use any ability it makes party selection somewhat arbitrary. You may as well pick three and stick with them for the whole game. You can strategically shift people in and out of battle during, which is a cool feature, but lets face it, all the b squad really needs to do is pop in long enough to hurl a few phoenix downs and then its back behind the scenes.Ok thats enough for the bad.The good. Side quest city! In fact I would venture to say that a good half of the game is side quests. This sort of makes up for the non free roaming element in that you are going back and forth doing cool things alot! You can stop and do quests throughout the game before moving the story ahead too instead of being confined to the very end. One more bad thing though. The rewards you get for doing these quests are more often than not nowhere near worth the task itself. OF course completeing the thing is reward enough to me. However you will start to get irritated when you defeat the uber kind god dragon and get a measily 1500 gold or some equaly useless sundry. In fact when you get a weapon its usual one you will be able to buy in the next town, or after the next quest.Oh man I started complaining again. hold on hold on.let me wrap this up by saying this. Im a diehard rpg purist and I was deadset on hating this game from the getgo before even playing it. It flew in the face of all I love about RPGs. however, even I cannot deny that the game is damned addictive, and when no one else was looking I think I may have actually smiled a couple of times. Its barely an RPG but for all that guys its still a fun game! worth playing worth getting through. maybe worth playing twice...but not thrice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2007"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Marco Ramirez Gomez \"MarcoCR\"","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"You must play  this game.

So much so that at one point I actually considered a Wii. Thankfully I stuck with what I really wanted and though it's only been two weeks I'm loving this thing. Sure I wish there were more games out at launch but I know they're coming. Besides at $50-$60 a pop for games it's not like I have the cash to just buy a stack of games at one time anyway. I have Resistance, Madden '07, and Need for Speed: Carbon. I'm happy with what I'm seeing so far. I like the wireless controllers though like a little kid I sit close enough to the TV to use a wired one. The graphics and sound are awesome. I'm curious to see what game developers will come up with when they don't have a strict launch deadline to meet and can really use this machine to its potential. There are a lot more Blu-ray titles available than I thought so I'll pick up a few and test the player more. The unit does produce a lot of heat so that comment I'm sure you've read elsewhere is true. I haven't tried the online network so I can't comment on that. One thing I will note is that the operating software had to be updated before it would play a game so if you don't have a high speed internet connection forget about using it right out of the box. Overall I'm happy I took the plunge. One more point. I don't think you have to have a HDTV to use a PS3 but to really appreciate it you should use something other than a standard tube. I have a 42\" Panasonic EDTV so it's not full high def but it can receive up to a 1080i signal and man it makes a difference. Wow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0058SHNF4","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Ubisoft manages to straddle the fence quite well","reviewText":"As a parent and Vine reviewer, I popped it in alone and navigated through the menus.  An eyebrow did shoot up...given the diverse nature of the songs (all kid-friendly mind you), ranging from The Wiggles, to Yo Gabba Gabba, to older fare provided in the form \"Just The Way You Are\" (Bruno Mars), what did Ubisoft intend to do with a Just Dance Kids 2 title?  Were they trying to straddle age groups and make it work?With something as nebulous as the word \"kids\", I wondered exactly how Ubisoft was going to handle a target demographic of, say, a 5-year old and a 10-year old in the same room.  However, Ubisoft manages to do exactly that.As soon as my daughter (who is 8) entered the room along with a younger friend (6) and another older friend (10), I let them have at it, intending to review this product through THEIR perception, not mine.  Here, we're able to find a game that a group of kids aged 6-10 can play together with and are eager to get a turn at it.  I have 2 Move controllers (only 1 Move controller and Eye is required as a minimum), although the game will support up to 4 players simultaneously; if you have 4 Move controllers, I hope you have a wide area to play in!  \"Fun!\"  \"Awesome!\"  \"This is so cool!\" are what I can relay from the kids.  However, the 10-year old might be stretching the song choice a little bit hard; I'd say that kids 9 and younger are an extremely safe bet.  Older than that and you risk the possibility of success to bomb in a heartbeat with the included playlist; I'm sure that you'll know your children well enough to make an informed decision.  Like Christmas, the kids ripped through the various menus and tried to uncover whatever they could.The menu system is relatively easy to get through and the kids managed to seem to get through the menus quite well with no input from me.  You can string together songs if you want to, play them individually, start an endless shuffle, etc.  It's not terribly heavy in the customizable department, but I think that's a good thing.  The kids thought the menus were easy to get through and relayed as much.  While all songs can be selected by default, filters exist for younger/older kids as well as easy/hard songs to dance to.  You can turn lyrics (subtitled on the left-hand side) for the songs on/off.  This more advanced customization is not as bold as other menu selections, reducing the apparent importance of those choices to kids but leaving it up to adults to filter as needed.  Beyond that, however, it doesn't have too many frills.  But, despite the lack of frills, the kids keep coming back to play it some more.Controls are pretty tight; Move controllers are well-integrated to the live action kids dancing in front of whimsical backgrounds.  Songs sound pretty good, too; however, just to warn you, not all songs are sung by the original artists.  Some are and some aren't for reasons that elude me.  However, the kids don't care and that's ultimately what the game is all about!As a parent, the playlist does suffer from some unusual eclectic taste.  \"Barbara Ann\" and \"Shake Your Grove Thing\" will sound like an era away for today's kids and, although they like it, they won't get the same smiles of recognition that parents will give.  Take a look at the overall song list if you'd like, but I'm willing to bet that parental perception of the song choices will be completely contrary to what the kids ultimately enjoy.  Ubisoft has done a remarkable job here.I only wish that \"Dance\" gaming titles would learn their lesson from Activision's mistake in the Guitar Hero series and make it easier to just simply download titles rather than machine-gunning us with additional discs.  One could say that there is hardly the space, but given the AVCHD (video) compression out there these days, one could easily make a single using about 100 MB of memory which on a hard-drive enabled PS3 is hardly a taxing amount at all!I'd highly recommend this game for kids aged 5-10.  It sounds/looks great, the menus require minimal parental input, and the kids are getting a workout by having fun.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 (rounded to 5).  Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

The music ranges from incidental to very good, standout is the music that plays in the Temple of the Acolytes of Apocalypse.9/10Gameplay - You have a large variety of moves to learn, and special powers etc. The range is impressive and much like an RPG you gain levels and purchase points in whatever power you want, eg making Wolverine regenerate faster, or enabling Jean Gray and Storm to fly (Yes they really fly). You can also purchase many items like armour/gloves and belts. Always entertaining there's no real problems here. It's also great to fight as a team in real time, and the enemy/ally AI is decent.8/10Extras/Replay - There are 3 levels of difficulty and the last one \"Hard\" is a real challenge and you can use your saved characters and items with a save game+ feature. There are also 3 extra characters to get, including one which takes you alot of work to get (Worth it though). Only one ending though. There are also some small side quests for extra diversion.Overall - Worth buying it took me about 20 hours on the first play through and as much again for the HARD setting, including the extra characters.

There are no real missions, no complex plot twists, no real story, just you and the open road...oh, and your customers.The object of the game is to pick up and drop off as many people in as little time as possible, often easier said than done. You can choose between four different driver, which are different in personality, but the same in driving skills. It really makes no difference which one you choose. The controls take a bit of getting used to, and unlike most driving games, the &quot;A&quot; button is not the gas pedal.

The city is nicely detailed, and there is a wide variety of people, places, cars, and people at large. In the sound department, the game also has the edge. The car, street, and voices are all nicely done, and the music suits the game perfectly. What it lacks is variety, which means that you will be hearing the Offspring's &quot;All I Want&quot; twice in the same game.The flaws in this game come purely from the lack of variety.

But keep in mind that that Crazy Taxi is not meant to be played for hours on end, it is a fun, wild, and wickedly enjoyable game. I would not recommend it to people who favor long, mission-based drivers, for them I would recommend &quot;Grand Theft Auto 3&quot;. For others who just want a bit of fun, this is your game. It is fun, but will get old fast and is unlikely to have a long life in your video game collection.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2002"}

Players become a wolf, an embodiment of the sun god Amaterasu -- the world lies in gamer's hands as they fight ominous beings and reclaim the earth from a curse that plagues it. It is crucial to help Amaterasu make the world a place where all living creatures can dwell once again.","reviewerName":"Antoinette Johnson \"Pooky\"","summary":"My favorite game on the PS2!","reviewText":"There is so much about Okami to like! i have never played a game so original before in my life. it has to be the most underrated game this century!Okami is about the Sun goddess Ameratsu Okami who takes the form of a wolf and her little woodsprite companion issun. 100 years ago Okami known back then as Shirainu killed a evil monster called Orochi (Mountain of Darkness) by means of a warrior named Negi. Ameratsu died in the fight and in honor of her and Negi they built a monument in honor of them. Centuries later orochis evil is brought upon the world again and Okami is resurracted to battle her foe once again.The story is actually more complex than how I summarized it. There are tons of side quest, missions, secrets in Okami. its replay value is extreme and broad because theres so many things to do and find. I still haven't beat it 100% because of the stray beads and i'm always preoccupied doing one of the most addicting things in video game history sinse pickpocketing in Sly cooper...Fishing. No words can describe how addicting fishing is in Okami. in most games its boring, but in Okami its executed in such a way that you can't stop. Fishing is also one of the best ways to earn money for supplies and new fighting techniques.Combat in okami is fun and fastpaced. Many enemies in the game require some level of strategy to defeat. You can't just hack and slash expecially later when enemies are stronger. The boss battles are huge and epic. every boss is unique and strategic. If you defeat an enemy in a cool way or buy 2 techniques that bring this on they drop a Demon fang that you exchange for goods and sometimes required items.The world is ginormous! After Orochi peaple make the mistake of thinking they beat the game, but really theres more story to be found. just as a warning alot of the plot and stories in Okami are based off Japenese Mythology, but thats what makes it so interesting. One in particular is a story involving a box that was given to an old man as a gift from a dragon palace, but yall can see that for yourselves.One of the biggest highlight of Okami though are the brush techniques. they are wonderful. there are actually more techniques and moves you can use that the game don't tell you about. Most you find doing side quest, but there are some that are found in secret places.The absolute greatest thing and everyone knows this is the graphics and music. Theres no game out there like this. Okami is made with beutiful japenese art. the music is also very Japenese and memorable. It is absolutely breathtaking expecially when you clean the earth. I think the PS2 version does the graphics better than the Wii. I hear peaple dote on the realistic graphics of the Xbox and PS3 but it can't compare to how breathtaking Okami is. The art style and music lead to some scary moments too. In evil or bad spots in the game the music can get extremely ominous. The creepiest and scariest area in the game for me is the ghost ship. The art and erie music had me looking behind my shoulder and enemies that I ain't gonna describe for spoiler reasons appeared out of nowhere and scared the living daylights out of me. Think the Grudge meets Silent Hill XD Don't get me started on Mr. and Mrs. Cutter (shivers)I know peaple complain that it too easy, but this is forgiven by how much this game offers. I admit though I did die once near the end of the game fighting these 9 dogs, but thats another story and I didn't get a game over because of my astral pouch.This review barely touches everything in this game. Okami is one of the greatest and revolutionary video games this century. I've hoped to find more games made with unque graphics like Okami, but I can never find anyXD The only game that comes close is Mini Ninjas for the Wii (fun game), but even it can't compare to Okami. I love it so much that I'm rebuying it for the Wii and getting its DS sequal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2010"}

This one is no different, but the game has a lot of problems and faults.The first issue is that there are far to many cars from Asia and to little from Europe or America. You may say this isn't an issue, but think of this. There is an 88 Accord and no 80s-90s fox Mustang.(The most popular car at an American track) Thats pretty bad, but Diatsue has more cars than Dodge or Jaguar. There are little Pontiacs and NO Porsches.(They give us Ruf instead) The Ferraris are lacking in any classic cars. But we have thirty different Lancers, and to many Civics to care about. I understand they are from Japan, but really. This is a racing game.Then there is a very Japan type feel and the menu is confusing at first. Thats not what grinds my gears. The fact that there are Standard cars and Premium cars sucks. The standards are in the used car market. You have to wait for the car you want to come around, but this time they never change color. Both Camaros in this department are mystic teal, and the XJ220 comes in silver. If you don't or do buy it, the next time you see one of them. They will be the same color. Ofcoarse you can change the color, but only if you own a car with that color. You buy a car and you can match its color. That is so dumb. You can't change standard cars rims. The Premiums are annoying too. The whole time you will think why are some of these a \"P\" car? And how didn't the Supra make that cut? Thats my biggest beef.The next problem is with the flickering shadows under and around all cars, damage or lack there of. These things are what Forza does better. Forza has better cars, better menu, interiors of all cars, major customization, but Gran Turismo has better physics, NASCAR,carts, weather!, and most important Rallies. I think its frustrating because GT5 could have been better. The Rally peice is really good though and makes me forget the faults, until I get to the menu again. They also got rid of drag racing for some reason.(WHY?)They got rid of some of the best tracks, and even the Test Track. I don't undertand why, but tuning isn't as important as it use to be. If you get a fully custom trans you'll see what I mean. Its like gearing for dumbies.Still with these complaints I think it is the best driving game out there, even with Forza having better cars. I just think they really could have done better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2010"}

I usually dont like FPS games at all, they are a major annoyance to me.  However I decided to buy killzone 2 because it was like 8 bucks last week. Well I regret not getting into this franchise sooner, so I immediatly ordered part 3. KZ 2 MP was very good and ejoyable, but KZ3 offers a much smoother, polished experience.  Ive tried playing COD and even Halo, but I just got bored or uninterested in it. This game feels familiar, yet completely different in a great way.  Everything feels much more balanced than the COD of the world. Its much more chaotic ( in a good way ) and makes you feel like this is a war. It captures that feeling of a realistic scifi war better than any other game. So if your FPS fan, or like me just looking to try something new, then get this game!! it is very fun and addictive and every move you make in the game wether it be kills or objectives, or just covering your squad mates, it ultimately makes you feel like you had a major part in any win your team gets. Hope this helps! look foward to playing with you guys! PS. the PSN has the multiplayer demo for free. I strongly suggest you try it, and if you like it, its only 15 bucks for MP only dload, and it comes with ALL THE DLOAD CONTENT!! SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT :)***UPDATE***Just finished the campaign. It was great, and I forgot to mention that this game looks so much more awesome in 3D! so if your lucky enough to have a 3D tv, this is a no brainer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

C. Orr","summary":"The Genius Of Simplicity","reviewText":"The wheel. Sandwiches. The bicycle.  Some things are so fundamental to our conception of the world it is hard to believe they were not invented sooner.  Video games are commonly seen as involving input from the gamer that starts and ends with making a character on the screen move, shoot and solve puzzles.  \"LittleBigPlanet\" changes the goalposts because it makes the possibility of gamers creating and sharing levels and turns it into the key selling point of a major release.\"LittleBigPlanet\" has a rich and challenging Story Mode right out of the box.  It is an excellent platforming game that comes with bright, colourful and humorous levels set across the globe, and you can play these without ever going online.  The Story Mode is relatively short, but some of the later levels (and I'm thinking of one particularly tricky one in particular) are a stiff challenge, and there is added replay value from collecting all the stickers and costumes with which to decorate levels and your Sackboy character respectively.  Developer Media Molecule have cleverly realised that players have a particular fondness for collecting stickers, recalling as they do childhood memories of sticker albums and stamps collecting.  The knockabout 2D feel of the game perfectly suits the vibrant colours and rich textures of the game.The game really comes to life, however, when you connect to other users, play with them online, play the many levels created by other users, and of course create your own works which others will be able to play.  And when I say \"many\", I really means lots.  At the time of writing there are twenty or so pages of created levels by budding Da Vincis, and the game has not even been released in Europe as of yet.  The communal aspect of LittleBigPlanet is the key feature that separates the game from previous platformers such as the revered Mario and Sonic games of the nineties.  Even if you have absolutely no interest in creating a level yourself, the sheer range of levels in terms of quality, imagination and difficulty is mind-boggling.  The promised Community feature will also supposedly add to the creation aspect by enabling the making of levels in real time online.LBP is a blindingly simple basic gameplay idea.  However, this doesn't automatically make the gameplay flawless.  The key problem I encountered was the layering system.  LBP is a so-called 2.5D game, which means Sackboy can move towards and back from the screen, in three layers.  Sometimes the game engine can get a little muddled, and throw your character to instant death because the game hasn't switched to an alternate level when it should have (or vice-versa).  The controls, too, can feel a little floaty and imprecise, but this is a little more forgivable because platform games have always relied on the harum scarum of on-the-fly player correction in the middle of difficult jumping sections.A second problem with the game is a little less apparent.  Although the Create Mode is well-structured in terms of plentiful tutorials (voiced by the redoubtable Stephen Fry), actually making things can be extremely treacherous.  Imagine creating a small engine -say a pulley- out of disparate materials.  The machine works fine, and you go on creating the rest of the level.  Then suddenly, the creation collapses and tears down anything lying in its way.  Defective creations  tend to go wrong by degrees: a 1% fault mutates over the course of a few hours of creation into a 2%, a 5%, and finally a fault that can collapse all your hard work.  In addition, creating is just plain hard work if you have no great aptitude for such things.  Using as it does the same game engine used by the developers that made the Story Mode, Create Mode is designed for serious, heavy-duty gaming.  At its heart are tools designed for creating complex levels, which have been play-tested for hours and are meant to be perfect.\"LittleBigPlanet\" is a strikingly beautiful and charming game.  Rich in texture and loving detail, the single player experience is overwhelmingly fun.  Sackboy is a winning presence, and doesn't seem out of place compared to the icons of the 2D era of gaming.  The created levels already available offer a mind-boggling trove of imagination, and community aspects will only expand with time.  The slightly over-complicated Create Mode shouldn't put anyone off this wonderful game. The game's slogan is \"Play.  Create.  Share,\" a command which anyone with a PlayStation 3 should obey forthwith.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2008"}

It is probably one of the best games out for the PS2 and is the best Wrestling game. Come on, like Rumble Roses can really be better then this?All of the problems that annoyed players with the first SVR are gone. The horrible voice acting is the first major improvement. Wrestlers no longer sound like they reading lines from a script. Their is even a hint of an echo when wrestlers are giving a speech in the ring. JR's voice is the only one that is not very good.Major improvement number two is the graphics. OMG do the graphics look awesome. These graphics make SVR05 look like playstation 1 graphics. And keep in mind that game was only made a year ago.The final major improvement is the game play itself. In SVR05 once you got the first hit on your opponent it was smooth sailing from there. All you had to do was keep hitting your opponent whenever he got up and keep using moves that do a lot of damage. On SVR06 this has been changed with the stamina system. It basically prevents one player from dominating a match by using high damage moves over and over again and also allows for one last desperation move by the guy who is getting a beat down. This leads to a very realistic and exciting match. Especially when you get to the point where both players are worn out. Other new features include playing possum, strong Irish whips, and the new GM mode.The GM mode is great for any sports fan that likes a good management game. You are tasked with drafting players, trading, negotiating salaries and determining who fights in what kind of match. You can watch or play these matches.This game is not perfect though. SVR06 does have its short comings. One is the targeting itself. You often find yourself accidently knocking out the ref even though you are targeting the player. While die hard WWE fans will tell me that its how matches are fought. I would disagree, because I've watch a million wrestling matches on TV and I never saw a wrestler accidently knock down the ref 5 times in a match before. Sometimes its difficult to quickly target different players  making handicap and royal rumble matches a headache. Finally the graphics maybe sweet but they are not 100% perfect. Perform a rear choke hold or any kind of submission and you see your characters hand going through your opponents neck. Or his foot going through your submission hold. It looks like your hand or foot is IN (not on..IN) your opponent. Other PS2 games don't have these graphic errors....SVR 06 does.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2005"}

EA really needs to fix that so people buying the game brand new like I did  don't freak out.. basically just use the code on the back of the \"ultimate edition dragon age origins\" instruction pamplet with the pic's of the two games (dragon age origins and awakening) on the front cover to install.. and that's it.

Featuring enhanced graphics, sound and control, Silent Hill Origins sets a new standard for this survival horror classic.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Solid prequel","reviewText":"Another PSP to PS2 conversion, Silent Hill Origins is a prequel to Konami's original Silent Hill game, and fans of the long running survival horror series will happy to know that this installment retains the series' penchant for the unbelievably creepy.  You play as a trucker named Travis, who has just stumbled into the town of Silent Hill, and naturally, it isn't too long before some very, very, bad things start happening.  Fans of the series will see some familiar faces and surroundings, and the game also manages to provide some ultra-creepy environments and events, as well as a spectacular musical score that perfectly underlines the frightening proceedings.  The game has been slightly visually enhanced in its transition from the PSP to the PS2, although things still look more grainy then they should.  The only downsides to Silent Hill Origins is that the game's camera doesn't always work the way you'd think it would, and the game's length may leave more to be desired.  Flaws aside though, Silent Hill Origins is still a scary blast, and there's enough extra content (like different endings) to find and comb through to justify picking it up.  If you already played through the PSP version of the game, there really isn't any reason to play it again, but if you didn't and you're a fan of the series or of survival horror in general, take a trip to Silent Hill.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2008"}

Mysterious portals have appeared in them, leading him to disturbing alternate worlds. This game is a terrifying experience that fans and newcomers will never forget.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Excellent","reviewText":"God forbid that Western gamers ought to ever be expected to try something original!In the wake of all the bad and mediocre reviews I've seen here for this game, I'm finally beginning to understand why the US and Europe are responsible for a good two-thirds of the the mundane sequels that we, as gamers, see released on a week to week basis.Annihoo, \"Silent Hill 4: The Room\" is indeed a sequel, but an original one. Konami have made many changes to the gameplay mechanics and general 'feel' of the game, while retaining the more well-loved features of the series to date.Players control Henry Townsend, housebound for some five days (thanks to the enormous chains all over the inside of his apartment door), as he begins to uncover something of the evil behind his apartment, his neighbours, and a nearby town called Silent Hill.Gameplay-wise we're looking at practically a whole new Silent Hill. The radio and flashlight are now missing, as are the menu screens. Players now make selections via the D-Pad and the circle button, all in realtime, and since Henry's inventory is no longer bottomless, a \"Resident Evil\"-esque Item Box system has been employed (albeit far more realistically). Levels, towns and Bosses are all gone by the board, replaced with a Quake-ike \"Hub\" system - you access various different realms via Henry's apartment - but the game does, in fact, feel a lot more organic for this. There's a real sense of progression and, thanks to the fact that ammo and health items are far, far scarcer than in previous games, there's a much deeper sense of \"Survival Horror\" about this one.Controls are tighter, and Henry moves a lot faster than Harry, James or Heather before him. The actual mechanics of movement will be immediately familiar to anyone who's played a Silent Hill game before, and the new speedy controls come into their own when trying to avoid the un-killable ghosts and super-lithe dog-monsters.In fact, the enemies that populate \"The Room\" are definitely the scariest-looking since SH 2. The Nurses now resemble something like Egyptian Dog-Gods, and those damn Monkeys from SH 1 are back with a vengeance (as well as a second head!).Graphically this is the real King of the Silent Hills. Advancing on the already-amazing character models from SH 3, \"The Room\" is populated by a whole host of impressively-detailed and realistic protagonists, and the animation is very fluid (if not so much as SH 3). Landscapes are now more grim and repulsive than SH 2 (but thankfully, not the teen-goth-pretentiousness of the SH 3 worlds) and the vignettes are as imaginative as they are ambiguous. Remember the \"What the hell is that??\" feeling of SH 2, that was almost absent in SH 3? It's back, and the atmosphere benefits hugely from it.The sound is by far and away the best sound in a Silent Hill game to date. From the haunting and melancholic opening tune (\"Goodbye\") to the human and animal sounds that populate the eerie worlds, there's a wealth of aural abomination waiting to be enjoyed. It adds huge amounts of atmosphere and, perhaps more importantly, scares, to the proceedings. Voice acting is excellent (Henry's shyness and ambiguity add greatly to our appreciation of him as the hero) and on a par with some of the better horror movies I've seen lately.Story-wise, while it can't compare to the magnificent Silent Hill 2, \"The Room\" is certainly one of the stronger games of the series in this regard. You need to complete the first third of the game before any of the real characterisation comes into play, but when it does, you feel an immediate attachment to the cast, and the compelling natures of characters like Eileen and the Child pull you further into the plot.Weighing in at a far longer play length than SH 3 (as well as a slightly steeper difficulty level), \"The Room\", with its four different endings and numerous chilling set pieces, will never compare to Silent Hill 2, but is a definite step in the right direction after the lacklustre and dull Silent Hill 3. It's a sort of cross between the Adventuring aspect of the original game, with the melancholic atmosphere of the second, and the super-cool graphics of the third game. The innovations and gameplay changes won't suit all fans, but I promise you, approach the game with an open mind, and you'll not be disappointed.Very highly recommended.By the by, the now-ubiquitous Hospital level is present, but isn't the same damn building, and, though very short, is also very affecting.Well done to Konami for making some brave and fresh changes to one of its best-loved series of games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2004"}

There are a few quirks that many reviewers have probably already mentioned, such as repetitive QTE sections (opening windows, sliding through gaps in walls, etc) that mask load screens, lengthy load times, and the limited freedom in a seemingly open environment. Also, some areas require you to press a button to drop down to the lower level, while some others do not. This type of inconsistency really took away the overall experience, which could have been much richer despite the detailed and atmospheric environments.A side note: it took me just under 10 hours to complete the game in \"easy\" mode.All in all, I enjoyed quite a bit of this game but I had hoped for more, and it had a potential to be a much better game. Let's hope for a follow-up to this game that addresses the numerous minor issues. If you are a die-hard stealth fan, I would definitely recommend this. If you haven't played a lot of stealth games or don't enjoy slower-paced games, I would say probably do a rental or pass.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

Jak II was one of the best games I played in 2003. It is possibly the best ps2 game ever made. The game is great and it is the way a sequal should be. The game takes place in a controlled currupted city called Haven City. It is controlled by the man who put Jak through hell for 2 years, Barron Praxis. You then meet other great characters like Vin,Sig,Kor and others. The game has alot of twist and turns. The graphics are a huge success in the game.Every backround detailed and sharp. The city is HUGE! Really huge acctually. I thought The character development was good. One thing that made this game really awsome is that Jak gets guns. Awsome guns! The Blaster, Scatter, Fulcon fury and peace maker gun. What also made me enjoy this game was that it wasnt short nor long. I hate short games or alteast games little to do. This game isnt like that. THIS GAME IS EXTREAMLY REPETITIVE! One mission took me like an hour to finish. Also the mission variety is great. 60 awsome missions. Some long though. The greatness of this game is shown with pure action.And if youre looking for a game to beat in 2 days I think you should leave this title alone.

At first I was a bit discouraged by this fact, but playing through the game convinced me of how much care went into making this into another Zelda masterpiece that's not \"just another entry\". Overall, this latest Zelda game is a more than worthy successor in a series that is always improving upon itself.First off, Twilight Princess is an engineering marvel. I'd rather examine this game than anything the new Sony PS3 has to offer (who would buy a $600 console to get some stupid boring NBA game?). Aside from the Resident Evil remake and RE Zero, Twilight Princess has the most impressive visuals yet on the GameCube. The game can process any complex visual task. I thought I've seen it all until this game. Loading times are nonexistant and I've come across no slowdown whatever, which is extraordinary considering how huge Twilight Princess's world is. This game, along with FFXII and Okami, shows that this generation of consoles is still way more interesting than the new one.It's Ocarina of Time and more. Death Mountain, Lake Hylia, the Castle Town... everything Ocarina of Time had is vastly improved upon here. All the worlds are exquisitely more detailed and contain much more activity and depth. The controls have improved too, from the outfits to the weaponry. No more limited moves and constant item switching that Ocarina of Time had. The dungeons in this game don't disappoint either. Nintendo keeps impressing me with the creativity put into the puzzles and bosses in the dungeons. You'll come across some of the biggest and most inventive bosses ever in a Zelda game.A game like this makes you thankful that the Nintendo EAD team is still around developing great titles. In a generation that is dominated by driving games, Maddens, Halos, and Grand Theft Autos (which I find to be all overrated bore-fests), a game like Twilight Princess comes along and whoops everything else on the market with its unbeatable design and charisma. Nintendo, along with Sega, Capcom, SNK, Konami, and Treasure, is a game developer always staying true to the spirit of pure core gaming, and this is a game that further proves it. Twilight Princess is a mandatory purchase if you have a GameCube or Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2006"}

I enjoy the updated maps but I think they should've been add-ons at a later date.  I want some actual new maps.  Over 3 months into the game now & there's still been no word on any future add-ons.This game is only playable online & the lag is quite ridiculous most nights.  They always seem to be working on this problem but still don't have it fixed.Being able to follow people is a pain.  At first the only way you had available was to message people (through the PS3 messages) & tell them where to go.  They've changed it a little bit so now on the main PS3 screen you can kind of see where people are.  There are only so many spaces though so if they are in a long titled lobby & room then it's still not possible to know exactly where they are.  Yes, you can send invites but that's a pain as well because you can only send while in the lobby & that's if you have time after the screen finally loads.I enjoy playing most game types.  You have Demolition, Suppression, Control, Extraction, Escort & Breach.  A new type for this game is Elimination where you can't win a round unless you eliminate everybody on the opposite team.No vehicles.  That's a bummer.  & you can't make ranked rooms.

The timeline hopping took a bit to get used to, but eventually made sense, and added interest to the storyline.  Overall the storyline is a real strength, as well as the graphics.  The fighting mechanics are a unique (in my experience) combination of turn-based and interactive, and can take some time to tune in order to be successful against tougher enemies.  These are the three main reasons for the 5 star rating (storyline, graphics, fighting).  There are however a few aspects of the (ally) monster leveling scheme that seemed to detract from gameplay, namely that abilities can drop off the list when you max out with little/no control over what gets dropped, and another nit is that by the time you are strong enough to tackle monsters who drop the best equipment in the game, you've already accomplished just about everything there is to do, so getting the best equipment is rather anticlimactic.

The graphics were excellent in that version for the PSone as in this version.  This game supports full 1080p and it shows.  Being one of only a handful of full HD supported games.  My main reason for picking up this game was to showcase the graphical quality.  In general I expected an okay racing title with more Ridge Racer racing physics.  To say the least I have been quite pleasantly surprised.This game has a moving dance soundtrack that will have you wanting to move faster.  So far I have throughly enjoyed playing this game.  It moves fast and looks good.  The physics are obviously realistic.  Please don't try to compare this to a realistic racing simulator.  Take it for what it is.  A fun racing game.  Online this game moves smooth.  Just like most games I have played online for PS3 the network is excellent.In closing if you are looking for a quality racing title that will keep you moving in grooving Ridge Racer is it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00004SQPD","description":"While inheriting the basic functions and design philosophy of the current PlayStation 2, the internal design architecture of this newly redesigned PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system model has been completely overhauled. Slimmer and more lightweight,  its internal volume has been reduced by 75 percent, overall weight has been halved and the thickness trimmed down to 2.8cm (thickness of current model is 7.8cm). Its size is almost as small as a hardcover book, making it easier to carry around. Equipped with both a modem port and an integrated Ethernet port for network gaming, the new PlayStation 2 sets new standards in the fusion of design and functionality.","reviewerName":"Hill(WILLIS BOY)","summary":"You will have fun","reviewText":"Although the PS2 was the leader of the last wave of consoles it was the least appealing in graphics and game play. I personally would suggest the Xbox if your into features like a internal hard drive with out memory cards, crisp graphics, custom sound tacks, online play out of the box, responsive analogs and controls, or the Nintendo game cube if controls, children's games, and even easier game play matter to you more. I would not recommend this to any one unless they have a soft spot for the controller which is comfortable but when it comes to game play it is the least responsive or if you really like kids RPG's or final fantasy games. The DVD player is an awesome feature but too beware of over heating on the smaller model but this is a very rare problem. Personally I think it has always been over priced. If you notice it is still the same price as the Xbox, which has greater features, or the game cube that has better graphics and better first party games. Now I did point out allot of negatives about the system but it really is the least impressive when it come to actual games. What is impressive is the amount of games in the library. I say age will play a factor. Online is available only on the larger version of the console.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000LFJNG6","description":"Simplify and enhance your Wii&#xAE; set up with Nyko&#x2019;s Wireless Sensor Bar for Wii. The Wireless Sensor Bar allows full Wii Remote functionality without the hassle or mess of any wired connection to the console. The infrared field created by the Wireless Sensor Bar allows for play up to 25 feet away, perfect for larger or wall-mounted TVs. Compatible with Nintendo's official Sensor Bar stand, the Wireless Sensor Bar is easy to set up, requiring no software or hardware installation on the Wii. Featuring 30 hours of battery life off 4 AA batteries (included) and a unique power saver mode with audible alarm, the Wireless Sensor Bar is designed for ultimate convenience.","reviewerName":"James Lin","summary":"Solid wireless sensor bar","reviewText":"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the sensor bar really isn't a sensor, but an emitter.  It shines two points of IR light that the Wii and Wiimote can use to orient the player's motions and controls.The Nyko wireless sensor bar works like the one that came with the Wii, except that there's no cable to power it.  Instead, it uses 4 x AA batteries which are included (Energizers).  The wireless nature of this sensor bar is especially helpful for people who have home theater systems where the console isn't right next to the TV.  My setup has all of my devices plugged into a receiver, and a single, long HDMI cable goes from the receiver to my wall-mounted TV.  If you use a projector where the screen is across the room from the projector unit, then you'll probably find this very helpful too.The back of the sensor bar has a switch for the timer which can be set to Off, 1 hour, or 2 hours.  The timer will automatically turn off the sensor bar after 1 or 2 hours so you don't have to worry about forgetting and draining the batteries.  However, when the timer reaches the 1 or 2 hour marks, it'll start beeping to remind the player.  At that point, you can hit the button to reset the timer and continue playing, switch off the bar manually, or let it beep until it turns itself off.The range on the bar is excellent and probably comparable to that of the original sensor bar.  I haven't had any issues with it.Pros:- \"Wireless\" so you can place it on your TV without running a long cable from your Wii.  This is helpful for people who have home theater systems where the TV or projector screen is far away from the console.- Built in timer so you can have it automatically turn off after 1 or 2 hours to prevent the batteries from draining.- Excellent range.- Solidly built and heavy enough with the 4 x AA batteries that it won't slide anywhere.Cons:- The blue power LED is incredibly bright and shines directly towards the players.  A much, much dimmer LED would have sufficed.  I might have to tape over it eventually.- The sensor bar makes a REALLY loud and annoying beeping sound when the timer is up.  It makes me not want to use the timer feature at all.I might open this thing up some day and replace the LED and speaker with ones that are less annoying, but overall, this is a solid wireless sensor bar.  You don't really need it if your Wii is right next to the TV, but it's very handy for people who have projectors or wall mounted TVs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2009"}

Son","summary":"Revolutionary in some areas and a step back in others","reviewText":"If you're the type to skip through cutscenes and don't care about having a purpose to what you're doing in a game, don't bother reading any further and don't bother playing this game. L.A. Noire is a captivating drama with intriguing plots and amazing characterization. L.A. Noire used real actors to play the parts of every character in the game including all of their facial animations. The results are absolutely amazing and bring a lifelike appearance never before seen in any video game. This feature serves a big purpose as you will be interrogating many suspects throughout this lengthy adventure. You will play as the ambitious detective, Cole Phelps, who is hard set on doing the right thing, preserving life, and serving swift justice to any criminals in his path. Facial animations aren't the only thing revolutionary about L.A. Noire. L.A. Noire is extremely well-written. The plot is very captivating but the characters are what's really impressive. Phelps' character is exceptionally deep for a video game. I've never seen a character I've disliked so much and yet couldn't help from loving at the same. Phelps is a great guy on many levels and at the same time, most will disagree with his views on many things. Although his intentions are usually good, he's not always doing it for the right reasons. This is what makes Phelps real and what brings L.A. Noire its amazing humanity.As amazing as L.A. Noire is, it isn't without flaws.  The shooting can be frustrating sometimes. Trying to take cover can be tricky and targeting criminals doesn't always work the way you want it to. Driving around is even worse. Chase scenes can be down right irritating  because many buildings have little parts sticking out and if you clip one of these, it will stop you dead in your tracks. It's also stupid that I'm hitting things like gates and wooden fences that bring my car to a complete halt. It certainly takes some realism out of the game. The next part may ruin the experience of L.A. Noire for you but it needs to be mentioned. Don't read this next part if you want your experience to be better. L.A. Noire does a great job making you think that you're having an impact on investigations and the overall plot. This, however, is just a big ruse. Your decisions and interrogations have very little difference on the outcome of the case or the overarching story. This is my biggest complaint about L.A. Noire. I don't mind playing a game \"on rails\" because it allows for excellent stories such as this one, but I need to feel like my actions have consequences. Especially for a game that doesn't have a lot of action-oriented gameplay. As you play through the game you'll start to realize your decisions don't matter and if you decide to replay a case you'll definitely figure it out.CONCLUSION: L.A. Noire is a wonderful experience. It just needs some gameplay tweaking.PROS:- Revolutionary animating of real actors. You've never seen anything like it.- Exceptional scriptwriting/storyline- The characters are absolutely ground-breaking for a video game- Searching for clues and interrogating suspects is a lot of funCONS:- Driving around can be frustrating- The cover mechanics in shootouts can be irritating- Something I mentioned above that can tarnish the experience","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

It enhances the PS4 experience, but unlike the kinect for Xbox One, since this is optional, most consumers will probably take a, &#34;wait and see approach&#34; to buying it. Which means two things, 1. Fewer sold = game devs have little incentive to design games for it, 2. Lack of buyers means it will have a niche audience, and even Sony won't be inspired to support it or develop for it. However, I love mine and it was very easy to setup. I truly believe it is a must have, but I'm guessing I'm in the minority.Not sure I see any cons, other than it is optional instead of integrated...

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4.

Rhodes","summary":"This must be what heaven feels like!","reviewText":"When people talk about the greatest game for the PSX most people will probably tell you Final Fantasy VII or something like that.  But I always think of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  By far this is the greatest 2D platformer to ever grace the gaming world, and there is no Castlevania better than Symphony of the Night.The game begins in 1792 with Richter Belmont going into battle with Dracula.  After Richter emerges victorious and banishes Dracula, the mysterious Castle disappears.  But a year afterwards Richter suddenly vanishes.  Maria, a close friend of his sets out to find him and out of nowhere Castlevania, the home of Dracula appears out of nowhere.You play as Alucard, the son of Dracula, who rushes into Castlevania when it appears in order to destroy it and prevent Dracula from returning.It's a very simple story, but its an action/adventure game.  The game also throws in some RPG elements.  Unlike the past Castlevania games, you're character now levels up and can equip weapons and armor.  Alucard also doesn't use the trademark whip like the Belmont's used to.  You actually use a Sword in one hand and you can even have a different weapon in another.  The game also presents a Super Metroid style map that you will use as you explore the castle looking for bosses to defeat and finding all of your abilities to take on Dracula.Like the classic games you've got \"Sub-weapons\" that use hearts.  Each weapon has its advantages and disadvantages.  For example, the throwing knives can be used for long range attacks but are fairly weak.  The Holy Cross does TONS of damage but cost a lot of hearts.You also have \"relics\" that you either find lying around or get from defeating bosses.  These relics help Alucard out and enhance his abilities.  You can use some relics to help you turn into a Wolf, turn into a bat or a cloud of mist. There is also a relic that lets you summon an ally known as a \"Familiar\" by your side.You can also use spells to hinder your skills.  The spells are done with a D-Pad combination.The visual look and feel of this game is astonishing.  A 2D game has never looked this good.  Even so many years later the graphics look really good.  Some are a tad bit fuzzy but you'll quickly get over that.The music is perhaps the best part about Castlevania: SOTN.  The tunes are addicting and you'll be humming them for a while.  The tunes were so good that I found myself just... standing around in one area just so I could enjoy the music.The game also throws in a twist halfway through.  Once you're done exploring the first castle you'll go to a \"Reverse\" castle in which everything is upside down.  The game also has four different endings.This is perhaps the best Playstation game of all time.  It is the best Castlevania hands down (with the excellent Circle of the Moon coming in second) and is the most breathtaking in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2004"}

Besides pehaps the Witcher and the lesser known Arcanum, those two games are my most beloved PC rpg's of all-time. I did not expect this game to come even close as I have played all of Bethesda's rpg's since Arena and know them as a company that churns out the same rpg with minor improvements over and over again.I knew this would be an oblivion clone, but I had hope for this game only because even simply putting the shell of fallout into the oblivion engine is better than nothing. The core gameplay of the first two Fallout's is there from the weapons and ammo gathering, to the large non-linear world, to the Perks and level building, and everything in between. Where this game fails is the first-person perspective and lack of a TRUE turned-based combat system. V.A.T.S is nothing more than a weak attempt at keeping the turn-based combat available in some weaker form for the purists such as myself. AP no longer plays a part in your movement durign combat, you can fight in real-time like oblivion and get by(although you do not gain the 15% crit bonus that using V.A.T.S. gives you), and it just feels too much like oblivion. From the conversations and facial expressions all the way down to the way the world map works and is layed out feels just like Oblivion.Don't get me wrong, this game is an outstanding stand-alone game by itself and blows away the much over-hyped Oblivion, especially for fallout fans, but it does not slake my appetite for a true Fallout successor. I have tried time and again to force myself to envision this game more like fallout than the elder scrolls series, but its impossible to not make the comparisons. Bethesda is a one-trick pony that needs to evolve soon or many people will jump ship as it seems many already have thanks to this game.Anyone who loved Oblivion will love this game, perhaps moreso, and most Fallout worshippers will do the same, if only with a bit of a sour after-taste like myself. Your better off with this game than without it either way, if given the choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2008"}

Wu \"University Graduate\"","summary":"Great FPS! Very Addictive!!","reviewText":"Before I start my review, I want to let u guys know that I own the following games: Killzone 2, BFBC1 & 2, COD4, CODW@W, CODMW2, MAG, and MOH.I notice it's a fashionable thing to bash a mainstream game, but I believe in order to appreciate COD:Black Ops, you have to come from a background playing other FPS games such as COD4 and MOH, and not only from playing MW2. I loved MW2 and I prestiged as well, but you cannot expect a carbon copy of MW2. If you want MW2, then just play MW2 with those $15 map-packs (I bought the stimulus package for myself as well, lol).PERSONAL REVIEW ON THE MULTIPLAYER MODE:I realized many MW2 players are hating on COD:Black ops(BO) because of the graphic. I agree with them somewhat, that is why I wanna give 4.5 out of 5, but it doesn't mean u could give the game only 1 star just cuz it doesn't have more textures than MW2!! If you ever played W@W, you know the graphic and innovation isn't everything for Treyarch; they care more of the gameplay and balance in COD. If you want the innovation in COD, just don't play COD and just pick up a copy of BFBC2. After playing W@W, I knew in terms of graphic, Treyarch is still playing the catch up game with Infinite ward. The heavily modified id Tech graphic engine used in the development of COD4 and MW2 by Infinite Ward is far more superior. That is why many people who ONLY played MW2 with high expectations especially on graphic are disappointed. Anyway, a matter of fact, I was amazed how Treyarch pulled off such an amazing graphic in BO, which is almost close to MW2 consider W@W's graphic was really bad compared to COD4.Well, I believe those MW2 players who gave lower rating simply cuz BO got rid of the following:1)Noob-tubing: scavenger + Danger close perk do not exist anymore for those noobtubers; so players who are not good at aiming cannot kill.2)Sniping: it became so much more difficult due to the fact that BO got rid of the quick scoping. If you ever played MOH, you will know how annoying and over powered snipers are. Especially in MW2, many players want to earn their higher kill-streak combo such as Harrier --> AC130 --> Nuke, that the game promotes campers and snipers. I really like how kill-streak do not chained-up as more kills in BO, which further gets rid of campers.3)Camping and dual shoguning: again there were so many campers and dual shotguners in MW2 that their strategies do not work in BO anymore. The implementation of RC-XD w/ ONLY 3 kill-streak (2 kill-streak with hardline perk) is simply to get rid of corner campers. I love that idea.For those of you thought that BO is just an inferior copy of MW2 with just few hours of gameplay, I suggest you to keep on playing. The multi-player mode doesn't grow on some players until you start the CUSTOMIZATION. The personalization of emblem, camo, face-paint, lens color, and lens will have you appreciate and hooked on BO even more. People who are hating on BO is only mentioning the surface of the game (graphic and sound), and have not experienced the real potential of BO. Those who are complaining about the lag, maybe their internet connections aren't good or do not know how to change their setting to LOCALE. You could change your connection setting to LOCALE, where you get to play with local people in your area/region, which personally helps getting the full bar while playing online. The game only came last week, and patches will come to fix those who really experiencing lags. All online games have lag and glitch problems when they first released. If you remember when COD4 first came out, many people including myself simply couldn't play online due to the infinite \"DOWNLOADING GAME SETTING SCREEN\" freeze. That was MUCH worse than any lag you will experience in BO.NOW, MY REVIEW ON THE SINGLE PLAYER MODE:I finished the campaign in 8 hours and loved every moment of it. The story was intense and creative that it reminded me of the movie, \"Shutter Island.\" Treyarch did a great job. I loved how Reznov and Dimitri from W@W came back in the story, and how you actually get to be in Hong kong, and even in German to get rid of SS soldiers like the good old W@W. For me, I thought the story was much much better than other FPS out there.OVERALL:Call of Duty:Black Ops is the closest thing to COD4!!! which for me was the most balanced multi-player experience. In BO, players actually have to run and circulate around the map in Team Deathmatch, which reminded me much of COD4 and I really enjoy that. However, I know there are many people do not appreciate how balanced BO's gameplay is and judging the game by just the surface appearance. Simply, for me, the gameplay of BO is amazing, fun, and addictive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Still one of the best games around, but it is a remake","reviewText":"For those looking to pick up an 3DS would obviously want some good games to go with the system.  After all, what's a game system without a game?  For the first six months or so of the 3DS's launch, OCARINA OF TIME was the definitive title for the 3DS.With OCARINA OF TIME, we came to the heart of the problem in regards to the 3DS and its initial launch.  Nintendo simply did not have that many games available at launch, and two of the key summer titles of 2011 for the system were remakes (OCARINA and STAR FOX 64). When it comes down to it, OCARINA OF TIME was almost thirteen years old at time of release the 3DS release, so it is not surprising that the 3DS had issues starting out of the gate when the main titles were simply remakes with a new coat of paint and some interface redesign.  Nintendo had to slash the cost from 250 to 170 (which is the first time Nintendo has had to reduce the cost of a console in its first year of release), and Nintendo reported the lowest earnings this year since 1986 (yes, 1986.  2011 has been that damaging to Nintendo).However, that is neither here nor there in regards to OCARINA, and the 3DS is on better footing anyway with the release of SUPER MARIO 3D LAND and MARIO KART 7.OCARINA OF TIME is just as great as you remember it.  The game play itself is the same as the N64 version; what has been changed is the graphics and interface. There the nine main dungeons to go through, along with plenty of sidequests, NPCs, towns, and minigames to go through, with the ultimate showdown with Ganon waiting at the end.Besides the graphic overhaul, the biggest upgrade to the system is the dual screen interface and motion control (!).In regards to the dual-screen interface design changes, Eiji Aonuma has paid for his sins in regards to the Water Temple.  Aounuma was the one responsibile for the constant pausing and switching of the iron boots that was undoubtly the most awkward part of the original N64 version.  That is not an issue in the 3DS version; with the touch screen you can easily switch items in and out without having to break up gameplay, and not only that you can have four items equipped instead of three like the original title.As far as bonus features, actually there are not many.  Obviously the Nintendo gave the game the 3D treatment.  There are boss rushes now, where you can fight all the dungeon bosses in sequential order.  The Master version boss rush has the bosses and enemies do double damage.Speaking of the Master Version, we finally get a mainstream release of Ura-Zelda (the original name of the Master Version).  Originally meant to come out on the 64DD add-on in 2000, the 64DD never came out for the N64 and so the title fell through.  Then in 2003 Nintendo gave \"Ocarina of Time/Ocarina of Time Master Version\" away for free on a Gamecube disk for those that preordered WIND WAKER.  This disk featured the original version and the master version of OCARINA.  However, although the disks are common place and easily obtainable, this title were not commercially released.The Master Version is (somewhat) like the second quest to the original NES title where it features remixed dungeons and more difficult enemies.  However, unlike the NES title, only the dungeons are remixed.  The story is identical and so are all other parts of the game.  Unfortunately, the master version on the 3DS v ersion is not available until AFTER you beat the original version.  I am just happy they have finally made Ura-Zelda released commerically and make it accessible to the large legion of the Zelda fandom community.In summary, if you love Zelda and want to play OCARINA OF TIME with a fresh coat of paint, don't hesitate it pick this up.  Another great added benefit is now it's portable!It still stands tall as one of the best games made (like its spiritual predecessor SUPER MARIO 64) and is still worth your time if you are a gamer.  However if you've picked OCARINA OF TIME up elsewhere (the original N64 version, the Gamecube disk, or the Wii Virtual Console), you may want to save your money for a new 3DS title instead of this one.If you've never played OCARINA before, then everything I just said in the last few sentences goes out the window; pick the game up now - you won't regret it!..----->>=&lt; M[For Bonus content to the review proper, I am including two articles I wrote about Ocarina of Time back in the late 1990s.  One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST.][Article 1 (Review): Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?  Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT.  Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best?  Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance?  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They're both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?One reason mainly.  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular.  Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon.  Ah, the last dungeon.  Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda.  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon.  It was truly a great dungeon.  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version.  What have we here?  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda!  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon.  Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.After five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64.  So cool!  Link in a 3D adventure.  About time too.  Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96.  Of course, I bought the game.  And of course, I beat it.  It is an excellent game.  Truly it is one of the great classics.  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  The end dungeon absolutely sucked.  That is my only disappointment with that game.  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower.  I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.[Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this]What did we get?  Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers.  What did we have to do?  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway.  And what did I get?  A great disappointment.  Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible.  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable.  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.[Spoiler Finished]Others say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game.  I have to disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64.  It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right.  But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game.  LTTP is huge.  It fully utilized the SNES technology.  It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever.  That's one more than the original has.  (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.)  After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon.  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also.  Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.But what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT?  My two chief complaints are these:1.  Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).2.  Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.All other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld.  But what have we in OoT?  A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field.  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen.  For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda.  Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme.  They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age.  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series.  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT?  The Overworld them from the original LoZ!  I couldn't believe they did that!  Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden.  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too.  Just a thought.Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually...-----[Article 2 (Comparison between LTTP and OoT): Zelda 64 a Remake? Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake.  Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena!  Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it.  It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past.  Why do I say this?  I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.Lets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP.  This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple.  Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her.  After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped.  This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods.  In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones.  After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly.  I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town.  Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf.  Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions.  Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away.  Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf.  How intriguing.In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you.  Link wakes no sages this time.  Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part.  They are challenging, fun, and intriguing.  Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff.  But it is not as consistent as LTTP.  After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals.  That's great!  Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.Okay, what do we have in Zelda 64?  You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link.  Guess what?  Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.*  Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda?  Why, I do believe it is, Watson!Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World.  Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself).  In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you.  There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth.  If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter.  Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple).  But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young.  That creates two versions of the same world to explore.  That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP.  Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword.  This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place.  Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP?  After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword.  But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents.  Well, that's the same in Zelda 64.  He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones.  I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )The real question is why did Nintendo do this?  Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense.  Again, another article, another time.  The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening.  Who knows why they chose to do that?  Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same.  In review:A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 641.  SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda.  This is to get the Master Sword.  Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.2.  N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones.  Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped.  He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is.  Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called.  Is given first Sage Medallion.3.  SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World).  Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4.  N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world.  One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult.  This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal.  Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.When he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown.5.  SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon.  Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.6.  N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil.  Ganon has just recently showed up.  Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world.  The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier.  But for game play, they're the same.7.  SNES:  He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical).  With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle.8.  N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower.9.  SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.10.  N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped.  Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.12.  N64:  Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda.  There's a shocker.13.  SNES:  There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also.14.  Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.15.  SNES:  In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.16.  N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess.  Yoshi also comes up.  Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also.  Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.As you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few.  If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose.  This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed.  Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand.  And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex.  But I love Ocarina of Time all the same.  This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains.  This is the first game in the series to break that trend.  The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain.  Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains.  At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

They should do the same concept with \"A New Hope\", \"Empire Strikes Back\", \"Return of the Jedi\", \"Phantom Menace\", and \"Attack of the Clones\".  I know the \"Attack of the Clones\" dealt with the battles in the movie, but I'm talking saber action, not so much vehicles.So, this game in itself is a really neat concept.  HINT: If you really want to get high skill levels, try NOT to block and defend so much.  Rely on your fighting skills and this will increase your status.

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four.

{"product_name":"B009LEIUY4","description":"","reviewerName":"Jessie Scott","summary":"Great Dungeon Crawl, Short on Story","reviewText":"I am new to the Etrian Odyssey series, but have been meaning to try it for some time.  Overall, I'm really enjoying this game.  However, I can say that this game won't be for everyone.Your task as an adventurer is to join the Explorer's Guild and make your way toward the legendary tree of life, Yggdrasil.  Within the first few minutes playing, the player is tasked with creating a \"Guild\" and recruiting (creating) up to 30 characters of various professions, all of which are fairly standard (fighter, heavy armor, mage for spells, thief for causing status conditions, etc).  There are three hidden subclasses that are unlockable later on.-There are three main areas: Cities, Lands, and Dungeons.--In the city, you buy/sell and create items; save the game at the inn or revive dead characters; manage your Guild and members; take on quests and missions (missions to move the story forward, quests for items and experience points); manage communication settings for Wi-Fi etc; and select a location to visit via land or dungeon (when opened).--In the Lands, you travel by airship and can eventually change altitude.  There are dungeons scattered about that can be visited, FOES (really tough enemies that are visible on the map) roaming around that need to be avoided, animals that can be acquired to sell and to eat for stat bonuses (rare animals give much better bonuses, always grab animals when available!), and other airships that will task you with bringing them an animal or helping them for some kind of gift.--In the Dungeon is where you do your exploring on foot.  Random encounters happen here as well as more FOES roaming around the dungeon.  There are treasure chests, events and people to talk to (typically with a \"Press A to Search\" when you move into a spot) and spots to mine, harvest, or chop up.  Some dungeons have places that can bring the player directly back to the town or save which helps speed things up.-As one of the main features of this series, the player draws the map on the bottom screen as they explore on the top screen.  It does tend to be repetitive after while,though it still helps to foster a sense of exploration.  I haven't gone in far enough to note if maps change at all, but if not, once a map is done it will never have to be redrawn.-New weapons and items are acquired by collecting the various items monsters drop and those that are harvested.  Forging items (adding additional properties to items with open forge slots) also requires the use of items that have been sold but does not cost anything and can be changed as frequently as desired.  Note that you don't have to save any of the items; everything sold will be tallied up and available to use.  Sell away!-The character image choices are limited.  I was left wondering several times if the character is a male or female.  It's easy to figure out once you realize that the portraits go male/female/male/female.  Some of the female models are hyper-sexualized (particular the thief) and the game only offers a choice between two awful choices.  You'd suspect with that little clothing they would have died a long time ago from a bee sting or something equally mundane.-The skill selection is varied and extensive, which allows for a degree of gameplay customization and the ability to have the same class play in different ways.  Reallocating skill points requires the character to lose 2 levels, which isn't particularly painful, but the time it takes to level back up is annoying.  The alternative is to create a new character and level them up.  Some skills need a certain number of skills allocated (like three levels) before the next one in the chain opens up.  Each player receives 1 skill point each level.  It's very sparse and makes choosing each skill to level up difficult.-Burst Skills are a nice addition that add another thin layer of tactics.  Each are useful depending on the situation, so change them as needed.  There is a burst gauge that is charged when the player attacks or defeats an enemy.  The maximum charge is 5.  Using a skill drains a number of charges depending on the skill (for instance a healing skill drains 1 charge while a range magic attack could drain 3).  This helps to customize each group to shore up weaknesses, increase the ability to survive or to damage enemies.-I am not a fan of the 3D effect for this game.  It looks too much like a pop up book, just layering 2D images really.  Navigating dungeons required me to readjust my eyes between battles.  I don't even use the 3D for this game.  (Note: I'm playing on a 3DS XL).-The story will not win any awards for being amazing.  It gets the job done, and I think it's all that is necessary for this title.  The player is searching for the legendary life tree and encounters random people along the way, saving others and battling foes.  Pretty standard JRPG fare if you're familiar with the genre.  I never really feel compelled to finish my mission.  I get caught up in killing enemies to level up before moving to the next story portion (which is necessary) and gain new items.  When I do further the story, it just sends me back out to explore some other location and return later.**Review Overview:Gameplay: 4/5 - There is nothing revolutionary about the gameplay, but it does everything it's supposed to do.  Menus are easy to manage (other than the first time where you are trying to locate where to distribute skill points - it's in custom by the way).  Enemies are easy to target and dungeons are simple to navigate.Graphics: 4/5 - The game has looks like an anime, if you like that style.  The characters aren't visible on screen, but the enemies all have good animations.  The 3D effect is not necessary and I feel like it's more of a hassle to have it on.  Your experience with 3D may vary.Story: 3/5 - Standard anime tropes abound in this game, the player is often found helping others.  You're an explorer, and so the story does a good job of getting the player into dungeons and charting them (on the lower screen) while the storyline itself is not terribly compelling.Overall: 4/5 - I enjoy the game, but it does feel very repetitive after awhile.If you're looking for a game with decent customization, deep player interaction, a great sense of exploration and discovery this is a solid title.  If you're looking for something fast paced and story driven, this title may not be for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"M.","summary":"Buy This Game Right Now","reviewText":"I am a longtime Nintendo and Super Mario fan, and I've been disappointed with the last few Mario games (NSMBU, NSMB2, even Dream Team *sigh*). But I assure you--this one's definitely worth your time and money, and I even see it as superior to Galaxy.First, I'll get the negatives out of the way:-No triple jump. Why would they get rid of the triple jump? I have no idea. It was cool, it was fun, and it often proved to be useful. The triple jump's removal didn't really effect gameplay too much, but I'll still miss it...At least the long jump and spin jump are still here!-Awkward multiplayer camera. I think basically every online review of 3D World touches on this, but it is true. I'm not sure if it's possible to even improve the multiplayer camera in a game such as this (it's still a little better than split screen), but it can still get annoying. Multiplayer is definitely best suited for 2 or 3 players with similar skill levels.-The Wii U Gamepad is a complete gimmick. Sad but true. It's so big and awkward for a game such as this, and its only advantage is the ability to stun enemies via the touch screen and microphone, which is more tedious than useful. If you're looking to get the most out of this game, do yourself a favor and buy a Wii U Pro Controller. I could ramble on forever about how great that thing is, but I'm supposed to be reviewing the game, not the controller.Everything else in this game is near perfect. The first few worlds of the game are pretty easy, but the difficulty level definitely picks up. I think both pros and beginners can get a lot out of this game, since the character choice plays a large role in the difficulty of levels. Plus there's the optional gold tanooki suit that appears if you die too many times in a certain level, which makes your character invincible (this is for beginners only, I refuse to use the gold tanooki suit!).The main story mode isn't super lengthy, but once you beat the game, you have access to many new (and super challenging) levels. Also there is much replayability, with 3 green stars (happy Year of Luigi!) and a stamp cleverly hidden throughout each level. The stamps are especially fun to collect, since you can use the ones you collect on Miiverse.I used a Wii U Pro Controller throughout the whole game, and the controls were PERFECT (Aside from the lack of the triple jump, that is), and much smoother than 3D Land's. First of all you must hold the X, Y, or 1 button (depending on the controller you're using) to dash. I absolutely love this. Sure, you have to hold down an additional button, but I have no problem whatsoever with that. It also allows you to move faster than you could in 64, Sunshine, or Galaxy. The controls are extremely responsive as well, with the addition of all sorts of awesome abilities like the long jump, spin jump, crouching jump, back flip, and roll, aside from the extra abilities gained from power-ups.Speaking of power-ups, Super Mario 3D World has tons of great ones. There's the Fire Flower, which allows you to shoot multiple fireballs at enemies. The fireballs also bounce off walls and such in this game for some reason, like they did in Super Mario 3D Land and the original Super Mario Land (who remembers that one?). There's also the Boomerang Flower, Super Star, Super Leaf, and the new Super Bell and Double Cherries. The Super Bell allows you to turn into a cat, allowing you to claw (sort of feels like SM64's punch) and pounce on enemies. Plus it's just plain adorable. The Double Cherries create clones of your character, which isn't ever necessary, but is super fun, especially for the more experienced players.Another thing is the soundtrack. It very well could be my new favorite soundtrack out of any Mario game. It's all masterfully orchestrated with a great big band sound, and any tracks that aren't completely new are re-done, often with a (really cool) jazzy vibe. I especially love the Bowser World theme. You'll hear a lot of original new music, plus some old favorites like the Super Mario Bros. overworld theme, the Super Mario Bros. underground theme, Super Mario 64's slider theme, Super Mario Galaxy music, Super Mario 3D Land's main theme, Mario Kart music, and even some Legend of Zelda music (there is an epic Zelda cameo).There are also just some overall nice touches, like a racing-style Mario Kart level, top-down perspective levels, levels taking place on a train, Captain Toad levels, genuinely difficult boss battles, clear pipes, new enemies, and more.I would definitely recommend this masterpiece to anyone who likes a good video game, no matter what their age is or how experienced with games they are. And although multiplayer is an emphasized feature of the game, the single player experience is just as great, if not better. The music, graphics, and almost everything else is near perfect. And to anyone who doesn't own a Wii U: It's worth buying just for Super Mario 3D World.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

In a small suburban town that's overrun by zombies, he escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be safe. Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"A must own game for any 360 owners, but not without its faults","reviewText":"Dead Rising is an Exciting new game by the same brilliant minds of developers CAPCOM(whom brought you Resident Evil 4, Killer 7, DMC).  The Game follows the footsteps of Frank, a War Journalist who is trying to figure out just what the hell is going on in the city of Colorado.  Long story short, some baddies have brought a horrible virus that has turned the entire(or almost)population to flesh eating cannibals.  Now Frank has to uncover the truth(in a mall, DAWN OF THE DEAD, hmmm???)and has to get it within the course of the 3 days before he leaves the town.  But as you get deeper into the games story you'll meet up with some likable characters whom are also there to you help you on your quest to finding how what the hell is been goin on this messed town, and also some unlikable people, but those are mainly the villains.Dead Rising is deffinetly one of the most unique games on the 360.  Its a free roaming(sort of)action adventure game that lets you use many random items as your weapons and damn do they help you out a lot.  For example, if there is a about maybe 100 to 200 zombies in a certain area and you have a baseball bat, USE IT and i mean use till you've gotten to your destination and more importantly...bashed some brains.  Speaking of which Dead Rising is very \"From Point a to point d\" oriented.  You will be doing missions and side quests which pins you to run from part of the mall to another part of it and the mall is quit huge.  The game is just plain fun and it never got boring for me once.  The game also has a level up system which lets you expand your stats like Running faster, increased attack hits and even expands your items holding(as you level up you can hold more items).  At first the it will be on the hard side as you are on a very low level with not much stats build for you so prepare to be romped on as I found the game pretty difficult in the beginning parts, but as you get better with new skills and such the game gos from frustrating to just challenging.  The reason also being is that the game chuck full of zombies and I mean CHUCK FULL of it.  There will be times when your in a room just vomiting zombies at every corner...its truly a site to see and is one of the first few 360 game to come out and show the graphical potential of the 360.  Speaking of that, Dead Rising is a very pretty game and has HANDS DOWN the best looking zombie visuals and character models i have ever seen on any console.  Sure it has a couple of frame rate hiccups but usually when you're shooting a handful of zombies in your area(more preferably the very end of the game when you fight the boss on a tank)but it really doesn't affect that much.  The sound is also top notch, the music is really awesome in parts like the park with the convicts.  Controls are just right aswell.I really wanted to give the game the a 5/5 but it sure does have its flaws.  One being that the A.1 is very retarded.  When you want to rescue Survivors they should have had an option where you can hold EACH AND EVERYONE of there hands because dealing with these morons is like dealing with a toddler.  Trust me there will be times when the woman or man you're saving is going to just run into the wall and keeping doing it for the next 20 minutes until you do something about it.  Its gos from fun to downright FRUSTRATING.  Also some of the bosses are a real pain, one I can remember was the gun shop owner(man that guy was A PAIN)but it feels really rewarding as I did get to have the Gun shop store all to myself(with unlimited amounts of shotties and rifles..shigghty shiggity sweet)in which these parts are very \"Rewarding\" felt or something like that..Blah.  Saving can also be a pain as it feels like a fetch quest since the mall is limited of Save stations(which play as bathrooms and such).  Blah lets get to thisThe Good-Visualy Awesome, one of the best looking games on the 360-Very fun and unique experience-Lots of items and weapons to choose from-doing everything will take a good 30 to 40 hours-Pretty cool plot in my opinion-IT TAKES PLACE IN A MALL, CMON MAN!!!  THATS AWESOME-Pretty gory, violent fun.  Not for the lil ones-Good Music-awesome cutscenes-Chuck full of Bosses and some are really memerable like the clownThe Bad-Can get very difficult at times-Some Bosses are real pain-Saving the A.1 is like trying to get a Baby to walk...at times atleast-Regular plot with the real ending talks only about 10 to 12 hours to beat :(-Lots of Load Times between mall which can get annoying-Needed more weapons like DOUBLE KATANA or something cause they didnt have much on the weapons other then a pistol, shotties, rifle ect.  Your standard weapon-Some Framerate hitches but not to the point where its downright Horrible..but still capcom could of fixed thisOverall Dead Rising is a must get for any 360 owners or anyone who is fan of the zombie genre in general(like myself).  Its a very unique and unforgettable experience, not to mention one of my fav 360 games ever(it was my first 360 game acctually).  Loads of fun, from start to finish.  Anyone looking to blast some undead heads should be checkin this game asap.  Put simply...Dead Rising is an awesome THOUGH FLAWED game...4.3","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

I've beaten Legend Of Mana, so hey why not give this a go! Honest opinion.... Not as great as I expected. I did enjoy it to some extent, but about 8 hours in it just gets cheap. I'm talking Ruby Weapons \"Quicksand\" attack cheap. Enemies start multiplying, bosses start coming in pairs and heal each other/Revive. I've come across this before in RPG's (Star Ocean 3,Legend Of Dragoon,Paper Mario), but in Secret Of Mana it's way out of control. I guess that's how they chose to make this game difficult, just give enemies doppleganger/infinite healing/infinite revive. Not my style. It's not like me to just up and quit a game right in the middle, so I'm a little disappointed. As for this being one of the greatest RPG's Ever? I wouldn't go that far and I wouldn't bring it up in a conversation concerning that subject.  Also it's absolutely not worth that $50.00 \"used\" price tag it holds. Maybe it's on PSN?ahem, on a much brighter note. May I recommend some highly acclaimed games like Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past, Final Fantasy 3 aka 6, or Chrono Trigger instead?Anywho, if you're a fan of this game no disrespect.

Sony sadly hasn't had the sales to match with the way gamers across the country had definitely needed for their needs. While it still has had some great games like Motorstorm and Guitar Hero: World Tour, there still wasn't a whole lot there for those who simply at the time, couldn't afford to buy the PS3. Well, after a few years of desperation, Sony has decided to pull out all the stops, by reducing its price, but to enhance the way that the PS3 has made itself a influential video game system. Well, with Sony deciding to soon retire the Playstation 2, Sony has put its priorities on the PS3 full time, with not only a reintroduction, but a new sleaker version. But, is it worth its weight in what it is worth, or should Sony make more drastic measures?The newer, and simpler Sony Playstation 3, brings in all that we have enjoyed from the original PS3, but add in a bit more within the price, and the gameplay. The system offers a much bigger hard drive for its price, but has all the features from top to bottom that were enjoyed from the PS3 right out of the box, including a bigger hard drive, where you can store 120 GB of gaming from the PSN, and downloadable content and games like the simple Flower, as well as play all your favorite movies on DVD & Blu-Ray discs. The setup makes it a lot sleaker and more convient to place around your house, more than any other Blu-Ray player currently on the market. You also get to play all your favorite PS3 games like Gran Turismo 5: Epilogue, Ratchet & Clank: Tools Of Destruction, and many other greats. The setup is very easy, and fun to play. Sadly though, there are a few disadvantages with this one. The first one is that unlike the PS2 or the Nintendo Wii, it honestly isn't backwards compatable. So if you still own Playstation 2 or the original Playstation 1 games, you sadly won't be able to play them here. Also, the loading time for Blu-Ray movies takes awhile on the new PS3, because the speed of the system for those discs is very slow. But you do get very well, a whole lot for what your money is worth right now, if you simply couldn't afford the PS3 then, and waited for the price to drop.All in all, despite a few things that could've been added for the newer version of the Playstation 3, it still is a great system from start to finish. Now, that the price has dropped, it is a better time to buy the PS3 than ever before. With Blu-ay players and discs being more affordable right now, it makes the system a must have video game owner. If you've waited for the price to drop on the PS3, because you couldn't afford it 3 years ago, now is the right time to jam your heart out on Sony's PS3.Price: BGraphics: BSound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: BConvience: B 1/2+Overall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary.

This budget title is actually fun, I'm amazed.  We all know the track record of these movie tie-in games and Captain America is some strange anomaly.  But sooner or later you just have to accept it, this is a solid game worth buying at it's budget price.Graphically this game is average, i'm not wowed, but they aren't bad.  They seemed to have put most of the detail work into Captain America himself, he looks quite good, even up close.  I particularly like the shield, it looks right and is oh so satisfying when you give it a toss.I've heard some comparisons to Arkham Asylum and Prince of Persia and i have to agree.  The combat is heavily influenced by the recent Batman game and I'm happy about it.  I really enjoy the simple yet satisfying combat, which consist of a standard attack, a grab attack, the counter button and a dodge function.  The combat is the most polished aspect of the game.  The attack and dodge animations are tight and just plain fun to watch.  The moves are easy to pull off and make you feel like a patriotic badass.  The platforming section looks very much like a prince of persia game but you don't really have much control over the Cap at these points.  All you do is hit one button to make him jump and swing around and there is no finesse required on the player's end, just hit the button over and over and watch Cap do his acrobatic thing.  Some people will not like this, but it didn't bother me.The shield itself really steals the show.  It can be used to block all manner of attacks including gunfire.  If you time it just right when an enemy fires his gun, you can deflect the bullet right back at them, sweet.  You can aim and toss it at multiple enemies as you upgrade your character.  It's even sweet in close combat, the sound of the shield bashing against a Hydra agent's mask makes the hair on my neck stand up.There are all kinds of extra content bonus items to pick up to flesh out the background of the story including film reels you can watch and Baron Zemo's personal diaries.  I find myself searching every nook and cranny for these items just to get a little extra experience to buff the Cap out with new abilities.Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and just plain surprised that it is actually a fun game.  It's made a Captain America fan out of me so it's doing something right.  If you like the combat of Arkham Asylum i think you will like this game.  So grab your shield and bash some Hydra skull!  CAPTAIN AMERICA FOREVER!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000K2R4","description":"The Dreamcast system is, in a word, awesome. Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Rezivor","summary":"\"It's thinking\" even after all these years.","reviewText":"The Sega Dreamcast was/is the last system that Sega released. If I remember right, the Dreamcast is a 128bit system. The Dreamcast system also came out in black (Sports edition) which both versions are cool! The dreamcast was ahead of it's time in my opinion. Sega implemented the 4 player ports built into the console, like N64. Sega also did something that Nintendo eventually became known for. Which is making a controller that seemed/seems gimmickey. The controller has a hollowed out mid-section, which has a port for for a memory car. The N64 had already had the memory card slot in their controller. However, the Sega Dreamcast controller had a open space, which would allow gamers to use a special memory card (VMU card). The special memory card had a screen & buttons on it. Which would allow you to see things on the screen that wouldn't not appear on your TV screen. For example, if you we're playing NBA 2K, and you slam dunked....The screen would have a animated reaction to the dunk! The screen would also show you your in game stats,ect... It was a very cool idea. The Dreamcast is not a HD system. It has the RF and AV capabilities. However, a cool thing with Dreamcast is that there is a device (VGA box) that allows you to hook up the Dreamcast to it, & then the VGA box to your LCD/plasma TV's & it comes in super sharp! You have to buy the VGA box seperately & most to my knowledge are not Sega brand. I recommend getting itto play Dreamcast on the current TV's! The Sega Dreamcast had many awesome titles to play. Some of the best games for this system are:Marvel vs Capcom 1 & 2Giga Wing 1&2Resident Evil 2 (it's rare)OuttriggerNBA 2K1Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1&2GTA 2Soul CaliberPlasma SwordSonic AdventureExpendablesReady 2 RumbleSega RallyVirtua Fighter 3Crazy TaxiAlso I recommend buying the extension cords for your controllers. It's like an extra 6FT of cord!There are other great-good games for this system, which I can't think of at the moment. If you have yet to own a Sega Dreamcast, but love collecting various systems, I recommend getting one! The Dreamcast is a classic game system. Which is still fun to play to this day!

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

I also like add that some of the indoor levels are far too dark at times you will probably have to adjust you tv's monitor as there is no brightness adjustment in game.The story is interesting, but its missing that cool narration from the first instead you'll be listening characters in game and cut scenes to get the whole story, and this time hale talks which in my opinion you won't care about him as you loose that connection.Overall its a great game and a good follow up but i feel like it lost some of its uniqueness.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Frank Amaro","summary":"BORING AND NOTHING","reviewText":"First of all, im a big fan of Resistance series. Part 1 was amazing gameplay and story. Part 2 was amazing graphics and boss fights. Part 3 was so bad, I felt like this was rushed to be on the market. First thing, so many bugs. My PS3 froze couple of times. Its not my PS3. I played Deus Ex and didnt freeze,i played other games in my PS3 and they didnt freeze. I might have a bad copy. Put this one back in, Froze when it went to a cut scene. Second. The Graphics was bad. Even G4 and IGN even said part 2 was a little better. Part 1 and 2 scored higher score than part 3.couple of times i fell through the floor and died. The Story was really bad. If you look at the revolver from part 2 and look at 3, you can see they didnt even care about details in the graphics. You can tell they rushed this game. You have to pay to play online.I got mine used. Are you kidding me. Part 1 and 2 was FREE.They really thought this game was going to be epic LOL.Of the Gameplay was like part 1 or 2 then yeah, this game was so easy to beat on the hardest gameplay. Every time it went to a cut scene took a while or skip bad.When Joe kid \"jack said\", \"DADDY\" sound like man midget who said that,i see they didnt care about voice acting or paying a kid,a real kid to say that line. they could of spend a little more time on this game and came out with a little better story and graphics.The story didnt even expand what you already know from part 1 and 2. The sad part they couldnt tell the story of the whole aliens from outer space and coming back to earth from a long time ago. They had to put the story in book picking up in the game. SO if you didnt collect all the books, you never know the back story to the aliens.I felt like I was playing SIDE MISSIONS to get to the end of the game, For the last Resistance game they could of did CGI instead of crapy art at the credits,This game could of been GOLD like God Of WAR 3. But they did a crapy game. EVEN in Superhuman mode was easy.This wasnt a story, was side quests. The real story was in books if you collect them all in the game. I will sell this and just keep 1 and 2. They were great. I thought having a big ammo BAR was really dumb. I wouldnt mind if they took 1 more year to touch this game up and did a better story. WHat a waste of $65. RENT THIS GAME DONT BUY. If you play part 1, the story went deep. Part 2 was short but the boss battles was amazing. Part 3 lacked, Story,gameplay,Boss Battles. I really loved the Hammer. To bad they didnt put it in the start of the game. The Prison was a waste of Time in my opinion.I was hoping they would of had a big cut scene of the story how they came to earth and why they left. In my opinion the best part of the game was 2 things, Letting us know what happen to Nathan Hale after he died, and the second, The ending with you hanging down with your handgun going crazy like a cowboy. The Boring part was the prision. They could of left that part out and took that time to make one hell of a ending.Come on people. YOu have to admit the ending ws crap and the story was as well. All i wanted was a Great ending to this series and one hell of a Story of thier back ground, Instead i got a back ground of a prison and a missing husband of a godly women whos been praying for a fighter to arrive at her town. IM NOT MAD. I ENJOY THE GAMEPLAY I HAD FUN. IN MY OPINION THEY COULD OF DONE SO MUCH MORE. GO OUT LIKE GOD OF WAR 3, GEARS OF WAR 3, LOOK AT METAL GEAR SOLID 4 JESUS THAT WAS A EPIC GAME. IM NOT SAYING BE THAT LONG OF A GAME OR GRAPHICS. MAKE THE LAST GAME BAD ASS SO EVERYONE WILL TALK ABOUT IT, INSTEAD IM TELLING PEOPLE DONT BUY IT. I LIKE THIS GAME I HAD FUN. SO IM NOT SAYING THIS GAME SUCKS. THIS GAME COULD OF HAD SO MUCH MORE DONE TO THIS.Let get this straight. I know they had an extra year to work on this. But honestly, your saying this was a GREAT STORY and GREAT GRAPHICS for this Generation. This game was so buggy. My PS3 froze and I let my friend use this, he gave it back to me.His Ps3 froze when he was playing this. Its the game that needs to fix. I dont care they had 3 years. This game looks bad. Stop lying to yourself saying this game is great. Im sorry, If IGN and G4 says the same things almost all of the players who played this game. Maby all you guys lying to yourself.If you can't read this review, You are the dumbest person alive.

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"The Fall of Man","reviewText":"One thing is for sure: Resistance 3 is at minimum as much fun to play as Resistance 1. And it's a dramatic improvement over some of the major disappointments that Resistance 2 brought: 1) R2 campaign was too short and R3's campaign is about as long as R1; 2) R2 was too easy and R3 is challenging on normal difficulty and a beast on hard; and 3) most importantly, R3 brings back campaign co-op play...R2 had co-op but it was special mission co-op, not campaign co-op.The R3 story isn't quite as well written as R1 was, but it's still good. The campaign consists of chapter after chapter of exhilarating battles against a plethora of creatures that you use a plethora of weapons to defeat (and the enemy will use most of them against you too) as you trek across country to New York. Remember in R1 you could carry every weapon that you came across in the game? And remember they eliminated that in R2 allowing you to carry only two weapons at a time? Well it's back to R1's way of thinking which is good and bad: good because, well, you have the best weapons at all times (as long as you've saved some ammo) to apply to enemies that certainly are easier to defeat if you've got the appropriate weapon in your hands; bad because 1) it's unrealistic to be able to carry so many weapons and 2) on the initial playthroughs you bring up your weapons menu and there are so many weapons to choose from you could get destroyed before you make your decision; the game does not pause when you're picking a weapon!You also get several mean weapons that are new to R3. Most of the weapons have an alternate fire that's extremely powerful and effective. Use it!...but use it only in dire situations like on groups because the alternate fire is often very limited. One or two of the guns had infinite ammo on the alternate trigger, but those were usually less powerful and effective.Grenades are key to survival, but you'll want to keep in mind that you can run out real real fast...so use them pretty much exclusively to take down groups of enemies or bosses.Part of the fun of this game is figuring out on your own how to get from chapter to chapter. There are no maps, which at times was frustrating. Let me tell you that if the phrase \"the best route is not always the most obvious\" ever applied to trying to get from here to there it applies in this game on more than one occasion.For me, perhaps the only disappointing feature of R3 is the health system. In R1 everyone who's played it will recall the annoying system of having to find health serums throughout the game. R2 moved to a more Call of Duty like system where finding cover immediately starts replenishing your health. R3 is back to finding serum jars throughout the game. Although, now that I think of it, this probably contributed heavily to how much easier R2 seemed than R1. The good part about co-op play is if you run out of health your partner can revive you within 30 seconds of being taken down. This saved me a lot of back to the last checkpoint restarts!Multiplayer is very cool, but it's pretty much the same FPS shooter stuff that's in any Call of Duty game. Different guns, different maps and different skins, but same old same old. For me Resistance 3's real fun and challenge is in the single player or co-op Campaign Mode.As a final side note, Resistance 3 has an M (mature gamers only) rating which miffs me a bit, but then I'm a bit more liberal when it comes to what I think might warp the little minds of kids these days. I've seen this classified as a Horror title, but I think that Sci-fi Action is much more fitting. Resistance deserved a T (teen) rating. R3 does have some creepy moments, but nothing I saw warranted an M rating.By now, as long as you've played at minimum Resistance 1 which I'd HIGHLY recommend, you know what you're up against. It's the Chimeran invasion. Where exactly did they come from? If you're up to the challenge to find out, you're the guy that shot R1 & R2's hero Nathan Hale, and you're now leading The Resistance to prevent the Fall of Man. Prepare for some serious battle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

Therefore, expectations were very high for Mass Effect 2, and most pleasantly, this game exceeds the first in just about every conceivable way!  Bioware has truly outdone themselves in fleshing out the Mass Effect universe and in creating a cast of characters that truly have a life of their own.The game starts out with a bang, in the form of a jaw-dropping opening sequence that had me staring at the screen in disbelief.  The story gets better from there as we're introduced to the Illusive Man (played expertly by Martin Sheen) and get familiar with working for the Cerberus organization.  What follows is roughly 30-40 hours of sci-fi perfection.  In what is probably a first in gaming, your choices and decisions that were made in the first Mass Effect carry over into this game (using your completed save file from the first game), noticeably molding the state of the universe.  This is astounding.  Characters that died in the first game are remembered, your love interests from the first game act accordingly when you meet them in this game, and the attitude of the characters reflect what you allowed or disallowed in the first game.  It's truly remarkable, considering all the variables from the first game.  If you never played the first game, or never finished it, the game defaults to a standard set of circumstances.  But to know that you had a direct impact on how your Mass Effect 2 experience rolls out is a wonderful thing.  Plus, throughout Mass Effect 2, you make several key decisions which you know are gonna come back to haunt you in the inevitable Mass Effect 3!Gameplay-wise, it's important to point out that the RPG elements of the first game have been drastically scaled back.  Gone is the micromanaging of weapon upgrades, omni-gel, and the detailed leveling up mechanics that the first game relied on.  When a character gains a level, you can only upgrade one of four attributes.  Weapons are upgraded using a simple system where you can level up only their general effectiveness, with no options.  While this may turn off some of the fans, I personally found this change to be a wholly welcome one.  It streamlines the game so you can concentrate on the action.  And this leads me to another gameplay change.  Missions are more shooter-based than they were in the first game.  A very effective cover mechanic has been introduced and aiming and shooting is more fluid and responsive.  Basically, though I hate to say it, it's reminiscent of Gears of War.  The overall mission structure, however, is just like in the first game, so it definitely still has the feel of Mass Effect.  Returning from the first game is the dialog wheel, only this time it's more interactive and is designed to make the dialog flow smoothly.  It works flawlessly and you feel more engaged in the conversations than ever!Mass Effect 2 is more of a character piece than the first game.  The number of playable characters doubles from that of the first game, but unlike that game, you have to make the characters loyal to you lest you suffer the consequences.  This, in my opinion, is where the game falters a bit.  The main story really only encompasses 4 or 5 missions.  The rest are made up of \"loyalty missions\", which are basically requests for help that your squad members ask of you.  They have nothing to do with the main story, though they do serve as excellent backstory for your comrades.  So essentially you do a mission to recruit a character, and then do their loyalty mission.  This results in a rather disjointed experience since you can only partake in the main story (which is nothing short of excellent) in only small bursts.  This is kind of a double-edged sword though, since by the end of the game where you must select team members to perform certain tasks, you really feel like you know them well.  Not since Final Fantasy VII have I felt so familiar with the characters in a game.  The loyalty missions aren't bad, I just wish they were more integrated with the game's overall story.It's probably a no-brainer that anyone who liked the first Mass Effect probably already got the second one.  But if you haven't played either game, I strongly suggest you play the first one first.  It's a wonderful thing to shape your own game experience, and I wouldn't want anyone to miss out on that!  Mass Effect 2 is definitely one of the best games of 2010, and probably the best on Xbox 360 for sure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2010"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story.

Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom.

They don't run away and camp and snipe me and shotgun me like everyone does in multi-player.

Thereare items to find throughout the games such ashealth drinks, first aid kits, many weapons andammo for them as well as melee weapons whichdon't require ammo.The town of Silent Hill has many areas to explore thoughon a somewhat liner but thrilling path.  Areas includevarious outdoor locations, an apartment complex, anabandoned hospital, Silent Hill Historical Society,Tulca Prison, The Lakeview Hotel and a few otherlocations  including nightmare/alternate versionsof said areas and locations. You also have a mapbut can only see it if you have access to light or aflashlight.James has a flashlight he will get eventually as wellas a radio.

{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Big and Good!!!","reviewText":"Although this isn't how I like my women, Big and Good is what you want for an action RPG!Story: 9/10The world was developed by famed fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore, the creator of Drizzt!  The world is incredibly deep and full of rich lore, loosely based on Celtic mythology and folklore.  In the world of Amalur, everyone is a slave to their fate.  Whether you were predestined to die a peasant or save the world, there's no escaping your destiny... Until your character rises from the dead, and became fateless.  Could this lead into a golden age of freedom or are you a pawn in a much larger, darker, game?Graphics: 7/10The graphics are similar to World of Warcraft.  There is lots of style in the world and architecture, so it feels cohesive.  The colors are saturated and the shapes are somewhat cartoonish.  I really dislike the cartoony look of the game because it breaks immersion.  If you like the WoW look, then you'll enjoy this game's visuals.  There are barren wastelands, lush forests, castles, towns, dungeons, and ancient ruins.Gameplay: 9/10This is an Action RPG with the emphasis on Action.  Basically, the game works like this:  Find a town, get some quests, mark them as active, track them down on your map, and complete them for Gold and XP.  This isn't a completely open ended world.  Instead, there are large areas and dungeons separated by relatively short loading screens.  There are Main Quests, which advance the story, Faction Quests which are side story based quests and deal with the fate of a group, and random quests that you find just about everywhere.  You get a quest journal where the quests are separated by type and text explaining what you need to do.  It's incredibly clear and they're easy to find on the main map.You also get lots of freedom in this game.  Defeat enemies with combat, magic, stealth, persuasion...  There really is only one way through the game, but you are free to steal, assault, and murder NPC's.  If you do, the guards show up and demand payment.  If you do not pay, they throw you in prison where you can wait out your sentence or try to escape.  Once you pay or get out of jail, your record is cleared and you are not wanted for any crimes.  This isn't the type of game where your reputation follows you.  Being fateless has its advantages.Combat: 9/10You have 70 inventory slots to start with, and you can buy more at stores.  You can equip two weapons at a time, and 4 Special Abilities.  The X button uses 1 weapon and the Y button uses the other.  There are special moves by holding down buttons or pausing in between the moves of the combos.  So, X, X, X, X is one combo where X, Pause, X, X, would be another.  The weapons and abilities that you choose are up to you.The Abilities are mapped to the face buttons: A, B, X, Y.  You bring up your Abilities List by holding LT, and pressing the appropriate button.  Some abilities are quick acting, like Lightning Bolt, some are constant but drain a percentage of your total mana like Shield, and some provide special gameplay like 'Backstab unwary enemy for a ton of damage.'Defensively, you can dodge with a diving roll, block a % of damage with a shield, or parry with your shield at the right time to knock an enemy off balance, allowing you an opening for a combo.  The Shield magically appears in your hand when you press the Block button so you can dual wield AND use a shield, which is nice.You usually fight 1 to 7 enemies in the game.  There are melee guys that charge you and ranged enemies that launch arrows or spells from a distance.  There are humanoid rogues, mages, warriors, and a large assortment of beasts.Health and Mana potions are mapped to the D-Pad and you can instantly activate them without a sluggish \"Drink Potion\" animation that often gets you killed in lesser games.As far as RPG combat goes, this one has lots of depth.Level Up: 10/10This is the most open ended level up system that I've ever seen in a game.  Because your character can defy fate in the story, you are free to shuffle your Attributes and Abilities at any time.  If you're a Fighter with a warhammer and a greatsword, and you want to change things up, you can.  Just see a Fate Weaver, pay some gold, and Whamo!  You can reassign all of your Attribute Points any way you want.  Now you can be a Sorcerer, a Rogue, or a Mix of any of the three classes.  It's completely up to you.  The game keeps track of how many ability points you have in each Class's Skill Tree and generates class names with predefined bonuses.  So, if you are playing as a Rogue / Mage, you can unlock the Class Warlock and get damage bonuses to your magic and piercing weapons!Any time you Level Up, you also get a Skill Point that you can put on any crafting skill.  These are separate from your 3 Attribute Points you get when you Level Up.  Your Skills can be applied to crafting, persuasion, stealth, lockpicking, detect hidden, mercantile, or dispel magical wards.  All of these skills are beneficial, too.  If you load up on Detect Hidden, enemies, chests, hidden loot, shrines, etc... will show up on your mini-map.  If you load up on Mercantile Skills, you'll get better prices at stores and you can destroy excess items in your inventory for cash!  These Skill Points also get reset when you see a Fate Weaver, so you're free to try out all of the skills.I did try all of the skills and at first, I had lots of points on alchemy and blacksmithing.  This game has potions for boosting any stat you can think of.  You can also craft gems for socketed items to boost the power of the item or even craft your own weapons.  To craft weapons, you find parts like hilts, blades, wraps, rivets, armor...  Depending on your skill, you can combine 2-5 parts.  If you want to make a sword, you have a Hilt, a Blade, and up to 3 additional slots.  The additional slots are for extra effects and damage.  You can create a longsword that does 25 damage, 25 fire damage, regenerates 1 HP per second, and adds 45 to your Mana.  What you create depends on the parts that you find.  You can also salvage any gear you have for its parts.Unfortunately, after spending lots of time on alchemy and smithing, I realized that there really wasn't any need for them.  The loot drops and loot from chests were really good.  I ended up putting all of my points on Mercantilism and just bought great weapons and armor at great prices.Exploration: 8/10The world is huge and there are dungeons and quests everywhere.  Around every corner, there are ambushers, people who need help, dungeons, ruins, etc...  There's also hidden loot stashed in chests, locked chests, magically sealed chests, tree trunks, and rock piles all over the world.  Locked and sealed chests can be opened with a Lockpicking or dispelling mini-game.  Failing lockpicking just breaks your lock pick.  Failing a dispelling curses you with some sort of stat loss.  Curses can be removed by healers in towns.  To keep things moving, you can fast travel to any location where you've already been.  The Exploration in this game is streamlined and rewarding!Maturity: TeenThis is a  high fantasy adventure game.  There's some cartoony blood, fantasy violence, cartoony monsters, etc...  There's no sex, romance, or swearing.Replay Value: ???The game is about 25-50 hours long, depending on how many side quests you do, but since you can change classes and abilities any time you want, there really is no reason to start over and replay the game from the beginning.  After you finish the game, you're free to keep exploring the massive world and complete quests.  If you never played as a rogue and want to try it out just change classes and keep playing.  So, there really isn't \"replay value\" but there is a lot of value in the main quest.  If you do a decent amount of side quests, you will level up pretty high and the game will feel too easy.  At any point, you can change the difficulty level.It's strange.  The main story is only composed of 14 quests.  In a game where you have well over 100 quests and little replay value, it would have been much better if the main story was longer and was more difficult as you progressed through it.Overall: 8.5/10This is a very huge and flexible game with a good story and deep lore.  If you're a fan if high fantasy and like real combat in your RPG's, and don't mind the cartoony graphics, then you should enjoy this game.Buy it if you like long action RPG's.Buy it if you love high fantasy.Buy it if you like fairly easy games.Rent it if you have at least 20 hours to blow through the main quests.Avoid it if you hate WoW style graphics and prefer realism.If you liked this game, there are plenty of others in the action / RPG genre.  Witcher 2, Skyrim, Oblivion, Mass Effect, Fallout, Dragon's Dogma, Red Dead Redemption, and Assassin's Creed 2 or 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"General Pete","summary":"Its really difficult to articulate my feelings on this","reviewText":"When this game sticks to homages of the first two games it works out just fine some of the old favorites like Wrex, Thane, Conrad are back even if it is for a brief period of time.However when the game tried new things at this late stage of the game they didn't really translate well.  Take for example the Mako from the first game now it couldn't steer worth a darn but it did at least give the impression that you were operating over a wide planetary service.  Personally I always liked it but they had to change it up for the 2nd game and introduced the probe which wasn't a bad concept just a monotonous one.  This idea was largely scrapped the third go around and while the probes were kept the scanner was also introduced so you knew that a planet you detected a signal on would contain a war resource.  This is where things started to break down for me there was not even the cursory inclusion of a random cut scene where the Normandy contacts one desperate band of survivors holding out against the Reapers against all odds I could have understood that at least.  No one we got was the Mass Effect equivalent of searching the Galaxy for Pokemon cardsMany little things like that hobbled the game for me and washed out what have always been the better aspects of the game the voice acting and the story.  Another change that was made was that I felt most of the sidequest opportunities that gave one the ability to experience the Mass Effect Universe were sidetracked for the larger Reaper threat which doesn't really work in terms of character development because we've known the Reapers game from the beginning the destruction of all organic life there isn't really all that more that can be done with that.  I also have to say something regarding the multiplayer which wasn't as terrible as I had feared and in some instances was quite fun but still left much to be desired it wasn't even technically it was co-op where you and a bunch of guys fight waves of a given enemy.  If I had been given an opportunity to fight as a Korgen Battlemaster against an Assari biotic that might have actually been interesting.Overall-I'm not going to comment on the ending because plenty of others have done that  I find it hilarious that EA found the reaction of the majority of the fanbase negative to say the least to be a complete shock.  It is hilarious to see a company which almost never addresses Customer Service concerns offering content for free as a goodwill gesture.

It's an exceptional WWII FPSJaw dropping graphics (that don't crush the average players system), the ability to be infantry of various unique types, then jump in any one of numerous vehicles, then jump into any number of different aircraft.  Totally flexible, insanely fun, very popular too (good for multiplayer gaming).2.  It's an even better modern-day-warfare FPS!What you say!  Yep, Battlefield 1942 has the most popular &quot;mod&quot; (game modification, meaning the game has been redesigned around a new theme, etc..) of 2003; Desert Combat.  Desert Combat uses the same fantastic engine as 1942 but is set in modern time.  Helicopter Gunships, SCUD missile launchers, A-10 Tank Killers dropping naughty explosive goodness!!!!  Why am I writing this review, I should be playing!Ok, once you own the game, you can go to [...] to download the free mod for it.Hope this review was helpful.Enjoy...!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}

Every bit as hard core, but the menus are easy to navigate, and the story is not quite as abstract.  Don't get me wrong, you still probably won't get the story fully, it's a JRPG.  That being said, this games battle mechanics are amazing, as long as you play as the warrior class.  The battles are epic, and grand.  I made a big mistake at the ending of the main game, and some day I'll have to start over, though.  SPOILER ALERT:  When you finish the main game, you can choose to become a god.  IF you make that choice, you cannot RTe-enter the game to play the dark arisen content.  You will have to start over, from the begining, and you won't be leveled up enough to handle the tougher monsters in the DLC content.

After replacing 3 hard drives because of forced restarts this company failed in trying to make the product work instead of a deadline and having a lot of negative feedback that drove people to go to games like Bioshock or Mass Effect 3. The story is cool and like about Fallout 3 , it was a original idea and had some cool backgrounds on the events and characters within the game. But the undertone of homosexuality in some of the characters took me off the game story line as not important to the events in New Vegas , the question is Why put it there? Political or social problems in the game designers lives? So that was a factor for me in one of many issues in the game , and it's bad enough the game promotes violence for one , but it's moral content of homosexuality is a bit far. As for the game , graphics is fine , but needs way more options to make it more real , Bioware is close with Dragon's Age 2. Freeze ups and glitches pretty much ruined it for me , it took 8 profiles to get all achevements and took 11 to finish the game because of code error in the profiles from all the force rebooting the PS3.Overall a 1 , i would give less if i could , and rest assured this company has lost another costumer period.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

I was never the biggest fan of Morrowind, I just couldn't get into it as much. I do own the game but I never got much out of it. When I picked up Oblivion, it was totally different and GREAT. A great RPG game.The graphics in this game are amazing point blank. If your out in the wilderness, and just look out really far everything is REALLY detailed, the people are detailed, and everything little thing you can think of is. The company really put time into the graphics, so fans of graphics will love this game.The sound, is really good throughout the game. It sets the tone for everything going on, even though it gets in the way sometimes while talking I have the music turned off so all I  hear is what im doing or people. But it has a good tone for the music.The controls are GREAT. The fighting with swords, bow control everything is good and controlled well. The use of magic is easy, overall the controls are set great and I havent had an issue with it yet.The fun factors of this game are crazy. Unless you play this game all day everyday, it will take you a WHILE to beat it. There are a bunch of things you can do in this game. Like, raid dungeons, kill bandits, steal items from them and so on. You can just roam the whole Cyrodill and find hidden places. There is a \"main quest\" in the game, which is the main storyline.  It has a great concept, but is kinda short 2 me, but thats ONLY the main quest. There are so many other quests out there its crazy. There is a Dark Brotherhood group you can join (my personal favorite), Theives Guild (which has great benefits), Fighters Guild (good for building fame), Mages  Guild (good for magic). Then after finishing all those side quests, you can do miscellaneous quests, like for single people and so on. A lot of them are fun and can benefit you in certain ways.One thing I found fun was getting your \"sneak\" level up, by doing this it makes it REALLY easy for you to pickpocket people, and also steal from stores easier. You can do this to get extra GOLD etc, but i'd recommend doing Theives Guild quests before doing so so you can sale them the stolen items (basically the only ones that will buy it from you). Once you get your player to a LEVEL 10, go to the NOCTURNAL SHRINE and to the quest, by finishing this you will get the SKELETON KEY which will allow you do open ANY chest, door, or anything locked without the risk of breaking pick locks :-). Also, the variety of the type of character you can choose is NICE, you can choose from a variety of different races, with different skills and attributes. Right now my person is a Dark Elf (pretty good to start with I think).Overall, I highly reccomend this game to any RPG fans, and any people that love long games with a high amount of variety!Peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2006"}

At first I thought It was my age, mid thirties; and with so much gaming under my belt I just figured I was just burned out along with the end of a console generation. I'd get a new game I was somewhat excited about but no matter how bad or good it was, I just couldn't finish it most of the time and few could hold my attention, except a select handful(Borderlands 2, AC3, Halo 4, BF3)..okay enough ramble....Huge spaces, with tons of actors on stage of the war theater.

I just couldn't believe that lighting and textures can look so natural and appealing. new guns are so handy and useful while the old ones are lovely still.Campaign is still fast and frantic now allowing custom loadouts and a not so linear story. You also compete for high score in campaign as well.Controls Are crisp and smooth and as always the top notch campaign story you have come to know from The Series.Enough twists and turns to keep anyone entertained.Sounds are greatly impressive from BlackOps 1..Multiplayer----Only few games in and considering the amount of people playing. Not ONE laggy game.. wish could say that about MW3...As someone who was not a fan of MW3, BO2 does a lot of things right.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Prepare for Really Long Cutscenes","reviewText":"The final installment of Hideo Kojima's \"Metal Gear\" series has a lot to live up to. Besides its innovations in gameplay, Metal Gear Solid 4 has to worry about wrapping up and connecting the stories of 5 different Metal Gear games. As such, this long-awaited finale has its work cut out for it, but does it pull it off?The story in this game is all but impenetrable if you haven't played every other game in the series, including the PSP-only Portable Ops. The game relies heavily on references and flashbacks from old games to tell its story, drawing from every other game to wrap up the series as a finished product. As a result, people who haven't played any of the games in the series before would do well to avoid the game and perhaps get the MGS Essential Collection for the PS2 first.The new theme in this Metal Gear Solid game is \"the battlefield\". Working against mercenaries employed by various Private Military Companies, you attempt to sneak (or fight) through warzones as the PMCs engage rebel and militia forces. Instead of the simpler and quieter job of sneaking through areas where your enemies are not engaged, you must instead brave gunfire from either side and avoid being detected. In many areas it's possible to aid the rebels by attacking PMCs; since the PMCs are always your enemies, it's useful to have people on your side who are fighting them. Doing so will make the rebels friendly to you and make your job easier. If you choose to attack the rebels, or not fight the PMCs, you'll have a tough time moving through rebel-controlled areas as well as PMC-controlled areas because both sides will be hostile towards you. Your participation in the battle is not required, though depending on your style of play, the game may get easier or harder depending on how you \"use\" the rebels. There are many pitched battles in the game, often involving armored vehicles and heavy weapons being used by both sides, with artillery raining down from above. Atmospherically, these sections definitely have the feel of a dangerous warzone, where any cover can be destroyed and an ambush can come from any side.Your main tool to avoid enemies is OctoCamo. A development of the camouflage system in MGS3, OctoCamo blends in automatically with any background you press against, granting you near-invisibility in almost any setting. Defeating the game's first boss grants you a mask addition that allows you to either camouflage your face (increasing your invisibility even further) or put on masks of human faces to use as disguises (it's purely a cosmetic change, though). Furthermore, there are certain uniforms that allows you to blend in with the crowds of militiamen and rebels and reduces the likelihood that Snake will personally be spotted. It also makes an ally out of any rebels that you happen to meet, since they assume you're on their side.Another item introduced in the game is the Solid Eye, a multipurpose \"eyepatch\" that allows you an extra heads-up display over your regular one. This HUD highlights items for you to collect, adds informative statistics to NPCs within range (specifically things like their mental status, health, and how they feel about you).  Furthermore, it also includes a binocular and night-vision/thermal vision mode, both of which are useful at spotting enemies at long range.There are two \"health\" bars in the game - the first represents physical health, while the second represents your state of mind. Being in stressful situations, such as being pursued, being shot at, or having killed a lot of enemies, will raise your stress a great deal and lower your state of mind. The lower your \"psyche\" bar is, the less accurately you will shoot, and furthermore Snake will breathe heavily and move sluggishly. The health bar is restored by items like rations, while the psyche bar is recovered either through certain food items or by staying out of combat for a certain amount of time to gather your wits. The Psyche bar may be a relatively annoying development, based on how you play; if you are a gung-ho soldier who intends to run around and shoot everything, then the psyche bar will hinder you fairly often. If you avoid combat, move slowly, and don't get caught in major fights, it isn't much of a problem.Weapons in this game are handled differently than previous games. In the past, weapons had to be found \"clean\" - you couldn't take weapons from enemies, but instead had to find them in certain areas at different parts of the game. In MGS4, a new character called Drebin is introduced. Drebin is a gun launderer - in exchange for \"Drebin Points\" accumulated by selling him weapons found on the battlefield, Drebin will remove the personal ID of any gun you find, which will allow you to use the formerly locked weapon. He will also sell you guns and ammo directly, though this tends to be more expensive. The sheer number of weapons is far greater than any other Metal Gear game: pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles are all included in the game's arsenal. The weapons in this game are in many cases customizable with a variety of items, including scopes, silencers, grips, laser sights, flashlights, and a wide variety of ammunition, both lethal and non-lethal. The effect of both the shop and the number of available weapons is to remind you that you are in a warzone, not a clean sneaking environment. As such, combat is often much more frantic and intense, and justifies the use of an RPG or a guided anti-tank missile.The new gameplay and controls in the game have mostly been improved. Instead of previous MGS games' overhead camera, MGS4 allows either an auto-aim or a third person over-the-shoulder shooting scheme. The option for first person also exists, using scopes or iron sights. The over-the-shoulder camera should be familiar to anyone who's played Resident Evil 4, and is one of the most helpful additions, gameplay-wise, to the game. Snake can aim either from the right or from the left, which helps when peeking out around corners. The controls are different, but primarily intuitive. The option exists to press against certain walls, either to hide out of someone's line of sight or to blend in with OctoCamo. This also allows for the ability to lean out into doorways to shoot at enemies, a refined version of the ability used in MGS2 and MGS3.In less gun-related combat, CQC has been brought over from MGS3, and for the most part it is the same. For some reason, it feels less smooth in operation, however. The option to hold enemies at gunpoint if they are caught unaware has been upgraded; instead of the somewhat nonsensical \"point your gun at enemies and they will shake items out of their bodies\" that previous games had, MGS4 goes with a more realistic \"body check\" as Snake pats down his enemies for weapons and ammunition. CQC and holding enemies up both can cause enemies to drop their weapons, unlike in previous games where enemies would hold on to their rifles and riddle you with bullets as soon as you dropped your guard. The items all feel much more realistic, and there are no more \"floating item boxes\". Some items are still contained in large boxes, but at the very least they no longer float and rotate anymore.The main problem with the game, in terms of gameplay, is that there isn't enough of it. The game is divided into five acts. The first two are as I described above: fighting through a warzone populated by PMCs with the help of rebels. However, from the third act onwards, these features disappear. Only the first two acts of the game are really identifiable as \"MGS4\", while the rest is like a different game that uses MGS4's gameplay and engine. Act 3 has you tailing an informant through a PMC-controlled city, Act 4 consists almost entirely of fighting robots and unmanned vehicles, and Act 5 consists of only two areas.For the most part, the game feels like wrestling with the cutscenes and story for control of the game. So many things happen in cutscenes that should have been done as actual gameplay sections. In fact, there are two cutscenes that occur while you are doing a gameplay segment, forcing you to rapidly move your eyes back and forth to the sides of the screen if you want to see what's going on in the cutscene. One character, returned from a previous game as a buffed-up cyborg ninja, has fight scenes that only occur in cinematics, and he never fights alongside you in actual gameplay. The sheer number and length of the cutscenes is overwhelming, as well. Early on I was willing to forgive it because MGS4 did have a lot of loose ends to tie up, but by the end it seems like unnecessary things were added or put in just so it would seem more like a Hollywood-style movie. I beat the game in 20 hours, and I estimate a third or a fourth of that was spent watching cutscenes. To be fair, they are well-directed and good overall, but they're just overwhelmingly long and poorly paced. The ending, for example, takes a good hour to complete, at least. Especially when you consider how many cutscenes would translate fine to regular gameplay, it seems way too excessive.The bosses of the game - the \"Beauty and the Beast\" unit - are also somewhat disappointing. All four are meant to be shadows of earlier bosses - combining the animal names of FOXHOUND from MGS1 with the emotions of the Cobra Unit of MGS3 to create \"Laughing Octopus\", \"Raging Raven\", \"Crying Wolf\", and \"Screaming Mantis\". Out of all of these bosses, only Laughing Octopus is really enjoyable to fight, as she uses a lot of stealth and surprise tactics. The others are just gimmicky fights that tend to be more annoying than fun. The worst part is that these bosses have nothing to do with the storyline other than \"they're an elite unit under the bad guy's control\".The graphics in the game are smooth and effective. The animation, in particular, seems very natural and realistic, with a lot more focus on how people actually move. There's no fault that can be found with the graphics; the characters and environments seem exactly as good and detailed as they need to be, and definitely help keep you immersed. The voice acting is great, with a lot of nostalgic returns from the original Metal Gear Solid's voice crew for characters that are returning in this new game. The music is usually understated, allowing the environmental noises - gunfire, yells, wind, and so on - to take center stage except in situations when Snake has been spotted, when tense and exciting music plays. The quality of the music is excellent, being thematic and evocative for each different area of the game. One of the items is an iPod that allows Snake to play songs that he has collected in the game. Some of these songs actually affect gameplay; certain battle themes will increase Snake's accuracy or health regeneration, while other songs will cause emotions in enemies that Snake has caught in a chokehold (presumably, that's where they have to be so that they are close enough to hear the music).Overall, MGS4 is an incredible game, but there's not enough \"game\" to rate it that highly as a total package. The overwhelming presence of cutscenes was incredibly stifling, and the sections of the game that were working with the established rules of the game were remarkably short. It feels like the game got too caught up in the story and forgot it was supposed to be a game, deciding instead to spend almost all of its time expounding on philosophy and history from previous Metal Gear games. There were a lot of really good sections, but these were far too short and seemed more like exceptions to the norm. If it was being rated as a movie, it would deserve full marks, but to rate it as a game, it only deserves an 7 or 8 out of 10 at most.UPDATE: The full walkthrough for both the regular and online components of this game are now done. We give the online component a 9/10 rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2008"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Picture is Worth 1000 Words","reviewText":"Last year, Konami released Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow for the Nintendo DS and it was a smash success.  It was one of the best DS games to come around.  Needless to say Portrait of Ruin has a lot to live up to.  It's just as good as Dawn of Sorrow, but it's no where near superior.  Still, it's a really fun game, and Castlevania fans can really enjoy what is destined to be another fantastic 2D side scroller.Portrait of Ruin takes place in the year 1944, in the middle of World War II.  However, the problem isn't the war, but rather that Castlevania has appeared again.  Only this time, a vampire artist named Brauner is controlling the power of the castle with paintings.  As Johnathan Morris and his friend Charlotte Orlean, your job will be to destroy these paintings as well as Brauner and any followers he may have.The game begins with you entering Castlevania, and you're able to explore the castle as you like in the metroid style way that's been around since Symphany of the Night, and the exploration is complete with warps and hidden walls.  However, in exploring, there's a twist this time.  As you roam through the castle, you'll come across paintings.  When you do come across a painting, it's your job to jump inside and go through the particular area it takes you to.  This new aspect is fun simply for the fact that it means there is more exploration to be done in this Castlevania than previous entries.  Not only must you explore the castle, but several different paintings as well.  This really adds a lot of variety to the setting.  The first painting is a city, for example, and you'll soon find yourself exploring the desert as well as other areas.The games environments look spectacular.  More detail is given to the backgrounds this time around, some effects being rendered in 3D.  They look pretty cool.  The game sports quite a bit of detail.  Some of the enemies look really good too.  There are over 100 enemies in Portrait of Ruin and some of them look absolutely stunning, especially some of the bosses you'll be fighting.  Needless to say, you won't tire of looking at the game any time soon.Portrait of Ruin doesn't use the touch screen for much of anything, though.  Gameplay happens on the touch screen but unlike Dawn of Sorrow, you'll never have to use your stylus, and that's fine with me.  The map is also displayed on the top screen at all times, much like it was in Dawn of Sorrow.  This means no more toggling between the map and gameplay.An interesting tweak to the gameplay is that you are now in control of two characters as opposed to one.  Johnathan and Charlotte.  Both characters are not the same, however, so don't expect that you'll never change.  Johnathan uses a whip and can use sub weapons such as knives while Charolotte specializes in several different types of magic.  As you progress through the game you'll run into a variety of enemies, some of which can only be killed with a specific character.You can switch characters at any time, but you can also call your partner into battle for some assisstance.  The AI will control whichever character you are not controlling.  Also, when you call on your partner, the MP guage will become their life guage.  If they take too much damage they'll be dismissed.  The good news, however, is that your MP refills as you walk around so even if they're taken out it won't be long before you can call on them again.The game is filled with puzzles to progress further, and you will indeed need both characters to go about some of them.  Again, this is unique to the Castlevania experience.  Early in the game, for example, you'll need to have one character stand on top of a statue while the other pushes, and you'll have to switch between them to get it going.Another welcome addition to the gameplay are quests.  Early in the game you'll meet a character named Wind who will send you on quests.  These quests are optional, but doing them nets you rewards such as new techniques or rare items.  There's also a merchant for you to buy goods from.Co-op play is another welcome addition to the game but it's extremely limited.  You can play either with a friend or with anyone from around the world, but you can't go through the main adventure, which is honestly a real drag.  The only thing you can do in co-op mode is fight all the bosses.  It's a boss rush mode with two players... that's it.  It's very disappointing that multiplayer is simply that.  Even worse, you both share a life guage, so if your partner dies, you suffer just as much.  You can find people through Nintendo Wi-Fi, which is really nice.  You can connect with anyone or you can enter a friend code, either way it doesn't matter.Its unfortunate that Boss Rush mode isn't a whole lot of fun, though.  You get rewarded for completing it at least.  However, it would've been far better (and more fun) to go through the adventure mode with a friend.  Instead your limited to boss rush mode.Shopping through the wi-fi network isn't bad, though.  When you connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi you select a monster and then the wi-fi connection seeks out a shop for you.  When you go in, you'll be able to buy items from people.  Likewise, you could set up the wi-fi and then sell items as well.When selling items, however, one has to note that you do not get to choose what price you sell stuff for.  You can only sell it for the price that you could sell it to a normal merchant for.  This means that you can't find a really rare item, and then sell it to your best friend for one cent.  However, to the shopping's credit, if you decide to open up a store and someone buys from you, the item does not disappear from your inventory.  So if you have a really powerful weapon, and your friend buys it, you both can use it.  It's a fun way to find rare items, however the shop your given is completely random (if you decide not to go into a friend's shop).  So there's no guarantee you'll get a good one the first time.Castlevania is known for having some of the best music in gaming.  Portrait of Ruin is no exception.  While it isn't as good as Dawn of Sorrow, it still has a lot of flare and passion that will absorb you.  Many tunes are indeed memorable.  Your characters also grunt when they swing their weapon or take damage.In the end Portrait of Ruin is a great game.  The wi-fi is a little disappointing, but the game as a whole is just a lot of fun to play.  Any Castlevania fan will enjoy it.The Good+2D Sidescrolling is still fun+Plenty of detail to the environments+Sidequests!+Playing as two characters really adds variety to the game+Large game, plenty to explore+The game sounds fantastic+It's got enough variety to make it extremely fun to play+Play co-op with a friend or with anyone around the worldThe Bad-Co-op mode is not as good as expected","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2006"}

In his dreams, happenstance encounters with a young girl facing a terrible destiny and the boy who will fight to save her, leads to Chopin's discovery of the light that shines in each of us in this enduring tale of good and evil, love and betrayal. With gorgeous next gen visuals and style, a unique battle system, and a captivating story, Eternal Sonata promises to give Xbox 360 fans the RPG they've been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Morgan Cahall \"so many books so little time\"","summary":"Eternal Sonata: If they had only stuck to the story...","reviewText":"The story follows the journey of Fredric Chopin as he tries to determine what is real and what is fantasy.  In our world Fredric Chopin lays hours away from death and has fallen in a coma from which he will not awake. The doctor attending solemnly announces that whether he lives or dies now depends on his will to live.The rest of the story follows Chopin's journey as he tries to determine what is real and what is the product of his fevered imagination. In what he thinks of as his dream world he soon comes across a young girl with the ability to use magic.  In this world those that can use magic are shunned because it means that they are close to death.The young girl, Polka, is journeying to the kingdom's capital to make a plea to the ruler to stop making a substance known as mineral powder; a mind numbing, addicting substance.  Soon Chopin and Polka come across others that are on there way to see the ruler of the kingdom for similar reasons. On their way they will travel through vast ruins, deep caves, noxious swamps and other locales.There is only one question for Fredric Chopin though. Is all this a product of his dying body and fevered mind or has he somehow stumbled into a new fantastic world?  What is real?>>>>>>>>>To start I liked this game. I wish more developers and publishers would take a chance on ideas like this, just because it is a bit different that what you normally get in a JRPG game. Oh don't get me wrong it's got all the stuff you expect from the genre, but it does offset it with the history theme and touching on some subjects(nature of reality, addiction, who do you serve and who do you trust, etc) that you don't normally find being addressed in video games. Initially Chopin reminds of a book character called Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever.He's just along for the ride, it doesn't matter what happens because it's all apart of the dream.  Even when something happens that he doesn't like he just assumes it's his subconscious messing with him.  He eventually gets that he is **not** in control and decides to start dealing with things head on.  Then I'm guessing that **maybe** they were trying to show how the mind  distracts itself from things it doesn't want to deal with?I'm still not sure, but now that I have seen the ending I think that's what they were going for. Unfortunately it threw me for enough of a loop that I did not finish the game.  I just couldn't get back into the story after the fight with the king. Saying that I  really do recommend this game to those who like JRPGs, it does have a few hiccups but is one of the more interesting takes on the genre.Save Game: 17 hrs (Game length estimate: 20-25 hrs, its one of the shorter ones, but there is a new game plus)Graphics: Bright and Colorful. With attention to detail. I wish more games understood that having color is OK.Gameplay: The controls worked fine for me. The battle sequences are interesting as your characters have different attacks depending on whether they are on a light or dark part of the map. This is also true of the enemies as some have different forms depending on where they are on the map.Story: See above.Overall: Definitely worth trying,","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

Great Game","reviewText":"Even though i'm just a small way through the game i can say its a heck of a lot of fun. The story is pretty basic, your betrayed by a general, and hunted down by bounty hunters, but there is a bit more. Lots of cut scenes and dialogue also, but once your in the action your in it. Also there is a very easy mode for people like me who don't like dying HA. The game very much reminds you of Quake and Unreal, but the graphics(especially on PC) are far superior. I have an ATI 4850 1gigDDR3, 8 gigs of DDR3, Core 2 Quad 2.67ghz, and the game runs flawless at full 1080p, all high settings. The controls are easy to learn, like most FPS, even when it gets frantic, it's pretty easy to keep your cool even when using the mouse and keys. Aiming is spot on, even if you feel sloppy, i have gotten tons of head shots without even really trying, mega plus. Also the kicking feature, that makes your enemy fly through the air in slow mo while you blow him away is great! I haven't gotten to the point where you get to use the energy pull(with the electrical stream) but i did play the demo 360, so i'm really looking forward to that as well. Hopefully its not to far into the game. I'm writing this early into it because i'm highly impressed, i just like the look, feel, and the cool enemies and new features that the game has. Its very fast, tense, and at times your like whoa, i need a break. Thats what makes Bulletstorm so great thus far, it is what the name says. Oddly enough this game was designed by a girl, she really knew what she was doing.So when i get most of the way or to the end of the game i'll post more, i'm sure my feelings won't change though. Loving every minute of it. Also where are all the PC people, there isn't even any DRM on this one, praise be the chick who backed that up. As long as you have a Games For Windows account your good to go, or just use your xbox live one. So have some fun, blow off some heads, kick some A%%(which is also a trip to do)literally. This game is all about run, gun, fun, and it delivers on all levels. Very adrenaline pumping.Much better than Killzone 3 for PS3, its just more of the same ole, same ole.Next great FPS coming is RAGE...looking forward to that one as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2011"}

As soon as Going Commando game out we grabbed a copy - and have been playing it non-stop ever since! Talk about a great sequel!The plot and gameplay is similar to the first game - you're going from planet to planet, bashing things, gathering up nuts and bolts and finding some INCREDIBLY fun weapons along the way. Even better, if you still have your memory card from the first game, you get to bring in many weapons from that for free.If you didn't play Ratchet &amp; Clank I, I *really* recommend you get it! It should be super-cheap by now and is great fun. It's not required to understand this second game, though.This game is almost like 20 games in one. There are pod-racing like portions where you challenge on faster and faster tracks. There are gladiator arena fighting where you test your strength and endurance. There are spaceship flying sections like Wing Commander where you fly through asteroids and around corners. There are button-combos and logic puzzles and really funny video clips.There are the skill points that you have to guess at and then execute. Each weapon upgrades to a new super version of itself. You really feel like you're making progress as you move through the game, becoming stronger and further along in the plot. Going back to planets is great fun, too, as you find ways to use your new weapons in fun ways.The game is also great on an entire-family sort of way. There's a lot of fun puns that will go right over the heads of the kids, but in general the game can be great fun for everyone. The kids can hand the controller to the adults if they get stuck, and the adults will have just as much fun as the kids did (and may not give the controller back for a while).There's always something fun to do, and if you want a change from what you're doing, just hop into one of the mini-games for a whole different experience. The game can literally go on forever. Highly, highly recommended as a must-have for any PS2!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2003"}

Now that 5 years has rolled around Killzone 2 is considered one of the best FPS games every made and is winning multiple game of the year awards as we speak, and was made the best looking game of all time (during it's release), and looked 100 times better than Halo 3. Not only that but back in 2005 every criticized the game for being pre-rendered because no one thought this kind of stuff could be done on a game console. Even on terms of multi player Killzone 2 really impresses with a strong ranking system, squads, voice chat, clans, and the works.The weakest part of Killzone 2 may be its story and characters. Instead of playing as Templar like the first game you play as Sev and fighting alongside a squad of three Garza, Natko, and Rico (the only one from the original game). The war against the Halghans isn't over so the only option is to storm the Visari Palace and take Visari down once and for all while fighting against a cruel general hellbent on getting the ISA's nuke codes.Not only is the game lacking solid story and characters it is very short. You can beat the game in about 6-8 hours depending on your play style so it will leave you wanting way more. One thing that impressed me a lot was the clever level design: The levels make you really thing about your strategy on how to attack enemies and this includes the weapons as well. Each one is unique and can only be used in certain situations, and there is a smorgasbord of them to boot. You have flamethrowers, rocket launchers, shotgun, and other sorts. Each weapon feels powerful and packs a good punch especially when your shotgun takes off a head at point-blank. You cn mount turrets, and even drive vehicles at a couple of points. Now when it comes to Sixaxis control the game uses it very poorly in only three ways. You can turn valves, set charges, and move the loading screens hologram around. Not very exciting, and I was expecting some pretty good use out of it with an epic game like Killzone 2.If you have a HDTV the game will blow your mind visually and audibly thanks to its impressive next-gen showcase. The graphics are amazing with super high res textures that have never been seen before. This stuff looks like pre-rendered next-gen graphics, but in real-time. While the game doesn't have much color that is ok because there is a distinct art style. There is lots of ambiance on top of all this that makes you feel like you are in a war-torn planet fighting for your race.If there is one thing I absolutely love about this game it is the Helghast design. They are such cool characters with creepy glowing red eyes, raspy voices that are only heard through gas masks, and strange British accents. The gritty art style is great and really fits this type of game despite everyone complaining about next-gen games not having enough color.The multi player is the meat of the game with up to 32 players on each map and everything gets really insane really fast. It takes awhile to get a hang of how everything is done and the fast pace. When I first went online I died about 100 times before I even made my first kill, and no I don't suck. After you get the hang of everything it becomes super addictive and fun. There are plenty of modes from team deathmatch, to search and destroy, and even a king of the kill type game.For people who just got a PS3 for Christmas Killzone 2 is something to really show off to your friends, and with great mutliplayer you can expect lots of hours playing this great next-gen gem.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

In it, you have a character who is not only blessed with a pair of powerful swords, but also is given various powers of the gods. The game is entirely based on Greek Mythological characters. As Kratos, the legendary chosen one, you must make your way through countless obstacles, hordes of amazingly detailed enemies, and stunning landscapes. The controls are easy to adjust to, which makes for great playability, and all the secrets in the game make it worth playing over again. Here's a little breakdown of the key components:GRAPHICS: 10 (out of 10)What can I say? The graphics, simply put, are flawless. The amount of detail, the character design, the art direction, all of this is done to perfection!SOUND: 9The sounds of swords clashing, people screaming, blood gushing, and monsters roaring are all very refreshing music to my ears. The music is very nicely done as well. However, the voice acting is not great. Other than that, it sounds great.ORIGINALITY: 10This is a whole new concept to the action/adventure genre of gaming. Not only are you fighting hordes of monsters in a Castlevania style battle system, but you use various buttons to interact with the backgrounds. Also, the idea of getting magical \"powers of the gods\" is truly a fabulous and unique touch.REPLAY: 8It's a good game to replay, because only at the Spartan (hard) difficulty level can you unlock some secrets.FINAL THOUGHTS:God of War is one of the finest games SCEA has released in a while (even if it's about a year and a half old, that statement still stands strong today). The graphics are so intense that it sometimes looks like you're playing a movie. But the only downside that I can think of is the occasional choppiness in the frame rate...that, and the fact that if you're under the age of 17 this game is ABSOLUTELY NOT for you. It's rated M for just about every reason a game should be rated M: very graphic violence, sexual content and nudity, and graphic language. So parents, keep this in mind.

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"A.

BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"","summary":"Nothing amazing and nothing  new","reviewText":"The more I see games from the far east - the more I agree with Hideo Kojima, when he said \"If you honestly compare Japanese games with Western ones, Japan has lost\". Resident Evil is another example of how you can make a games, which looks great graphically, but is barely playable in terms of controls.To begin with, just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons (or, more like \"push the same button so many times\"): Start, X, X , X, X, X, Down, Down, X, X... Are you freaking kidding me???And it's the same throughout the game: every time you need to go to a next Act, or to restart a game because you got killed, it's a miriad of X pushes. Even to upgrade a weapon you have to push X to select the upgrade, then confirm Upgrade by pushing X again, then confirm the confirmation by pushing X again, then when it's upgraded you have to push X yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed. HOLY COW!!! Who in the hell did come up with this stupidity???Now, I don't know why it was even considered as an option, let alone the ONLY option available, to completely STOP a player in his/her place to shoot and even to reload a gun. But it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot, unable to handle more than one task at a time: you can either move, or you can shoot, or you can reload your gun, but never the combination of moving and one of the other two.Aiming is also weird: while you're rooted in place, you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends, which is nearly impossible without a full (stereo) 3D, because you can't really tell how far it ends, because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen (not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aim).The control scheme is the worst of all games in the world. I've complained on bad controls in other games, of course, but nothing comes close to RE5 in this regard: I doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to come.As far as the storyline is concerned - it's japanese, so it's all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted, just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the West. I know some people might like it, so take this as my personal opinion :)All in all, the controls completely ruined the game for me. The graphics are amazing (although the PS3 version, as usual, have gotten a shorter end of a stick, with jaggies appearing/disappearing all the time because of the \"dynamic\" antialiasing, framerate drops, which also causes control lagginess, and many other graphical compromises here and there that have already been mentioned by the [...] reviewers.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2009"}

Peavey","summary":"Super Mario 64 Adventure","reviewText":"Super Mario 64 one of the greatest games for N64.Story/Plot: the Story begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.Gameplay: Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink \"peace-loving\" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible. The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.The gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 1.Power ups: Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario's abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.Abilities: Mario can wall jump, long jump, and many more.Music: the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage. In short Super Mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect.This game is a must get in your video game collection. This game also started the trend where super games have 64 in their name for example Donkey Kong 64 Super Mario Kart 64 Pilotwings 64 and Super Man 64.Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Music 5/5 Powerups 5/5 Overall 10/10 = A+","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

The game features Dolby Digital sound, comprehensive voice acting, and a completely original soundtrack.","reviewerName":"Mithlas","summary":"Dungeons and Disappointments","reviewText":"Some reviewers loved all Balder's Gate-related phenomena, I personally thought the story was shallow and lacked anything to really define motivation. Ostensibly \"to let the player be the character\", your character instead comes across as a vapid individual who has no personality or real lines. Some people liked the \"twist\" of getting caught up in a plot with magi and demons, but I found it more like an accident and never felt a compelling reason to continue beyond \"I haven't beaten the game yet\". Castle of the Winds, a now-freeware game for Windows 95 did a better job of getting an adventurer to set out on a dangerous quest.Story: 5/10If you've played PS1 or PS2-launch titles, you're not far from what you'll see here. The scenery looks nice, but character models are unimaginative and relatively bland. While your appearance changes based on armor, it's not a drastic change and the benefits of new equipment aren't much different than \"a new coat of paint\". The camera is fixed at a slightly offset top-down that generally doesn't hide obstacles but also doesn't give you a satisfying way to navigate. The lack of differentiation between non-interactive terrain dressing and potentially useful objects like item boxes is also unhelpful. Not terrible, but the lack of distinction brought the score down.Graphics: 5/10Unexceptional sounds at best, some were annoying. Volume can't be controlled in-game, and the voicing ranged from \"bad rivaling cheap kung-fu dubs\" to \"modestly compelling\", with most of it being unimaginative and repetitive - particularly the shops, who won't shut up while you're trying to shop.Sound: 4/10Little actually stood out, but after having been through soundtracks like .Hack//G.U. or Ace Combat 5, I expect music that won't be missed in an empty elevator.Music: 5/10A very basic \"dungeon crawler\", I feel that calling it a hack-and-slash does a disservice to action games like Gauntlet orDynasty Warriors: Strikeforcethat do that subgenre justice. Enemies are difficult - you may like or dislike this - but they don't respawn, so if you want to practice or level grind, you have to save character data and start a new game, then import. Random drops and inconsistent ability - enemies tended to hit every swing even if they weren't at optimal range, whereas everything from bows to great swords to daggers had a tendency to miss - not dodged, but simply doing nothing. The fact that everything has a single swing as its whole moveset was especially disappointing, at least Gauntlet had reverse-strokes instead of the same chop time after time.Gameplay: 4/10You can import character data into any game load that you please, but as awkward as the game felt to play through in the first place and as miniscule as the benefits of revisiting an area are (especially with the steps you have to take), I just can't in good conscience recommend this when there are so many other games that actually let you have fun throughout, and then games like Ratchet & Clank let you cruise back through the story with all the goodies you earned.Replayability: 2/10If you're a hardcore \"dungeon crawler\" fan, and think getting a \"stained cotton shirt +1\" is the greatest thing in gaming, then this game will suit your collection. If you prefer characters with more depth than cardboard cutouts try.hack: G.U., Vol.3: RedemptionIf you like weapons and magic with nifty utility as well as flashy combat effectiveness, tryGolden Sun. Unfortunately, nothing in this game really earns a special mention. It's a bargain-bin purchase, but not quite worth bargain-bin prices unless you're a particularly avid \"dungeon crawler\" fan.Overall: 4/10","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2010"}

Johnson","summary":"Wow; now I want even more!","reviewText":"Because I never had a PS2 I never had the opportunity to play the God of War series.  Everyone I spoke to said they were some of the best games, they have ever played, but because I never really wanted a PS2, God of War I and II were two games I figured I would never be able to play.  Even after purchasing a PS3 I still was unable to play these games because the new PS3 systems do not have backwards compatibility.  Luckily these two games were re-mastered and re-released for the PS3 so I finally had the opportunity to play these games.  Long story short, I realized that the raving stories about the God of War series were correct.God of War I looks really good considering it's a fairly old game.  The developers did a very good job in remastering it and this is very apparent when you view the cut screens (which were NOT re-mastered).  Though not true surround sound like other PS3 games like MW2 or Drakes Fortune the sound is still pretty good.Game play wise Kratos' movements are very fluid, and its not hard at all to pick up the game and start playing without having to learn complicated moves.  Even though this game is basically a hack and slash, it's a step or two above a pure button masher.  While you can kill some enemies by just mashing buttons, other enemies require a little more thought in how you fight and defend against them.  For example, the minotaurs will always give you health if you kill them a certain way, but if you just mash button to beat them, you will probably wont get health and in certain parts of the game, this health is crucial to your survival.  Other enemies require you to press the right button at the right time in order to finish them off.  Miss a button or take too long and you have to start the sequence all over again.  On paper this does not sound fun, but actually playing the game it flows flawlessly with the combat sequences.The storyline is very well written, you are Kratos a Spartan warrior looking to defeat his master, Ares after the God of War causes him to slaughter his own wife and daughter in Kratos' blind quest for power.  As your journey progresses you are aided by the other Gods such as Poseidon, Athena and Zeus in order to defeat the insane war god.This game is more difficult than other games and it requires patience and persistence to prevail.  However, because the game was so fun and rewarding to me, I never got to the point where I just became so frustrated and give up altogether.  There is an extremely difficult and frustrating area in Hades' realm where you are forced to climb spinning pillars of knifes and just being grazed by one of these knifes causes you to fall down to the bottom forcing you to start all over again.  But after 15 tries or so, I finally got through it and saved immediately to prevent having to do this all over again.Speaking of saving, God of War does an EXCELLENT job of managing checkpoints and save points.  In WAY too many games you are at the mercy of the developers that seem to like having gamers repeat certain tasks over and over and over again before they reach a checkpoint. In addition, save points (if there are any) are also too far apart.  However in GOW it's quite refreshing that you are hardly ever forced to do tedious tasks repeatedly thanks to a generous checkpoint system.  This comes in very handy when you are in the later stages and die often.  Once you get by a difficult part you are almost guaranteed to cross a check point and so when you die again, you don't have to do the difficult task you just took 10 tries to complete.  In addition to checkpoints, you also have access to save points.  Though not as numerous as checkpoints the save points are also quite forgiving, and you can use them multiple times whenever you like provided you can find a way to get back to them.God of War I has an amazing storyline, excellent cut sequences (though low graphical quality), and near flawless combat system.  Put all these things together and you have a game worthy of 5 stars despite some extremely difficult sections.  But wait! There is another game in this collection, God of War II.God of War II takes place a few years after Kratos' defeat of Ares, the Gods have rewarded Kratos for his services, but later on he is betrayed and he is stripped of all his powers so he now he is intent on revenge of the remaining gods of Olympus.  As the gods have aided him the first time around, Kratos now gets aid from the Titans as they are also enemies of the Gods.God of War II offers slightly better graphics and a more polished look.  In addition the cut screens this time around seem to have also been re-mastered and look much better than the cut screens of the previous title.  Though God of War I is quite graphic in its own right, God of War II steps it up, and should be enough to satisfy those of us who enjoy seeing Kratos ripping bodies in half and snapping the necks of anyone who dare oppose him.  Kratos is ruthless, and this game does an extremely good job in capturing that in both combat sequences and the cut screens.Other than the better graphics, the combat system and game play remain virtually unchanged.  However there was no need to change them, as it was already great.  So there is no need to fix what wasn't broken.The difficulty of God of War II while still quite difficult doesn't seem quite as hard as the original one and if you were able to defeat God of War I, you should be able to beat God of War II as well.  The most difficult part for me in God of War II was when I had to defeat 7 endless waves of enemies with only a couple of health and magic chests.  Even this became easy once I changed my approach in fighting instead of mashing buttons.  If you go into this game thinking you can just mash buttons to advance you will be disappointed.  Just like the first game, some combat sequences require careful planning, timing, and PATIENCE.Luckily in God of War II the checkpoint/save system has also remained virtually untouched, and this is a good thing.  As I said before this was a god send especially in the more difficult areas.  I really wish more game developers would do the same thing, instead of thinking gamers really enjoy having to do things over and over and over again.To me God of War II seems to be shorter than God of War I and the spectacular ending to this installment is not really and ending at all, but a precursor to God of War III which will be out in a couple of weeks.If you have already played and beaten these games on the PS2, then you may be able to do without playing through them again on the re-mastered versions.  However, if you haven't played these games yet, then I urge you to go ahead and do so.  Usually I don't go back and play old games that I never played before, but with God of War: Collection I am glad I made an exception.  Now that I have beaten them, I am suffering from withdrawal symptoms and am eagerly awaiting the 3rd installment.  In the meantime, God of War II does have a challenge mode which should keep me occupied until March 16th.This collection is HIGHLY recommended especially if you have never played the series before, and with two weeks to go until God of War III, you should have just enough time to beat them and be caught up.Really a no-brainer here; 5/5 starts and at this price for TWO excellent games, it is a steal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Finds a middle ground between the mediocrity of the first title and the excellence of the second","reviewText":"In a way, Jak 3 is more of a direct sequel to chapter two than it is a continuation of the storyline that was established in part one. I realize that this was meant to be the end of a journey, a \"coming of age\" story that follows the title character through his innocence, his adolescence, and finally his ascent into adulthood. Bearing in mind, it's only natural that he'd want to distance himself from the people and places that make him feel like an adventuring child, rather than a self-assured saver of globes. \"When I became a man, I put away childish things,\" after all.Where the inspiration behind the storytelling of Jak II was unquestionably Blade Runner, the main source of direction for this final chapter comes largely from Mel Gibson's The Road Warrior. The outlanders who rescue the title-endorsed duo from their exile and drag them back to their own makeshift shanty town are the textbook definition of an early '80s burly man. They adorn themselves with hundreds of pointy edges, enormous, hopelessly detailed weapons and layer after layer of questionably-hemmed leather. They puff out their chests at every opportunity, and speak like a cluster of throat cancer survivors.These new characters are just overflowing with personality, which makes the minor cutscenes and motivational speeches entertaining, but I couldn't shake the feeling that they were just going through the motions in an attempt to mimic the successful main cast of the second game. It's like they were trying to match the edge of the gritty, sullen warriors of Jak II, but were missing some intangible element that kept them from reaching that full potential. The twists and turns of their storylines were somewhat transparent (I'd figured out the major twist in Damas's story within an hour of meeting him), their importance to the central plot is thrown into question fairly early on, (when you return to the city around the three hour mark and only occasionally return to the desert thereafter) and for all of their gusto, their emotional impact on the player doesn't hold a candle to the inner-city gangs that ran chapter two.As the \"last\" game in the series, (Daxter on the PSP and Jak X: Combat Racing have since been released, continuing the saga, and there are rumors of a new game on the PS3) Jak 3 is an atypical grand finale. A lot of things didn't happen that I expected to during the \"wrap up\" cutscene at the very end, and vice-versa... I was caught off guard by more than a few revelations, including the Wizard of Oz-styled reveal just before the final boss. For the first time, I think the series found its stride in the vein of comedy it had sought since day one. The character interactions are actually very funny in places - I legitimately laughed out loud on more than one occasion, which is not something I'm known to do during a game.With the outline in place and the unexpected twists and turns counteracting the few more obvious revelations, Jak 3's story would have set the stage for one of the greatest final chapters in video gaming history - if only it were a bit longer. Jak 3 weighs in at about a dozen hours, which is less than half the length of Jak II, and that results in a much less rewarding experience than you'd hope for in a final episode. It also wasn't nearly as difficult as its immediate predecessor, which means less screaming and shouting, but also less relief and self-assuredness upon reaching that final scene. After completing part two, I had a sense of accomplishment, almost pride, at having finished such an elaborate and difficult game. I didn't get that same sensation upon putting this one to bed.One area in which Jak 3 doesn't disappoint is the \"holy crap\" department. It just spoils you with these things - you'll control Daxter as he clings for dear life onto a speeding missle, (a live freaking MISSLE!) you'll leap onto a teensy platform while the camera leers above you and displays the dizzying heights below, you'll take down creatures the size of a whale... just unimaginably cool stuff. It doesn't overload on the action in quite the way that God of War did, but it's pretty close, and the last full hour of gameplay is one of those long moments that transcends mere video gaming and puts the player right into the middle of a summer blockbuster. I've long considered the last stage of the original Halo to be one of the, if not the greatest level in the history of gaming, and I'd seriously consider the closing moments of Jak 3 at least on par with that. So, yeah, very high praise indeed.In both the grand finale and throughout the entirety of the game, there's a lot of variety in the gameplay. This is not just your standard jump, shoot and explore adventure game. You'll bump into an odd blend of flight stages, DDR-style coordination stages, racing levels and railed first person shooter segments, in addition to the exploring, jumping, punching, shooting and all-around adventuring levels. And, while this is something I had a big problem with when it was shoved into the mechanics of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, it doesn't bother me so much here. The main reason is because the Jak series has always had some sort of similar variety ingrained within it, but it's also a bit more admissible here because the setup actually works. Nothing feels like it's been needlessly crammed into the proceedings, like the dance stages or the workout levels of San Andreas... it all just works together, several parts of a whole.While the basic gameplay model (and its dedication to consistently bending genres) has remained mostly intact, there are two notable variations from the functionality of Jak II that become abundantly clear within the first couple of hours. First and foremost is the much, much heavier emphasis that's placed on the driving stages, more so than in The Precursor Legacy and Jak II combined. In this third chapter, they're vital to the completion of half the game's levels, including the final boss fight. It's almost to the point that I'd call this an \"action / racing\" title, because you'll find yourself spending as much time behind the wheel as you are on foot.When it was successful, the vehicle-based gameplay was a blast, something that's never really been tried before - a sort of supercharged platformer on wheels. On the few stages that failed, however, the wheels felt like a gimmicky death trap. Incredibly frustrating, like trying to shove a square peg through a round opening. Largely, the vehicle stages were a roaring success, however.Secondly, there's the revelation that there is a \"Light Jak\" to mirror the beastial \"Dark Jak\" that was unveiled in the second game. Where Jak's darker persona brought with it a variety of new attacks and offensive maneuvers, his light side focuses more on exploratory aids and defensive mechanisms. As such, it's not quite as exciting to play as \"Light Jak\" for the first time as it was to burst into \"Dark Jak\" mode near the opening of Jak II. It's just not as much fun to grow wings and casually flutter around a room as it is to fire purple lightning out of your fingertips and fry the opposition. These light powers enable a few new modes of exploration for the die-hard fan, but are generally fairly useless and go unused until the situation demands that you employ them. FAs far as controls are concerned, it's a pretty tight ship at this point in the series. Most of the infuriating glitches and bugs from the first game were ironed out in the second chapter, and the third game actually improves upon the near-perfection attained by the second. A few jump commands go unrecognized, and I had some problems with touchy collision detection during the faster races (which meant I had to hit the checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again) but those are minor gripes at best.Visually, this could pass as Jak II's identical twin. The characters look almost exactly the same as in the previous chapter, and all of the little quirks, cartoony exaggerations and background puns that gave the first two games their identity are here in living color. It's not the best looking game I've ever played, and I didn't notice much of a difference upon switching to progressive scan, but it's near the top of its genre all the same. I'd imagine the phrase \"ain't broke, don't fix it\" could be applied to Jak 3 without hesitationThe voice acting is one area that's been kept fairly high in quality throughout the series, and that legacy is kept up here. Where the story falters, the voice actors often revive it, and vice versa... it's a good collaboration. The scenes are routinely stolen by Daxter and / or the villains, who go above and beyond in their pursuit of a good reading that matches the circumstances, while Jak is kept fairly low-key and stoic. It's for the best, too, because on the few occasions where he does decide to go all macho and tries to spit out a line like \"let's go kill us some metal heads,\" it doesn't fit and he comes across as awkward and unsure.Upon completing the second game, I likened it to The Empire Strikes Back, in that it took a fairly light-hearted series and transformed it into a more adult-oriented saga, with incredible results. For what it's worth, that Star Wars parallel carries over fairly accurately with this third chapter - you'll get lots of warm fuzzies at the end, and it's not quite as weighty or substantial as the second chapter, but overall it's still a very entertaining experience with a cast of characters you can't help but love. The big action scenes are really done fabulously, and there's rarely a dull moment, but this game suffers from the unbelievable quality of the game that immediately preceded it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series, it has caught heavy anticipation. Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past. Link is a child, whose destiny is to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon (Gannondorf here) by traveling through time. You'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians, Kokiri, Zoras, and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule. Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along. In the end, the game is an Action/RPG, and should never be classified in the style of traditional, turn-based RPG's (like Final Fantasy).New additions to the series are automatic jumping and Z-targeting. The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzle-solving and dungeon arrangement. You also build your attributes, receiving items including the Ocarina, learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling. Along with mini-games, hidden items and side quests equal, its a worthwhile experience. Graphics-wise, Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding. No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates, but rather focus on detail and designer talent. The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive. The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format. The themes of Zora's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears. Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby. A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.In the end, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time makes the cut. Even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeon-dwelling and puzzle-solving, the impressive graphics, quality sound and everything that's been obtained from previous Zelda titles will keep fans and non-fans alike entertained. It's fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}

Flawlessly voice by Tricia Helfer, during some of the closeups, Kerrigan even looks photorealistically like Helfer. Some of these cutscenes have to be seen to be believed. Granted, your box does have to have some horsepower, but even a 3 year old computer can run graphics at or near High settings.Gameplay is what you know and love, with well designed missions, especially some of the lone owlf missions. Each one is thoughtfully laid out, and I can't think of but 2 that felt even remotely like grinders. You can beat yourself bloody against all comers if you so choose, but theres always intelligent planning that can simplify things tremendously. The space mission was especially fun, and I wish that there'd been more of thsoe, but hopefully the final chapter will have more of that.Multiplayer has a sprinkling of new options, but is otherwise the same well nailed down system, and it now includings a vs AI option that seems to work well, though you really ahve to pick your difficulty level well.The only real gripe is the Battlenet. While it may just be going through the startup jitters, nothing is annoying as getting a hard difficulty achievement, then losing it because the Battlenet connection hiccuped at the last second.Unit evolution is neat, and you'll love being able to mix and match, rather than be stuck with every purchase made. The specilization of each Zerg type is especially nice, as you gte to see both in action, rather than having to make an irreversible choice blindly. The incorporation of some of the aspects of the Zerg Hive are really clever and enjoyable.Overall, worth the wait. While everyone was annoyed at the delay between chapter 1 and 2, the added polish and depth of feel to this shows it wasn't a waste. Gorgeous graphics, great plot twists out of the gate, and enjoyable gameplay make this a rare 5 stars.All told, this was worth the wait. Stunning graphics, great plot twists right out of the gate, and enjoyable in and out-of-mission play make this a rare 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00140S21O","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the best multiplayers hands down","reviewText":"One of the more unfortunate things about trying to find a good multiplayer game or just game in general is finding the one that \"clicks\" with you. The one that you feel more comfortable playing so whereas you might not like the twitchyness of a Call of Duty title, you might prefer the larger open-world objective based games such as MAG or the Battlefield series. In my case it was Team Fortress 2 since I was either too awful at once, annoyed at the community by another or bored by another but with this game there is that large sense of balance and even surprising depth that I quite enjoyed. However, this is coming from someone who owned the 360 version for so long and it always depressed me and left me curious as to not only missing out on the PC updates but how it ran given all the changes. Finally buckling down and buying it off Steam, I was left with that old familiar feeling of knowing what to do but still needing to re-learn how to do it, if that makes sense. See, because of all these updates, new weaponry and items can be used which can either promote a different strategy or leave you with a \"how the hell did he?...oh, he's got a better gun than me\" but aside from that, there's not a lot of multiplayers out there that feel this inviting yet offer so much in return.Games like Gears of War or Halo have weapon spawns that you have to find so it becomes a fight to get to the  the fastest, games like Call of Duty are about your weapon loadouts and what you bring in but also what you find off your dead enemy/teammates. Team Fortress 2 though is similar to Battlefield in that what class you pick ultimately brings a specific way to approach the battle. Pick the Australian sniper class and you'll tend to hang back, pick the energetic Scout though and you'll be playing the annoying pest, coming in full blast with a shotgun right in their face before they speed away. From the support Medic doctor to the minigun-totin Heavy, it seems there's a class for everyone. Course some classes tend to be used a lot more than others such as the Demoman who carries a grenade launcher but he also carries a remote-mine launcher than can be detonated with right-click and it's very common to see more than one out on the field using strictly this tactic.Another thing that is vastly different from the console versions is the modding community and let me tell you, as a player who frequented that drab 2fort or Dustbowl maps, to all of a sudden be hit with a winterized version of 2fort or a rainy Hydro map and you'll find you're hit with a different animal altogether than what was on the Xbox version. From different gametypes such as Dodgeball and I even saw a \"Mariokart\" server then yeah, there's large amounts of customization in regards to not only what maps you play on but the kind of game you play. Another notable difference is in regards to the achievements and let's just say there's a TON of achievements for this and nearly every class update (I think Engineers are left) has brought with it a good chunk so yeah, getting the achievements on this will take awhile. Unless you don't use the clearly-marked \"achievement\" servers.Tied into the new achievements is new weaponry so remember how snipers were strictly relegated to that one sniper rifle and his SMG? Well how's about now being given a bow-and-arrow? Or the Demoman and his broken bottle? Well how's about being given a freakin sword which can be combined with a charging ability to basically act as a Halo 2 energy sword lunge? While this sounds all great and all, keep in mind, certain achievements can be based around luck  (\"Backstab an enemy, who then switches to Pyro before they respawn\" or excessive grinding such as Chief of Staff (\"Accumulate one million total health points.\") This is great for people who prefer using a specific class yet at the same time it sucks when you're met with an equal class user on the other team who uses something you clearly have no chance in getting for a good while.But with the endless support from Valve, the modding community and just the general gameplay of Team Fortress 2 itself, it's kind of hard to beat what you'll be getting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2010"}

You'll notice upgraded graphics, prone, some new guns and streamlined classes, a few new vehicles, but nothing radical at all. So if you were a fan of BF2, you'll like this. If you're a CoD fanboy that thinks all non CoD games are \"teh suxor\", then move along, there's nothing to see here.Why 3 stars? Bugs, glitches, having a campaign mode that is a glorified rail shooter, no split screen co-op and the only new game mode is a squad based death match. From a purely opinion based perspective, and where BF3 struggles most is the squad mechanic. If you are playing solo, expect a boring game. You might get lucky and squad up with some cool cats, but as an adult gamer with adults on my friends list, getting a good squad together is hit or miss.For all you fanboys ready to flame away, I don't expect any more out of MW3. FPS games are uber-popular, but also, like the music games (Rock band, guitar hero), they are kind of at a peak. Call of Duty redefined the console FPS with it's unlock and prestige system. Killzone 2 set the bar for graphics, but those games are both several years old.

The most notable achievement perhaps is the rich storyline and detailed universe created by the developers (there is plenty to read here -- I started by reading every word but confess to scanning some texts as the game progressed). The graphics are good in parts but not in others (I know this game came out in 2007 but then so did Crysis). The voice acting is overall pretty good and there are plenty of branches to the dialogue trees. And this is where MASS EFFECT's strengths lie: in the role playing aspects of the game. You're given the opportunity to be the good guy or the not so good guy, depending on how you wish to play. Less successful is the combat, which, for the most part, failed to engage. Also the side missions are very repetitive and dull. The vehicle you get to drive on numerous occasions bounces around like a drunken bouncy thing, and there are endless elevators that take too long to ascend or descend. Oh, and the UI for selecting skills, weapons etc. is needlessly complex.Overall MASS EFFECT is worth playing but the whole experience is oddly detached and vaguely unsatisfying.

Barely worth a weekend rental","reviewText":"The Good: Fun and fast paced action, fun multiplayer modes, lots of customization, looks great, Declassified Missions add fun challengeThe Bad: Horrible story, extremely linear, very short, lack of maps, lack of new contentGears of War is the Xbox 360's best series and one of the best of this generation. It introduced cinematic gameplay in a gritty post apocalyptic world with revolutionary gun play and cover system. Judgement proves that all series run out of steam. It's the worst Gears game, but not terrible. People Can Fly (of Painkiller fame) took the driver's seat thanks to their successful collaboration with Epic during the development of Bulletstorm. Judgement isn't anything like the previous games in a bad way. It's dragged down by balance issues, linearity, and a poor story.Let's start with the story. It takes place years before Delta Squad was formed and Baird was a Lieutenant. He's accompanied by UIR Paduk, Sofia Hendrick, and Augustus Cole. They are arrested and are being held in a trial in the middle of a battlefield by Colonel Loomis. You play their flashbacks as testimonies. Honestly the story never goes anywhere and there's nothing gripping about it. You just play as each character in short 30-45 minute chapters. Once you catch up to the present moment you play one more chapter and that's it. Nothing interesting at all. Even the bonus chapter called Aftermath is pretty lame. It takes place after Gears of War 3, but all you're doing is finding a boat to get out to sea. There's nothing revealing to the overall story.Challenge and pacing takes a back seat as well. Judgement is all about the kill count and tactical combat takes a back seat. All the enemies health have been dialed back a lot so you can run around pumping them with lead. It got so bad that 5-6 enemies will pile up on you or an ally. This would never happen in previous Gears games. I honestly rarely used cover and just went around blasting enemies with the Gnasher. The game is broken up into sections with score totals at the end. The only awesome thing about Judgement that impressed me were the Declassified missions. These are giant red gear logos on the wall at the beginning of each section that make the game a bit more challenging. Ranging from time limits, to certain weapons, more enemies, more defenses etc. These also increase your star rating which are used to unlock items and achievements.Half way through the game it starts getting extremely repetitive. I honestly almost hated the game, but the action itself kept me hooked because it was faster paced than previous games and a bit more exciting. There really isn't much new added to this game either. There's one new enemy that acts like a mini Berserker. Once you shoot it it will grow bigger and only head shots will kill it. There are a few new weapons, but they are UIR weapons. The Booshka is a grenade launcher, the Markza is a sniper rifle with a fast firing rate. There's also another rifle that is nearly as deadly as a Longshot but fires 4 rounds before a reload. I wanted more content, honestly even the levels were generic and boring. It's the same hallways and battlefields over and over. The overall game is just really disappointing.Once you finish the campaign there's really no reason to go back unless you really want all the stars and find the hidden COG tags, or to play co-op. The multiplayer is probably the best out of all the Gears games, but is lacking content. There aren't many maps, and Horde mode is absent, but there's a substitute mode called Survival and Overrun. Survival pits a Gears team against AI controlled Locust, and Overrun lets players control the Locusts. This mode is intense and another small step in the evolution of the Gears multiplayer suite. The classic modes are back and feel as solid as ever, but the lack of maps may bore players quicker than previous games.Overall, Judgement is a huge disappointment. The campaign is generic, short, and almost boring, the tactical side of Gears is taken away for running and gunning. Multiplayer suffers from a lack of maps, but at least there's a lot of customization stuff to unlock for your characters. You now get rewarded for all those kills and ribbons you earn in the from of Prizeboxes. The graphics look great and push the 360 to its limits, but the console is seriously aged and it shows. Judgement is  fun weekend rental or bargain purchase, at this point Gears of War needs a reboot to keep from going under.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

I figured an officially licensed Playstation Bluetooth was the way to go.After getting the headset out of the box, I flipped open the instructions and they were very easy to follow (see the image I uploaded). I connected the USB cable to the headset and the game console, and it took less than 5 seconds for the device to be recognized and mapped to my Playstation 3. The initial charging took 3 hours, but it was well worth the wait.Having never used a Bluetooth headset before, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I adapted to using this. The game sounds came through clearly, and there was only a half-second lag between speaking and hearing my voice. The buttons were very easy to find and after some practice, I knew exactly where to press for louder or softer volume.When I pressed the mute button, a popup showed up on my game screen with the mute status and the battery level on the headset - every 6 seconds or so, I could hear a beep to remind me it was muted. When I turned off the mute button, it gave a double beep and showed another popup to confirm this.I also noticed the range of the headset was very good - I could walk through two rooms with no loss in sound quality.The speakerphone/microphone functions worked well while the unit sat in the charging cradle, and the voice changer was also a nice touch - now gamers can go online sounding like Tobin Bell from the Saw films.Though this was a great headset, I did notice a few problems:(1) When I pressed the mute button, the top two corners of the headset dug into my outer ear, which was uncomfortable.(2) The rubber ring on the headset didn't provide any extra comfort for my ear.(3) The cover for the USB connector on the headset was very small - it was hard to open and even harder to close. Thankfully, using the USB stand allows me to charge the unit without having to use that connector more than once.With the sound quality and overall ease of use, I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone who wants to connect to the Playstation Network.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2009"}

I purchased the game via digital download directly from Bethesda.(---) It's absolutely bug infested, riddled with quest and progress breaking bugs. I have had to re-log in order to force portions of quests to function approximately 20% of the time. Game breaking bugs made the first dungeon incapable of being finished. I have fallen through the world and been unable to play again until after the servers were taken down for maintenance. Several other times I fell through the world, was forced to re-log, then had to wait 10-15 minutes before I could control my character again. I've lost levels to random \"rollbacks\" - in which the client experiences an error and crashes, and when you log back on you've lost your past hour of progress. I've been killed instantly by terrain, become trapped in rocks or walls or grass, been shot into the sky by passing NPCs......this is disgraceful. I have beta tested many games, played many MMOs at launch, and never, ever, have I seen a game so incredibly unfinished. I am not being hyperbolic at all when I state that this game is still in alpha, and it is a shame that Bethesda is charging money for it(-) Controller support is absent, and the general keyboard & mouse controls are awkward. It plays very similar to Skyrim but with subtle differences to accommodate for the fact that it's a MMO. Sadly these subtle differences don't translate well.(+/-) Presentation is generally strong, but suffers from some incredibly low res textures throughout, alongside some awful voice acting and animation. Most of it is good, but the poor parts are truly terrible and jarring(+) A huge world full of memorable content, on and off the beaten path. It makes Skyrim seem downright tiny in comparison(+/-) Deep and layered character customization (regarding skills, not aesthetics) that translates pretty well to combat and general gameplay, offset by the awkward controls and some pre-beta level tuning(-) User interface, crafting, inventory, it's all a mixed bag of poor, dated design elements and mechanisms. It is so awful it deserves its own bullet point. The basic bag and banking systems, common to MMOs and refined over the years, is like something out of a nightmare in 2003(-) Stability is abysmal. Lag is common. Interactions not working. Group members appearing offline when they're in front of you. Guild functions not working for days. Dropped packets. Etc, etc, etc. It's like some tiny fly-by-night company is running this thing. It's sad(-) Aggressively drab and uninspired character and gear design. This applies to not just gear, like armor and weapons, but also spells and abilities and class distinctions. I don't expect the players in an Elder Scroll game to resemble blinking neon signs like they do in other games (WoW), but man, even the best gear one could acquire in this game is just plain and boring. A magical healer looks the same as a plate-wearing tank.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2014"}

I'm a huge fan of zombie games and have played every game available including Left 4 Dead 1 & 2, RE 1-5, and Dead Rising 1 & 2.  I had high hopes for Dead Island and it hasn't really lived up to them in any sense.  The graphics aren't great but are passable but the real lack here for me is the characters and the story development.  It just all feels like a lot of running around and clubbing or chopping zombies.  You don't really feel like there's a sense of purpose to what you're doing and some of the \"quests\" are so lame - one of them is to find a bottle of champagne for a drunk Russian woman.  The scenery of the island is beautiful but it gets repetitive after playing for a few hours.  I guess overall my feeling is that this is really nothing new.  There's no real excitement that \"hey this is really cool\" .  That is what I was hoping for.  It's not a terrible game.  It is very similar to Dead Rising with nicer scenery. I don't think it's a game that will have replay value for me and I definitely regret spending $60  on it.  Wish I would have waited for a used version.

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Ziggy","summary":"Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto Vice City while similar to GTA3 is a very different gaming experience.  All the essentials from the previous game return here, but Vice City breaks new barriers.  First with the addition of the main character, Tommy Vercetti.  Voiced wonderfully by Ray Liotta, Vercetti says more in the first 5 minutes of the game than The Guy did in the entire GTA3 game.  Second, the diverse landscape of Vice City is overwhelming compared to the setting of GTA3.  While I preferred the darker surroundings of the previous game, the bright night life of Vice City is essential to its storyline and setting.  Set in the 1980's Vice City appears as the same town that Tony Montana hovered around in Scarface.  The similarities don't stop there.  Many missions are clearly based on certain parts of the 1983 gangster movie.  Gamers will actually put down the controller and wait for Vercetti to exclaim \"Say goodnight to the bad guy,\" after he's torched an entire bank and killed nearly all his compainions in the process.  Speaking of that mission, it showcases Vice City's greatest asset.  The story here moves back and forth, and the end of the game, although highly unlikely, is well done.  Vercetti is a bad dude, there is no doubt about that and gamers will have fun with his character.  On the question of which game is better, GTA3 or GTA: Vice City, there is still one more review to write before the ultimate answer is given.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2005"}

Its very immerse and makes you want to stay in the game longer and longer.The battle mechanics are where this game shines. You have block, attack, parry (which seems to be useless), roll / dodge (shares a button with run), use item, menu and so on. You pretty much go into every battle holding the block. Let the enemy attack and then its your turn. Its really just as simple as that. You have a stamina bar that wears down when you run, block or attack. if your stamina is too low, an enemy can easily break through your block and then attack and kill you. This is pretty much every battle. It is time consuming. There greater foes that might challenge you with dodges and waiting for the right moment to attack or getting behind them to backstab them. These are more interesting and challenging. Like a heavy knight that will use potions quicker than you and raise his shield quicker than you. The bosses are an absolute highlight of the game if not just a good excuse to kill you.You can't really breeze through enemies. Nor can you run through them as you can in other games. Eventually you'll get blocked or run out of stamina and have a mob of foes ready to kill you. Every attack, block, counter and item use seems to take too long of a time, which leaves you open for any number of things. When your weapons clang against a wall you take damage, which I guess makes sense.Its not hard, difficult or challenging as people say it is. It is just time consuming. The game does a good job of spoon feeding you things in the tutorial level. At the end of the level, they have a boss that is designed to kill you and oh trust me, the bosses will kill you. See nothing else is really that challenging, but the bosses will just kill you. Once the first boss kills you, then you're thrown into the reality of the game that you're a soul that collects other souls as currency. If you just used all of your items on the boss, you need to buy them again with no currency. Then your weapon breaks so you need even more currency and if you spend 45 minutes getting 2/3rds the currency you need to buy a replacement weapon then you die, well that's 45 minutes you just wasted. There are of course blacksmiths that will repair your weapons at about 1/5th the cost to buy a new one.As a 'soul' in a body, that leads into the game's uh multiplayer online yet single player mentality. The game is really single player, but you can see ghosts of other players. You can see blood spots from where they died and you can see a ghost of how they died. This will warn you if you want the warning. This is totally by choice that you can see it. You can also leave messages and read other messages left by other people. They can even tip you for your message whether its a hint, tip, warning or trick. There are plenty of people warning you of simple things and plenty more people trying to get you to recommend a message so they'll get tipped souls in return. Seems more like people trying to get out of the grinding.Since this is an RPG there is plenty of reason to come back to this game after you beat it. You start each game by picking a class and your stats, movement and weapon skills vary, which can drastically alter your game experience. Such as I see plenty of dead spots with ghosts of archers and pikemen. Every weapon has its own rythem too. Quick blades you go stab stab stab once you find an opening, while larger blades are too slow, but effectively 1 swipe is worth 3 dagger stabs. Also with stabbing weapons you need to lock onto a target by pushing the left thumbstick. Otherwise, without locking on... you'll be lucky to hit something.It is rare that I will actually play a game for hours and sink time into a game, but Demon Souls was able to get hours and hours out of me. I feel very committed to the game, because every action is so time consuming and yet rewarding. You get further being cautious than you ever will being quick about things. Your being cautious will keep you alive and keeping you alive will keep you playing.Now for the few downsides. Let's start with the poor camera controls that prevent you from looking into a doorway when a first person perspective would let you see everything. Also, even with all of the warnings, you really need to stock up for bosses or use trial and error methods against the bosses. The only catch is that if you die on a boss... you restart the level. All of the enemies are there again and you lose all of your souls (currency). You still keep your items, you just need to slog your way through everything. That's your punishment for failure. Sure there are unlockable gates as a sort of shortcut through the levels, but if the boss is at the beginning of a level and you need fire to beat that boss, but the merchant is all the way at the back of a level, that just means you'll be playing for 30 more minutes before you face the boss again.So be prepared to pour hours, days and weeks into this game. Every time you pick up the controller it turns into a commitment that is rewarded and punished for failure.Currently its free for Play Station Plus members. It is well worth your time to give it a try if not pick it up for $20.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

Weir","summary":"Not for your average gamer, but there is a lot to appreciate.","reviewText":"I just rented Demon's Souls from Gamefly to check it out. Its a refreshingly unique experience in a sea of cookie cutter first person shooters and open world action games. Originally I had not planned to play this game but I just keep hearing about it more and more, especially now that Dark Souls (its spiritual sequel) has been released. I'm only about 6 hours in but totally in love with this Demon's Souls. The first 3-4 hours were frustrating but it has finally \"clicked\". Demon's Souls is more unforgiving than it is difficult. That is to say, it IS difficult, but it requires you to know what you're capable of and run from what you're not capable of handling. That aspect is difficult in itself because it's never really obvious what you can or can't handle. You're required to find out via trial and error, exploration and experimentation. Demon's Souls is also extremely rewarding and one of the most addictive titles I've played this generation. It's really hard to verbalize just why it's so great, you just have to experience it for yourself and have a little (or a lot?) of patience.The kick-in-the-balls hard difficulty (admittedly, most of the time I will die because I'm impatient and not using sound strategies, but there have been PLENTY of cheap deaths) reminds me of the difficult games I played as a child on the NES and other early consoles. If you appreciate games that require trial and error, repetition, grinding, pattern recognition and, most of all, intense concentration and sound execution of strategy you will eat this game up.  It's a very cerebral game but one that people will appreciate if they grew up playing mega man titles and grind-heavy RPGs. Demon's Souls harkens back to the days when video games didn't reward you and hold your hand every step of the way. It will not insult your intelligence. No offense, but the younger generation of gamers who never played consoles prior to the latest 2 console generations, and are playing military bro shooters excessively, accustomed to being constantly positively reinforced with rewards and upgrades need not apply - they will just not comprehend or appreciate a game like Demon's Souls. Older gamers should check it out and give it a try. You just might fall in love like I did.I'm returning my borrowed copy from Gamefly tomorrow and will purchase my own personal copy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

Now this is why I brought a Gamecube! This is the console action I remember and love! This is a simply, a great game. Super Smash Bros. Melee takes everything I loved about Super Smash Bros. and ups it. It adds new, better, more complex characters. It adds more detailed levels. There's a ton of things to do in Single player. The replay value is through the roof if you love fighting games. This is the best Gamecube game I've played yet.On the single player side of things, my type of game, SSBM easily stands tall. Trophies are a blast to collect, and extremely well modeled. Any 3d artist will be proud of Nintendo's work. The Event mode is a ton of fun, and challenging enough to keep you trying without making you want to break the controller. The standard game is as you'd expect, standard... but a lot of fun and worth playing though at least once with every character. Multiplayer wise, it's as fun as it's ever been. It can be a blast to get a game going between two good players, and certainly a very entertaining time.The graphics are incredible. Mario has a more realistic look to him this time, as well as Bowser. Bowser is meaner, bigger, and badder than ever. He claws, he spikes, he spits flame... and shows no mercy. All the characters this time around have surprising complexity to them. Zelda can transform into her alter ego, making for two sets of moves and two sets of attacks. Her motion as her alter self are incredible, the animation is a work of art. She flips, jabs, teleports, and fights with the fluidness of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. All the characters have every trademark move you'd expect. Samus is truly a joy to play as in 3d. Her flips, her blasts, her bombs, even her grapple hook are all just as you'd expect. There's nothing quite like blasting Kirby into the stratosphere with a barrage of attacks from the old days of Metroid. Link is cool as ever as well, his shield, his hookshot, boomerang, bombs, and most importantly sword fighting abilities are all intact. You'll feel just like the old Zelda days again, there's even a battle in event mode against your dark shadow self. I could continue on for quite some time like this, but you'll see when you play.The levels are extremely detailed and varied. They range from the F-Zero race track of the unforgettable Mute City to a Pokemon Stadium that changes form as the battle progresses. Each is fun, each is jaw dropping gorgeous, but none so much as the Hyrule Temple. Zelda fans will simply adore this map. Another favorite of mine is of course, BrinStar. *drool*This game is incredibly easy to recommend. I highly suggest it as a buy to fans of Nintendo and/or fighting. If you've got a lot of pals around to VS against, all the better. However, the single player action alone is fun for ages. There's just so much to collect and so many characters to unlock and fight with. If you're not a big Nintendo freak like me, or not sure of it's lasting appeal, give it a rental. If by the end of the rental you're bored, it wasn't worth buying anyway. If not, pick it up. It's a great example of Nintendo through the ages and a showcase title for your Gamecube.- Rirath_com","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

Of course it didn't come out at launch... that would have been too easy! This was the main game to get when the system launched back in November/December 2001. This game is a fighter at its core, but it's more humorous then bloody. You fight as many of the Nintendo key characters such as Link, Mario, Zelda, Pikachu etc, against each other. There are some well known names in this group, and there are some vague characters. This is an excellent multiplayer game, but it is good as a single as well. Personally, I don't think it deserves the Teen rating it got. The first one on the N64 was rated Everyone, and I feel it should have received that as well. Yes there's violence in it, but compare it to something like Soul Calibur (great game, just more graphic), and you'll see Smash Bros is much better. With all the different characters you can be, this is a definite must have for the Cube. And at the lower price point, it's a value. A+!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2004"}

Seriously, those where probably the best gaming experiences that i dont think anyone whose played them and took time to enjoy them will forget anytime soon.I made a decision to re-grade to a ps3 after my 360 broke for the umpteenth time, and the first game i picked up when i got a ps3 was, you guessed it, Mass Effect 2 for ps3. After downloading the add-ons needed for ME 2 on ps3, the additional DLC, and the in-game comic of Mass Effect 1 that lets you make decisions that effect the playthrough of the sequel, i was pleasantly surprised. The comic doesn't literally cover up the entire Mass Effect 1 story, but you'll get whats up as soon as you get your game underway, and you will still get the full-blown experience straight up.The anticipation for Mass Effect 3 is no joke at all, so if your sitting there reading this review and debating on picking this game up, I think the time for debate needs to end, right about . . .

My friend and I would sit for hours playing this.  While I still have the Nintendo 64 version, I am super excited and happy that I have this version as well.  This is the same game that was played on the 64.  But, it looks, sounds and plays better than it's 64 version.  You move easily by using the control nub.  You can hit the L and R buttons to take a sharper turn, hit up on the nub and B to do a flip and easily shoot with the buttons.  Everything felt really great while I was playing.  It will take getting used to having to move in the time and speed you need to sometimes do in the game though.  You have the choice of picking from two different control types.  I first chose the choice where up is up and down is down.  I couldn't do it, so I went with my N64 pick down is up and up is down.  Much better!  The voices have all been redone and sound great.  I was good to hear old peppy again.  If you played and enjoyed the N64 game, this is a must have.  If you heard about, but never had a chance to play the original, you should defiantly get this.  It is a lot of fun.Anything else besides the single player?Besides the single player, you can play this with friends.  Which is always a good thing.  You can even see your friends faces via the camera on the 3DS!!!!  I can't wait to try it out.  The game also has the mode score attack.  In this, you can replay missions that you have already played to try and get the highest score.  Seems fun.  Oh, you can also chose from classic control or the new gyro controls.  If you choose this control type, you have to actually move your 3DS around in order to have your ship move.  This could be fun, but right now I have chosen to stick with the classic way to play the game.  This game brings back a lot of memories.  Once you have played this version, I am sure you will remember it.  So go get it!Nintendo, please take more classic Nintendo 64 games and put them out on the 3DS.  I will always look forward to new games.  But there are so many I didn't get to play on the 64!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0037LVW9M","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"Not a bad 3rd person shooter, but hardly anything memorable","reviewText":"I was expecting a lot from this game based on some of the early gameplay footage I saw and the pretty awesome trailer, but I'm sad to say this game definitely did not live up to my expectations. It's a very linear, predictable and cliche story-line almost like any other generic shooter. Nearly every conflict and firefight seems almost perfectly setup for you to position your team and handle things with ease with a 1-shot kill coordinated strike. There's some tactical elements to it, but by and large its a very easy game and you can breeze through it with minimal effort. Even the cool parts about using futuristic technology always seems convenient and provided only when necessarily for level-specific objectives. Even then in the end they just make the game easier than it already is even without using the tech.I'm sure you've seen advertisements about how much you can customize the weapons. Well let me tell you right now that you have to go through quite a lot just to unlock the guns you probably want to use. And most of the attachments and modifications you can make really don't make that much of a difference, and feel mostly cosmetic more than anything given how small the actual areas in the single-player campaign for you to fight in. This isn't exactly a hyper-realistic shooter and I didn't notice much in the way of bullet sway or drop at any point. The actual number of guns you have available to use is pretty small. If you were hoping for some Matrix-style racks of various firearms to use and modify prepare to be disappointed.The upsides for this game are that it has the mechanics down for creating a competent 3rd-person shooter. I haven't experienced any glitches and generally its got some fun set-up cinematic scenes which are fun the first few times. But frankly they didn't really emphasize the &#34;Ghost&#34; aspect since you can easily get through many conflicts guns blazing and be rewarded. Maybe that was by design so that people can play it their way, but it definitely detracts from the tactical aspect of things. The multiplayer isn't bad either, though I haven't exactly seen many people playing. Even then there's not too much variety and it all comes down to knowing the map-layout in terms of being successful. There's some cool uses of technology though for the multi-player which does add something to the mix.Overall it's probably not something you'll play for very long since there are just a lot of better games out there to spend your time  on. Still, if you find this on sale and want a fun shooter to play through (especially on Co-op with friends) its not a bad game to try out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00140P9G0","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"Portal's brilliance and wit make it an excellent game that's innovative, challenging, and entertaining in many ways.","reviewText":"(Note: I have only extensively played the Mac version of this game available through the Steam game download service, but I assume the Mac and PC versions are essentially the same.)A few years ago, if I had heard of a game that would somehow combine a puzzle and a shooter, I would have had plenty of doubts as to how that would work. The two just don't seem like they would get along together very well. Enter Portal, a game that isn't a true shooter, but integrates basic first-person shooting elements into a puzzler that is brilliant, superbly executed, challenging, and also extremely witty. Perhaps this concept of a shooter and puzzle game mixed together can be done...Portal gives no background to its story or world, and it doesn't have much of a developed plot. Throughout the game, though, it becomes apparent that the girl controlled by the player is a test subject for a gun that shoots portals. This concept carries the story alongside an odd computerized voice, apparently named GLaDOS, who talks to the player throughout the entire game. GLaDOS' lines offer up countless witty moments that often forced me to laugh out loud. The humor is about as clever as it gets, and though GLaDOS remains a mystery right up to the game's finale, its voice makes for a surprisingly brilliant villain.The concept of Portal is that, as mentioned before, the player is given a gun that can shoot portals, hence the game's title. Eventually, the gun is able to shoot two portals that link together, allowing the player to navigate around rooms with relative ease. This concept of a portal gun is marvelously executed through the work of the game's fantastic level design. The objective is always to simply reach the end of the level, but to activate the platform that takes the player through the final gate, switches must be held down by weighted cubes, energy balls must find a place in receivers, and the player may very well have to come up with a creative way to fling himself or herself up into the air or across a large gap. Portal's level design offers just about every imaginable use of this concept of a portal gun, creating a brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable game.With such brilliant level design comes plenty of challenges. The game's concept calls for oodles of potential challenges, and Portal makes use of seemingly every single one imaginable. The portals create a rock solid element on which to build the game's many challenges, which include figuring out how to launch the character across a room, directing balls of energy to their receivers, and many more that I would rather not spoil. The game's obstacles are almost always challenging in some way, but I found them all to be doable with a bit of thought and close observation of a level. Solving each of Portal's puzzles is simply delightful and satisfying; I know I felt very accomplished after figuring out how to pass a few particularly challenging scenarios. If the main story isn't challenging enough for you, though, there are also advanced maps and extra challenges available to tackle, and these bring on the game's true degree of difficulty.Despite all of Portal's brilliant achievements in its concept and level design, though, it is a painfully brief experience. The main story takes a maximum of 3-4 hours to complete, and though there are six advanced maps and plenty of extra challenges, they do not substantially extend the game's longevity. To pay any more than $15 for the game would only be worthwhile for people who have already played it and enjoyed it enough to the point where they simply must own it. I still find it to be a wholly worthwhile game despite its shortness, though.I couldn't run Portal on very high graphic settings because of my computer's capabilities, but I have seen it on consoles before and it certainly looks sharp at maximum graphical potential. The game's look fits its mood well with plenty of black and white, setting a dark but futuristic sort of tone. The game also sounds great, even aside from the witty and hysterically computerized lines from GLaDOS. The portal gun makes a cool noise when it is fired, the portals themselves make a sort of mystical sound, and the turrets that show up every once in a while also sound believable. These turrets also speak, and they actually sound quite creepy as they say things like \"I see you\" in eerie robotic voices.Portal is a simply fantastic game. Despite the apparent lack of length, the brilliantly executed concept and phenomenal level design make it a blast to play. The level of challenge also makes the game engaging, and oh so satisfying when the game's obstacles are overcome. Portal is easily worth a purchase at $10-15, but if you're about to pay any more than that, make sure you've played it before so you know if you like it or not. But I don't see why you wouldn't like it, because its brilliance and wit make it a simply excellent game.Positive:+ Extremely witty sense of humor+ Creative and marvelously executed concept+ Brilliant level and puzzle design+ Challenging but doableNegative:Short. As in painfully short.9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001HB7K6I","reviewerName":"Nerrel","summary":"beautiful classic, but maybe not for everyone","reviewText":"there are enough reviews praising this game for it's lavish artwork and presentation already, so i thought i'd rather devote my review to countering some of the criticisms of the game i've read in online reviews. many of these reviewers had me unsure if it was worthwhile to buy the game, and now that i've played it through i can't understand how they arrived at some of their criticisms and i'm glad i didn't listen to them. in case anyone else is considering the game, i hope this makes you more confident in buying:the main complaint is that while the visuals are amazing, the gameplay is too shallow; i think this is a complaint directed more toward 2D games in general than it is specifically at muramasa. modern games have become so complex that in retrospect nearly any retro 2D game will seem incredibly simple in comparison, and that's not a bad thing. the problem is that these reviewers are confusing simple with shallow. most of them have probably not played a new 2D game in very long time and the contrast in depth between a humble retro-syled game like muramasa and today's hyper-realisic HD games is glaring. if super metroid were released today, i expect it would receive a lot of the same complaints muramasa has.if you judge the game by the old 2D standards it isn't lacking anything. although only one button is used for most attacks, there is a large variety of moves to perform while fighting and they can be executed with a surprising amount of precision. you can often get by with button-mashing, but it pays to make the effort to carefully choose your attacks. choosing the right swords also plays a vital role in the game, with certain swords being better suited for particular enemies. out of the hundred or so swords in the game, there is always one that will work best for each situation, with a few swords even seemingly designed to work for just a single specific boss. figuring out when and where to equip each sword is a major part of the fun.the ability to cook adds another layer of complexity to the game, allowing you to prepare some of your own healing items for use in battle. different foods will replenish different amounts of health and fill your character to different degrees. when your character is full, you will not be able to use another healing item until a fullness gauge on screen depletes. this often leaves you frantically struggling to survive with little health until you're able to eat again. it forces you to plan how to use your healing items a little more carefully and adds a little intensity to the more viscous fights. these RPG elements don't feel gimmicky in the slightest and give you more than enough to think about during combat to keep the game from being a simple mess of sword swinging.there is an abundance of repeating backgrounds, but it never gets to the point of annoyance. the environments are so beautifully done that you probably won't mind seeing them a few extra times, especially since you won't notice most details the first time around. passing through a field of wheat with thousands of individual stalks waving in the wind will always be an impressive sight.backtracking is a more serious problem, with no real useful way of getting around ever provided to you during your first play through. the game provides rickshaws and ships for taking shortcuts, but most of them are never even usable and the few that do work never seem to go where you want to, which makes you wonder why they even bothered programming them in. as long as you follow your objectives and keep moving forward you'll end up where you need to be without trouble, but if you ever decide to move backwards and explore the earlier areas again you'll have a hellish time getting across the map. once again, the amazing sights along the way help make it a non-issue.none of this was really necessary to write; if you love the old SNES classics then you'll probably love muramasa, since it's styled strongly after the games of that era. if, on the other hand, you have no real interest in japanese culture and super metroid isn't one of your all-time favorite games, you may be better off passing this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2009"}

I love the PS3 and I don't want people to get the wrong idea. So what I mean by it should be focused on gaming more. I meant that the game developers should be more willing to use the power of the PS3. Every developer that has gone with the PS3 instead of the 360 has had great sucess. Examples: Metal Gear Solid 4, Little Big Planet, Uncharted 2! The X-box 360 cant fit any of those games into one disc or match the graphic power. But when a developer makes games such as Fallout 3 and GTA 4 cross platform. In the end the X-box gets thes majority of the goods. All of the great downloadble content from those games is still not available on the PS3. Thankfully now with Batman Arkham Asylum, they have an exclusive download. In the end, I love the PS3. I just hope that in the future that the Developers would begin to use this system for what its worth!It has so many features that the XBox doesnt have. Such as Blu-Ray, Internet Browser, and some of the earlier models have full backwards compatibility with PS1/2 games. The PS3 is pretty much a computer and it has great features and great games but it cant match up to the games that are out on 360 though. Thats just my opion though, some people really prefer PS3 games. PS3's home is a really cool feature, You can explore the PS3 world with different themes from various games. Which is really cool because you can see and interact with everyone else that is exploring Home as well.PS3 is a great system and I would recommend it to anyone as it is the premier system with the best features and is the most advanced gaming system to date(Other than PC's of course).

C. Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"Stabbity Stab Stab!","reviewText":"If you can overlook the storyline, this game is loads of backstabbing fun.  This whole ancestor animus gobbly gook of a storyline just seems like the developers were trying too hard to write one of those stories that just blows us away, but instead just wrote one that blows.  If they were to just leave out the whole future ancestor machine part of the story and focus on just Altair and his journey, i think i would have liked it more.  The gameplay is great fun but can get repetitive.  Im not a big fan of collecting flags in the different cities really, but the assassination missions are quite good.  You can kill just about anyone with your trusty arm dagger that extends at will and then retracts to hide.  I like that they made your character an arrogant a-hole too, it was a clever idea because your master is upset with a botched job you do at the beginning and you lose all your nifty equipment.  You are then forced to complete other missions while following the creed to obtain all your old weapons again.  I thought the sword fights were fun and once you master the counter move you are pretty much unstoppable.  Some people have complained about how you will be fighting one enemy and a group of his buddies come along and just seem to wait their turn to fight you instead of just jumping in all at once.  But i like to think that they are all just too frightened because they see you are such a masterful swordsman.  One other gripe i have is that the end of the game kind of leaves you hanging and doesn't really explain why you have been slaying half the country side for the entire game.  Yes Assassin's Creed has its flaws, but i myself can overlook them to appreciate the core gameplay.  Maybe the second creed game will retify all the problems of the first.

I had the original 3DS and loved it. Ps vita was okay. Not much was being released though. Anyways this is about the 3DS XL not the vita. The bigger screen makes the 3D a lot better and makes things easier to see. Everything looks better on the Xl. The system does not look as good as the original but looks can take a back seat. the other gripe i have with it is the power button is to flush to the system making the device a bit hard to turn off and on. That and no second circle pad. Other then that this is an awesome upgrade and great for people who play at home or pack there portables for the weekend like me.

{"product_name":"B00009WNZA","reviewerName":"Baseball \"Johnny\"","summary":"Good Game","reviewText":"I bought this in December and I really like this game. EA has really improved this game from the Sims and other Sims games. Yesterday, March 1st, 2005, the new The Sims University Expansion Pack came out and I just got it. It's so cool and you should no doubt buy it when you buy this game. The Sims is a really fun game because you can control the characters. You can build a family, buy a house, and guide your sim through it's life. My favorite town is Pleasantville but people have their own choices. If you get cheats you can have 50,000 simoleons and if you keep doing that cheat you can have loads of money! So if you just started out with only like 3,000 simoleons do the cheat and your family will be rich! Another thing I like about this game is that you can travel outside in a taxi. It's really cool and you can go anywhere you want. The graphics are very good especially for a computer. Well that's my only problem. I wish this game was on PlayStation 2 or Xbox also because I don't like playing it on the computer since it heats up too fast (usually on laptops). You should no doubtfully look into this game and buy the new expansion pack with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2005"}

Blending adventure elements with the racing elements Mario Kart 64 was known for, Rare's Mario Kart clone was a good effort but it has since sparked a furious debate as to whether it was better than Nintendo's game.In Diddy Kong Racing, 8 characters including Diddy Kong, band together to stop Wizpig, the main villain, from taking over their world by beating him at his own game: racing. You start out driving a kart and get to explore the huge over world with 4 different sections representing different areas. Your goal is to win balloons to unlock all of the areas. Each area has 4 stages to race through and when you come in first place, you earn a balloon. After you beat all 4 stages in an area, you unlock a race with the boss of the area. Beat the boss and you move on to the other areas to repeat the same process. Earn a certain amount of balloons to unlock Wizpig's area where you ultimately race against him to beat him and win the game. As you complete each stage, it becomes available for time trail and multi-player modes.The PROS: For starters, there is a lot to do here. Not only do you race around in carts but after you accept challenges from the Genie (the character you interact with the most), beat them and you unlock the ability to race around in a hovercraft and a plane. There are a lot of stages to complete and not only can you unlock two additional racers, meet a certain condition and you unlock a secret area with its own stages to race on. The game looks great considering it came out in 1997. The overall presentation, graphics, music and sound effects fit the overall happy mood of the game. Three of your friends can take you in the multi player mode and you can use kart, hovercraft or plane here as well. So yeah, it will keep you busy and it's fun but it depends on who plays it because....The CONS: of two issues that do hamper the overall gaming experience. First, this game is tough. The other racers will put up a fight and since you can use weapons to blast them or help yourself, so can the other racers. It's a different experience whenever you switch your type of ride so keep that in mind and because of it, you have to memorize the stages well to get an advantage. The tough difficulty this game brings may turn off some gamers. Also, this game requires a huge amount of backtracking which brings about a feeling of severe repetition. In order to get all the balloons, you must beat each stage 3 times and beat each boss of each area two times. Yes, you read that correct. The first time around, you must place first in each race. The second time around, you have to collect 8 silver coins scattered throughout each stage AND place first. The third time around, you must race through each stage back to back in a grand prix style and place first for the gold trophy. Since the computer racers were tough to begin with, expect to race the same stages over and over and over.Rare has a history of making tough games and Diddy Kong Racing follows this tradition. There's so much to do and look at and for the dedicated gamer, this game delivers. But for those who don't have a lot of time to invest or are easily frustrated by an intense learning curve this game brings, you may not want to play it. With its great graphics, main story mode with lots to do and a decent multi-player mode for you and 3 other players, Diddy Kong Racing is a good effort from Rare. Whether or not this is a better game compared to Mario Kart 64 depends on who you ask. Give it a try if you can get this for a low price. As an alternative, you can pick this up for the Nintendo DS but it went through some changes as a result of Rare porting it over.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2011"}

Is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore? Is there one game to give you an excuse to say to Playstation2 and X-Box and Gamecube owners, \"I know it's an old system, but this game is the reason I still own it\"? Yes, and that game is called \"Golden Eye 007\".It's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan \"Bond\" movies would become an undeniable classic. But that's exactly what \"Golden Eye\" is. Many first-person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay, while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players. Thankfully, \"Golden Eye\" is the diamond in the rough. It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination. Moving Bond, James Bond is as easy as breathing, and the shooting system is just as simple. Even with the horrible N64 controller, a player can learn how to play \"Golden Eye\" on the first or second try. And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI. Of course, because of the N64's difficult-to-program cartridge format, some things had to be sacrificed, like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot. But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters.Graphically, \"Golden Eye 007\" was a marvel to look at...when it was first released. Nowadays, when compared to games like \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" for the PS2 and \"Dead or Alive 3\" for the X-Box, \"Golden Eye\" looks like a SNES game. Because cartridges are limited in space, textures can be bland, character models look blocky, and detail is kept to a passable minimum. But anyone who doesn't care about graphics, as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent, shouldn't have any trouble with \"Golden Eye\".Soundwise, it's not the biggest strength of the game, but it's still good. Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done - a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it, at least to a certain extent. And voices, while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs, suit the game well. It would've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters, but the limitations of the cartridge format doesn't help this area much.All in all, \"Golden Eye\" is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming. While the N64 is arguably one of the worst Nintendo consoles to be released (alongside the horrendous Virtua Boy), it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the Gamecube was announced. \"Golden Eye\" is not only the game that many FPS fans point to as their favorite game, but many non-FPS gamers also found it very enjoyable. While later great first-person shooters like the N64's \"Perfect Dark\" and the recent X-Box million-seller \"Halo\" presented excellet FPS action with updated graphics to boot, \"Golden Eye\" will forever be remembered as the first-person shoot for the masses.If you need a reason to keep your N64, this is it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2002"}

The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.In a word, \"Goldeneye\" is amazing. It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth, fun, and challenging adventure. You assume the role of James Bond, the secret agent who needs no introduction. You run through various missions, which tie into the movie, and solve various problems and perform various tasks. What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight. As expected, you have a number of weapons at your disposal, from the silenced pistol and machine gun, to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives. The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game, with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond's charm.The graphics are phenominal, with smooth movements and amazing scenery. This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures. The music is right out of a Bond movie, and adds a nice edge to the action. The controls, usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller, are easy to manage here. After a while it becomes like second nature.For parents considering this game for their children, they should be aware of the violence. Much of the game is spent killing people, and the realism is striking. It is up to you, but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Misses the mark of past Jedi games just barely","reviewText":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (SW:TFU) at launch probably was one of the most hyped games of the year and fell flat on its face for multiple reasons.  Everything from glitches, game breaking bugs, messed up auto saves, combos that wouldn't trigger and unlockables that magically relocked themselves(yet couldn't be collected again on your save file).  At $20(what i paid for a copy) and all the patching this game is safe to purchase 'technically'.(see summary notes below why)Gameplay: As an avid Jedi Academy fan it has been far to long since I actually took out my light saber and had a good time in a hack n' slash manor.  This game definitely delivered on that aspect putting you in the shoes of Starkiller whom pretty much is a jedi/sith on steroids.  What dissapointed a lot of people was the fact you don't start with much force powers. For a big bad apprentice of the legendary Sith Lord - Darth Vader  he pretty much was a wimp.  You unlock abilities and costumes each level and get various light saber crystals and power crystals for your sabers as you go along.  The first play through cam honestly feel like a downer since the entire time you are basically finding holocron's to level up abilities or unlock combos, or even \"pimp\" starkiller out.  The real fun is AFTER you beat the game.  Now you got yourself a pimped out Starkiller, game plus it up and unleash the force!!!!  I found my second and third play throughs to be much more enjoyable  simply because I was not looking for costumes, crystals or 'gimped' by the game mechanics. I could play how I want, with what I want.Sound/Story: The sound effects are pretty good. Old fashion Star Wars effects, can't go wrong with that.  The music is classic also.  You feel like you are really in the star wars universe but at this point Lucas Arts has perfected the sound and audio.  It was odd to see the dialogue didn't sync with the mouths in cut scenes though.(could just be me though).  The story is actually pretty good I think.  While it won't win awards it keeps you entertained and the Dark Side / Light Side alternatives are pretty drastic but very interesting twistsGraphics/Presentation:  The graphics are amazing.  Game is 720p (unless forced to 1080p)  Planet and space backdrops are fluid and the force powers look and feel realistic.  There is a lot of 'force' behind them .  When you pick up a storm trooper he fails about in a panic and you can tell when you throw em into a wall it definitely hurt. The game did a great job with the environments but you also revisit areas so it wasn't really hard to polish up the planets.Length/Replay: The game is short as I beat it on my first run through in about 6 hours, but this is starting to seem like the norm on hack n' slash games but length really is just a piece of a game.  while short and areas get repetitive the replay factor of this game is VERY high.  Once you pimp our your starkiller it is fun to see just how much destruction you can bringSummary of \"cons\" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)- Despite heavy patching the game still has few bugs (if your saber gets glitched into a texture or you get force thrown into a texture you will have to restart checkpoint.  By doing so your saber now does ZERO damage and becomes worthless.  An easy fix for this is 1. just die  2. force power through the area to a cutscene) *nothing positive to say other than they fixed a ton of crucial bugs at least- The system set in place for the game hurts it on the first play through.  You don't exactly \"unleash\" like the title or trailers showed. [Now game plus it up, now we're talking!]- Not a lot of variety in design, revisiting places [they do a good job making it feel like a whole new world each time though]Overall Score: 78% (88% if you are a TRUE star wars fan! May the force be with you!)A must for a true Star Wars fan, and at $20 it is priced well.  However $30 for the DLC ($9.99 per map) is pricey and for the casual fan or player the DLC is simply not worth such a steep price.  The Ultimate Sith edition was taken out of print also fairly quickly. (my speculation is Lucas Arts felt they were giving away the DLC and wanted to milk us for more money, besides the \"Ultimate sith edition\" is actually just the ORIGINAL GAME disk w/ a DLC disk.  If you want to play a DLC map you actually have to put the DLC disk in the drive instead of the game disk.  Wow disk swapping on a PS3 with BLU-RAY? Even on the 360 I am sure they have space on the disks.  That is just being flat out cheap...but I'm also off-topic ^_^ )","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"With a few more tweaks, this game could have been the SITH!","reviewText":"I saw my enemies (my prey) and for a fleeting second, I pitied them. I knew their feeble training was no match for the teachings I had absorbed. However, I was taught that pity was for the weak. I could almost smell their fear as the battle commenced.The first got off easy. I lifted him with the power of The Force and flung his body over the railing to the molten depths below. The next one fired a blaster at me but I dodged his fire with a speedy Sith maneuver - it was the last thing he never saw. My last foe was in complete shock, and I used this to my advantage: I summoned the power of lightning from my fingertips to strike the very core of his being. As I left the room, I knew the danger was far from over...but I also had the sweet taste of victory in my mouth - and my palate would not be satisfied until my mission was complete.This is a glimpse inside the mind of Starkiller, the new apprentice of Darth Vader.Upon doing a little research, it's clear that LucasArts wanted to make a truly epic game. The Force Unleashed incorporates several different kinds of software:(1) Havok: This allows for a more lifelike world and animation, such as the ragdoll physics for the game characters.(2) Digital Molecular Matter (DMM): It allows objects in the game to break differently from each impact: wood splinters like wood, glass breaks like glass, and a structure can crumble due to lack of support.(3) Euphoria: Instead of using predefined animations, the characters' actions and reactions are synthesized in real-time; they are different every time, even when replaying the same scene.All of these are combined to provide a very compelling and vibrant world in which we can cultivate our character to become a force to be reckoned with.Each mission has a main objective and a number of separate, optional objectives which can increase our score, or reveal secret powerups. By leveling up, our character can increase his proficiency in Force Powers, Force Talents, and even Combinations. The lightsaber itself can be outfitted with different crystals - some change the color, others offer additional effects for protection or attacks. Costumes can be selected for the character to wear throughout the game, and a growing Databank allows us to read about different characters, locations, and vehicles. There is also a training room to hone your skills against a variety of foes. As you progress, you can select any level you have previously completed to go back and search for hidden items you may have missed. For those who want the quick and easy path, there is a code input screen to access levels and items with greater ease.So how is the gameplay itself?Well, it's got some excellent promise. This is not a typical \"Button Masher\" game; it requires the player to change their attack strategies for each opponent. Some will be affected by lightning, while others are not. Some enemies can be lifted and thrown with The Force, while others cannot. This keeps the gameplay from getting overly repetitive. There are more Star Wars cameos than you can shake a Gundark at, including the voice of Jimmy Smits reprising his role as Bail Organa.The powers are very well explained in the tutorials. I loved using the Sith Lightning for protection and attacks, the dash maneuver proved invaluable during boss battles, but I must say that the Force Lift felt a little clunky. Using two analog sticks to move an object was awkward and the targeting system fell short at times, missing the target I was trying to hit. It's curious to note thatPSI-OPS, a game with a telekinetic character, used a similar power which felt much more fluid...that game came out 4 years prior, ALSO using Havok software.The background music is a combination of the classic John Williams scores from the first 6 films, with new music specifically made for The Force Unleashed. Apparently the music changes with the pace and environment of any given moment. This truly allows us to feel like after all previous attempts, we are finally playing a truly epic Star Wars game.LucasArts has even announced expansion packs that will be available at the Playstation Network: new skins, and a new mission.So with all of this going for it, and being a Star Wars Fanboy, why can't I give this game 5 stars?Well...there were two incredibly frustrating segments to this game. I won't mention them here, but everyone who has played and completed this game knows exactly which segments I am referring to. I had to lower the difficulty level of the game in order to pass one of those segments, and I know that other gamers with less patience might have resorted to using a cheat code, or worse...turned the game off and advised their friends not to buy it - exactly what LucasArts would not want to happen. This game can be finished in about 3-4 days of intense playing. Sure, the effort put into the game is impressive, but if it's too quick to finish, most players won't want to pay the high price tag.The desire to unlock all the force powers will keep the fans going, and for those people who didn't like Episodes I-III, there's a hidden joke in one of the levels that'll keep you laughing for the rest of the game. However, if you want to play another Star Wars game with humor as your guide, look no further thanLego Star Wars.All in all, LucasArts clearly spent a lot of time and effort with The Force Unleashed. There was a time when I would avoid their games because the over-reliance on Star Wars material usually meant more games, but with lower quality.I can't wait to see what their next effort brings.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}

I would expect this to be a great gaming keyboard for Windows users.I tested this keyboard on a Mac, so the software part of this review ONLY relates to how it works on a Macintosh computer, not a Windows PC.Hardware:The keyboard has a solid feel to it and seems to be well made.  The detachable keypad is a great idea.  Although I am right handed, I can see how the detachable number pad could be pretty neat for left-handed users.  The keypad is held in place magnetically and can be connected to the left or right side of the keyboard.  I am not sure that this will make a big difference for lefties, as they are accustomed to the keypad being on the right side of the keyboard, but this could still be a welcome addition.The extra row of keys on the left side of the keyboard have caused me to place my left hand too far over a few times.  It will take some getting used to, but I have no complaints there.The backlighting is neat, but not really worth changing keyboards to get.  It would be great if you are using the computer in the dark though, just to figure out where all the extra keys are.  The backlighting intensity is adjustable via a knob on the keyboard.There is a volume control beside the backlighting control knob and it works exactly as you would expect.  I like it.Software:Here's where the keyboard takes a nosedive on the Mac.  The advanced features of the keyboard do not work on the Mac at all.  I was unable to test any of the macro features or anything of that nature, as they didn't work.Another Mac issue is that the Alt and Windows keys will not reverse in the control panel, even though I check the \"reverse alt and windows key\" option.  This makes common command-key strokes more difficult on the Mac, as you have to move your finger over an extra key.  This is almost a deal breaker for me, as I use command keys quite a bit.  I have reinstalled the software multiple times and it will still not reverse the keys, although the keys were reversed on my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard.I would not recommend this keyboard for Mac users, but it seems like it would be absolutely great for Windows users.  I like the feel of the keyboard and Microsoft has come up with some innovative ideas... if they only worked on a Mac.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2009"}

It's just this game gets on my nerves, such as Samus acting like a school girl, and the movement overall feels weird. And I hate how they gave you the first person view, but yet, you can't move, thats some stupid crap there. I love the Metroid franchise, I love Super Metroid, and the Metroid Prime Trilogy, but this game, just isn't a Metroid game. If if was some other game, I would've liked it more.The story very Anime conceived, and I like Anime, but I think they made Samus into a, not so strong Bounty Hunter, I mean Samus cowering over Ridely, come on. The scenery is fine, but not up to the standards set by the Prime trilogy. For an asking price of 17 bucks, thats what its worth.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2011"}

And returning with it is the swinging bionic arm game mechanic that made it so popular and critically acclaimed. Bionic Commando makes the move to 3D, and gamers will be able to grapple, swing, and scale a giant environment filled with buildings, canyons, and more..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; } img.withlink {border:1px #777777 solid;}There are many creative uses for your bionic arm.View larger.Being able to swing and shoot is an essential skill.View larger.Freely explore Ascension City and its outskirts.View larger.Ten players can get it on the action at the same time.View larger.Nathan Spencer is BackBionic Commando takes place 10 years after the 1988 game, with Nathan Spencer again the protagonist. Voiced by Mike Patton, ex-Faith No More singer, Spencer is betrayed by his government, falsely accused of murder and sentenced to execution. Just prior to his execution, however, the city is bombed and Spencer is asked to track down the terrorists in return for his freedom.Bionic Arm Offers New Control PossibilitiesLike in the original game, the bionic arm is what separates Bionic Commando from other games. With it, you can swing between buildings, grapple onto ledges and zip up, walk walls, pull apart the landscape, throw heavy objects, attack enemies, and more.Giant, Sweeping World to ExploreAs you swing around with your bionic arm, you'll be subjected to beautifully detailed scenery that ranges from Ascension City and its bridges and skyscrapers, to outdoor environments like canyons. By mastering different swinging techniques, players will be able to reach different areas and target enemies while mid-swing or even hanging upside down. If you misjudge your swing by even a little bit, you might find yourself plunging to your doom.Swinging Multiplayer Fun for up to Ten PlayersBionic Commando allows up to 10 players at a time to get in on the swinging fun, finding new ways and techniques with the bionic arm to dispatch your friends and enemies. Maps are designed with the swing and gun game mechanic in mind, rewarding players who are adept at simultaneously swinging and aiming.Bionic Commando is an updated and beautiful take on the classic, bringing the core elements of the 8-bit original into a beautiful, 3D world. Fans of the classic and newcomers alike will delight at the unique game play options that the bionic arm afford.","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Fun and under-appreciated","reviewText":"When Bionic Commando launched it was met with a lot of speculation and didn't receive many favorable reviews.  Many criticized the game for being all of the map really and not doing any of those elements right.  Having played through the game twice now people judged this game by the cover not by the overall contents, and having been gaming since back in ye olde days of the Atari 2600 this game brought the classic Bionic Commando into 3D without missing a beat.Gameplay: Not your every day video game I will be honest.  Like most games today there is a learning curve but they baby you into the game.  Bionic Commando basically doesn't pull its punches.  Right after the basic tutorial it is good luck, 'have fun storming the castle' pretty much.  Practice a bit with your timing and next thing you know you will be Tarzan with a grenade launcher.  Boss fights feel very epic and actually will make you think fast on your feet trying to find out the weakness of the boss. There also is no one way to actually fight enemies.  You can do everything from stomping on enemies, swinging and shooting, grabbing and throwing them into the air, throw objects , or simply pull out a gun and pew pew them all.  One gripe that anyone will notice is that until you get a hang of the game, your accuracy with firearms is pretty  much terrible until you pull off some nice challenge stunts to unlock some bonusesSound/Story: The voice acting is actually some of the best I have heard in a long time and pretty much carried the weak storyline of the game.  Sound effects were spot on alsoGraphics/Presentation: The graphics were actually really good.  The game runs at 720p unless you force 1080p.  I was surprised at how detailed they went with the background of the game.  The overall presentation of the game was smooth.  The game itself can be a challenge even on normal, as you might end up doing 10-15mins on stuff only to die and have to redo it.  Checkpoints are very fair though, and areas aren't super massive where 20+ mins of work magically vanishes because you missed that one grapple.Length/Replay: The game could be considered short especially once you get really good at it.  Master your swings and next thing you know in an hour you just plowed through 20% of the game.  Though it may be short, the game doesn't pull punches and you will enjoy the little twists and turns the game throws at you.  Replay factor is also a \"plus\" because there will be collectibles that just seem to taunt you.  They look so easy yet 10 mins later you are still trying to line up that swing or release just right, and then there always is the phantom collectible that taunts you since you never found it but it has to be in the level somewhere!  Plus once I got good at the game, it was just to much fun to swing and do a \"death from above\" onto a MECH since I got my timing down perfect.Summary of \"cons\" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)- Early on having to figure out shooting mechanics and grappling while avoiding bullets can be frustrating [But learning and mastering the system turns you into a complete unstoppable 'bionic commando']- Short game (under 7 hrs) [good replay though with collectibles and voice acting. Plus some maps are just fun to figure out different ways around enemies or just replay it to try and best your challenge count]Overall Score: 91%A must have for any action gamer at this point and price ($12 when I bought it).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"D_Strasse \"D_Strasse\"","summary":"Intermediate players perspective","reviewText":"I've been playing guitar for a long time, yet I'm still only what I'd consider an intermediate layer.  I know some scales, chords, and have a good understanding of the fretboard but I really haven't ever played in a band or put the 1000s upon 1000s of hours into being really great.  Here's my perspective of the game:Pros:- Game is a LOT of fun.  As someone who doesn't play in a band, it's awesome to be playing with a backing track and with all the necessary effects required to sound the part.- Adaptive difficulty.  Missed a bunch of notes, you get fewer of them, hit a lot and the game pushes you.  Difficulty always feels \"right\" IMHO.- Lots of songs.  Game does have a rock/hard rock bent so take that into account.- Tutorials.  Don't just play the songs but learn some of the techniques necessary to become a pro.- Other learning tools.  Technique games and Riff Repeater will help you nail teh songs as you progress.Cons:- Loading times.  I wish there was an install option for this game because the loading screens can add up and become a real bother after a while.- Layout.  As other reviewers mention, the layout while familiar to those that have played the Guitar Hero/Rock Band games isn't the best implementation here.  It really is too easy to mistake a 5 fret note for a 6th.  Really why should someone who KNOWS where the 6th fret is make mistakes for not being able to read what the game is tellnig you?  The colored strings is easy to get used to, but really normal tab layout would have been sooooo much better an idea.  I get that this method helps you by reading the note's name but how many people are paying attention to the fact that it is an A chord versus just trying to get their fingers in the right spots?- Cable length.  Cable at ~10ft can keep you closer to the TV than you intended.- Very laggy while in the menus.  Oddly lag isn't as apparaent while playing the songs or techniques, but during the loading screens the lag is jarring.- Only two difficulty levels.  Hard or adaptive.  It would be nice for some to play some games on easy, or medium without the burden of the game tossing in more notes if you do play a passage well.Summary:The game is a ton of fun, and it is recommended for those from beginners to those looking for some fun finger practice while learning some new songs.  Just remember the game isn't perfect nor the only tool you'll need to fully learn guitar.  That said it is a fun and powerful tool in that learn-to-play-guitar toolbelt.  Have fun rockin' out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2012"}

This games for YOU!I must say I really, really enjoyed the combat in this game it is very fluid and feels smooth. The loot system is great too, there is a huge variety of weapons to find and choose from. The RPG elements are nice, at times they take a backseat to the loot system. Otherwise the enemy's types are really cool and there is a good amount of variety to them. Their are 9 dungeons each can take about 20-30 minutes and after you beat those 9 you unlock alternative roots that you take to fight new bosses and enemies which take around 30-40 minutes. The game can take around 12 hours to complete and after that you unlock NEW GAME + which adds a great amount of variety. If you don't have friends to play it with there is always online co-op which is unlocked around level 10, there is even bots that you can eventually pick and choose who will fight with you. There are also side quests they your going to want to complete which will take add numerous amounts of replay ability to each dungeon.Overall the game is simple and at the same time simply amazing. If your on the fence about this game or even waiting for a price drop, just go for it. This game is totally worth 40-50 dollars, I was waiting for it to hit 20 dollars and I'm sure glad I didn't.
