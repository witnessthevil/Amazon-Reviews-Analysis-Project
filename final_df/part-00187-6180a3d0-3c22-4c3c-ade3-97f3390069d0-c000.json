{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"The Dreadful Aurora Engine","reviewText":"***Revised since the initial review with the patch 1.2***I reserved this game after the promising previews released by many medium.  Once the installation is completed, I was in for a shock.The game is quite linear, and many times you are confined to one small section of the worldmap until you complete enough essential quests to advance to the next level.  The game is divided into several chapters.  Within limit, you can do side quests any order you choose to or completely ignore them.  To emphasize the strong narrative drive and more character-driven game, certain sacrifice of freedom is understandable.  Not all RPGs should be TES (The Elder Scrolls) series.  What cause the serious flaw of the game is the engine that was used to create the game.The immersion is constantly broken and hindered by horrific engine called 'Aurora Engine'.  What could have been an impressive game is seriously marred by the dreadful 'Aurora Engine' by Bioware.  Although the Polish game developers 'CD Projekt' modified 'Aurora Engine', they inherited all the shortcoming of the engine such as long loading time, framerate issue, bad camera angle, etc.The biggest problem caused by this God-awful engine is the loading time.  You thought the loading time in 'NWN 2' was bad.  The excessive loading times last from 30 seconds to upward of 2 minutes.  It's bad enought that you do need to see the loading screen between indoor and outdoor environment, but God.  I've never experienced such a long loading time since 'Gothic 3'.  It breaks the immersion since you spend more time staring at your loading screen than traversing a tiny section of the game map at a time.  Games like 'Oblivion' and 'Two Worlds' put the entire 'absolutely gigantic in-game map' on a single loading within 10 seconds, why does 'The Withcher' requires longer than 2 minutes to load small section of in-game map?  Although 'Gothic 3' has arguably the worst loading time in the history of CRPG, once loading is done you don't have loading areas ever until you are dead.  As often as you need to move back and forth into diffrent loading areas in 'The Witcher', this is quite a back-breaker.***Revision Begins***With the patch 1.2, the loading time is significantly reduced, however, the initial loading takes still longer than 1 min close to 2 sometimes.  Loading into smaller area takes about 10 seconds, but coming out still takes 20 to 30 seconds.  The loading time is now definitely bearable, but still too long with all that required frequent loadings.***Revision Ends***Almost equally problemetic is the camera angle.  None of the three-available camera is good enough.  Furthermore, it is really difficult to adjust the camera position within the already-confined range of the camera.  At least in 'NWN2', the gamer had the ability to adjust the angle of the camera.Then comes the awful 'floating in the air' feel issue just as in 'NWN2'.  This issue will take tolls even on the most powerful computer rigs currently available, and lowering your video options will hardly improve the matter.  This is non-specs specific symptom caused by lack of optimization rather than serious stuttering framerate drop caused by lack of computer horsepower.  Once loading is completed, the framerate itself is very steady and the game runs very smooth without hiccup or tearing.Besides all the inherited evils from 'Aurora Engine', the combat mechanics is broken.  I give credit to the developers for trying to innovate RPG combat mechanics by combining turn-base / menu-driven combat and hack-and-slash click-fest combat.  Although it works in theory, the gamer will be too preoccuppied to connect the combo attack, they miss out on combat animation altogether.  The problem here is without constantly connecting chains of combo attack, you will not be able to carry out any attack, so you have to pay attention to on-screen signals to time your mouse-clicking.  At least in clickfest combat, you can fix your eyes on the animation and enjoy.It's a shame, because this game has some impressive plotline and depth of characters and conversation that hasn't been seen since 'Planescape: Torment'.  Past the aforementioned flaws, there are plenty of good gaming to be had, but what flaws the gamers are asked to overcome.Maybe some prefers isometric, bird's eye view camera angle deep into the 21st century.  Many people claims to be a hard-core RPG gamers, and are proud to enjoy the limited camera angle, uninvolving combat, and clumsy menu interfaces.  They wear them as if it were the badge of honor.  I still have the original copies of every single 'Ultima', 'Baldur's Gate', 'Fallout', 'Diablo' series along with 'Planescape: Torment'.  I enjoyed them in the past, and I'll cherish the awesome memories of them in the back of my mind, but I've moved on.  In the 20th century, they were more than acceptible because of the limitation of the technology.  I am forever ruined by non-linear, open-ended, free-form RPG such as TES, Two Worlds, and Gothic series.  Heck, even some 2D isometric CRPGs like 'Divine Divinity' and 'Sacred Gold' offer huge non-linear, open-ended, free-form game world that require no loading.  As much as I enjoy many games made by 'Bioware' engines, I really hate the fact that their games always give me this confined, limited feel due to the modular nature of the game world.  If I have to give up nonlinear gameplay, then I'll have the grandeur of Final Fantasy series anytime of the day.  If I have to give up more up close and personal combat over 'point and click with mouse', then I might as well just give up RPG altogether and enjoy the ever-terrific 'Total War' series.For those who can overcome the flaws of the game, character design is delicate and well-drawn, the environment is beautiful, dialogues are well-written, combat animation is exciting and various, and most of all, the story is distinctively different from the typical RPG elements.  Choices are plentiful during the conversations.  Many will affect the outcome in the future.  The game is a spiritual succesor of the RPG classic 'Planescape: Torment'.  If you ever played the game, you have some idea of what to expect.  The overall production value is exceptionally outstanding, and the game is nicely polished.  It is truly a shame because this game could have been one of the best RPG game without in-game technical flaws, and these are flaws patches cannot fix.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2007"}

The story kept me going but also makes me less apt to replay the game. The fights were not on par with Red Dead or GTA - maybe having played those games made this so much easier? Throwing an Intuition point at an interview assures you of success. The cases proceed in a criminally linear way. At crime scenes, you just wander aimlessly around waiting for the handset to rumble - you found a clue. This game has 3 disks but goes really quickly. Most of the bandwidth is for facial expressions. Unfortunately, facial expressions do not make for a great game or contribute to the outcome of an interview. It is pretty easy to tell if someone is staring at the ceiling without needing an HD rendering of their chin. All in all, you will feel like you are watching a movie that requires you to push a button at the end of each scene.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2011"}

There are stars to question, witnesses to badger, and the dark, grimy, gritty underworld to deal with. How does it hold up?First, hopefully it's clear that this is going to involve police procedure. You go from being a patrolman to a detective and along the way you have to search for clues, examine dead bodies, and chase down running suspects (\"why do they always have to run?\"). So if you're a wild-shoot-em type of person, this probably won't appeal to you. It involves a lot of methodical attention.That being said, if you enjoy the follow-clues types of games, there's a lot here to enjoy. You search the crime scene. You figure out which witnesses are lying and which are telling the truth. You go from place to place to draw out the storyline. You get to interrogate suspects and in complex cases you get to decide who should take the blame.The impressive facial system means you are seeing emotions and sidelong glances on the peoples' faces. You really can get a sense if they're dodging the truth of being honest. That then affects your choices.On the downside, the LA map is long and narrow - and this can be a royal pain as you move through missions. You can waste long stretches of times navigating from one area to another. It simply isn't fun.The interface can be fairly silly. You wave your mouse around waiting for something to buzz, to indicate a clue. You have a gun in your hand but you have to hold it at the exact right angle before the game acknowledges its presence.While some aspects integrate smoothly - like having a notebook in your hand to keep track of witnesses, clues, and locations, other parts are more silly. You're chasing a suspect but you have to stand still pointing at them for 10 seconds before you can fire a shot in the air? You find dead bodies and just flip them over before anyone can examine them? A person asks for a lawyer and you continue to browbeat them into submission?There's the find-cars-to-collect, military flashbacks, dirty cops, and other side-games to keep you entertained. Shoot-outs and boxing matches. But then there's also disembodied limbs floating through walls which bring laughter instead of serious immersion.There was a great deal of potential here, but there are enough flaws that should have been ironed out during beta testing to make me think this just wasn't ready for full release yet. I'll give it an 8/10 for pushing the boundary, but it definitely wasn't perfected.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2012"}

I have tried 12 hours in to grab the captivation others have experienced but have been unable. I suspect that this game has been over hyped by gaming hysteria.The graphics. Ok, motion capture is incredible but not new. Check out Enslaved for some of the best lifelike character animations and facial displays. This is the first clue that this has been over hyped. Cool but not ground breaking and certainly not enough to celebrate this as one of the greatest pieces of art to ever be released in games.The game play. Somewhat formulaic after the first couple of cases as it eases into slight boredom. I love RPG's ala BioWare so was not bothered by the trimming of the open world of RS's previous titles. The 2nd clue that the greatness of this game was over sold is the alleged choice system. The game will play out the same no matter what you choose. There is no moral or ethical consequences. It is a numbers game with no replaybility because any case you solve will play out exactly the same the next time you play.The enviroment. Mafia II captures this era much more beautifully and with a much more expansive world and story as did The Saboteur. While it does capture the film noir feel and the music is ok I don't feel immersion that other games have made me feel.Not a bad game. Just not great. If I could turn back time I would keep my money in my pocket and buy it used. Everything I have seen points me to believe the shelves will be filled with used copies in a few months after the hysteria resides and the truth is revealed.

{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"A taxing, rewarding, stressful, satisfying, punishing and soothing rollercoaster","reviewText":"XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a bit of a contradiction of a game. Not only is it vastly different than the common games of this current generation, but I stand by my title for this review because it will evoke a vast range of emotions from start to finish. Make no mistake, if you choose to play XCOM:Enemy Unknown the game will not - I repeat, NOT - make things easy on you, nor will it offer much in terms of showing where you went wrong. It's like the ironclad PE teacher who berates you for everything you're doing wrong. Make a single mistake, especially on \"Ironman Mode\", (which only allows for a single autosave that CONSTANTLY overwrites itself,) and the game will severely punish you. More than once I would play on Ironman on the Classic Difficulty (so called because the 1994 original XCOM was also so difficult), and at first everything seemed to go well, then without warning or time to adjust, the situation would spiral out of control. Suddenly entire continents that seemed okay were in danger of withdrawing from the XCOM project (thus forever losing their monthly funding and support staff they would otherwise contribute) and my soldiers would be woefully unprepared for the missions. Since a lot of what happens is randomized, this further made it difficult to get a good idea of what exactly went wrong and what I could have done to prevent it from happening. When you finally do get a good handle on how the underlying mechanics of the game work and you use them to your advantage and find yourself consistently winning, it is a good feeling, but the road there is long and hard. Again, this is by design. I will let you decide if that is a good thing or a bad thing.The controls are intuitive and simple; you will spend very little time learning how to control the curser,but sometimes the camera gets in the way. When lining up a rocket or grenade, you will sometimes have to rotate the camera to get a good angle, for example.The music is good and sets the tone, especially rght after you discover an enemy; it was designed to send a feeling of adrenaline and a sense of urgency and danger, and it shows. The soldier audio barks when they acknowledge an order, hit or miss an enemy, etc. do get a little repetitive, though.Gameplay wise, the game is a mixed bag, with the good generally outweighing the bad. Veterans of the 1994 classic will have no issue getting back into the feel of the turn-based strategy game, although newcomers may need to use the admittedly bare bones tutorial and/or a walkthrough to get an idea of how to play the game, and eventually play it well. Choices matter in this game; resources in the early to mid-game are tight, and carefully managing what little you have to invest into getting more of what you need is a critical skill. Knowing how to do that is the difference between winning and losing, especially on the harder difficulties where time is also a precious luxury you never have enough of.For fans of turn-based strategy games like Advance Wars, Great Big War Game, etc., this is an easy sell. For gamers who complain that today's games are way too easy, this game will chew you up and spit you out. It will make you carefully consider both short and long-term strategy, it will punish you for any mistake, it will even punish you when you're doing everything right,  it will test your patience, it will throw everything it has at you. But ultimately, when you've learned to master the beast, the feeling you get is like none other.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"The magic is back!","reviewText":"If you played the original XCOM years ago, chances are that you fell in love with the game. I first played it on the original Playstation and it really says something when a game that was basically a pretty shoddy PC port with more than a few performance issues kept pulling me back in. To this day, playing XCOM on the PS all those years ago is a period of my gaming history that I look back on very fondly, complete with stories that sound like incredibly detailed documents of actual battles and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that feels that way. Now XCOM makes its return to the next gen consoles bringing with it the turn based strategy genre, a genre that has seen next to no use this current generation. As a lifelong XCOM fan, I can say that this game not only does the original justice but it is easily one of the best games you can currently purchase, period.As hostile forces from outer space land on Earth, laying waste to everything and kidnapping innocent civilians for their nefarious schemes, it falls on the XCOM force to stop them by any means necessary. Funded by every major country, XCOM acts as a task force with many weapons and gadgets at their disposal. It's your job to make sure that you keep these countries somewhat satisfied with your performance and assist them whenever alien activity in their sectors gets a little hairy. A typical distress call might have you investigate a suspected UFO landing site. Another might require you to rescue a person of high importance to the council that you report to. You take your troops out and go survey these sites, trying not to destroy any UFO tech for future research purposes and if possible, catching the enemy alive so you can better study them and find out what makes them tick.XCOM plays just like it did with some minor changes to the core gameplay that don't take anything away from the original experience. It's been streamlined a bit and once you get the hang of it, you really start to appreciate just how simple they've made it in terms of control and strategy while managing to keep the game tru to the original. This is a tight and polished interface and it's very obvious that the developers had a very high level of respect for the original. Again, if you've played the original, I think you'll really appreciate what has been done to bring this game up to date.Theres's a micromanaging aspect to the game which is a load of fun in itself. Your underground base can be outfitted with a number of different rooms with varying purposes just like the original. You research the alien artifacts you get off of the battlefield and then fabricate items based on that research, giving you more of an edge not just on the battlefield but in your day to day operations. Better detection equipment, better weapons, better items... and that's just the icing on the cake.You can also customize your soldiers and rename them as you see fit. I tend to use my friends names and doing that makes the game incredibly personal because if you didn't know, XCOM isn't exacly a forgiving game. When your soldiers go out into battle, chances are that you've grown a little attached to these jarheads if they've already survived a handful of missions. When those same soldiers get dropped, it's hard to describe other than that you FEEL it. I recently lost my oldest veteran and the way he died was like something out of the most depressing war film you can think of, a sacrifice in the name of his brothers and sisters in combat. Some may feel that the game is cheap and too difficult as a result but this is what is at the core of XCOM. An unforgiving and more realistic battlefront where your soldiers will die if you're not careful.Everything about this game is done very well, from the Unreal engine graphics and the surround sound, which utilizes some fitting, spooky UFO type music for ambience and percussion based tracks for intense battles. The cinematics and tutorial messages that are seamlessly weaved into the game make it all a much more cinematic experience than what was possible beforehand. In fact, one of my wishes with the original was that it would somehow give you a more cinematic replay of your battles. Though that's not exactly what you get here, this is the closest you will get and it's pretty awesome.It'd be a shame if this game were to be ignored in favor of any other FPS type game that we've basically already played before we've even picked up the controller. With XCOM, you get true strategic gameplay that is a hell of a lot fun and incredibly involving. The original is rightfully considered one of THE best games of all time and this updated version is deserving of a place in the series and a very well crafted update to a timeless classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2012"}

In fact, you can probably see players from both games in the free roam and other modes. But there are mini games within the free roam multiplayer mode where it says you have to have the undead pack to play.

If you have played any of the Animal Crossing games you know that it is not all action packed but it is a more of a game to play to relax. As mayor you will be planning out the look of your village by not only building things that are needed (shops, bridges, etc) but also some public works as well (fountains, wells, etc).  Seeing as your mayor it doesn't mean you cannot have any fun as you can go fishing, digging for fossils, catching bugs as well as interacting with all the villagers that are in the town.One thing that is a massive improvement over the other games is the graphics as the characters are now a bit taller as you can customize your character from head to toe. Pants, shoes and socks can now be bought so you can make your character look more like you or give him or her some wacky clothing as well.  This is a game that simply cannot be played for a few hours and just beaten and moved on to the next game. This is an experience that will give you at least 50 hours of gameplay and you can even open your town to other people online!Whether or not you have played the previous games in this series this is one game that is a must if you have a 3DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}

This war has left the planet icy, cold and nearly inhospitable resulting in the death of all but a few million humans. These humans prayed to the Aesir and worship the ODIN (Organically Distributed Intelligence Network) and were blessed by the Gods, who sheltered the few remaining humans in an enclave known as Midgard.GraphicsThe graphics in Too Human are what you'd expect from a game that came out half way through the consoles life, they look good but aren't hyper realistic like Halo, Call of Duty or Elder Scrolls. They relate more to Dead Rising, Crackdown or Saint's Row. All in all, the graphics are standard, nothing special, nothing good or bad.ControlsUsually controls are tough to talk about due to them usually being so generic, Too Human is different in this way. The left thumbstick moves Baldur around, but to attack, you lean the right stick in the direction you want to attack and tapping to launch enemies with melee weapons. Guns can be tough to control, especially if you're using two at a time so practice is needed with them. Rifles are capable of launching grenades which is very helpful against groups of enemies. If you can adjust to these controls, you'll have a lot of fun with the game, just give it some time.Music/Sound/VoiceSadly, there is little of all of them in the game, in-between fights you'll be listening to little or nothing at all. Only when in combat do you hear anything, and honestly, the music is nothing special. Sound effects seem to be repeated after a bit, but switching what you do can alleviate that issue pretty quick (don't use the same move over and over and over and over).OtherThe game can be very difficult at times, especially on higher difficulties; enemies will have various immunities at all times on tougher levels, making strategy mandatory. So mastering this game can be tough, but is very rewarding as you'll get some of the best armor and weapons.The one thing that REALLY stands out is the ability to customize Baldur after a certain point, you can change his armor color, bonus stats and weapon effects, as well as a few other things I won't mention.The multiplayer is pretty well done as well, I never had any issues with players joining my game and it is always fun to play hack & slash games with a friend. This can either make the game tougher or easier, depending on the skill of the players.Achievements: A good chunk of the achievements will come naturally, some of the others will require skill (beat the 4 levels WITHOUT dying), patience (obtain 10,000 drops) and luck (complete a full set of Epic gear). With time, you should be able to get them though.OverallToo Human is a fun game if given a chance, best played with a friend and not for the weak of heart.8.5/10.0Pros- Norse Mythology driven story (kinda)- Ability to customize is great- Tough game that's rewardingCons- Steep learning curve- Will give many players a headache- Bland musical scoreRead more at lvgrb.blogspot","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

It made my 6.5 year wait to get a PS3 so much easier on me, Amazon shipping is always really fast.So my shipping experience was awesome, what about the item itself? Well after I freaked out with glee over finally getting my first HD console(more importantly, the best one on the market today) I spent around three hours sampling the two Uncharted games(very impressive, even in 480i because I forgot to get HDMI cords and the cords that come with the system are lame; I'm moving from 1080p 60 FPS PC gaming to this and Uncharted 2's still prettier than any PC game I've ever played) and I've spent roughly the past two hours playing the first inFamous title. Outside of the floaty movement and difficulty of the combat, it may end up one of my favorite games this generation. It's really great so far, I'm excited I got the sequel AND the spinoff PSN sequel inFamous: Festival of Blood. I'm undoubtedly going to play through each game on the good AND evil paths, maybe I'll even try out a mixed path later to see how complex the game can get.Probably most surprising was the 30-day PS+ trial. Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition, Ratchet & Clank: A41, Quantum Conundrum, Dungeon Defenders? They really aren't holding out on us with their free PS+ games, it easily convinced me to try to get a year-long PS+ membership very soon. It looks like it's the best value in gaming so far, I'm just worried it's so great now to try to trap users into the service or to make it required or something. The reason I won't even consider getting a 360 is the monthly fee requirement to play your games online, if Sony pulled something like that I'm not sure what I'd do.Still, I went from having five PS3 games to temporarily having over 12 PS3 titles PLUS some great Vita games(I finally get to play Gravity Rush, wootwoot). There's no way that's a bad deal at no cost to me.The system looks sexy and sleek, but uneven due to the disc-slide-tray mechanism thing. Just isn't very smooth on the top. It also lets out more heat than I'd expected, but it's nowhere near as bad in terms of heat output as my gaming computer or my friend's 360. This won't heat up my room as bad as my computer sometimes does, but it just might raise the temperature in here a little. Eh, it's Winter, a little heat is better than none at all or too much. Funny, that ends up being a plus in the end... for now.Last thing, I also got my second package from Amazon about half an hour ago(also with 5-8 day shipping, ordered only a day prior) with Arkham City: GOTY in it. This is shaping up to be my best Christmas ever by far, in terms of material gains. I haven't been this happy with my video games in a LONG time.At the end of the day, this PS3 cost me $200 along with quite a few free games and a decent-sized hard drive. It's the newer, slimmer model so it'll be easier to take to friends' houses and it'll use up less electricity/produce less heat, AND IT ONLY COST $200. Easily the best PS3 deal I've seen to date, I'm so glad I was able to snag it. Next up I'm gonna focus on getting a nice Move controller setup and another DS3 or two for multiplayer and new ways to play games. I've always wanted to play lightgun games at home, Move looks like the best way to do it. SOOO excited.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}

The Pro Elite Wireless positions its analog sticks asymmetrically, with left analog stick up and the right analog stick down. This design helps prevent cramping during extended gaming sessions and is especially ideal for first-person shooters. The R2 buttons have also been repositioned for greater accessibility while gaming. Additionally, all of the buttons are backlit, so you'll still be able to game in the dark.Ergonomic, Natural DesignErgonomically designed, the Pro Elite Wireless provides optimal comfort for all hand sizes. Its textured rubber grips are soft and breathable, so your gaming won't be ruined by sweaty palms. The palm handles have been expanded to provide a more generous area for gripping the controller. And with its gently contoured edges, the Pro Elite Wireless helps alleviate pressure on your hands to ensure comfort.Precise SIXAXIS Motion ControlNot only is the Pro Elite Wireless comfortable and intuitive, it's also compatible with SIXAXIS games. Using a fine-tuned accelerometer and gyroscope, the Pro Elite Wireless can sense your movements and translate them into the game. This gives you more direct, lifelike control over the events in your game. To get the most out of SIXAXIS-heavy games like Warhawk and Heavenly Sword, you'll need the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.Rumble Feedback for Immersive GameplayFully supporting rumble feedback, the Pro Elite Wireless uses two vibrating motors on either side of the controller to create a rumbling sensation at certain moments during the game. This makes yaour gaming experience even more immersive, as you're able to feel every gunshot and explosion in visceral detail.The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is backed by a two-year warranty.

The small PS3 controllers seem small and painful to use over a long period of time and I can't grip them easily to get precise control.  I've always liked the xbox360 controller over the PS3 and hoped I could find one like it.Well, I've come as close as I can so far.  This controller is more comfortable than the PS3, at least to me.  It is larger, easier to grip, the analog stick on the left is in the upper position (like a 360) and has more heft to it.  The grip has a textured surface which I like, but you if you like a smooth feel this may be a con for you.The problem is the dead zones/sensitivity.  The triggers feel fine, comparable to the PS3 more than the xbox.  The problem is their sensitivity.  They aren't as linear proportional as the regular PS3.  I do like their feel, but would like a little more up turn on the bottom edge, to prevent finger slipping.The other issue is the analog stick dead zones.  Like the trigger buttons they aren't linearly proportional.  Precise control, for me, is very difficult.  A little movement won't cause any movement on screen, as you move it further out it causes a sudden vast  movement (more exponential, than linear).I'm not trying to say they are unusable, but it does make precise control for racing or first person shooters more difficult.Battery life seems as good as the PS3 controller.  I wish it didn't need the USB dongle to work, but I can live with it.Overall I really like the controller and will use it over the PS3.  I would recommend it for anyone that likes the xbox360 controller or feels the PS3 is small and hard to grip.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Returning to Rapture Doesn't Feel TOO Different.","reviewText":"Bioshock 2 is a first person shooter set in an underwater dystopia called Rapture. The player must seek resolution to events that occurred over a decade ago, when times were much simpler, and of course before the downfall of Rapture.  Things have changed since the first time you submerged in the original Bioshock. Things seem to of gotten worse, to balance this you will become one of the most feared enemies in the original, a Big Daddy.As a big daddy your arsenal has been altered, and why not when you're a metallic gargantuan wonder, in place of a tiny Thompson you'll now be equipped with a destructive .50 cal machine gun.  A Big Daddy has a very special role in the series, as a protector of Little Sisters, things can get up and personal no worries your hand is drill. So while a few tweaks definitely make the gameplay more interesting, sadly a few water drops pelt this sequel.While a story of decaying sanity is still apparent, by finding audio logs of past residents within Rapture, the overall premise of the story at foot here just isn't as engrossing as the original. This could be due to the original having so many firsts, from plot twists to the marvel of realizing the scope and location of the game. Fortunately Bioshock 2 makes up for this by strengthening the gameplay. The graphics are richened, blues glow, reds violently explore dark depths, and colors swell and pop. Atmospherics reign supreme in this game, from every flickering shadow, leaking ceiling and warmly lit room, this game illustrates a world worth inspecting. Controls can be a bit confusing when compared to the standard fps floating amongst the market. Rest assures they become second nature, and are quite convenient for the game play at hand. You'll be shifting through weaponry and plasmids in no time. Good thing to with the vast unlocks available online and off, you'll want to be exploring all these techniques.In case you're wondering, plasmids are specially altered genetics capable of giving one the ability to launch fire, shoot lightning, or launch a swarm of bees toward enemies.  Mulitplayer is a large and fun addition to the game.  Plasmids and gene tonics (always active bonus skills) are the core build up for the mayhem. A tiny plot is mixed into the multiplayer serving as a brief prolog even before the events of Bioshock 1. Before you begin the onslaught, take some time and pick out your character, there aesthetics and there melee weapon. Players can duke it out online (no splitscreen to speak of sorry) in a free for all, a capture the flag variant (involving little sisters), or classic team death match. Other modes are available on top of it all. As you play online you'll earn experience, though in this case it's called ADAM, with enough you can unlock new weapons, weapon attachments, and all the genetics one could possibly want. Per loadout (customizable class) two weapons can be held, two plasmids, and three gene tonics. Play with them and find what works best for you, are you the stealthy type?My only true gripe with the game deals with the Big Daddy you play as. For such a powerful and terrifying foe in the original, you seem to be quite the runt in this one. I understand that there are different models to be dealt with here, but it's almost as if a reskin was trying to cut it (oh and louder footsteps). This isn't bad but can take one out of the experience. Making it feel like you are just playing a leangthy expansion to the original, as no real significant changes are present.Returning to Rapture, there is a lot to discover. Tons of items and exploration can lead to hours of extended gameplay. Alternate endings, lengthy 10+ hour campaign, weapon upgrades, it's all here. Rapture and its inhabitants probably wouldn't welcome you back, but the developers certainly made sure it feels that way.In case anybody was wondering, I purchased the Collectors Edition. The contents have been clearly analyzed by many, just to add to it all I to find it worth the 100$. The music from Gary Schyman really impressed me with his understanding and appreciation for music. The vinyl record included (featuring the original titles score) was intensely satisfying to listen to, the CD I have not checked out as it features music from this game and I've been playing with my ears open. The book is richly detailed, serving as a much better commentary then any disc in recent years for a game has. The three posters I have not checked out yet, but intend to sooner or later. Everything about this boxset is quality, and it really makes me happy to know I didn't purchase yet again another bottom of the barrel `special' edition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}

The environments are totally interactive like throwing someone in a fish tank and see the fish tank break.  The bosses are hard but the levels themselves aren't that terribly hard untill you get towards the end then it's really hard.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Simply spectacular","reviewText":"Like Final Fantasy III before it, Final Fantasy IV has undergone a complete makeover for it's transition to the DS, and the game as a whole is a simply spectacular achievement.  Completely remade in lush 3-D, Final Fantasy IV returns players to familiar faces like Cecil and Rosa as your journey begins.  And what a journey it is.  Final Fantasy IV for the DS blows the previously released, and well done, version for the GBA that came out a few years back, and despite the game's transition to 3-D, the core gameplay remains the same, and the overall experience has become all the better as well.  The game looks great for a DS game, and while it hardly takes advantage of the DS' touch screen capabilities, there's really no reason for it to either.  Customizing your characters is enjoyably addictive thanks to the new augment system, and the game seems more challenging as a whole as well.  If there's any downside to Final Fantasy IV, it's that the voice acting is pretty weak.  While it's nice to finally hear Cecil and his crew talk, the voice acting just comes off as kind of lame.  That aside, there's a spectacular story here (one of the best of the entire Final Fantasy series) and deep, engaging gameplay that doesn't disappoint on any level whatsoever, so this is a minor gripe at the very best.  All in all, Final Fantasy IV is a brilliant re-imagining of a classic game that any and every DS owning Final Fantasy and/or RPG fan should definitely pick up, and may very well be the best RPG available for Nintendo's dual screened handheld at this time.  Thanks Square, you've done it again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2008"}

New vehicles including M4 Flamethrower Tanks, and PT boats.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"First MoH game to change things up","reviewText":"The Good: Great visuals, solid action, guns feel good, the change of scenery is niceThe Bad: No health packs means constant deaths, constant relying on quick saves, friendly AI is dumb as dirt, action gets repetitive, not enough cinematic moments, framerate drops for no reason2004 was a year where WWII games were at their peak, Rising Sun was a huge disappointment, so EA went after the Pacific theatre again with Pacific Assault. The game was much better than Rising Sun and was a graphical showcase. It pushed PCs to their limits back then and was a solid shooter. The only problem was that it didn't advance the series' formula at all and was just another shooting gallery. It did have some great cinematic moments and showed what Medal of Honor could really do on better hardware. The consoles couldn't handle what Pacific Assault was able to do to it remained the last PC exclusive MoH game.The game starts out with the storming of Atawa Atoll beach on November 20, 1943, 8 months before the French D-Day that is so famous. The game takes you through the jungles of Japan in some pretty narly guerrilla warfare. There's lush flora in your way, and the Pacific theatre was a huge change of scenery from all the European battles everyone was tired of. Many new weapons were introduced like the Japanese weapons and some others like the Riot Gun. One scene has you carrying an MG to set up an ambush along a river. You can pick it up and move it. It's nice to see things like this in WWII games but there just isn't enough like that.Most of the campaign was just endless jungles and disabling this machine gun nest, eliminate those patrols. It repeated over and over for about 6-8 hours. The one mission where you were in a plane was nice because you controlled the rear MG and then took over the plane itself. The controls were a bit hard to get used to because the whole thing is controlled with just the mouse. The game was relentlessly difficult like all Medal of Honor games. You couldn't refill your plane's health so if you died you restarted the entire level or your last quick save. The checkpoints are spread very far apart so rely on constantly quick saving otherwise you will be angry. I also didn't like the default control setup. Aiming was done with Left Alt and melee was done with the right mouse button. What kind of controls are those?! I had to change them manually.The game is also full of bugs and glitches. Most were patched but some still exist. The game crashes every so often, friendly AI gets in your way to where you can't advance and have to enable the developer console and use noclip to get through them. The biggest issue is that you have a health bar and can't refill it with health packs. Once you die a corpsman will come heal you, if you're lucky. They only came some times and I died often because of the stupid AI. Why not give me health packs like older MoH games? With that aside the weapons feel great to shoot and the action is solid. There's a lot going on screen, but the framerate can't keep up with the action. Back in the day everyone thought it was because the engine pushed PCs too hard, now that PCs are way more advanced it's just the engine. I got 60 FPS most of the time then suddenly it dropped below 20 for no reason.Pacific Assault is a solid shooter, and if you missed out on this try it out. Almost any computer can run this game these days, so there's no excuse not to. Pacific Assault is also one of the better Medal of Honor games and really advanced the series past the dated gameplay from Rising Sun and back.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

I played this game all the way up to Gran Pulse, and lost interest at that point. My biggest gripe with this game is that IT IS VERY LINEAR, and you CANNOT deviate from the storyline to do side quests at all until you get to Gran Pulse.Gran Pulse is at the 80% completion mark of the game, and by the time I reached that point, I got burnt out. I felt like the game was a major cookie cutter design in terms of it being a big graphical fest, and following all of the point A to B spots on the map. Also, you cannot choose who is in your party until you get to Chapter 10, which is the 30 hour mark. The fun part of the game is the paradigm system, which allows you to change the roles of your party members on the fly. Sometimes someone needs to tank, someone needs to buff/debuff, heal, and other times all three need to DPS like crazy to beat enrage timers.I would have liked this game a lot more, and would have beat it all the way until the very end, if it would have allowed me to do side quests at my own disposal. The long stretches of following a single line while fighting the same monsters over and over again, and not knowing who was going to come and go in my party, became dull. I absolutely hated when I would deck out a character in fancy gear, and then them deciding to go wander off and not being able to get the gear back until hours later.The story is somewhat convoluted, and details on what is going on get lost along the way if you are not paying attention. There were some elements in the story that were confusing, like locations mentioned over and over again. I thought Gran Pulse was a city on the same planet, but it is actually located elsewhere... Confusing. It seems to me like the writers are running out of ideas, and they thought adding all these confusing ideas and locations would be entertaining, while they just detract from the story. For me, the Final Fantasy series has actually reached it's final fantasy. I went ahead and read the ending of the story through an online forum, and have NO interest in playing FF XIII-2 due to how the story goes at that point.End the series on a somewhat good note, Square Enix... If they want to do something to make money, then I suggest them going back to the older parts of the series and giving the graphics a facelift, and releasing them for the next-gen consoles. Don't keep taking these recycled stories & linear ideas and throwing them in a blender hoping for a different result. The graphics and the paradigm system is really the only things that kept me interested enough to play it as far as reaching Gran Pulse.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

Taegel","summary":"Very Enjoyable Dynamic Stealth Assassination Game","reviewText":"Gamers will recognize structural elements from Bioshock, which, to my mind, is a very good thing.  Here, however, the stealth mechanics work flawlessly, and your magical abilities aren't simply various weapons.  Rather, the mechanics allow you to teleport short distances, see through walls (a la Batman, Deus Ex, Assassin's Creed, etc) and inhabit animals and other humans.  Not only are these mechanics just cool, they allow you to attack objectives in a multiplicity of ways.  DISHONORED is thus a game that can sustain at least a few play throughs.TIPS:Get Dark Vision Immediately.Then Upgrade Blink to level 2.Then upgrade Agility to 1, as your ability to jump higher will enable higher blinks. Agility 2 is useless.Then get Bend time. Then STOP time. Stop time costs 8 runes, and it's worth it--especially when you want to kill Tall Boys.My only gripe would be that the game seems to punish you for being what you are--an assassin-- as killing just a moderate amount of people (in video game reality, obviously) leads to the \"dark\" ending.  To that I ask, who hired the Church Lady as a designer on this thing?  I did my best to spare non-combatants, yet the game still seems to take a dim view of killing. And I won't give anything away, but the \"dark\" ending is not satisfying. I was hoping for at least something bittersweet, like the end of The Searchers.There's also no barometer to give you real-time data on how much \"chaos\" you're creating.  However, you do get your stats at the end of a mission.  So if you're going for the no-kill play through, you ca re-do that mission if you  accidentally killed someone. (Unlike Deus Ex, which kept you guessing until the end--Lame.)It would be good to have some \"chaos\" gradations in this game.  Therefore, you could have a play through with1. a normal ending (you killed a lot of guys because you're a badasss and they got in your way) but spared civilians, knocked out people when you could and weren't a complete psycho),2. an ending where you were one of the Super Friends (you killed very few people).3. a REALLY twisted ending where you played through as a complete homicidal maniac--killing everyone and their pets without compunction and without mercy and often without reason except because there's something wrong with you.However, I simply played how I wanted--with a fairly strict scorched Earth policy--and watched the \"happy\" ending on YouTube.  Maybe I'll do a no-kill play through at some later point.But this is pretty nit-picky.  Playing the game is really fun.  I'm just a little irritated by the end (if you didn't get that).In conclusion, if you dig first person stealth action games with broad (though not strictly open) worlds, buy this game.  It's great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2012"}

The graphics and sound are shadows of its descendents, but the gameplay is addictive and the story is stunningly rich and thoughtful. Players guide parties of four characters on a series of quests to defeat four ancient demons and save the world--which is also stuck in a time loop!","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"one of my all time favorites","reviewText":"When I first played Final Fantasy for the NES, I had been playing video games for a couple of years.  I'm not sure I had yet played Dragon Warrior, but I know that I had never heard of an RPG.  I received this game for Christmas one year and just started playing.  Even though the gameplay was so different and I only got to tell the characters what to do instead of controlling them, I was absolutely engrossed in the game.  I couldn't put it down.  I spent time fighting Imps, beating the Pirates in Pravoka, and venturing into the Marsh Cave (but not before level 9).  I loved this new game.Compared to RPGs today, Final Fantasy had an incredibly simple story.  The world is in trouble (naturally).  Four Fiends of Fire, Earth, Air, and Water have ruined the land.  A prophecy states that four warriors of Light would come to save the world.  You control these Light Warriors and get to pick the character classes of your party (Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, Red/White/Black Mage).  It is your quest to destroy this evil plaguing the land and restore the Crystals which give the land its strength.  You fight and level up your characters so that they will be stronger and are able to destroy the more difficult enemies.  You buy items to keep your characters strong.  You buy weapons and armor so that you characters will be able to fight more effectively and live longer.I only had two problems with this game when I was first playing it for the NES.  One: if one of your characters kills an enemy but another character is still targeting that enemy, your second character will attack the empty space where the enemy used to be.  That character wastes his turn.  It made me use a lot more strategy when fighting (which may have been the reason), but it didn't make sense.  If you were in a fight against a pack of wolves and your friend killed one, would you still fight the dead wolf or retarget against a live one?  Yeah, me too.  Two: This is a problem with the NES.  Since this is a battery backed game in order to save your progress, I had many instances of the save data erasing on me when I was hours and hours deep into the game.  That's probably why I can walk through the first portion of the game without and guidance whatsoever and it is only near the end that I have to try to remember what to do.There are games for the Nintendo that I like better, but Final Fantasy remains one of my all time favorite games and it is perhaps the most influential in my gaming life.  Without Final Fantasy, I probably would not play RPGs as much as I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Markus Egger \"www.MarkusEgger.com/blog\"","summary":"The Ultimate (Travel) Companion","reviewText":"This device surpassed all my expectations.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Scott W.

Final Fantasy Tactics has at least two of those indications. 1) Although the Playstation 1 is in its Dark Ages, many last-second RPG's are using the Final Fantasy Tactics battle system. 2) The game had to be reissued, due to popular demand.GRAPHICS: Grade of &quot;A&quot;. Yes, they do look like they can be done on a Super Nintendo, but this game isn't TRYING to be graphically intense. Does Tetris need great graphics? Most certainly not, because it's a puzzle game. Likewise, FFT doesn't need good graphcis because it's a strategy game, where too much detail would possibly get in the way and be a distraction.MUSIC: Grade of &quot;A&quot;. Some people will tell you that the FFT soundtrack is the best videogame soundtrack ever. I don't know if I'd go that far, but I must say, the music fits PERFECTLY with the game. There are tons of battles in this game, but there is a LOT of variety in the music. Best of all, the music actually puts you in the MOOD to whip out that sword and cream those foes. Germinas Peak, Sweegy Woods, Back Fire, Boss Battle themes, are among my favorites.GAMEPLAY: Strategy games can sometimes be synonymous with &quot;difficult&quot;. And believe me, this game IS difficult. BUT NOT TO LEARN! Someone definitely had their hat on right when they made the intuitive battle system. Move, Act, or Wait are your three primary commands, and they become second-nature within an hour. Also, one can equip their characters with many pieces of equipment. This sounds tedious, but there is a nice feature called a &quot;Fitting Room&quot; that makes all the boredom of &quot;Buy, Exit Menu, Equip, Go back to store, Sell&quot; so much simpler. But what makes the game difficult are the battles. Some are ridiculously easy, but others will require some leveling up in the field, first. FFT brings back the Job system that was in FF5, allowing for a more-than-generous amount of customizability.STORYLINE: This is where the game could use a little help. For one, the translation has speling errors, wordssmashed together punctuation problems, and sometimes I just don't understand what is going on. Materia-like crystals play a vital role. One thing that I found amusing was that nearly every between-battles sequence involves a death. To me, the storyline is just a peripheral. If you understand it, fine. If not, fine. You're here to fight battles and listen to the music, mostly.FINAL: I'd give it 4.5 stars out of 5. One thing that this game has, though, is REPLAY VALUE. You can beat it in 30 hours, but you can probably play it another 30 times, no problem.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2001"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Despite the short time it took to make Soul Calibur 3, the game is very impressive","reviewText":"Soul Calibur 3 is definitely one of the best games to his the Playstation 2 for 2005-06. It features extremely polished and well done graphics, a well augmented fighting engine (compared to the engine of SC2 which had some complaints), and plenty of replay value with it's enhanced single player modes.One of the negatives that the game faces is that after the \"guest character\" extravaganza of Soul Calibur 2, people were expecting there to be a guest character on Soul Calibur 3. Sadly, we haven't had any such luck, but thankfully Namco had put in a \"Create-A-Character\" mode in place of the \"guest character\".The create-a-character mode is very well done, and allows you to create a plethora of video game and anime characters, as well as almost anyone else you could possibly imagine. The only drawbacks to the create-a-character mode is that you cannot fine-tune the faces as much as you can on games such as the WWE games, and you have to unlock most of the costume parts and features of the create-a-character mode. To unlock said parts and features, one must play through the game's \"Tale of Souls\" and \"Chronicles of the Sword\" mode.Tales of Souls is the single player story mode in Soul Calibur 3, and it is another place in the game where some negative comments have been stirred up. These negatives are due to the fact that you cannot change the difficulty of ToS, and as a result it starts out easy and quickly goes to extremely frustrating as the computer will become VERY aggressive and block/counter just about every move you throw at it. It is still beatable, but this is a major hamper on players who are new to Soul Calibur. Aside from this negative, ToS is very entertaining, and features a rather well fleshed out storyline for each of the characters in the game, which is somewhat unusual for a fighting game. It allows you to chose your own path, and make different choices in the cut-scenes, depending on what buttons you press. As a result, you can influence how well you will do in the preceding fights, as well as change the very ending for each character.Chronicles of the Sword is the \"adventure\" mode of the game, and it plays similar to that of a RPG/Strategy game like Shining Force. The only difference is that when your units get into a fight, they duke it out via Soul Calibur's fighting engine instead of via an rpg battle. This mode is creative, although it's storyline is a little non-existent. Still, it is enjoyable, and is worth playing if you wish to unlock most of the in-game content.Overall, SC3 is a pleasant surprise despite the short amount of time that the game took to make. It features some of the best graphics you will ever find on a PS2 game, and it plays well to boot. This game is definitely recommended for anyone who is a fighting game fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2006"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player.

It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Omnes","summary":"The first season of a great game","reviewText":"For a few years, I had heard of this game that Sam Lake wanted to do, a story in which a writer becomes the hero of a novel that he apparently wrote, but doesn't remember doing so. And unlike what I was expecting, which was a game a bit rushed out and unpolished for sometimes certain companies don't want to do great games, but instead rushed out products so that can get as much money as possible, to the detriment of the game and the designer's talent, this game is instead another proof that Sam Lake is a very talented writer and game designer.Each level is designed as an episode of a tv series, called Alan Wake, where there is a summary starting from the second till the sixth episode, product placements with items like Energizer batteries and Verizon cell phones, and many references to horror classics such as the X-Files, The Birds, and Stephen King's works. Though I sometimes felt that it was a bit unnecessary to have Alan Wake say out loud certain references like when the Taken tries to get to Alan by axing down a door, or the Birds that attack Barry inside his chalet since those references are very popular. At least Sam Lake shows is this game that he respects and considers Stephen King as an important author and not a best-seller machine which is what certain intellectuals believe.Apart from the story, I also loved the Night Springs mini-episodes that you can watch on certain televisions. The suspense is excellent and I still wished that Sam Lake had put them in the extras, among the soundtrack and the radios shows that you uncover during the game. Among my favorite songs, I loved the Poet and the muse by the old gods of Asgard, Up jumped the Devil by Nick Cage and the Bad Seeds, and Haunted by Poe.Visually the game is excellent and the landscape is gorgeous. At night, the lighting department manages to create very scary environments, where one isn't too sure if there won't be a Taken around the corner to attack you, even when you're certain that there is no enemy around. The same can be said for the audio, which adds to the tension and encourages you to be careful to the sounds you hear as each one may be a Taken who is approaching.There are however two things one must know about this game. First of all that it is not an open-world as in Red Dead redemption or Grand Theft Auto. However for each level, you get to be in a specific environment, very wide and impressive where you can find trivial informations about Bright Falls, manuscript pages, thermos bottles, tv and radio shows, all special tokens that can be difficult to find for they are well hidden. However you must know that there is no sub-quests as in Red Dead Redemption.Finally, the ending will infuriate many gamers as it is open-ended and not all the questions are resolved. However this game is supposedly the first season of a series of games that are part of the Alan Wake universe. According to Remedy, there is supposed to be a sequel and the DLC content, such as the first one that will appear in July, will bridge up the ending and prepare us for the sequel. Which I hope they will get to make for they released the game at the wrong time, which was when Red Dead Redemption came out.I hope Sam Lake won't have the same problems that Michel Ancel got with Beyond Good and Evil.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2010"}

With 8 more bits, 4 more buttons and no more cartridges blowing, the Super Nintendo set the standard for 16-bit gaming. For 10 years, the SNES was king. Even as 32-bit systems tried to steal the show, the Super Nintendo proved that gaming genius was about more than technology: it's just about fun. Remind yourself how much fun the SNES is. \n\nThis refurbished SNES console is guaranteed to work upon arrival or we&#x20AC;TMll send you another one. It comes bundled with 1 controller and hookups. .","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The height of gaming: PERIOD","reviewText":"Anyone who was around in the NES days knows how fun those games were. Nearly anyone around for the Super Nintendo generation will without a doubt call it: The Greatest System of the Gaming World.While many have updated to the PS2, GCN and XBOX, the SNES is still strong even to this day. The games are classics (and actually led to a lot of successful games found on the PSX and PS2) and don't depend so heavily on eye-candy and if you can believe it, PSX games like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy VII made people WANT an SNES even more (so we could play Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy III/VI).So what makes the SNES so strong in not only Nintendo's franchise, but in gaming in general?  Well, to start off the controller is by far the most comfortable of any game system ever.  The controller has lead to other controllers that have copied the design (The PSX/PS2 controller is almost an exact duplicate).Second is these games are incredible!  The SNES has some of the greatest games of any series. Several FF fans call FFVI the best one, several Zelda fans call Link to the Past the best one, several Mario fans call Super Mario RPG the best one.  Not to mention we've had lots of gaming goodness.  The Donkey Kong Trilogy, Secret of Mana, Contra III, the Mega Man X series debuted here as well.  The Super Nintendo set the standard for gaming as we know it!  How many of us were blown away by Donkey Kong Country when it was released? A whole lot of us were! Compare the amazement DKC gave off to what DK64 gave off.Several different genres, the SNES provides great Action/Adventure, RPGs, Puzzles and more!  The SNES even has educational games.  It's the perfect family console!But there are a few problems.  The first one being the system is out of date and it's actually harder to find now. But you can get it at a cheap price (usually ranging from 25 to 50 bucks).The second con is...some of the games that are really popular, are sold for OUTRAGEOUS prices! Go to ebay and type in Chrono Trigger and you'll see that go for as much as 300 dollars!  Other games that are really popular have been released on the Gameboy Advance (Such as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Donkey Kong Country).  So while the games are great, some you'll have to be willing to pay a lot for, others are re-released and can't rekindle the magic of the original.The Good:+Still strong after all these years! Thanks to the GBA many remember what a gem the SNES was!+Fantastic games! Super Metroid, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Mega Man X series, DKC Trilogy and the list goes on and on!+Best Controller+Quite a durable system...I've had mine for 12 years and it still looks brand new!+Easy to work and games are easy to play and get into.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"Rock Band Gets Even Better","reviewText":"vs. Rock Band 1:Rock Band 2 doesn't add too many features, but the new challenges and especially the drum trainer are great.  In the first Rock Band game I constantly ran into patterns on songs I was completely unfamiliar with.  I could either fail the song over and over, or hit practice mode.  But either way, I'd likely be ill-prepared for the next song.  The drum trainer lets you practice pure rudiments, basics that many patterns in the songs are built from.  Plus, you get to feel like you are actually learning how to play an instrument (and unlike guitar, you are).However, my favorite feature is the new World Tour mode, despite having only minor changes from Rock Band 1.  Now you can use any members for a band at any time, which actually was the reason my wife stopped playing and I just played on the solo mode (which is now gone unfortuantely).  Aside from the missing solo mode, a minor difference (and not so practical now that I have a couple hundred songs), Rock Band 2 really does a great job of upgrading and adding new features.Songs:The library of songs added in Rock Band 2 is great.  I think just about anybody could find 20 songs on the list they like, probably many more.  The list is pretty ecclectic, so I doubt anybody will be a fan of each and every song, but it's definitely a solid list with all master recordings and mainly big names.  Of course the sheer volume, 104 songs (including those yet to be released) plus all the downloadable songs you can buy and those in Rock Band 1 are the biggest draw.Overall:Rock Band 2 doesn't mess with what Rock Band 1 did right and simply refines the experience and beefs up the content.  Harmonix did a great job with this game and I only wish that the bundle had come out as early, as the prices for everything individually is much higher, (not that I need a new mic).  If you don't have any fake guitars or drum sets  cluttering up your TV area, well, maybe you should hold out for the bundle and save some $$$.  Or who knows, maybe the Guitar Hero World Tour instruments will be superior anyway?  But if you do have the Rock Band 1 bundle, or even an old guitar hero guitar, Rock Band 2 is a must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2008"}

Joker has big plans for Armageddon in Gotham, so Batman heads over the wall to bust some heads.I liked Arkham Asylum quite a lot, but they should have went in a new direction for a sequel. Arkham City is very similar, with many of the same abilities and combat maneuvers. Even the side missions and extras are identical, but just in new locations. Arkham City itself is very dark (as expected) and as a result it's a very difficult environment to run about in. The repetitive combat gets boring about halfway though, and there's no way to level-up the force of your combat, just your defenses.Towards the end of Arkham City I just longed for it to be finished. We're two games into this particular chronology now and we have still never been able to fly around the actual Gotham, or cruise in the Batmobile, or see Wayne Manor.

Update 2 11-29","reviewText":"Later in the evening update.....the game still earthquakes. This is insane! It's like buying a Porsche but having to pull over every few miles because it overheats!! 3 stars, I don't care what they fix. I'm done unless something really bad happens.I have NEVER made so many updates to a review! This really is insane. I will warn you that this is a ****SPOILER ALERT**** and so will post it at the VERY bottom of the review, but at a certain point in the game, you will have to do this work around to free yourself from the college.November 28th Late Evening Update:I have revised my review to 5 stars as game play seems perfect after the last 92mb download. No freezing and no earthquakes. So,I give it 5 stars foor game play and sheer addictability (if that's even a word). As long is those major bugs are fixed, I'm thrilled and I can HIGHLY recommend it now! One final warning: be prepared to lose sleep, as it will keep you up!November 28th, 2011: 92mb update downloaded. I am going to put it through its paces and post. I just wanted others to know there is an update out there. Stay tuned!I now have to shut the game down, then turn it on and load my last saved game whenever the earthquake hits, otherwise it just keeps going. What a PITA!!!!...and btw, where's the fix???? Nowhere in sight. Shame on Bethesda!Ok, so I thought the freezing was bad, not the entire game looks to be in earthquake mode! Everything shakes/vibrates. It's insane. You can turn off the feedback from your controllwe, but you still cannot stop the earthquake and so it makes it VERY hard to focus. I got up to a fairly high level quickly enough. After reading online, I will share the following: my freezing started at about 4mb saves, and then the earthquake at around 8mb. I can no longer play the game, which is insane! This could easily be a superstar game if not for such MAJOR distractions. If you have no value for money, and are happy just to own it, then what can I say. If you value money, quality, etc., then DO NOT buy this game....until the bugs are known to have been fixed....then buy it (probably at a discount) and have fun playing an amazing game....*IF* these bugs get fixex!!!Here's the biggest problem folks, game freeze and slow down! BIGTIME!!! I will also note that this is more like a revamped oblivion, with a worse engine, as I never had these problems with Oblivion. Much of the landscape is the same, the inns are very much the same, and often one is like being in another. The game play and challenge, when it doesn't freeze is AWESOME! The problem is, you play for two hours and then it freezes! Maybe this is only with the PS3, I don't know.Getting your character to a strong enough level is tough and a nice challenge. The puzzles in the rooms are sometimes too obscure. I like making my own food. I didn't know I was such a good cook!a few things to keep in mind. Save your gold, get plenty of lock picks, save your perk points, and speech is important, especially if you want to make some money, because it is VERY tough to make money early on in the game, and a good speech rating gets you percent bonuses when selling, and that will come in handy.For a free place to store things, go to the mage college. They give you a room and you can store things there. I have not had anything disappear....yet. But, I can't afford a house yet. I spend all my gold training.Scrolls can be tricky to cast at first, but then you get the hang of it. Make sure you cast the spell completely before letting go. Also, look out for traps. Runes on stones, trip wires, etc. They are everywhere, even chests.No amount of running, jumping, etc., will increase stamina scores....that's a bummer. Fighting, magic use, etc., will increase and you can only increase Magika, Health, or Stamina when you level up. It's nice that you can level up right away.If not for the freeze and lag, I think I could give this game 5 stars (at least 4.5). You'll get your moneys worth in play time, that's for sure.....just with the freeze you get more than you bargained for.SPOILER ALERTAfter beomming Archmage I was stuck in my quarters with no way out because going down through the Arcaneum from the Arch Mages room created a green void. To get through this, you need to go into Skyrim ABOVE, on the top level and then jump off the ledge into the courtyard. You'll take some damage, but that recovers. Then the void will no longer appear and you can go around the college freely (at least so far, let's see how many more updates I can make). Hope this helps!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001Y7404","description":"Silent Hill 4: The Room offers a new cast and story, full of dark mysteries and horrendous new creatures. Henry Townshend is trapped in a cursed apartment. Mysterious portals have appeared in them, leading him to disturbing alternate worlds. This game is a terrifying experience that fans and newcomers will never forget.","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"A bit different, a bit of the same","reviewText":"For diehard Silent Hill fans, Silent Hill 4 is a hard game to get into.  When I started playing, I really didn't like it much.  The first-person camera view in the apartment central to the story was annoying, the inventory system was hard to get used to, and I was wondering where the heck Silent Hill was.  I got over the other things eventually, but I'm still wondering about that last one.Once the story got moving and I got used to how the game mechanics worked, I started to really enjoy it.  Though this game is very different from previous installments, it does have a lot going for it.  The graphics, for example, are top-notch, raising the bar even a little higher from the high standard set in Silent Hill 3.  The textures of gore-clotted walls and the grey skin of ghosts that float above the ground eerily, the stark lighting effects and ultra-realistic character models, all these add to the strange surrealism of the game, and are beautifully (if disturbingly-so) rendered.  The graphics are a big part of what makes this game interesting.The music, also, is pure Silent Hill. Akira Yamaoka returns to the series as sound designer, music composer, and producer, so his unique style of ambient sound and chilling music is heard throughout the game. Yamaoka adopts a style which sets a subtle mood of unease, sudden sound effects which hint at danger.  When you hear soft padding you know that something nasty is nearby hunting for you, and the use of music is understated but very effective. I do have one quibble with the sound effects in this installment of the series, a particular creature's sound when struck, but I'll get to that shortly.The gameplay, while a significant change from the previous Silent Hill games and difficult to adjust to, really does work a little better once you've gotten used to it. The limited inventory system can be frustrating, but I'd have to say that it's more realistic (just where did Heather, from Silent Hill 3, put all those big weapons, anyway?) and actually allows for faster access to the items you need.  Also, while you're getting to what you need in inventory, unlike previous SH games, you can still be attacked.  Again, frustrating at first, but it's more realistic and really adds to the panic factor, which is what a good survival horror game is all about.The story is what I play any game for.  If it doesn't have a decent story behind it, I'm sure to give up on it pretty fast. And one of the things I love about the Silent Hill series, especially Silent Hill 2, is the strength of the storytelling. This fourth installment tells a different kind of story, and starts out a bit slow, but once you're into it, it is absolutely enthralling. The premise is strong, starting out with you playing as Henry Townshend, trapped in your apartment in Room 302 in South Ashfield, near the town of Silent Hill. You can look into the hallway, through the peephole in the door, and see your neighbors walking by.  You can look out the windows to see what's going on outside.  You can even, a little later, look in on someone else's apartment.  But you can't get out...that is, until a big hole crumbles open in your bathroom wall and you find yourself in another world.  In this world, you meet various characters and you learn of a serial killer who carves numbers into each of his victims.  As you progress through different worlds, all linked to your apartment and the widening hole in the wall, you're only a step behind this killer and each person you meet falls victim to his work...and then you meet their ghosts, which aren't happy with you at all...Silent Hill 4 isn't a perfect game, though, and in some ways falls short of its predecessors, Silent Hill 2 and 3 especially. The biggest frustration was that you never get to Silent Hill.  You hear about it throughout the game, and the observant will note that the serial killer is actually someone mentioned (briefly) in Silent Hill 2, and the building Superintendent is also connected to one of the previous game's characters. You even see Toluca Lake at one point, but that's about as close as you get to the spooky town.  Silent Hill 3, which started out in a different place, at least eventually got you to Silent Hill...I wish Silent Hill 4 had done the same.  It would have been nice to see those familiar, evil streets again, since it's in the name and all.  Also, the sound quibble I mentioned earlier.  One of the monsters, which first appears in the hospital, makes a burping sound when struck.  At first I thought it was a bad joke or a glitch, but every time this creature is hit with anything it...belches.  It's a creepy-looking thing, big and scary and dangerous.  But when it burps as you hit it, it ruins the effect a bit.Still, despite these weaknesses (one major, one minor), Silent Hill 4 is still a solid game, better than most of the Resident Evil games and scarier than any other game I've ever played. The recurrent theme of watching other people, and perhaps of being watched in return, arches over the whole game and lends another dimension to the story.  So, while I hope the the fifth installment of the series they return us to the town of Silent Hill, I can still say that for the most part, Silent Hill 4 is just as enjoyable, just as original, and just as scary as any other game in the series.  And taken on its own merits, separate from the overall series, its creepier and more compelling than most games.  Reason enough to give it a fair shot, at least.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2005"}

Final Fantasy 3 was probably the best NES game not released in the US. (NES not SNES... that would belong to FFV).  So for the wonderful DS, we get a shiny new release (from the same crew who did FFIV DS and FF Heroes of Light). And it rocks.I actually lost my original DS copy after playing through to about Viking Cove.  I played through most of the game on my NES emulator afterwards and then stopped when I decided to re-buy the game and re-start on the DS.The DS version keeps the heart and soul of the original.  The music is a remastered version of the original, so it's nice to hear the beeping original sounds replaced with a more orchestral sounding score (despite the limited DS hardware).  Graphics are improved while retaining the traditional feel of the original.  Things are a tad more 3-d, but it's still overall a top down view with the ability to 'zoom in' and check things out.  Look for those sparkles for secrets!Battles are different though.  Originally you could face off against up to 9 baddies.  Now you go against 1-3 normally (though there are instances where you might face 4).  The baddies are tougher.  Mainly their hp is a little higher and they are a bit harder to kill.  Spells can all hit multiple targets.  Good and bad since spells like poison and silence can hit your entire party as well!  Stock up on those items!The ability to change jobs on the fly is great.  I love the customization aspect of this title.  All of the jobs are equally impressive.  I enjoyed playing with a warrior, red mage, black mage, and white mage through the first part.  White mage is the weakest job until you get a fire (or other spell) rod and can then hit baddies with some hurt.  If you switch jobs, there is a slight 'down time' where your abilities are weakened and it takes a few battles (up to 10) to get over the reduction.  Makes it tough to switch jobs while deep in a cave or high in a tower, but that's life!  Also if you switch from a non mage job to a mage job, you have zero magic points.  True even if you switch from mage to non-mage to mage again.  You lose.Sometimes the graphics get annoying.  Typically when they clutter too many objects on screen.  This is mostly in houses within towns.  Dungeons are pretty slick though.  Once you get to the Tower of Owen you will see what I mean.Overall the game feels more like Final Fantasy 4 than Final Fantasy 1, despite the appearance of the original being so similar to FF1.  But the designers were already working on FF4 and some of the ideas that were going to be implemented in FF4 also went into this game.It's a long journey, one that will take around 30 hours if you try and complete most side quests and collect most items.  The difficulty is high, as well as the encounter rate being high, so don't expect to get through this game without seeing the game over screen at least once.  I've beaten every Final Fantasy and FF2 was the only one tougher than this in my opinion.  Though FF1 (the NES version) was pretty close to this in difficulty.  You will want to spend a bit of time level grinding, or if not, then save often.Saving often also became my mantra for this game when I entered the sealed cave, just to fight a couple of battles and see how tough... Unfortunately I hadn't saved since I was just Luneth in the party, all the way through getting all four characters... First battle were those copper coin things, hit and confused two of my party members in first round... yeah... couldn't escape... death ensued.  Then re-doing 30 minutes of running around to get the characters and talk to Cid and the king and... phew... so save OFTEN!  And some monsters will be strong enough to wipe you out and are made that way.  You cannot beat Bahamut, so he will kill you and give you game over if you do not run.  The sea monster will also kill you in two rounds since it gets two hits per round, hitting your level 10-13 characters for over 6000 damage.  (Save right after Viking Cove and don't get on the ship for the love of...). And that reminds me.  Enemies could only take one attack in the NES version (for example the boss Medusa was easy as cake because she only hit once, usually with an ineffective Break spell, but in this version she gets two attacks, usually a fire 2 spell or Break spell with a physical attack for the other), in this version the ability of several enemies to take multiple attacks per round adds some challenge.  Especially in those tough boss battles.But with patience comes reward.  This is a complex game and when you realize it was originally released on the NES and that this version keeps most of the original core of the game intact... you realize the sheer awesomeness of the NES original.  I am sad we missed this one back around 1990, 1991 but playing it on the emulator was fun.  Now playing the re-make on the DS is the final icing on the cake.  Thank you Square Enix for a job well done!Pros:+ Remarkably free from noticeable bugs or glitches.+ Very good, enjoyable remastered soundtrack.+ Lots of depth with class changes.+ Ability to change spells between members so they aren't 'stuck' with one character.+ Newly updated story with individual characters.+ Good difficulty level and decent encounter rate.+ Lots of stuff to do so a long adventure.+ Better job leveling system than the original.Cons:- Graphics generally good, but some areas hard to see.- Encounter rate might be too high for some.- Higher difficulty might turn off some who are used to later FF titles.- Zooming in or 'checking' for secret areas can get tedious.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2012"}

The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.Premium Edition ContentsGAME DVDThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings game DVD.MAKING-OF DVDAll the cinematic materials related to game - trailers, dev diaries, gameplay footage, interviews and making-of exclusive video.OST CDAudio-CD with in-game music.ETUIBox with all the contents of The Witcher 2 Premium Edition.WORLD MAPA map of the game's world.GAME GUIDEThe Witcher 2 strategy guide for both novice and experienced role-playing fans.GAME MANUALA rulebook and interface explanation to help you get started.PAMPHLET AND COINA physical representation of one of the in-game items.PAPERCRAFTSTwo papercraft dolls - Geralt and one random character for collectors.DLCExtra in-game feature for download: The Ultimate Swordsman SuitSystem RequirementsMinimal Requirements:CPU: Dual-Core, 2,2 GHz.RAM: 1 GB (Windows XP), 2 GB (Windows Vista / Windows 7)GPU: nVidia GeForce 8800 / 512 MBOS: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7","reviewerName":"Richard A. Rossi","summary":"Save and reload gets old","reviewText":"I'm about to uninstall this game.  I'm at the \"Letho\" fight.  Look it up on Youtube.  I had to reload 10-15 times when fighting the Kayran.  I feel like I just did that and I'm back dying over and over again.  Could I make it past this guy?  I'm sure I could, but there are so many other games that I don't have to be so frustrated with. To use potions, you have to do it *before* you fight, so I would have to go back to a previous save, drink my potions, then do the boss fight.  lame..  To say this game is complicated is a major understatement.  Finding out how to run it is a major challenge in itself.  There are some quests where you just wander around aimlessly talking to people until you hit the right person.  Of course you can look up everything on the internet, but that is not the way I want to play a game.  I guess I get to pick the lesser of two evils.Also, the game is a graphics card pig.  I just upgraded to an HD6850 and it's fine now, but don't expect to be able to play it with an older set-up.  It will slow to a crawl unless you set the graphics to UGLY.I really liked the first Witcher once I got used to it, but I think it's the developers plan for you to die over and over again in boss fights in this game.  No thanks.Note:  I read in another review that the game gets better after the Letho fight.  You can switch difficulty at any time, even during a fight.  I changed the difficulty to easy and I cruised through the guy.  I hope I don't end up doing that again, it really cheapens the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2012"}

It doesn't matter, however.  I have to say that this is not only one of the best jrpgs i have played, but one of the best rpgs period I have played ever.Really, it would take me forever to tell you all the reasons I love this game or what is so good about it but I will just say that everything about this game is amazing.For a jrpg its quite revolutionary.  The combat system is in real-time and is A TON of fun.  You can only control one character out of a party of three but that character has a selection of attacks and abilites at the bottom of the screen to cycle through and activate.  While not using these your character will default to their basic attack.  The availability of these attacks is based on a cool down system.  After using each one you have to wait a certain amount of time for it to cool down before another use.  These times can be shortened by upgrading them with points you earn after each battle.Some of these attacks require specific character placement in order to deal the most damage.  One attack might be a slash with your weapon that does the most damage from behind the opponent while another will do the most damage from the side.  What's more is that there are some attacks that you can chain together with your party to inflict a bunch of damage if done in the correct order.  I'll explain: one character will use an attack that will \"break\" the defense of an opponent while the next party member will use an attack to \"topple\" the enemy causing it to fall to the ground rendering it totally helpless.  The third party member can use an attack that will \"daze\" the same enemy which keeps it down while the party inflicts as much damage as possible before recovering.  Once getting this chain of attacks down you can inflict a bunch of damage and doing so is a lot of fun.This leads into another reason why the game is so fun: the AI.  While you can only be in control of one person that doesn't mean that the other 2 members are just there stupidly running around getting themselves killed.  It's actually the complete opposite.  I haven't played an rpg where your AI teamates are this competent.Pulling off the chain mentioned before is easy because once you initiate the \"break\" of defense the other members of the party immediately spring into action causing the next stages. This also goes for healing and other special abilities they might have. I have played the game for around 20-25 hours and I have never had to complain about the other party members.  That is quite amazing to me.The story and the characters in this game are also top-notch.  Each character you meet has their own distinct personality.  The voice acting is quite good and portrays these characters well.I won't really explain the story just because I wouldn't do a good job and I might spoil something but I will say it all revolves around the sword on the front cover called the Monado(Of course).  There's much more to the story but you're pretty much questing to find out its true purpose and potential.  Throw in some political affairs and some human eating robot things and you have a very entertaining story that will keep playing until the early hours of the morning.  Great stuff!One thing I am sick of hearing is when people write and say that this game doesn't have very good graphics compared to the 360 and ps3.  Of course it's not going to surpass the ps3 or the 360.  I wasn't expecting it to and neither should anyone else.  I will say that this game looks amazing.  Probably the best I've seen on the wii so far.  And I will say that if the wii can pull off visuals like this then I expect to see more ps3 and 360 games that have at least as much content if not more.The character models look really good in the game.  The main characters each have their own look and are very detailed.  That goes for the enemies as well.  What really impresses me, however, are the environments. This is the aspect I was talking about when I said I expect more from the ps3 and 360 now because I haven't seen many of their games with impressive environments like the ones in this game(I own the wii,ps3, and xbox360 by the way.  I love them all.  Im not trying to be a troll.  Im just using this to make a point about the game).  Every environment I have visited in the game is varied and distinct from the last.  They are also very vast and expansive.  There will be times when you won't believe you are playing a wii game.  They are that good.  The distances you can see in this game are amazing.  Sure, more details load in once you get closer but the sheer amount of things you can see on the screen at one time is a feat that I have not seen in many games.  They are also detailed and very well designed.  They make you want to go exploring and the best part is is that you are well rewarded for doing so.What else.....the game is packed with content.  It has tons of sidequests that you can choose to complete or not.  There's a ton of loot to find.  Every enemy encounter will result in a loot drop after being defeated.  You can save whenever you want.  The game supports the wii classic controller. The soundtrack is great.  I don't know.  I can't really think of anything else to say right now.I might not be very good at writing reviews but I hope you got the gist of why this game is a must own rpg.  I don't care what you're views are on jrpgs.  Even if you hate them and swore to yourself that you would never play another one again still give this one a try at least.  This is a really really really great game that deserves the attention of any rpg fan. It's very well worth your money.I thought I would add a little bit more to this review after beating the game.  That's right.  67 hours, 2 battered controllers, and plenty of curse words later I beat the game.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  The last few hours of the game are incredibly difficult but I was left very satisfied with the ending that the game has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}

About 5 days ago I pre-ordered ps4 and am ready to jump on to the next gen console. But, this console was built to last; it's been over 5 years and it still runs like brand new one. Never had any problems besides some noise generated by the fans. I own over 50 ps3 games and still have many games either wrapped or unfinished. Actually I am still waiting for ps4 game prices to drop. In the mean time, I will try to finish as many games as possible and I believe this console will not disappoint me.Anyway, I am leaving a review now because I just want to express how much I love this bundle. MGS4 is one of my all time favorite games and this console WILL last for many years, if you take good care of it.

And there are some pretty good other FF games out there...This game reminded me greatly of Chrono Cross, which is another awesome Playstation game. But where that game failed, this one shined. In Chrono Cross there were 40 playable characters all with paper thin personalities. This game has 8 characters but every single one of them was memorable and a joy to play.Theres the hilarious and hungry Quina, the cute and sad Vivi, the confident ladies man Zidane, and the typical loner Amarant.Every character oozes with life and looks wonderful. The designs and dialogue are a joy to behold in this game.Each character is also very unique in that they have their own special skills unlike some other Final Fantasys like part 6 and 7.Every thing is perfect about this game, from its story, graphics, music, movies, dialogue, and gameplay. This game took me 60 hours to beat it and every side quest and every second was a wonderful experience.If there is one minor gripe i have its that the game was too easy. I blew through every boss battle with one try and the only battle i ever died on was against the hidden boss Ozma.Once you get the Auto Regen skill you can sadly hold down the fight command and just sit back and demolish the game.In the end this game is a true gem.

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Nikodem Leszek Blach \"Nik\"","summary":"I'm surprised by how much I liked it","reviewText":"FFXIII was an OK game, I'd give it a 4/5. While it's greatest flaw was its lack of exploration the combat was fun and the story was interesting.This game improves on FFXIII in every day - combat is more fun, the story is... probably more fun, and there is a huge amount of exploration. But, this game is a direct sequel to FFXIII so don't bother getting it unless you played FFXIII from beginning to end.  and 13-3 will be the same way, this game will lead directly into it.The game is shorter than FFXIII by quite a few hours... you can beat it in like.. 25 hours. But through exploration this game could easily last 60+ hours.The game has 1 huge flaw that makes me wish I could give it 4.5/5 stars - the DLC.  When you get to the Casino they'll talk about there being 2 games you can play - card game and slots, but you won't be able to figure out how to play the card game - cause you can't.  That card game requires 5 dollar DLC. As small of an issue as that is, that bothers me tremendously. There is probably 30 dollars worth of DLC for this game, most of it is very optional and gives you extra story scenes with main characters... and one of the features that should clearly be in-game is locked out by one of those DLCs.Aside from that though, excellent game. I got it for 20 and don't regret a penny of it. Since it is a little bit shorter and is generally kind of an add-on story, I wouldn't pay full price.  But, hey, it got me to preorder Lightning Returns so I guess it really did something right for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

Shafer","summary":"How to make a great game bad","reviewText":"I absolutely loved the original Modern Warfare.  I played it for hours and always had a blast playing with my friends.  I was excited to get this but soon became too disappointed because of too many reasons.CampaignProbably the only reason why I would reccoment this game, this is only if you completed and enjoyed the campaign from the first game.  Its main downside is that it is incredibly short and once youve completed it and have gotten all enemy intels, you will never come back to it.  On a positive note, going through on Veteran was an enjoybale experience as opposed to throwing your controller across the room in a fit of rage that previous titles in the series would cause.  And to all of the whiners about the \"No Russian\" mission, please just shut up.  Its an integral part to the story, you are given to option to skip it and not be penalized, and even if you do go through you have the option not to kill any civilians.  If you dont like it, than dont do it, simple as that.Spec OpsTo sum it up, its just the campaign broken up into small segments with a specific objective that you can do with a buddie.  Ive done most with my friends and we agree that it just isnt enjoyable.  It starts to get boring at the point when the missions get rehashed and the enemies become simply rediculous.  I gave up completing all of them when they could start to hear silenced shots from the other side of the map and the inclusion of juggernauts for the later missions.  Juggernauts themselves might as well be God for being over-powered.  I tested how strong one was with a friend and even after 20 C4, 20 claymores and multiple shots from a grenade launcher, he walked out of the mushroom cloud acting as if he just hopped out of the shower and proceeded to gun us down in 2 seconds.  All of that was on the mission where your forced to use only explosives, making it impossible to do.  In the end, its not enjoyable and Nazi Zombies from World at War was better compared to this.MultiplayerOne of the main reasons I bought this game and is completely disappointing.  The same problems from MW1 are still present and more have been added in.  The guns for the most part feel the same and theres no joy in gaining levels to get the later guns.  The fun part about MW1 was that you got new and exciting guns to use as you leveled up farther but in this game, the starting guns from the first are the ones you get last.Akimbo weapons are over-powered and the general consensus agrees with this.  Akimbo weapons basically mean that you can now duel weild certain guns from machine pistols to sub machine guns and even shotguns.  The one gun that everyone has problems with is the Model 1887 shotgun which has seems to have the range of a sniper rifle, can reload in split seconds and kills you in one hit a vast majority of the time.There is also a fairly large amount of people that constantly glitch, such as leaving the map area to going inside rocks to be invincible, but the most infamous of all is the javelin glitch.  A javelin is a new type of rocket that propels the rocket itself out of the launcher before flying off into the air and coming straight down on top of its target through a targeting system.  I think Penny-Arcade puts it best by describing it as, \"It is a mechanism by which a person can explode when you shoot them - not simply with a grenade, as the Martyrdom Deathstreak allows, but directing concussive force outward with the broad profile of an aerial bombardment.\"  Its cheap, annoying, and it needs to get patched ASAP.The killstreaks, while great now that you can customize what you want to have, ruins the game.  In MW1, you could only have one killstreak out at a time for the entire team.  One bombing run, one helicopter, just one of anything one at a time.  In this game, the entire team can have a bombing run and a helicopter and a super helicopter and a harrier and an invisible bombing run and radar jamming and everything else out in multiples at the same time.  Not to mention, the tactical nuke that you can kill in ruins the game even more.  Once used, the tactical nuke kills everyone on both teams instantly and the game ends in favor of the team that called it in.  Your team could be close to winning the game but if a nuke comes, too bad for you.  Ive had this situation happen to me far too many times and its gotten sick of it.  No one should be able to instantly end the game with a win just because they got 25 kills in a row, which despite what one may think is easy to get.The maps are terrible and cater to much to campers.  Campers have always plagued this series, especially in World at War, but its even worse in this game.  The maps are too vertical, in the sense that instead of being on the ground for the most part, you can now go into just about every building, climb every room and sit inside any corner you want, waiting for someone to walk by just to shoot them.  The reason why the killstreaks are easy to get is because of this, and theres no way to stop it.  Sure you can kill a camper, but thats not going to stop them from continuing it in another spot.  One of the killstreaks, called a \"care package\" that awards any random killstreak reward, is easily obtainable and even furthers encouragin people to camp.  Someone could kill 3 people, get a chopper gunner and seconds later have 20 kills from it, all because they sat in a corner and waited.On a side note, the inability to talk with friends over party-chat for the most of the game types is inexusable.  I want to talk to my friends, not listen to a group of immature racists scream every kind of profanity and more into my ear.  I can always mute people, but I shouldnt have to do this before every match and its just a chore now.If your thinking about getting this game, dont because its a rental at best for the campaign.  Spec ops is insanely hard and multiplayer is ruined by being bogged down with too many issues.  This is easily the biggest disappointment of the year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000AVBFU8","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Legend of Its Own!","reviewText":"The Tales series has been in good hands lately.  Tales of Symphonia, which was a masterful game, was grand.  Tales of Legendia is even better and more fleshed out.  From start to finish, the game shines.The game begins with Senel Coolidge and his sister Shirly fleeing from enemies aboard their ship.  Soon another ship called the Legacy comes by and over takes them.  The Legacy, we discover, is an ancient artifact from the Kingdom of Terises.  When Senel and Shirly board the legacy we discover Shirly has the ability to breathe underwater which means she may be of a race called Ferines.  But that's not all, because locals think she is a Merines, she might also be able to pilot the Legacy.  Unfortunately she also gets kidnapped by bandits within the first five minutes or so.  It's a lot to swallow, but you'll find out all the answers as the story progresses.The Tales series is known for having well-developed characters, and Tales of Legendia is no exception.  Each character that joins your party is neatly fleshed out to the point where they are their own self.  What helps the character development (besides the well crafted dialogue), is how they will react and interact with one another in battle.  Each character has his or her own attitude and way of thinking.  You'll easily fall in love with these characters.The biggest strength of Tales of Legendia though is without a doubt, the battle system.  It's real time battling, mixed with a sort of Action/Adventure appeal.  That is to say, you actully run up to an enemy and start attacking as if it really were an action/adventure title.  It's fun, intense and well executed.  You can only control one character at a time.  The other characters in battle are controlled strictly by AI.  AI usually has a bad reputation in RPGs.  Not in Tales of Legendia.  Your AI characters are actually smart, and they stick around for a while.  You'll actually come to see that they're good at keeping themselves alive.  It easily works out to the point where you don't have to babysit a weak character.Each character also has Eres.  Magic abilities that cost magic points to use.  These attacks are devasting and beautiful.  Your characters have several kinds of Eres they can perform on enemies, and they'll get more and more.  And each one is more beautiful and more devastating than the last.You can take advantage of the battle system by the combos as well.  As you and your allies take on the monsters you'll be able to get some pretty high combos.  Not only do combos work to cancel or slow down enemies, but the higher your combo, the bigger bonus experience bonus you'll get.  If you're really good, you'll get several experience points just off combos alone.There are a lot of battles in Tales of Legendia.  This is good because battling is fun, but it's also bad because they're random battles.  Dungeons tend to be long and drawn out (with a lot of backtracking) and the encounter rate is high.  You'll have lots of fun battling, but you'll be begging for a break.  It might've been best to stick with contact based battles like in Tales of Symphonia.The Random Encounter rate also doesn't help when moving around on the world map, either.  Since you move rather sluggish on the world map, you're just asking for a lot of battles.  Walking across the world map is simple, but using the map provided can be tough sometimes.  Towns don't make themselves that well known.  So if you're traveling to a town, you might find yourself walking on the wrong side of a mountain range and not know it because it wasn't clearly pointed out on the world map.  This is a minor problem, though, and probably won't frustrate you.  Although the random encounter rate might start to eat at even the most patient gamers.Tales of Legendia is a beautiful game.  Every area shines with beautiful detail.  You'll be in awe with these graphics from the moment the game opens up.  Everything is bright and colorful, and the game doesn't suffer from any framerate issues.  The characters are also detailed, and some of the story plays out in animated cutscenes.  The music is also really good.  One of the most beautiful soundtracks you'll hear in an RPG.  The characters voices are also well performed.  This is some of the best voice acting in a video game.Tales of Legendia is worth it.  With an incredible story, remarkable characters, engaging battle system and astounding beauty, the casual RPGer should be awe-struck throughout.The Good+Beautiful Graphics+Great Soundtrack+Engaging story+Beautifully developed characters+Top-notch voice acting+Tons of extras and secrets+Incredible Battle System, I've never had more fun with an RPGThe Bad-There's only one con that sticks out.  When you mix the high random encounter rate with the length of these dungeons and sluggish movement on the world map, even the most patient RPGers will lose it... but it's easily resolved with a FUN battle system!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords. A few minutes with this game may turn any  zombie gamer into a next-generation gaming system fan.--Eric  Twelker","reviewerName":"Aaron Newlands \"Sithgod\"","summary":"More thought could have gone into it.","reviewText":"This is a good game, and graphiclly it is pretty amazing. The hero looks too western to be a samurai though. Yes it is a resident evil clone. And for that it is a little sad. Capcom are showing that they have the talent to do excellent games. But they are having a tendency to do the same style of survival horror.  The graphics are great, but the characters are weak overall. Just that little bit two dimentional. But hopefully that will improve with an Onimusha II.  I don't like the distances between some save points and I don't like the way you can't skip movies. There are 3 trap/puzzel rooms in a row in one area and you have to view the movie each time.  The monsters go from being very cool, to just average and that is a bit of a pity. I would have liked to have seen more ninja based villans. The samurai villains are easy but cool.  I would have liked to have been able to play the girl ninja. She for most of the game takes a different route and that would have added alot to the lasting appeal.  The extra costumes are cool, although I was told there is a panda bear costume or something similar. Capcom for god's sake why? Give us another interesting costume rather than something just ridiculas.  I bought the game I am happy I bought it. It is worth buying and the PS2 has already had some nice Japanese samurai games. They are rapidly becoming my favourite type of game. I hope to see more of these cinematic style games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2001"}

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to theChinatown Warsas well as the greaterGrand Theft Autocommunities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments.

And you better be ready to defend yourself because you're about to take on this vast, dangerous world from the perspective of two deadly critters with a history of giving even the most stalwart people the creeps: the scorpion and the tarantula..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Experience 360-degree access to detailed, unforgiving environments.View larger.Witness a story of human greed from two distinct perspectives.View larger.Fast action and stunning combo moves keep creature battles challenging.View larger.Combat rattlesnakes and other deadly predators.View larger.Deadly, Motion-Controlled Combat with Wii TechnologyYour Wii controller gives you the ability to move stealthily and attack quickly, just like the real creatures these characters are based on. Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"If I'm being honest (and I am)...","reviewText":"Some of the gameplay felt gimmicky. Less like a game honed to perfection. The camera can get really screwey at times. And I was often made dizzy just climbing around. Those things would have dropped this to a 4 for me, because the premise of the game and some of the execution is A+. Not to mention that it has some big name voices going for it. Sadly this is another case where the graphics were a drawback. Some of the landscapes just seem like something from the last generation of game systems. Even the coloration just felt drab. And I know the Wii is capable of better. Just look at Mario Galaxy 2. No, this is honestly a 3 for me. Even if the control issues were tightened and the gameplay was superb, I would still get tired of looking at this near-lifeless landscape.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

I loved them in MP3 but I only ever borrowed that game and never finished it. I also own the Original and never played Echoes, but I have alwatys enjoyed anytiem I have had with Metroid becasue I love puzzles, the atmosphere, the RPG-esque upgrading, adn Samus is a great character even though she never says anything, she definately has a presence in the narrative.But some people don't like the Wii controls.  If you hated them in MP3 (liek my old room-mate did, whom I borrow the game from and loved it... go figure) you won't liek thsi collection at all, becuase there is no option to play \"retro-style\" or anything.  Typically people who don't liek the new cntrols are simple used to the other two gmaes which they loved, and jsut can't stomach a change, but if that's the case this is probably a bad choice.In fact its the reason for the 4-5 stars, because if you already own 2 out of 3 or even 3 out of 3 of these games it may be a less worthy purchase for you.  If that's the case you are basically payign a premium for the fantastic box and new controsl on two older games because MP3 is unchanged.  Also, save files don't carry over, FYI.If your like me and only own 1-3 of these great games and you enjoyedor thin kyou will enjoy actually using the Wii-mote to paly then this is a must have.  Its almost a idelogical thing, becasue the new controls defiantely change the game, signifigantly.  YOu will HAVE to aim now rather then jsut lock on and fire-away which was pretty muh the only wa to play MP1.  If that's hwo you think the game should paly, then needles to say don't get this.What I hope is that thsi one amazing package can entice the NUMEROUS people who own a Wii and never owned a Gamecube:  IF you like puzzles, interesting story (that's text heavy, fyi)  and great atmosphere with some strong FPS elements then please do your self a favour and get this collection of one classic Nintendo Franchise","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2010"}

Metroid for NES.  When Metroid came out then it was far beyond games of the time.  Here was a game where it was completely open ended, no direction, and left you for yourself to figure out what to do.  A very good game.  When Super Metroid came out I lost touch with reality, it was that addicting. (when your 7).  I think that game actually might have game me goosebumps at the time when I entered into deep Norfair.  To me, that was the best game of the series.  As graphics improved and the ability to render 3D graphics emerged, games were being \"converted\".  When I first heard that the new Metroid for gamecube was going to be a first person and 3D I Immediately said this is going to suck.  I'm die hard for the 2D scroller. God was I wrong.  Retro Studios took this game and made it fantastic.  I think one of the most important things that they did was not to take the adventure,open ended parts out of the game. They kept it true to the original series.  If they had made it just a FPS I would have hated it.  I can tell that the developers at Retro Studios were all Metroid fans because of the quality of that game.  I thought that Echos was still a great game, but more of the same old formula with new tricks.  Metroid Corruption just blew me away.  The controls just felt superb, accurate and responsive.  After playing Corruption I thought this is how they last 2 should have played.  Well here you go, All 3 games, redone into a trilogy of insane quality.  I really don't think it could have been done any better for a FPS 3D Metroid.  They are 3 of the best games ever created for the gamecube and Wii, together on one disc, for around $50.  Enough said.  I already owned the games for game cube, and I had already bought Metroid Corruption, but I bought this anyways just to play on my 42\" Plasma in 480P 16x9 quality!  It was well worth it.If you haven't heard which you probably have, a new Metroid game is being developed for the Wii, Metroid: Other M.  This one's in 2D!

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"2005 starts with a bang","reviewText":"Note: This isn't a \"I'm giving it 5 stars even though I haven't played it\" reviews or a \"I played demo so real thing's probably same\" ones. I have played the final retail version.I'll say this now: I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil games. I'm no pansy that hates being scared but it's kind of hard to get scared when you're packing a pump shotgun.(Geez you came out of nowhere! Now die Punk &lt;Fire shotgun at their face>). Not totally exciting. But for some reason I just had to play Resident Evil 4. Could be a bit of a drought in games lately(I've beaten MGS3, Metroid Prime 2 and San Andreas, don't have Xbox to play Halo 2). And after picking it up, it's a stellar entry into a series I kind of despise.Story: Takes place in 2004, 6 years after Raccoon City was nuked to stop the T-Virus from spreading. Once a rookie cop during that time, Leon Kennedy is now an agent who receives an assignment: rescue the President's daugther, Ashley. While there, he finds a man in a cabin who doesn't take too kindly to strangers and attacks Leon. Leon is then attacked by a huge horde of them but something's wrong: they're faster, even a bit smarter, using traps and ambushing, even ladders into windows. These aren't the same zombies as before.Graphics: If not the best then one of the best graphics on any home console. The locations and villages have a strong atmosphere and totally immerses you into it with real-looking environments. And wait till the boss battles, nothing as massive as Quadraxis from Metroid Prime 2(thank god) but they're some of the most cinematic bosses ever.Sound/Music: A survival/horror games lives or dies(no pun intended) by it's music. If it can immerse you and make you edgy with creeking floorboards, footsteps, distant cries then it'll get you perfectly in tune with the environments. While there's some cases of bad voice acting, it's miles above what the series used to have(no overracted \"Ada!\" here).Gameplay: If you're a RE fan or not, you'll probably agree with me on this: the control scheme felt busted. It was just awkward. People have compared it to driving a tank. And since the old games used a static camera(never really moved), due to the camera switching to the next scene, your character would now have slightly different controls. Up was always used to move your character forward so if the camera now has you in the background coming to the foreground, your first instinct to go down towards the camera makes you go back to the previous screen but going up was the correct way.It's finally changed in Resident Evil 4. The camera takes a Splinter Cell-esque approach with the camera just behind Leon's right shoulder. It's not true 3rd person perspective a la Ratchet and Clank or Zelda but it's enough.Also changed is the dynamics in battles, which are plentiful, sometimes too much so. It's not uncommon to have 10-15 of these...\"things\" after you. You can shoot them in the leg to slow them down or drop them to their knees, shoot their arms to drop the weapons, shoot the dynamite they throw so it explodes right in their face or blow their head off with a well-aimed bullet(not always, sometimes they just act as if the bullet grazed their face, holding it in pain). Word of advice: when it's nighttime, DO NOT blow their heads off. Drawers and tables can be moved in front of doors to barricade yourself in for awhile.Like Shenmue, the A button is context-sensitive which means in certain areas, you can do a specific action. If an enemy has a ladder against a window, you can push it off. If they get too close, you can roundhouse kick them away. You can crouch from too close explosions etc. Aiming is a bit slow but it's a hell of a lot better than previous entries where you couldn't tell if you were directly aiming at them or not until you fired.As for downsides? The action gets to be too intense at times with a large number coming at you from all sides and since the camera focused directly in front of Leon, you can't see if anyone is running at the sides or behind. There's no strafing(literally walking sideways, controlling Leon is either back, forward or turning) and no dodging like in Nemesis.You have to switch to your ammo in the menu also. Can't just simply click a button and switch from your grenade to a gun. Your inventory is changed but it's slightly bothersome since your arsenal, first aid sprays and ammo take up space on a grid. Your shotgun takes up a good 3-4 spaces which would be perfect for ammo or herbs(your potions essentially). You can \"level up\" your guns and your attache case(no magically connected item boxes here) so you can carry more stuff. However, none of these cause you to just quit the game entirely, they're just things that'll irk you.Dust off your Gamecube and pop this in. This is probably the most funnest action games in years and you'll oddly find yourself wanting to blow off some more heads and kill these spanish speaking enemies when you're not playing.

The movements of the characters are too slow- multiple enemies are ridiculous, you can basically fight one at a time unless your attack is big enough to wipe everyone out.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Kevin","summary":"A Good Disney RPG","reviewText":"So I picked up a PS2 just to play the Kingdom hearts series. I am a 24yr old male and have never played Kingdom hearts before even though I've played RPGs all my life. All of the other reviews have hit the pros/cons right on the head. The scenary and characters make this game. The combat is extremely repetitive but it is not quite boring. You are jumping around swinging your keyblade most of the time. The bosses are relatively epic for a game made when this was. I think the game was geared more for a younger audience because of the Disney characters and the fact that the RPG elements are kind of light. I would pick up a guide unless you like being lost and not know where to go to progress the story. You have to like RPGs to like this game, or it may be a good way to introduce yourself to RPGs.

Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"SleepyJD","summary":"Amazing Squaresoft teams up with the crappy Disney","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts is a square game at heart, but features many disney worlds and characters.

W. Mullins","summary":"A great addition to the franchise","reviewText":"There is no way not to compare Call of Duty Black Ops to the excellent Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. The later has become the game that all current FPS are judged by, more so member of the Call of Duty family. I had spent an unhealthy amount of time playing Modern Warfare 2 and so comparing the two as I played through Black Ops was second nature. I will admit I was less than thrilled to hear that Treyarch was developing Black Ops, since the last two CoD games they made (CoD3 and World at War) were my least favorite of the series. For the most part all that worry has been set aside, Black Ops is a great FPS and a great new addition to the Call of Duty line of games.The game plays very much like all post Call of Duty games, good tight controls and fast paced shooting with some story to tie it together. If anything the one thing that dissappointed me the most was the rather odd and somewhat boring story of the game. The mission levels and settings a varied to an amazing degree, Vietnam, Russia, Cuba, etc and span several decades of the Cold War. Yet the story that ties it together seems something out of a cheap spy thriller. While most people will not be bother by this I expect all games at this stage of video game history to have a decent story and a certain amount of polish. The CoD formula is a very linear game with set piece scenes and so the story and presentation are what really makes you feel like going on to the end. The story wasn't bad, but I think they could have told it much better. The interation they have implemented is very nice though. During many scenes you will still have buttons to press and things to do, from starting the engine of your SR71 spy plane to rappelling down mountains, I think that was a nice touch.As I mentioned before the missions are extremely varied in setting, from jungle to snow and everywhere in between. The voice acting is all very good and the graphics are amazing. I remember just looking at the reflection in the canopy of a helicopter you pilot and thinking 'wow nice touch'. The weapon, an important element in all shooters, are varied and interesting. They did a good job of putting lots of gun in the game, while helping them to feel unique and different from each other. The realism isn't great, many of the weapons were not around during the time frame the missions were based on. There are other small details like the Troy folding sights on the weapons facing the wrong direction and the like which bothered me, but its something most people wouldn't pick up on and doesn't really take away from the game.The campaign is rather short but not terribly so and its worth a couple play through. And while the story is somewhat short Treyarch did a wonderful thing by adding a zombie game as well. That was a major hit with their WaW game and I was glad to see it not just returned in Black Ops, but improved as well. It also adds a lot of value and replay to the game. Multiplayer is good and the ability to outfit your kit and weapons again is good.Multiplayer is very good. The maps are well laid out and fun, they seem somewhat camping resistant as well. The weapons are different and the mods are nice. Their are a number of types of online games to play and the option to play split screen or LAN as well. You can set up multiple custom classes so you can switch on the fly. There is also the option to play alone again AI enemies, which allows you to practice. The AI is quite good and on all settings they seem to be fantastic shots.I was worried about picking this game up on launch day since I felt burned bu CoD3 and WaW before, but after reading some good reviews decided to give it a try. And I am glad I did, Treyarch has done a great job on this game and have vastly improved from their last couple attempts. Black Ops is not just a good Treyarch game, but a great Call of Duty game when considered with the fit of the entire series. I am glad I p","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the creepiest and most well written games you'll ever play","reviewText":"Indigo Prophecy is one of those surprisingly great and terribly underrated and unnoticed games that come along every now and then.  Despite it's low-res graphics and textures, Indigo Prophecy features an incredibly dark and gloomy atmosphere thanks to some creepy and bloody cinematics, as well as one of the most well written and original stories you will ever find in a video game.  From it's opening cinematic, which will stick in your head for quite some time, you control Lucas Kane; a seemingly normal guy who doesn't seem to recall that he just violently murdered a man.  As you progress through the game, you will be introduced to Detectives Valenti and Miles, of whom you will also control as everyone involved is on the course of a collision that will feature many events you won't see coming, and plenty of twists as well.  What really makes Indigo Prophecy is the fact that the choices you make really do effect later outcomes.  The game has no linear feel to it at all as cause and effect have never had this kind of impact on a game in, well, ever.  As you play through the game, you will also participate in mundane tasks to boot, much like playing the original Shenmue from years ago.  There's also some inventive elements in the game's core gameplay in terms of action mechanics; taking advantage of the controler's analog sticks as well as your reflexes.  The game however, does have it's share of drawbacks, most notably being the game's graphics engine.  Nearly every character you encounter moves and reacts in the same caricatural way, while their features (faces, clothing) are all so low-res that it occasionally looks kind of ugly to look at.  It's not that bad throughout most of the game, but it does have it's noticable moments nonetheless.  Other than that and some plot holes, the only other real downside to Indigo Prophecy is the game's somewhat schizo camera that at times has a mind of it's own.  Those are the only real flaws in a game that features superb storytelling, wonderful voice acting, an ultra eerie environment, and some inventive gameplay; so all together the game is a different and worthwhile experience.  All in all, if you missed out on Indigo Prophecy when it was first released, now is the time to pick it up.  It's one of the best and most original third party games made for the PS2, and it's one of the most memorable to boot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2007"}

There are plenty of maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. The combat is well-balanced and challenging without being frustrating. And there are, as advertised, \"bazillions\" of weapons (too many, in my opinion -- it's gets a bit tedious deciding what to keep and what to sell or dump). And it's a great multiplayer game too, especially with friends.

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"J. Shafer","summary":"Decent platformer, average game","reviewText":"Prince of Persia starts out with a theif (yes, the main character is not acctually a prince) wandering the desert looking for his donkey that has all of the gold and other various expensive trinkets that he got done stealing in a recent \"trip\".  He falls down a crevage and comes across a princess named Elika who brings him to a temple in the middle of a kingdom of sorts, upon which the king unleashes the dark god Ahriman.  Before he knows it, our hero becomes caught within a quest to restore the land back to normal with the help of Elika.The story is pretty bland and unoriginal.  It borrows heavily from Persian religion and it basically boils down to a black and white deal.  Youve got Ormazd the god of light who is just the Persian equivalent of God whereas Ahriman the god of darkness is essentially the devil.  It doesnt really develop farther than putting the devil back in his prison and learning a bit behind Elikas mysterious background.  Also, without spoiling too much, the ending was pretty terrible, confusing and makes everything you did in the game pointless.Gameplay is still good, when the game is acctually being a combat oriented platformer like its supposed to be.  Like the Sand of Time trilogy (specifically the 1st one), the game is extremely repetitive but doesnt manage to pull it off as well as SoT did.  In SoT the game followed the pattern of a fight, saving, platforming, and then repeat for the rest of the game.  This game just has to you to one of the various areas of the game to purify the corrupted land and then fighting one of the 4 bosses.  Whats annoying is that you have to fight each boss around 5-6 times before 1/4 of the entire land will be cleansed and instead of fighting the same boss, it would have been nice to see something different.  The combat, while still decent (and somewhat rare to come across), is still average.  Its a 1-vs-1 battle where you sword fight with the enemy.  While your given multiple combos, its usually better to just repeat the same one that deals the most damage and hope that the enemy doesnt delfect your attack which is common.  What makes combat even easier is that you have plenty of oppurtunites to instantly kill the enemy.  If you push them against a wall or get them over a ledge its an instant kill which makes this game easier.  This game is so easy that its acctually impossible to die.On a side note, the graphics and art direction is nothing short of amazing and Ubisoft really outdid themselves.  When you purify the land, everything is lush, green and just simply beautiful to look at for periods of time.If your a fan of the PoP series, atleast give it a try.  Youll probably enjoy the game alot more if your willing to forget everything about SoT because youll constantly find yourself saying \"SoT was infanitely better than this.\"  If your new to the series, you should also give it a try as well altough if you can I would also suggest the Sands of Time trilogy as well because while this game is fun at times, its just overall a pretty average game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00008KUA3","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"Mindless fun beckons.","reviewText":"The Warioware series...can it even be described completely? With five games out and each game more innovative than the last, it has proved that Nintendo still has the creative juices flowing. The original, which is hard to believe, but it came out six years ago for the GBA and received great reviews? So what is Warioware exactly?GRAPHICS: For a GBA game, they look great. Besides the clean colors of the microgames, they also have some nice `realistic' graphics that are used especially at Dr. Crygor's games. Some nice cutscenes also help catapult them.MUSIC: Although most of the tracks last as long as the microgames, they are still interesting and catchy, kind of like a commercial jingle.SOUND: Wario's voice is prominent, along with others, but the sound effects themselves are as random as the game itself.GAMEPLAY: The heart and soul of this game resides here, folks. The game consists of microgames, which are simple, seconds long games that are simple to play, the controls being the directional pad and the A button. You go through stages involving one of the Warioware characters, with each character having their own type of games. For example, 9-Volt's games are all classic Nintendo microgames. Each microgame has three levels, each increasing it in difficulty. During a stage, there will be increases in speed, as well as a boss stage at the end, which is a longer microgame. You can also play the microgames individually, and if you get enough points, you will complete the microgame. Beat them all, and you get something cool.The game has some unlockable minigames that are unique, such as two player games that use only the L and R buttons, no extra GBA required, to Warioized versions of classic games, such as Dr. Wario and a Wario version of the Mario Paint fly swatting game.The game itself has no point but to entertain.BUY: It's a must buy, sure enough. When I got it, I didn't know what to expect, but like me, you'll probably be surprised on how addicting it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2009"}

It shows the same playful, all-ages fun adventure style. Definitely lots of fun!Your main characters are Jak, a teenage boy, and Daxter, his young friend who early on gets turned into a reddish weasel. You're told by the great sage that the only way to turn Daxter back into a human is to go on a quest to reach the other sages.There are of course many subquests along the way, some involving the sage's sexy daughter, Kira. You need to gather up 'orbs' which are sort of a currency for the land, and power cells, which let you power various devices. There is also 'eco', a form of power which comes in four colors. It allows you to heal, to run more quickly, to breathe fire, and do other special activities.The graphics are great, from running through water to climbing up mountains and walking through villages. The sounds work well too, with the wooden bridges and sandy beaches and ocean swims all seeming very realistic. The background music is catchy and fun.This isn't a dark, somber 'save the world against zombies' type of game. It's very lighthearted, with wisecracking and simple tasks. The tasks you perform make you feel like you're really helping people out, and the challenges are doable. The save system makes it easy to try again if you fail the first time. It's really a game that both adults and kids can play together and both enjoy.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2003"}

It makes the most of the DS stylus and dual screens, and allows a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to compete in two- or four-player battles.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The best version of Tetris to this date","reviewText":"Tetris has a very long history in the world of Nintendo. Starting out as the pack in game for the original Game Boy, the puzzle game has been enjoyed by millions of players worldwide and it was virtually ported to every Nintendo gaming console known to man. Now, it was time for the Nintendo DS to get its own version. Tetris DS was released in 2006 and once again, gamers lined up to play it. This is quite possibly the best version of it to date.Tetris DS is a puzzle game where you make lines of blocks from falling pieces anyway possible. Clear the lines and you earn points and go up a level. As you pass each level, the falling block pieces come down faster and faster. If you let the lines fill up the screen, the game's over. It's a simple premise but hard to master. Tetris DS comes with many different game modes, supports up to 10 players per match and features online multi-player so you can take on players from across the world. The game tracks your progress by saving directly on the cart so you can always check your stats.The PROS: This is exactly how you keep Tetris from being fresh and always fun to play. The graphics are crisp and vibrant while the music and sounds are updated for the DS and sound great. You will get into it immediately thanks to the easy to use controls and the different game modes put fun twists on the traditional Tetris game. Anyone with a DS can play against you since you can wireless send a copy to them and up to 10 people can join in. The same goes for the online multi-player mode and there is always someone to challenge as it still has a big presence online.The CONS: None.Nintendo did a really nice job with this version of Tetris. While it is pricy to get, it is worth it but you may want to find a used copy first. It is still fun and it's even better to play it with other people. You owe it to yourself to get this game if you don't have it but own a DS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

Of course, it's filled with all the essential elements - Goombas, gold question-mark boxes, Fire Flowers, pipes, and the like, but it's very different from other Mario games. To be honest, I like this game a whole lot better than Mario 64.It was cool having Bowser Koopa on my side for once, as well as two new characters (Geno and Mallow) I was disappointed that Luigi wasn't part of the game, but having Peach as a playable character's cool. Everyone has nice attacks, and I liked playing with all of them - I was often switching between characters because none of them were really weak (unlike other games where some characters are practically useless) and the storyline itself is unique and interesting. The game length was also good, you have all of these quests (and side-quests) to explore, along with quite a few bonus quests (which turn up a few cool and rare items).

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new.

This game is really great, I noticed some small glitches but nothing that ruins the game experience,  This game will keep you playing for hours,  not only that but I played through the first one again just so I could import an interesting character.This game and the previous ones are worth buying because of the multitude of options in playing,  most of the choices that you make have implications and resonate through out the gaming experience,  if you enjoy Fable or games where you actually get to make choices this game will be perfect for you.  Some of the other reviews called this a shooter, and yes there are guns in this game, and you can focus on shooting but it is not a shooter game,  the story expands from a single seed and each choice you make leads to a branching story line that is not any where in the same universe as a shooter or your average action game.  This is not a linear story where you are forced to do what the game wants you too,  you make choices which you do not get to make in shooters.  If you choose not to upgrade a certain armor on your ship there are repercussions later in the game,  If you saved someone in the first game they show up in this game.This game is amazing,  but the true genius is the vision of the people who created this game and how your actions stretch across the entire series,  actions you take in the first game will effect the outcome of the last game.  If you enjoy the idea of being able to control the path you take in a video game you will love this series,  start with the first one, and remember that every choice you make has consequences,  unlike shooter games where you have no choices your a train on tracks.

The key thing to remember here is that Metal Gear Solid 5 is being split into pieces.  Ground Zeroes is the first piece.  The Phantom Pain is the next piece.  There will likely be more after that.  This means that this game is VERY short.  You will be playing about 1/4 the length of a normal game for 1/2 the price of a full length game.  The main mission, Ground Zeroes, is roughly 2 hours, and then there are side ops.  These hold the familiar feel of the Peace Walker 2 missions.  If you liked those, then you will like these.  That being said, this game may not be worth it to you.  Rent it for a couple of days and you can get the maximum experience.  However, if you are like me, then the better option would be to just buy it and acquire all the Metal Gear Solid 5 pieces as they come out, and then play them all through again, one after another.  This is probably the route to take if you are an avid Metal Gear fan. After playing it through once, I can confidently say that I will want to beat it again within the next few days.  The main point here is just that you should be warned of the brevity of the game as I know that there are many people that want a game that will last. The Metal Gear Solid 5 collection will be one that any fan will want to have in full.  That starts with this game and whether or not a few hours of game play will be worth $30.Another important thing to note about the MGS 5 series is that if you play Ground Zeroes for the Xbox 360, for example, then your save data will transfer to Xbox one.  The same thing will happen for PS3 to PS4.  This will also include any stats or information that carries across the MGS 5 series.This MGS has absolutely amazing mechanics.  They are smooth and responsive.  They feel great and better than they ever have. I got it for the Xbox One, and it is one of the most beautiful games so far. I specifically remember one mission where you have to shoot down some large artillery and then escape in a certain amount of time.  My heart was pounding almost like I was living the situation (I highly suggest playing with headphones).The game play is fun, and in a way, personalized.  If you want to be stealthy, you can be stealthy.  If you want to \"run and gun\", then you can do that too. You play how you want to and this makes the game that much better, giving you all the more reason to get it.For those newcomers:Metal Gear Solid 5 is directly related to other games in the series.  I believe it take place directly after Peace Walker.  I promise you that you will be lost if you haven't played MGS before.  Yes, you could read game summaries as some like to do, but I advise against it.  I would suggest getting some of the other ones, at least Peace Walker, and then buying this along with Phantom Pain when that comes out.  You don't have to, but for the full experience this is what I would suggest.I am giving this game 5 stars on the basis of what it is, and not how it relates to the price.  This game is tons of fun while it lasts, and is a game that I in no ways regret getting.  If you don't mind putting down $30 for an awesome, but quick experience, then I suggest doing so.  If you want to get a lot of time out of a game, then this may not be the way to go for you.  You can only play a game again so many times. Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes really pushes the MGS series forward.  It retains what it needed to from older games while also introducing some awesome new features.  5/5 for quality.  Value is at the buyers discretion. I hope this helped and if you have any questions, feel free to email me!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"Yuri Cunha \"Juggalo\"","summary":"Go Wireless Now!","reviewText":"The normal controller was already the greatest one ever, until Nintendo decided to make it even more perfect.Now we've got the Wavebird.

You can move much more, if you have quick movements while playing, the wire won't pull the GameCube and many other advantages.Yes, the Waverbird Controller is a little heavier than the normal one, and bigger too, but don't worry, that's nothing when you're playing.The controller has sixteen frequences, so if you're playing with a friend with another Wavebird Controller, you guys will not control each other's characters, which would be funny but really disappointing.Overall, this Controller is much better than the normal, even though they're both awesome.I just wished Nintendo could put out more colors for the Wavebird, because I don't like grey.

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Troy Kearney \"avid reader\"","summary":"Get set to kick some serious Arsenal...","reviewText":"Sony's game-making unit has had several hits come out of their house of ideas, the Sly Cooper, Jak & Daxter and SOCOM series among them.  But for those who like a game that combines the fun of Sly with the weapon-blasting of SOCOM but without the dark undertones of the Jak series, there is Ratchet & Clank.  So far the unlikely duo of a weasel-like hero (Ratchet) and his small yet reliable partner in heroism (Clank) have had gamers running and gunning through 2 hits (the original and R&C;: Going Commando).  So since Sly, SOCOM and Jak have released sequels, would R&C; follow suit?  DUUHHHH!!!!Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (if you can't laugh at this title, get some help) finds our two heroes enjoying the success of their last mission (Going Commando) with Clank becoming a TV superstar and Ratchet becoming the second banana.  Suddenly a request comes in for the two to jump back into action when a race of creatures called the Tyrrahnoids attack Rachet's home world of Veldin.However, when they learn that the attack is the work of a mad scientist named Dr. Nefarious, they also learn that there was only one person who faced Nefarious before and beat him.  Unfortunately for R&C;, it turns out to be their old friend/nemesis Captain Quark, who they faced in Going Commando.  Realizing that they need Quark to stop Nefarious again, they go on a search to find him and stop the Tyrrahnoid threat.Once again, you get to play with some serious sweet (and fun) weaponry through the game, including a gun that turns your enemies into...ducks (thus taking the phrase \"Duck Hunt\" to a whole new level...hee hee) As you progress, you work on building up both your personal experience to gain health and also stepping up your arsenal (no pun intended) by consistantly using your weapons to add upgrades that will come in handily in later missions.  Also, just a small piece of advice: if you still have your old game data from both of the previous R&C; games, have it ready since it can help you get a discount on weapons in UYA.Needless to say there are some definitely funny moments throughout the game, including when you find out where some of the Sewer Crystals came from...it isn't pretty...:)If you already have the first 2 titles in the Ratchet & Clank series, you need to add this one to complete the trifecta.

{"product_name":"B001ELI4S4","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"So far, so good","reviewText":"I have never really been a PlayStation fan since purchasing the very first PlayStation nearly 10 years ago.  As a result most of my console gaming was on Nintendo's and Microsoft's consoles.  However, between my XBOX Pro and Elite consoles, I have had to send them back them to Microsoft seven times in less than two years.  Even the \"more reliable\" Elite console had to be returned twice last year.  I decided that I spent too much money for that kind of unreliability so I reluctantly contemplated a PS3 purchase.  Now before all of you Microsoft fan boys start calling this a fan boy review, think again;  I call them as I see them and I never really understood why someone just can't have two or all three of the gaming systems anyway.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy my XBOX 360 console, have around 25 XBOX 360 games, and still play it regularly. However when I spend nearly a grand on two Microsoft consoles, I expect them to last longer than a few months.  I don't know about you, but I work hard for my money, paying for all my things out of my own pocket and I refuse to spend another dime on Microsoft's money pit of faulty consoles.The main reason I purchased a PS3 was because I was in the market for a Blu-Ray player.  However during extensive research I discovered that the Blu-Ray player on the PS3 is one of the best on the market, and while I'm not a big fan of multipurpose gaming consoles, I decided on the PS3 opposed to a standalone due to my countless issues with the XBOX 360.  I may end up getting a standalone Blu-Ray player eventually, but for now the PS3 will suffice.  The Blu-Ray player does not disappoint; however since this is my first experience with a Blu-Ray player, I don't have anything to compare it to other than DVD players.  That said I never experienced any issue with the playback on the PS3.  The first movie I purchased was The Dark Knight and comparing the video quality to my DVD player I do see a big difference.  While DVD's certainly look good, the Blu-Ray does in fact show a noticeable difference.  Honestly I don't notice much difference in audio, but this could be because I have a very old A/V receiver.  The Blu-Ray player on the PS3 also up converts regular DVD's (with an HDMI cable).  To me, the up-converting is ok, but I prefer using my standalone for watching regular DVD's.One huge advantage the PS3 has over the 360 is that Sony doesn't nickel and dime you on accessories like Microsoft does.  An example of this is that the PS3 has built in wireless internet capability instead of making you spend a hundred bucks on an \"adapter\".  Additionally, all A/V connections in the back of the console are spaced out so you can use multiple A/V outputs (i.e. using HDMI video with optical sound) without having to spend an additional fifty bucks on yet ANOTHER adapter.  Also, the PS3 controller can be charged with the included USB cable and you are not forced to purchase a battery pack and a separate charger.  Finally, all memberships to the Sony PlayStation network (the equivalent to XBOX Live) are absolutely free.  Meaning it's free to play games online without having to pay ANOTHER fifty/year for a \"Gold membership\"; granted while it is not that much, free is always better.  Keep in mind that you still have to pay for some downloads, but you aren't charged just to be member.One small complaint I had right off the bat is that unlike the 360 I am unable to output optical sound to my receiver and HDMI sound to my television simultaneously.  I found the ability to do this on the 360 to be quite convenient since when everyone is in the bed I can play games with the receiver volume turned all the way down and just use the sound on the TV.  However with the PS3 you can only choose one or the other at a given time.  So before I start playing games, I have to choose in the Audio Settings screen if I want to use HDMI sound through the TV or optical sound through my receiver every time.  My receiver does not have HDMI capability so I do not know if this limitation applies if both the TV and Receiver have HDMI capability.This PS3 package comes bundled with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune which is a very good game to start off with.  Once you are done with this game you can easily download demos from the PlayStation network to check out other titles you are curious about.Keep in mind that to cut costs, Sony decided to do away with backwards compatibility with PS2 games.  Neither of the current versions of the PS3 can play PS2 games.  Because I have no PS2 games, this is not a concern for me and since I'm one to keep my old consoles, backwards compatibility has NEVER been a concern for me.  However, if you are one that wishes to play PS2 games, then I suggest getting one of the older model PS3's or just purchase a PS2 separately since they are inexpensive now.So far the PS3 seems like a good console.  Available titles are limited for me since I have most of the good cross platform games on the 360 already.  Drake's Fortune is a good start, but I am hoping for more worthy PS3 titles in the near future.  Reliability wise, I have experienced a couple of game freezes, but restarting the system seemed to clear the problem.  Only time will tell it it's more reliable than the 360.  I could be wrong, but I highly doubt I will go through 3 - 4 per year as I have with the 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2009"}

This design works to deliver the story and keep you entertained, but only on the first playthrough.  On subsequent returns to Metro 2033 you already know the story, you already know what is going to happen and the sheer number of scripted events just gets boring.  The scarcity of targets to shoot and the overall short levels don't give you a lot to do.That is not to say that Metro 2033 is not an awesome experience because it is.  But it is also one you might want to embark on as a rental instead of a purchase (if you can actually find the game in stock at a rental place that is).  You owe it to yourself to give it a try.  It is unlike any other game that I've played lately and if they make a 2034 I'm going to be first in line.  But please, give us more to shoot at next time OK?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"Better Than the Original","reviewText":"This game is incredibly addictive.  If you are sick of Diablo 1, don't think you will be bored of Diablo 2.  The same great gameplay is back, only highly refined and expanded 5 times.  You can literally play the entire thing through 15 times and not see everything.For those of you who haven't played Diablo, it is basically an RPG version of Solitaire - very simple, very repeditive, and very addictive.  The perfect game for blowing 30 minutes at lunch, but beware - you might take the rest of the day off!The backdrop of the game is breathtaking!  You will travel through dark caves, desert tombs, monasteries, deserted cities, jungles, ancient Mayan temples with undead priests assaulting you in waves, and even the rivers of Hell.  The final showdown with Diablo is 10 times better than the original.  The story that ties everything together is, well, not as deep as other RPGs, but still spell-binding.  The ending will have you begging for D3.And once you finish it, you can play it again!  This game has the most replay value of any RPG ever.  First, it is actually fun to play over and over.  Secondly, Diablo 2 has five highly unique character classes which all play differently, and within each class are 30 skills which would take you 300 levels to explore!  You'll want to finish the game 2-3 times with each character.Finally, Battle.Net rocks.  You are basically getting a MMORPG for free, without the monthly fee.  Get online, meet your friends, form a party, and hop on a game.  Incredibly simple.  The games gets dynamically tougher as more players join, and you will never feel like there are more players then there are monsters.  Forget camping, or taking 3 months to level - Diablo 2 lets you have fun immediately and doesn't slow down.  During launch, everyone was trying to use it at the same time, but now things have calmed down significantly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2000"}

It looks and feels like a PS1 game with slightly better graffics at times.  Specifically in towns and when running around the world map.\"Unfortunately this is true all the way through the entire game.  Only the cutscenes are smooth rest of the game feels PS1-ey.\"Gameplay can be very smooth but at times it is very confusing and difficult to figure out.  If you get the hang of everything namely the \"Tri-attacks\" and how to control where you run when you use a hero charge so you dont run into a wall please let me know.\"Thanks for telling me i can jump it helped alot knowing when your in mid-air you can spray your bullets so it hits a wider area on your enemy.  Unfortunately not even that can help you sometimes because if the enemy is bigger than you, you will end up running into him interrupting your turn making the whole point of jumping useless.  Only reason i jump in this game anymore is to find an easy way to get behind an enemy and attack the soft spot in their defense.\"Replay im not so sure about replay but there are a ton of things to do so far in the game and im not even halfway done yet.\"Fetch this, Fetch that.  Get into random battle earn hexes and use it to either open up the lego blocks on every floor or play lets make a color bridge from one terminal to the next.  I didn't get this idea and furthermore as far as i got into the game i never earned enough colored blocks to even put it to use.\"Overall it is a fun game.\"If you are a glutton for punishment.  Horrible/Non-existant story.  Uninteresting characters.  Only thing that saves this game is the guns and even that gets old after awhile.\"A bit of warning if your not confident you will kill every enemy and win every battle save often or burn your money before you go out because retrys cost money each time.\"If you can make it to chapter 7 or so there is a economic exploit you can use to gain as much money as you want to do w/e you want with.  Buy ammo, upgrades etc.  So if you get that far and you end up losing who cares you have a way to make unlimited money.Personally if you can finish this game more power to you, i just don't have the patience to put up with it past chapter 11.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"LOVE THE LORD \"W.Y.

This is my first racing wheel and as a fan of all things Gran Turismo there is no other way to race! The level of 'feedback' that you get from the DFGT is just simply not something that can be done on a standard controller.Set-up is a breeze with a few cables to connect - USB to the PS3, power cord and the cord connecting the pedals. The wheel itself feels very high quality and not flimsy.The addition of a quick settings button is great in that you can make real-time adjustments to everything from driving aids like traction control to braking power, etc. Button layout is great and easily thumb accessible allowing you to concentrate on driving. The force feedback is fantastic as well! You'll feel actual changes in the road surface, bumps and crashes are all recreated and take your driving games to a new level.A few minor complaints:I wish that Bluetooth technology had been implemented. This would at least cut down on the cables. I realize that a power cable would still be necessary, but anything helps.The pedals are made well but on carpet are prone to sliding around. There is a non-slip surface on the bottom but I still notice that the pedals slide around, especially if you are rough on the accelerator/brake.Ideally you'll have something that you can clamp the wheel to.

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A Landmark","reviewText":"In the Wii's final days, Nintendo has unleashed upon us The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, a landmark game and a high point in a console generation full of many high points.  Skyward Sword succeeds on a two fronts...it not only moves the Legend of Zelda franchise forward by creating an experience that is both looking towards the future and rooted in nostalgia, but it also makes the definitive argument for the viability of motion controls and their place in games that provide deep and engaging experiences.On the surface, Skyward Sword is a very different type of Zelda game.  Being the earliest game in the series' chronology, the game begins in a village in the clouds, and as the game progresses, Link explores various areas on the surface beneath the clouds, which are not laid out as easily navigable open spaces (ala Hyrule Field) but as areas consisting of multiple series of puzzles which gradually bring Link closer to the game's dungeons.  It is much different from the more traditional structure of the excellent The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, but as gamers make their way through the game, they'll begin to notice that as different as things may seem, this is one of the most nostalgic video games ever made, one that pays homage to the past 25 years of the franchise.  Gamers will see familiar characters reborn in completely different ways, and will get pulled into the games stunning environments and challenging puzzles just like they always have.  Skyward Sword feels like the culmination of every Zelda title ever made, and on the 25th anniversary of the first game's release, it is appropriate that this game reaches new highs for the franchise.  The combat is the very best it has ever been.  The game is amazingly balanced...the overly frustrating puzzle elements of some of the previous games seem to be gone, yet the game is still very challenging, but more fair this time around.  The brilliant musical score is, for the first time, fully orchestrated and absolutely lovely.  Visually, this is arguably the most beautiful of all the Zelda games, with character models that seem to mix The Wind Waker with Twilight Princess, and a beautiful effect that makes background objects look like watercolor paintings as the draw distance increases.  And fittingly, the Zelda storyline reaches a level never before reached with the most emotionally poignant narrative the series has ever seen.  This is a story you won't ever forget.The Legend of Zelda series has always been one to innovate, whether it is giving us the first true console adventure game (The Legend of Zelda), one of the earliest action RPGs (Zelda II), or the grandest 3D adventure to ever be created (Ocarina of Time).  Amazingly, Skyward Sword may be the most innovative Zelda title yet, and this is due to its unbelievable utilization of motion controls.  To list all the ways that the motion controls are creatively and meaningfully used here would not only take too long, but would spoil many of the surprises that come later on in the game.  But let me say this...this is a true, immersive motion gaming experience, far beyond the tacked on motion controls from the earlier Twilight Princess.  Not only do the controls work efficiently and effectively, but they significantly add to the experience of playing this game.  It seems like this is the game that the Nintendo Wii was born to have, and it is very surprising that it has taken this long for a game like this to come out.  Motion controls have been a controversial topic during this console generation, and their ultimate destiny in the gaming world is yet to be determined.  But if there ever was a game to make a case that motion controls can really be the ultimate way to control games that \"hardcore\" gamers like, Skyward Sword is that game.  You've never played a video game in this way before, and after Skyward Sword, you may never want to go back.So here, in the twilight of the Nintendo Wii's life, we are given the console's crown jewel.  Not only is it one of the finest of all the Zelda games, but it is also an evolution of the way we play games like this.  The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a pivotal game this generation.  If motion controls become a major part in non-casual gaming, Skyward Sword will be remembered as the key launch point of this trend.  If motion controls disappear, Skyward Sword will always be remembered as its finest hour.  Regardless, Skyward Sword is another brilliant Nintendo gem.  An absolute must-play in every way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2012"}

In that light, take these one and two star reviews with a grain of salt.  No, it's not perfect, but no game is.There's been a lot of discussion about graphics.  To my eyes it's a gorgeous game, especially on the ps4.  It doesn't top InFamous Second Son, but it's still a beautiful rendition of Chicago.  A lot of the game mechanics appear to be borrowed from Ubisoft's stable of games:  hacking from Deus Ex, the cover system from Splinter Cell, etc., but they've all been integrated rather nicely.  I found the controls largely fluid, at least while on foot and during gun play. The voice acting was solid, the soundtrack acceptable, and there's simply a ton of stuff to do. 10 hours in and I haven't even completed a Act 1.There are, however, plenty of mis-steps in my estimation.  Yes, the driving is atrocious.  Prepare to fishtail...everywhere.  The lack of customization is surprising, whether it be clothing, cars, or anything else.  I noticed little things, like the time not showing on your smart phone/profiler, which struck me as odd.  I had some major frame rate drops during the intro mission, too.  The missions can be very challenging, so prepare to die and fail a lot.There's a great sense of paranoia running through Watch_Dogs, especially when other players can hack your game.  We live in a world where virtually no one appears to have any right to privacy:  the NSA, spying, hacking, data centers (I drive past the Bluffdale, UT data center everyday), wi-fi everywhere. There's no way to protect yourself.  Someone's always just a click away from digitally intruding on our lives.  In that regard, Watch_Dogs has plenty to say about modern society and the big, wide gray areas we all inhabit.I've enjoyed this game a lot.  Give it a try.  Give in to the paranoia.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2014"}

Get a few colors and shapes, match them up and volia (or kaboom if you will).Bejeweled twist takes the time tested swapping of two colors for the new system of 4 color rotation.  Unlike most alterations to puzzle games, it works to create a whole new puzzle.  It alters they way you think about your moves, especially since lining up 4 or 5 jewels at the same time give you special powers needed to destroy certain items (such as the coal bricks).  Honestly, while it forces you to think in new ways, it also makes the game easier.  Essentially it allows you to carry a jewel across the whole board if you need to, meaning you always have a move.Regardless, there is plenty of strategy here and the undenialiby great feeling of getting a cascade.  It is Bejeweled, slightly altered, but still Bejeweled.

{"product_name":"B00020V4N0","reviewerName":"M. Boone \"DaClint\"","summary":"Madden 2005, Over-rated!","reviewText":"This game is a whole lotta fun. The Franchise Mode is a lot more realistic. You can trade draft picks and with the owner mode, you create the prices, advertising, and one fan appreciation day per year. Also, you can listen to the radio show that actually tells what happened that week and earn money for your stadium to buy improvements later on. You can propose trades and your guys improve or get worse a little bit every 4-5 weeks, depending on the player's performance. But the D-Stick is overrated. It's nothing more than a stronger tackle. If you miss the tackle, you trip and get burned. The replays are cooler but the commentary is the same pretty much and they say the same things a lot. The kicking is a little harder but the new camera angle gives the receiving end a good chance to find a \"hole\" to get great yardage on the return. The create-a-fan feature has the unique masks and foam fingers for each team. My favorite drill in mini-camp, the ground attack, is now available for playing against opponents in mini-games. The defense can now score points in the two minute drill. But, the regular multiplayer exhibition mode has lost its touch with all the new features for single player mode. One good thing about it is the new plays. The game is worth the $50 for serious and normal football fans. And one last thing, the soundtrack is great! It's better than some movie soundtracks. It has artists like Hoobastank, Green Day, New Found Glory, and much more. Part of soundtrack is available for download at iTunes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Solid game play with bad writing","reviewText":"This is a fairly standard JRPG with a turn-based battle system and job/class system. As a game, it's great. The game play is fun, engaging, and solid. The story itself is pretty interesting, but it gets ruined in the delivery.The dialog in this game is absolutely and irredeemably horrendous. Characters use 3 or more sentences to \"cleverly\" announce things that should take the player less than the first sentence to figure out, and that's only if you haven't already gotten the idea before the speech even begins. This makes cut scenes drag out far too long just in the speech alone. But then there's the \"cinematography.\" There are 5 main characters in the game, and each of their individual-yet-identical reactions needs to be shown separately rather than just doing a nice group shot and move on. It makes the painfully long interactions take painfully longer. To make matters worse, you can't easily skip through them. Each cut scene one is divided into several short, 5-10 seconds sub-scenes that you have skip individually, but you can't skip the scene for the first second or so. This is really only a problem if they immediately precede an event with a one-chance achievement. If you miss the achievement, you have to reload your save and then button-mash the start button for 20 seconds to skip the painfully long BS you've already sat through once.Also, whoever edited the translation apparently never learned how to use pronouns. Characters over-use each others' names instead of referring to \"her\" or \"him\". This would be fine in Japanese, were using pronouns is not considered \"polite\", but in English it makes for second grade level conversation. This seems petty, but I'm an aspiring writer and misuse of language irritates the crap out of me. For example, take the sentence: \"I think Kluke is great, and I really like Kluke, but Kluke never seems to notice me.\" These characters are supposed to be 17-18? This sounds like it came from a 3 year old.But that aside, the game is fun and expansive. The map may be small-ish, but the layout is pretty genius with twists, turns, and barriers (which you can remove later in the game) that force you to take a healthy amount of time exploring. There's a ton of items (380 core items, plus a bunch more from DLC), so collecting never really gets old. There's also a ton of monsters (290), so combat never really gets stale, either. Finally, there are 9 classes, and each character has access to all of them, so you can mix-and-match as your party learns new skills without ever being left with an unbalanced party. The \"generalist\" class lets you learn \"Skills+X\" (up to 8) and \"Accessory+X\" (up to 3) where 'X' is the number of additional slots you get. You can put these skills in the first two slots for each of the other 8 classes and have a permanent expansion, allowing you combine up 10 skills from multiple categories, as well as add 3 extra accessories, to form super-characters. By the end of the game, you really should be mowing down rows of enemies with a single hit while simultaneously looting multiple items and absorbing tons of HP and MP.I recommend this game as a very fun time-killer. But I warn you: don't expect to be thrilled by the dialog.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

In some ways it falls far short of its lofty promises. The single player campaign was too drawn and needed work. I felt as though it was dry and I had to force myself to play it. I have strong opinion you should play campaign before online, but this dropped the ball for single player in my opinion. It caters to purely online play. I gave it a 4 because 3 was way too low. More like a 3.75. I loved every installment of battlefield. This one was great, but definitely left me with a thirst and want for something else. I love its ability to cater to those who COD forgot. Did this installment feel like it was trying to hard to be the same and different as COD to anyone else?? This game has a one time through on the campaign purely because I believe that is why I bought it. The online lives true to everything promised. If you are for online only, then consider the campaign a bonus, if you desire the story and depth of characters...

It doesn't matter if you're obsessed with videogames, just a casual fan, or don't play videogames at all: the God of War series is just one of those trilogies that demands the respect or recognition of all gamers... who are somewhere around 18 years old. Using Greek mythology as a basis for its unique story, similarly to the movie Clash of the Titans, God of War puts players into the sandals of Kratos, a Spartan warrior with incredible strength and a temper to match who slays almost every mythological figure he comes across; whether it's a person or a monster, there's literally a 90% chance Kratos will kill them. When the game starts, it does so without any overly long building up or dragging out. From the main menu you can see the side of Kratos's face (mostly his silhouette) amidst a background of flames. Once you press start, the flames fade away and the camera shows Kratos's entire face and he sadly speaks: \"The gods of Olympus have abandoned me.\" You then see that he is atop an enormous cliff, which he steps off of and plummets towards the waters of the Aegean Sea below him. The game then wastes no time with the action and goes back three weeks to when Kratos, in the service of the gods, is in a large shipwreck in the very same ocean doing battle with undead warriors, harpies, and a multi-headed Hydra. In what ends up becoming the trademark of the God of War series, this game sort of starts you off battling a boss, the Hydra, although at first you fight only a couple of its heads as you guide Kratos through the wreckage of several ships the Hydra destroyed, with many of the passengers being slaughtered en masse. When Kratos finally reaches the master head of the Hydra, the game shows off its graphical and technical superiority: the master head of the Hydra is GIGANTIC with sharp teeth and an intimidating roar. Kratos appears about the size of a Polly Pocket figure in comparison to this monster. When Kratos shows he is a match for this creature and proceeds to punish it with his chained blades, the Blades of Chaos, you begin to see how Kratos is truly one tough customer.Afterwards, Kratos is tasked by Athena, the goddess of wisdom, to destroy her brother Ares, the titular god of war, and save her city of Athens from being destroyed by him and his army. Kratos appears to have some past history with Ares and gladly accepts the mission in return for the gods removing the nightmares and memories that haunt Kratos every day and night; memories consisting of him slaughtering countless men and women. Kratos then begins his journey to slay Ares and his minions, traveling great distances through many detailed and varied environments such as the streets of Athens, the Desert of Lost Souls, and Pandora's Temple. During his journey, we find out more about Kratos's past, and the way the game slowly reveals his past through flashbacks with beautifully detailed CGI cutscenes is nothing short of amazing. These scenes are narrated by an unseen elderly woman, giving the scenes and the game in general a storytelling element that immediately grips the player and immerses them into the epic mythos of the game. It's also (mostly) through these cutscenes that we see just how well Kratos defines the term \"anti-hero\". Make no mistake, while Kratos is the protagonist of the game, he is by no means a \"good guy\" or \"hero\". In any other tale, he could easily be the villain.However, this game is more than just pretty graphics and an interesting tale. Most of it is in your face, relentless, bloody, and challenging action. As I previously mentioned, Kratos battles every kind of mythological creature ever spawned like minotaurs, centaurs, cyclopses, Medusa, and much more. With his main weapons, the fire imbued Blades of Chaos, Kratos can defeat most enemies just with the very effective combos available to him with these blades, mostly through combinations of light and heavy attacks. The blades can be upgraded for extra power and effectiveness as you defeat enemies. Kratos also acquires upgradeable magical abilities from the gods such as throwing Zeus's lightning bolts (Zeus's Fury), surrounding himself with a field of lightning (Poseidon's Rage), turning his enemies into stone with the head of Medusa (Medusa's Gaze), and summoning the souls of the dead (Army of Hades). He also acquires another weapon, the Blade of Artemis, which is slow and has a shorter reach than the Blades of Chaos, but does more damage per swing. The Blades of Chaos also eventually grant Kratos with the Rage of the Gods, where a bolt of lightning strikes Kratos and he is energized with the electrical energy. In this state his attacks do far greater damage and he takes much less damage from enemy attacks. It's best to save this move for a couple of the game's more difficult set-pieces and boss battles. One particular set-piece where Kratos undergoes a seemingly endless battle with a bunch of three headed Cerberus hounds proves to be one of the most difficult battles in the entire series and demands smart use of magic and Rage of the Gods. When surrounded by enemies, knowing when to attack, block/parry, or dodge attacks is key to surviving. That's what's so great about this game's combat: it's challenging, but also accessible and easy even for newbies to set up a good rhythm. Another way Kratos can do away with his enemies is by grabbing them once they've been weakened and then one of many quick time events will occur. You'll have to either press one of the four face buttons when prompted to do so, twist the analog sticks, or jam on the cirlce (grab) button so Kratos can brutally dismember his enemies: he'll twist off heads, yank off arms, behead enemies with their own weapons, rip them in half... whatever you can picture in your darkest thoughts, Kratos can do it.Other times, button prompts pop up requiring you to jam on a button simply to lift up a gate or push over a huge statue. The QTEs also come into play when Kratos battles the bosses in this game, and successfully completing them does great damage to the bosses (or kills them). This game perfected the use of QTEs: they give you just enough time to react and you usually only suffer moderate damage should you miss a step, but you still have to be on your toes if you want to survive. There are only three bosses in the game, but they're all huge and offer decent challenges, especially the final boss. The game has many puzzles to test the player's wit as well, and most of them are reasonably challenging. Some may take a while to figure out, like knowing in which order to turn several levers to activate some other machine. Others involve just being very quick, like pushing a large block across the floor and climbing onto it to reach a higher ledge before spikes shoot up from the floor and instantly kill Kratos. Still others require that Kratos sacrifice a person to please the gods, and he has no qualms about doing such a thing if it helps him in his quest to kill Ares (told you he wasn't a good guy). Overall, the game's combat and puzzles are challenging, but not quite to such an infuriating degree as games like Devil May Cry 3. I'm sure it's pretty obvious to you by now that this game has a very high level of blood and gore, but it also has several instances of nudity and sexual situations that actually reinforce the overall authenticity of the game's Greek myth backdrop... just don't play this game in front of children or family members if you want to avoid having a very awkward moment. This game has great graphics, challenging enemies and puzzles, an epic story, and top-notch gameplay and controls. Not to mention the incredible music, with lots of well sung orchestral scores that fit the game very well and further enhance its epicness. Get this game if you haven't already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2011"}

This is the first video game I have ever played where you have to solve puzzles to be able to advance.  I'm not talking puzzles like putting blocks in order from lowest to highest (1,2,3,4,5), they are actually pretty hard.  A lot of them involve strategic thinking and puzzle solving abilities.Of course, there is a ton of bloody combat where you can castrate your enemies.  Every time you kill one, you get orbs, which can be used to buy upgrades.  The story is pretty interesting too.  You are Kratos, a Spartan who wants to kill the God of War because he betrayed you.  You go on your quest and battle numerous enemies and solve many puzzles.  And in the end, you can probably guess what happens.I would recommend this game to anyone who is old enough to witness the horrible ways of killing that occur in this game.

{"product_name":"B002ZJPYHS","description":"","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"Underappreciated","reviewText":"The single-player game and the multiplayer game are powered by two completely different engines and developed by two completely different teams. This probably saved them a lot of time, but the evenness definitely suffered. For example, the multiplayer maps may resemble the theme of the single-player game (Afghanistan), but they are not from the game at all. The guns don't carry over, either.Single-PlayerPowered by Unreal Engine 3, this is the uglier of the two modes. The textures are not very good, and the AA doesn't really work too well; everything is still jaggy. The actual campaign, though, is excellent. It felt less like a Michael Bay movie, and more like a modern war movie, like Hurt Locker, the superior Green Zone, and even Brothers. This is the most emotionally captivating FPS I have ever played. The length, however, is pretty short. You can finish this game in 5 hours. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Doing the same thing for 30 hours is still doing the same thing for 30 hours. The campaign that has been crafted here is fantastic. Also, the FOV is non-changeable, unlike in multiplayer, but I got used to it after a while.MultiplayerPowered by Frostbite Engine 1.5, this is the most beautiful engine I have ever seen. It looks better than Crysis to me. There are only 3 classes, and you don't get unrealistic perks like in Call of Duty, but the graphics, the realistic maps, and the non-rushing nature of the gameplay is very good. I dislike the offensive support actions. Sometimes you'll get hit by mortar strikes, rockets and missiles over and over again. It's really annoying. Also, it's hard to get experience points without getting a kill. Trying to get a kill as a sniper is hard.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

I HATE YOU BETHESDA SOFTWORKS.","reviewText":"First off, I was obsessed with Fallout 1 and 2, and Fallout 3 was just so good that the glitches from the original game just didn't effect me so much.  I was enjoying the original Fallout 3 game too much, but the down loadable contents(DLC) were too glitchy to try again.Now with a new company making the new installment, I hoped that the quality of the game would be better.  NO IT DIDN'T.  It's basically Fallout 3 with additional glitches that are too much to enjoy.  What is worst is that the glitches are so bad that it CORRUPTS saves.  So forget about continuing your progress, since they won't mean anything.If you still want to purchase the game, then DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME for this console.  The Xbox 360 has a timed exclusive like Fallout 3.  Also, once the DLCs were available for the PS3 users, the DLCs were filled with glitches that were NEVER PATCHED.I REALLY HATE THE WAY BETHESDA SOFTWORKS AND their scapegoat, Obsidian Entertainment.  SERIOUSLY, THEY MUST THINK PATCHES ARE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE GAMES.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY FINISH THE GAME AND SEE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS IT AS A FINISH GAME.(Review of the game)It's just one giant DLC.  Almost every part of the game is the same as Fallout 3.  The only differences are just the small details.  New additional weapons, trees, Vegas.  There are some good parts of the game, but there are just too much of the last game in this game that it's really not a new game.It's much more harder than the last Fallout 3 game.  They went back to the original leveling up sequence from Fallout 1 and 2 where you can only get a perk after leveling up a few times, instead of leveling up every time.  Now you can get two more companions at the same time.  One is a living person and the other is a machine or mechanical one. Also, for Fallout 2 fans, this game does mention the tribal descendant, vault dweller as well as his/her's super mutant companion.  Arefu remind you of anything.I rented this damn game, and, based on my experience, didn't taking advantage of Black Friday deals where this game was marked down to $34.99.  The game is just so badly made that I didn't want to help top this game as a best-seller.  As a PS3 owner, this time exclusives are worthless.  If you decided to stick it to your PS3 consumers, you can guarantee that some us are more interested in other games than your DLCs when it comes out.Bethesda Softworks is a bad game company and their treatment towards PS3 consumers are horrible.When you buy Bethesda Softworks, you're buying an unfinished game period.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

Suda, you son of ma gun!","reviewText":"Yet again Suda 61 makes a game that has more flash than substance -- Killer 7, Halo 2, No More heroes, Final Fantasy 7, and now this game. Get it together, Suda. His Fire Pro Wrestling games were amazing.. but that was like, 30 years ago. Now we have this horrible game with little to no storyline(LOL REVENGE) and immature humor. What baffles me most, is the M rating on the box.. I mean, really? This is a children's game. The large amount of sexual references made me question if this game was related to Bayonetta in anyway. Aside from the sexual references mentioned above and the blood.. No More heroes 3 is a mindless button masher for children.Also, theres a'little TOO much \"humor\" for such a violent movie game. Travis seems like a normal(IN JAPAN) guy most of the time, but during some parts of the game(mainly cutscenes) he turns into a ruthless jackass and even kills some innocent people with no remorse, even cracking a joke while doing so; way to be inconsistent, speaking of inconsistency.. theres appearantly 50 assassins, but Marella doesn't recall fighting that many, the game blatantly lies to you.Marella praises the game's charater designs, but the gameplay is far too linear in this era of gaming.. that's weak. It doesn't take much effort to make a game that parody's other games and has a non-existant un-original plot.. anyone could do this. The only good thing about this game, aside from the character designs, would be the MGS and Super Robots homage.This is why Suda games don't have sequels(with the exception of this one), because they suck.Marella gives this game a solid, a SOLID, 1/5.SUDA, YOU LOSE!

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Joshua Glowzinski \"Gman\"","summary":"Dead tired after playing for a hour or so.","reviewText":"The first Xbox One games I got were Dead Rising 3 and Fighting Fury.  I somewhat regret getting Rising 3.  I do not want to get ahead of myself.  This will be a short review.When I first started this game, I noticed that while it looked good, it seemed somewhat dull.  I can not explain it.  It just does not impress me.  So I started out on a bad note.  You play a mechanic who is going through some though times.  What with a zombie outbreak and all.  There is something about the guy that is different from most of the people though.  I will leave that out of the review so you can find out on your own.There is a story here.  The problem is, sometimes you just can not hear a thing that is being said.  You have a phone.  Someone will call you.  The thing is though, there are so many things happening in the background, that you can not hear one word the person is saying.  Other times, you will be told to drive around while something happens.  Thank the gaming gods that you can save your game at anytime.  As fun as it is to drive around and find treasure and kill zombies, after doing to for 10 or 15 minutes, you've really had enough.  It just gets dull fast.You can upgrade things.  So far, I can upgrade the weapons and the vehicles.  You have to find the blue prints.  They are all over the places.  You find them, then stand in front of two items.  The items will get this white glow and you can upgrade them.  It was cool the first time I did it.  But again, as with the random zombie killing, it just get to the point in which I no longer cared.  It does give you something to do though.  Trying to find all the blueprints.As far as controls go, they are good.  There is no auto lock though.  Many times you will be shooting at something, and they will just jump all around.  I guess it is all about knowing when to attack.  When driving, I can always control it very easily.  Now, you will hear a lot about no load times.  It is true to a point.  I can drive all over the city and not once do I ever have to wait for something to load.  Trust me, it is a good thing.  The reason I say this is for the fact that when you die, an trust me, you will die a lot in this game, you have to sit and watch a thing go in a circle.  Now, I know what your saying.  \"So what?\"  Well, 15 or 20 seconds sitting there would be fine.  But, every time you die, you will have to sit there, looking at the screen for 64 seconds!!!!  It is the longest I have ever had to wait for a game to load.  I've been playing games since the NES.  I was under 10 when my parents had that system, so let us compare the load times to Playstation and Nintendo 64.  You just site there.  Now imagine, you play for an hour and you die 15 times.  Well, that is at least 15 minutes of that hour that you will be waiting for the freaking game to load.  Not cool.  That is a reoccurring thing with the One.  Every single thing I do just drag on and on and freaking on.  I mean, after a bit, I just got sick of the loading and said forget it.  Before anyone out there says they didn't die once.  Good for you.  There are people who are far better at gaming than I.  But for those who sometimes slip up and do die, good luck.In the end, I think I got $10 and got this for $49.99.  I would have been much happier though if I had gotten it for, say $19.99.  It is just one of those games that you forget about.  It reminds me of a Playstation 2 game.  I can not think of the game.  But it does.  It is fun.  But it can get very frustrating.  I will play it and finish it.  Then I will sell it and never play it again.  Take that for what it is.  Happy gaming.Oh, it should be noted that I've never played either of the other Dead Rising games for a long period of time.  I may have rented the second one.  I do remember playing it.  Maybe it was a demo.Well, I had given this game a 3 and said I would give it a 3.8 I think.  After playing through a part in which you have to destroy the loaders to escape, I give this game a 1.  I am standing there, hitting the button to pick up health and nothing happens, I run and nothing happens.  I finally get past the second part only to have no clue which way to go to get to the next part because the room is on fire and I can not see a thing, thus I can not see the way out.  I absolutely hate this game.  I will sell it and buy something that I hope is better.  Maybe E.T for the Atari. 2600.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J9M0","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"I just want you gone.","reviewText":"If you've played the original Portal then you'll feel right at home with the temporal displacement concept used again in Portal 2. If not then the game has a short acclimatization opening set of missions to get you in the swing and before you know it you'll be romping through walls only to appear in ceilings and floors.Now it would have been quite easy I think for Valve to just replicate the original. The (almost) mini-game that was included as part ofThe Orange Boxwas innovative enough to support at least one more game without changing too much. They could have merely padded it out with new missions and similar challenges and told the same story and been done... and I think most of us would have loved it regardless. However, I applaud Valve though for taking the chance to improve on the original game in every way. New elements added include a metablob power goo which can allow you to run faster (orange goop), jump higher (blue) and even put portals in places you couldn't have before (white). There are lasers and glass refracting cubes, leaps of faith and directional tunnels which allow you to travel over the many bottomless pits or retrieve cubes from distant areas. Plus the challenges are more stringent with the freedom to put a portal where ever you want several restricted forcing good old strategic thinking. I loved the forehead slapping moments where just as you thought a puzzle was impossible you realize it was actually the easiest one in the game. And this happened more than once.So the game mechanics are vastly improved but really that's not the star. Nor is it GlaDOS, the auto-tuned warbler and fiendish creator of the tests, and despite what you may have read it's not even Stephen Merchant's amazing ad-libbed voice over as new-comer Wheatley (incredibly funny and sublimely British though it is). No, for me, the jewel in the Portal 2 crown was the story; the underlying tale told unfolds to create a new universe and without spoiling anything I learned a lot about 'myself' playing Portal 2. The story swerves from massively funny to downright dark with just enough tongue-in-cheek to pull it off. Wisecracking and death threats - love it! And you can tell it's good writing when you stand around waiting to hear the next line instead of blasting through the mission.Now all this comes with my one caveat and that's the duration of the game. It's short. Wonderful but short. None of my online friends have Portal 2 yet so the co-op mode remains unplayed for me which just leaves the single player campaign and that frankly has limited appeal in terms of replay value. You should factor this one point in when deciding how much the game is worth paying for.Every so often a game comes along which has all factors in place to stand out from the crowd. Portal 2 is a revelation in story telling in games, and a unique star in a sea of generic FPS clones. I've no doubt there will be a Portal 3 and I'll be one of the first to buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

They have years to complete a game, and yet put out a product which isn't ready for the consumer. First off I will say this game is brilliant. It is just as gripping as any major Hollywood Drama. The graphics are incredible and the plot is phenomenal. I really hope this game does well so that in the future more games in this new \"genre\" of interactive games will be released. I will say give the controls some time...they are really frustrating and unintuitive...but you sort of get used to them with time. I hope the developer does NOT implement the walking control scheme in future games...holding the R2 button to walk while trying to position the left stick (which changes orientation every time the darn camera changes) is mind-numbingly frustrating in several parts of the game.Now on to the bad stuff. This game has BUGS. It skips...the sound hiccups, and worst of all: IT FREEZES CONSTANTLY. I have a brand new ps3 slim and it is not my system. I looked online and it looks like the game is extremelly buggy, all of the forums confirm that my case of freezing is not isolated. This is unforgivable in a major marquee release like this. It installs a 220 meg patch when you first get the game but that does nothing to solve the freezing issues.And yet...here I am still trying to play the damn thing even though it freezes on me every 30 minutes. If there was a standard \"Save Anywhere\" Feature this would be fine, but the game saves in checkpoints and in many cases not until AFTER you finish a chapter. Shame on Sony for releasing a product this buggy. Hopefully it gets fixed in a future patch...until then I think I'll have to either return it or wait.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"chaoslegion","summary":"Preview for Diablo 3!!!","reviewText":"Finally, the game that everyone's waiting for has come. The Diablo 3. Well, sort of. The real name of the game is called Guild Wars, and it was developed by the co developers of Starcraft, Warcraft, and finally, Diablo itself. It's just basically Diablo 3 which has similar gameplay as Diablo 2 but with better graphics and more.Like the other reviewer, I have played the beta on last days of October, and I got to tell you, it's hell of a game. Since, I'm in a hurry, I won't tell you much about the game but just tell you some stuff that other reviewer left out.The graphics are simply, amazing(At one moment throughout the game, I noticed myself staring at the water details for like 1 minute just checking out the details because it was so shiny and watery). To get the best out of the game, you would need the new GeForce 6800 or Radeon X800, but the system which I have tried on still made the game look sharp and almost life-like. The system was Athlon XP 3200+, 512mb pc3200 ram, GeForce 5700LE overclocked 256mb 8x, and DSL. It was on 1024x768 with on auto detect settings which was on high settings.But the one thing that I really think that was smart of the developers was the download and play system(This way, you won't need to waste 2 hours installing 3GB HD space which this game will probably be overall or something close to it). I'm not sure that's what it was called but that's how it works. First, all you need is 62kb client which will let you download the launcher. After that, you need to register. When you create your character and play it will download the files that you will need to get to that main area. It will happen everytime you go to a new area. Also, I don't know if this happens to all computers, but my loading times were about 5 seconds which is very fast. The downloading might take longer depending on the connection speed.Besides this, the other reviewer(G. Coope) pretty much mentioned the main stuff. The reason why I gave 5 instead of 4 was because I know that this game will be much better than the beta.Graphics-10 (better than any other MMORPG games except for Everquest 2 and Lineage)Gameplay-10 (like Diablo 2)Sound-9 (decent music but nothing extraordinary)Replay Value-8 (after playing like 10 hours straight you will eventually get tired of it but after 30 minutes pass by, you will be hacking and slashing again)Difficulty and learning curve-9 (medium and 30 minute learning curve)Overall-9.2 (a Must Have!)I hope this beta review was helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2004"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Bob O.

I never really played the previous games either, but I knew that my friends on live would be playing this so I had to break down and get it. Anyways, it's so fun! I haven't played much of the campaign yet, so I'm going to discuss the multiplayer, which is probably the reason a lot of people buy it anyways. The graphics are pretty good; they're nothing like Gears, but then I often got lag on Gears and people always complained about the host advantage. I'm playing from Japan, but I had no problem playing games of 12 people with mostly stateside members. I haven't played a match yet where I noticed any lag and the game play seems really solid. I especially like the balance of weapons and the physics in this game. Everything feels really smooth and there seems to be a good balance in game play.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Look Ma, I'm a B-movie zombie killer superstar","reviewText":"One thing that I try to do whenever a new game is coming out is generally try to avoid any articles, gameplay footage and press before a game's release since inevitably I'll read too much into it and be disappointed. Instead, it's better to walk into a game, movie or CD fresh and free of preconceptions and just let the game does what it does rather than what you want it to do and that's what Left 4 Dead did for me. While Portal is one of my favorite games ever, I have to say I'm only a marginal fan of the Half-Life series so I figured \"well, brand new Xbox 360, 2 years worth of games to try out, why not start with a new one?\" and so we have this incredibly fun shooter that has an incredibly satisfying whole though strangely, nitpick-worthy parts.Story: No real \"story\" here, just 4 scenarios themed as a B-movie event with 4 survivors: Zoey, a college student and horror movie lover, Bill, a war veteran, Louis, a desk worker for an IT company and Francis, a tattoo-sporting biker. The 4 have to make it through various locales such as an airport, the countryside or a hospital as they battle wave upon wave (upon wave) of zombies.Graphics: Like Epic Games and their Unreal Engine, Valve continually uses the Source Engine which has received improvements with each game they use with it and one thing they changed was lighting which has been considerably updated since Half-Life 2's Ravenwood level and now the moodiness, the flashlight and atmosphere has been refined to really make you feel you're in a spooky B-movie. Another is the crowd and when you see more than 2 dozen incoming zombies running at you, that \"oh........****\" feeling creeps in.Sound/Music: The music of course is appropriately moody and creepy and meant to create an almost atonal ambience similar to Resident Evil games and it works quite well though in order to hear Live chatter, I had to turn it down (I use headphones) but I like its use. Voice acting is sort of a weird mixed bag in that the characters are voiced very well and I never despised that one character for bad lines however those lines will be repeated quite frequently and \"Reloading!\" or \"Cover me while I heal\" will pop up on more than one time.Gameplay: While you can play single player with competent though not altogether useful AI players, it's best to go on Xbox Live or system link/split screen and play that way since it's incredibly fun and while the scenarios aren't plentiful in choices, I found it fun to just go through the levels anyway. There's not a whole lot here to learn with your D-pad providing various item uses with Up (flashlight), Right (med pack with LT to heal teammate, RT to heal yourself), Down (Pain pills) and Left (grenades which are either Pipe Bombs that beep which zombies flock to or molotov cocktails to create some flamage). Weapons come from pistols that have unlimited ammo with a second pistol being able to be found and for bigger firepower we have Shotgun, Assault Rifles and Sniper. Located within each scenario are Safe Rooms which upon closed provide a checkpoint as well as ammo and weapon replenishing and also revive dead teammates.Now since it is zombies, you're thinking it's just going to be those 28 Weeks Later-esque zombies that strictly run right? Nope, we have different classes from boomers (big fat guys that vomit goo on you which makes zombie flock to you specifically), smokers which can latch onto you with a looooong tongue and incapacitate you unless you're saved by a teammate, hunters who act like jumping cats that pounce on you from afar to the big burly Tanks. The creepy ones coming from Witches; what sounds like a crying girl turns out to be a one-hit kill beast for anyone who disturbs her so it's best to avoid her unless you want one of the achievements. Versus mode allows you to play as the survivors or the zombies and let's just say smashing through stuff as a tank is bad*** incarnate. The one fault in the Versus mode is that while playing as the undead is fun, your bullet-taking capacity is abysmal and many times you'll be dead before you even get to have fun and have to wait 20 seconds to respawn. I understand at least wanting to give survivors a chance to win but come on, that's just silly.Not wanting to have 4 repeated scenarios with the same encounter each time, Valve brought in the \"Director\" which essentially acts as a zombie button where it sends enemies to you depending on your progress so whereas on one scenario, I had to stop an invading horde from behind, in a subsequent playthrough they were nowhere to be found. And while it is fun to constantly be on your toes, the level design itself is pretty much set in place and what would've made it fun is if the level itself changed in each playthrough such as a cave-in prompting another way around or an explosion blocking an exit but that's not here so Left 4 Dead is insanely fun when you don't think about the small details.If you can get the game as a deal, go for it since it's one of the more enjoyable surprises on the 360 so far. But for a full 70 buck purchase, it feels like the amount of stuff to do would be a factor if it wasn't for the fun that outweights it but however you get it, play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

If you've ever wanted to know what it would be like to experience a zombie appocalypse with other people, well then your in for a treat here. This is probably the closest thing you'll get to an interactive zombie movie. There is also an AI director which controls enemy numbers, enemy placement, weapons placement ect. Sadly there are only four campaigns in the game and once you memorize the levels, the game gets repetitive after a while even with the AI director. Also there are a lot of douche bags online too. This is by no means a bad game, it's very fun but it can get a bit old after a while.

Take what would be a three-part South Park episode, combine it with all the tropes and cliches of classic JRPG video games, and you've got the Stick of Truth, a foul, hilarious romp through South Park and a love letter to geekery.FOR FANS OF THE SHOW: The game is just as funny as the show. The creators had a heavy hand in the writing of the game, and it's full of all the banter, gags, and offensive humor you know and love. It LOOKS like the show, too. Obsidian did a great job of capturing the look of South Park, so much so that it often looks like an interactive episode. Very well done.FOR VIDEO GAME FANS: If you enjoy the JRPG genre, you'll know this game's mechanics inside and out. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's simple and direct and gets the job done. Timed battle system similar to some of the Final Fantasy installments, some exploration, good special powers system, and lots of parodying of genre tropes. It's very well done.The game is a bit on the short side for the genre -- you'll finish in about 12 hours -- but to be honest, over the course of 40 hours this would probably begin to get old, so 12 hours is close to ideal.Very funny game and actually fun to play, just remember what it is. If you don't like South Park, you won't like this, and if you hate JRPG mechanics you'll probably need to be a huge South Park fan for this to sustain your interest.If you like South Park and like games, though, you'll probably want to play this.

Theisen","summary":"A living, breathing animated novel","reviewText":"It's all about the little things in this game. Never mind the fact that the general premise and presentation is unique and memorable, but it's the small things that will keep sinking in and makes Valkyria Chronicles a delightful experience for any fan of the strategy or tactical RPG genres or just plan anyone who enjoys a rewarding character experience in general.Just going through the installation starts to tip you off of these little things. As it progresses, the background image from the title screen slowly fills in with color from just a sketch to a full mural. It's so subtle it takes particular attention to even spot it happening. Though optional, this install makes a lot of the load times in-game practically zero and I'd highly suggest it.Starting your game you can instantly tell you're on to something special. Instead of being shoved through any content, you're shown the game interface in the extremely unique form of a novel--one apparently being written by an author in this reality. Every cutscene and battle throughout is treated as a separate entity. Separated into Chapters, it gives a sense of meaning to your progress and lends a very unconventional third-person view over the game. Time to fight for Gallia!The combat system itself actually lends to the story experience. You're playing the role of one squad of one regiment of one division of an army of Gallia. Not some elite group, not the pride of the army in any way. Actually quite the opposite--as part of the militia the military higher-ups in the army have little faith in you and are quite happy to send you in as cannon fodder on the front lines. This flows into the normal course game, and eventually you'll end up with more special little tasks in particular places that make the story documentation by the narrator actually justifiable. Perhaps the aspect of this I find most interesting is that your squad and characters are just comprised of just normal everyday people. You don't have special powers or magic abilities of any sort. Some are volunteers, some are drafted. Some have friends, others prefer to work alone. You can be injured and killed just like anyone else out there. If one of your members is killed, they're gone forever. This cloud overhead instantly changes the game from just some kind of war-based or simple tactics game toward a hybrid RPG to all but the entirely coldhearted. In other words, you might start out as any random group of soldiers, but because the story develops so well it's only at your final battles that you realize you're in such a special place. This is a good thing.Moving forward, every new chapter keeps offering new little things to make you smile. You gain members and form your own specialized smaller attack squad with them. You'll end up with about 50 recruits, all of which have a very particular personality (with voice-over dialogue included), special quirks and traits, and the novel will even keep a \"Personnel\" section for you that will keep adding new bits of information about them as the story progresses as they're used more in combat. With so much diversity, there are more than enough different ways to fill out your squad to match your mood. When you go into a mission, you'll have your squad comprised of 20 out of all of your available recruits, and any of these 20 is able to be used if you choose.All aspects of your squad are handled in the \"Headquarters\" tab of the novel, allowing you to change members at any time, upgrade weapons and armor, train your units (the process to level up), meet with a war reporter and a few other things. The first time you head here a few chapters in, you'll have the task of picking your 20 active members--this is harder than it sounds. As I mentioned, each has his or her own personality and you'll end up with an instant love/hate of some of them. It becomes harder and harder to keep in all the members you enjoy the most, as almost all of them have memorable lines of some sort. You'll most certainly feel some kind of real emotional connection to some of them after your battles together, so much so that losing them in combat will have you frantically going to load from your last same to prevent this... and some self-mental abuse for ever putting them in such a tight spot.Beyond the personalities of all your members, as they go through battles and gain levels they'll earn new \"potentials\" (combat abilities, basically). Here's another place where the RPG-ness of the game kicks in nicely. Even though all units of any of the 5 job classes all gain experience levels at the same time, no two members end up the same because of these potentials. These can range from expected elements in battle such as either being stronger or weaker when caught in crossfire, to such quirky things as some characters developing such a strong love or hate of one of their comrades that it will greatly change their combat skill when around that member. For example, one of your group leaders wants to be a singer. Another member of her class has the same aspirations and gets furious when around this leader. Another member looks up to her as a role model for the future career she wants and receives bonuses instead. On top of zany quirks like this, when the abilities kick in during combat they all even have their own character dialog attached.Combat can seem rather complicated at first, but you'll get accustomed to it fairly quickly. The first half dozen missions slowly ramp up the difficulty for you and teach you basically everything you'll need to know in terms of normal battle tactics. In short, you're playing the role of the tank commander and leader of your squad, you choose units to control with CP (command points), then move the unit in real-time. This includes moving, hiding in cover, firing, etc.. Naturally, your CP pool is limited. Fortunately, your opponents also have to follow these rules so you're theoretically fighting on the same terms. On top of the movements, you can issue \"Orders\" from your tank over the radio, which are mostly normal combat things like a heightened evasion, calling for a medic to heal or evacuate a wounded soldier. Just like CP, enemy generals can use these too. Moreover, all job classes are shared between you and your foes, general weapon types are the same, tanks work the same way, and so forth. The normal combat flow is to choose how to use your members to capture a particular place on the map or to eliminate a particular target--though there are some very unique types of missions and a few times you'll simply drop your jaw at what you need to do. The overall difficulty of this game can be frustrating for some people, but in almost every case there are multiple ways to complete your objectives.There is one battle element that needs a special note attached; the enemy AI can be simply horrible at times. Even worse is when it's completely manic. You can take advantage of foes by trapping them with crossfire, while others will walk head-on into certain death without firing a shot. Reinforcements seem to have preset actions, which might look very dumb, or might surprise you and cause an instant mission failure if you're not watching your back. This is the one thing that really holds this game back from being a truly revolutionary title that could appease players of a half dozen different genres.Between missions, you'll be going through cutscenes (defined as \"episodes\" within chapters of the book) which push the story forward. All have full voiceovers and have your characters moving and interacting like you'd expect of any social group. The only letdown in these scenes is that conversations that take place in closed areas such as a room are all done via character face pop-up boxes. If you feel like you need to improve your characters a bit more, you're free to engage in Skirmishes, which are basically a way to duplicate battles on some of the maps you've already fought on. All things considered, the majority of your time will be spent in storyline battles, though the percentage of time is in the 70-80% range compared to 90-95%+ like in a lot of RPGs.The graphics are stunning, if not hard to describe in other terms. It's kind of a hodgepodge of what you might think of an animated television series mixed with the drawing style of manga, penned by a sketch artist for accents and flares and colored in with crayons. I'm sure that makes very little sense, but all your need to know is that it works incredibly. My only real complaint about the graphics is how granulated and pixel-y units get when you look at them from a distance or through a sniper rifle scope. It's almost as though you zoom in at what the original view was and it's not enhances. There are tons of graphical details to make up for this though, such as small smoke trails coming from shell casings falling out of machine guns, to the simply beautiful way large explosions and smoke clouds rest, to the awesome \"action word\" system of thing s in battle which continuously remind you that this is a Japanese title. It's not much, but seeing the word \"rummmmble\" trail out from behind your moving tank in a choppy motion is adorably wacky yet adds to the feel of combat. If you're using the Dualshock3, you also get a satisfying rumble in your hands as you move the tank, too.The sound presentation is equally great. The soundtrack is quite expansive and particularly in combat the different tracks and stanzas flow together seamlessly. The only bits of music I really started to yawn at was what's played in headquarters and in book mode. As I've said, all your members have their own unique dialogue and all cutscenes are fully voiced. Moods can change mid-battle, and the music will match and special cutscenes will pop up at important moments with extra dialogue. Weapon sounds are all great and on par with what you'd expect in a full-blown shooter.Depending on your style and care for the story and members, a fair guess of time to complete the storyline is 40-60 hours. This goes up more if you need to repeat missions. After clearing, you're offered the proverbial \"new game plus\" feature, which lets you replay any mission and adds a difficulty level to skirmishes. You'll also have a wide range of \"decorations\" (medals) to collect, and you could easily sink over 100 hours into this game if you wanted to. Even past that, this is the sort of game where you might want to start from the beginning at level 1 all over again, just to watch the whole story play through.However you look at it, the game gushes personality. It took awhile, but here's a truly solid RPG for the PS3. Looking over the game objectively it barely meets the criteria of any variant of RPG, but anyone who might see 10 seconds of a cutscene would instantly recognize it as such. It takes a hell of a game to combine so many different things you do in any single title, throw it in a blender, and actually come out with a result that is greater than the sum of its parts. It may favor players of the RPG brand and hardcore followers of Japanese titles, but there's hardly a gamer out there that wouldn't enjoy playing Valkyria Chronicles. Sega did an awesome job here and this is the sort of genre-mixer that's likely to lead to a lot of copycat types of games in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Too darned scary!Unless you've been living under a rock (or don't care about PC games or even PCs), you're no doubt aware that Doom III has been under development and recently released.  Does Doom III live up to the hype?  Yes it does, but like all computer games has its drawbacks.The graphics are perhaps the best of any PC game, but they're basically just a notch up.  Like most games these days Doom III's visuals include dynamic lighting, shadows, and detail (of course), but it just has more dynamic lighting, shadows, and detail than other games.  Hence, any improvements in graphics set by Doom III are largely of a quantitative nature rather than qualitative.One qualitative feature of Doom III's graphics engine that impressed me was its ability to render \"video\" in real time.  As you make your way through the levels, you see monitors upon which are often displayed some video that purports to explain some aspect of the story.  I thought this was a cool effect, and I haven't seen it in any other game.The sound and music in Doom III are also quite good, and you may wish to play the game on a good set of 5.1 surround speakers.Nevertheless, this graphic and audio excellence comes at a price.  I played the game on my 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 system with 512 MB RAM and a 128 MB Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card and experienced significant performance problems.  Many of these problems were alleviated by downloading drivers from ATI that noticeably improved performance, but my PC could still only eek out good performance at 800 X 600 screen resolution at \"mid-quality\" graphics settings.  So if you've got the money and the inclination, I'd suggest you spare no expense in getting the best gaming computer available for this game.The gameplay is fairly standard for a shooter.  You wonder through corridors and rooms killing monsters (if they don't kill you first) and you look for important items such as weapons, ammo, health \"kits,\" armor, and items you may need to open a locked door.  Sometimes it is very helpful if not essential to find a code you can use to open a door or a storage cabinet.  Since the levels are very often dark, you need to use a flashlight a lot.  Much ado has been made that you cannot use the flashlight and a weapon simultaneously (although the flashlight can be used as a weak weapon).  However, I found that a good strategy is if confronted by an enemy in a dark area, one should run to a lighted area and battle the monster there if possible.Speaking of the monsters, they are mostly horrific, and they make the game a bit too scary even for me.  Although the first 3/5 of the game or so you battle mostly zombies that are rather weak, you'll be fighting for your life against tougher monsters later in the game.  One monster that really sent chills down my spine is the \"hellknight.\"  These things are about the most frightening monsters I've seen in any game.  They're HUGE, ugly, very powerful, and you'd better be ready to fight if you run into one in some dark corridor.  On one level my health was low, and a hellknight was coming for me.  Fortunately, I was able to circle strafe around a metal lift, and I managed to shoot it with my weapon and duck behind the lift before it could retaliate.  I killed him and breathed a sigh of relief.  Battles like this one are what makes this game so horrific, and I'm no sissy but frankly it got to be too much at times.  The boss battles were too difficult, in my opinion, and I had to use cheat codes to get pass at least two of the bosses.Despite some of the imperfections in this game, I must give Id credit for creating what I'm sure many people might consider a masterpiece.  I really liked most of the game, and I believe it was worth the wait.  Just keep one thought in mind, however:  Doom III is an intense and scary experience that's not for the faint of heart.  Enter if you dare!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2004"}

Could have fixed it myself for $20, but there were a lot of reasons to upgrade. My original didn't have HDMI and was LOUD. The Slim is MUCH quieter (when you turn it on cold you literally can't tell it's on), smaller, and has HDMI and built-in wireless. Awesome. Definitely recommend.Question: My Slim though occasionally \"clips\" audio, as if it's lagging for a millisecond when doing things like backing out of a menu option, or even when powering it on and playing that start-up melody. My old one didn't do this. Does anyone else's?? Odd because I'm pretty sure the Slim also has a slightly more powerful chipset than the Original... Thought I'd mention it here as a question just in case it really is some weird issue with the Slim (software/firmware or not, it's still an issue), and others might like to know.UPDATE 10/6/20111) Glossy finish looks nice out of the box, but agree with others, it's a dust magnet. Really wish it was matte and/or rougher, anything but glossy.2) After much testing, audio static issue seems to be a decoding issue at my TV's end. It happens only through HDMI, with Dolby Digital 5.1 selected on the Xbox. I have an older 42\" Samsung LCD and it seems it has issues keeping up with decoding the audio, so every few minutes or so, it will produce \"static\" on top of the normal audio. I'd think it should distort or skip rather than produce static, but I've narrowed it down pretty conclusively at this point. It's definitely between the Xbox and the TV, and only through HDMI, and other HDMI audio sources (laptop) do not have the same issue, and I'm assuming that's because they're not pushing DD 5.1 like the Xbox is. I suspect if the laptop was pushing DD 5.1 over HDMI, I'd end up with the same issue.Bottom line is if you experience audio static/distortion/fuzz over HDMI and only over HDMI, it's probably not your Xbox. Probably a decoding issue for older hardware.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2011"}

Most I saw in 2 tounaments run the same plays over and over. All they know how to do is pass long,blitz or move 10 players in coverage to only still get burned by somebody else who is lucky enuff to actually complete 2 out of 15 long passes. Now my point is these are the same kind that will get on here or other places and give this whining review bout how they wasted thier money again on Madden calling it unplayable cause they simply have no clue how to play football. This game in opinon is the best to date. The presentation is great,AI especially on defense is alot smarter. The game looks real and for the most part plays true to the NFL.

They updated one of their more underrated franchises and combined it with the amusing Mii aesthetic of Wii Sports Resort.  And in true Pilotwings tradition, it also launches the Nintendo 3DS hardware.  Like Wii Sports Resort, the game takes place in the fictional WuHu Island, reproduced exactly like it was on Sports.  You take control of a number of different aerial vehicles, from biplanes to rocket packs to jets, and then take them for a spin around the island, collecting balloons and flying through rings.  It sounds rather banal, but it actually gets really challenging.  Each mission is laid out like an obstacle course of sorts, and you must navigate through it within a certain time limit while being sure to get as many collectibles as you can.  Completing each mission gives you stars, and you need a certain number of stars to unlock later levels.  Gameplay-wise, the controls are very tight and responsive.  The graphics are on par with Wii Sports Resort, and the sound is crystal clear.  The music needed a little more work...the background songs are really Muzak-inspired!Of course, the star feature in this game is the 3D effect.  Simply put, it is phenomenal.  Even compared to other 3DS titles, this game's 3D is deep and incredibly functional.  It's not just a gimmick...playing the game in 3D vs. 2D will give players a clear advantage, as you can accurately gauge the depth and distance for targets and landing.  As with any 3D game, playing for too long may cause eye strain and even a little dizziness, so take breaks (or periodically switch to 2D).

I had tried Wii almost as soon as it came out and was captivated by the motion sensors but the limited availability and sameness to the games as well as limited graphics was frustrating.Xbox 360 the $50 a year subscription and more importantly it lost the Blu-ray/HD battle were big no points for me. I enjoy games, my wife does not. She does enjoy movies and the internet. When I pointed out that PS3 was a Blu-ray player (with excellent reviews) and could let us surf the internet, she was all for it.I have an 'old' HDTV (3 years old). It has a maximum resolution of 1080i and a DVI input but no HDMI. I did some research before buying this so I bought an HDMI to DVI cable at the same time. I was worried about hooking it up and getting it to look right and also getting sound. I should not have been. It took literally a few minutes. Plugged the HDMI end into the PS3 and the DVI end into the HDTV. Received a picture (great picture) right away. It detected that 1080i was the highest resolution and I choose that.Sound I simply choose the option to put sound out correctly and received gorgeous sound. I only use the speakers that came with the HDTV but it sounds fantastic on Blu-Ray. I can only imagine what people with surround sound systems will get.The Blu-Ray discs are stunning. Even with 'just' 1080i. Truly beautiful. And it also up-converts very well. My favorite movies are the LOTR expanded editions. I have seen LOTR on TNT HD broadcasts. With the PS3 they look almost as good perhaps even better than the HD broadcasts. Also one of the coolest things and I have no idea if this for all Blu-Rays are just PS3 is that it remembers where you were on discs (Blu-ray and DVD discs)even if the disc was last played 8 discs ago. So say for instance you a third of the way through Fellowship. You then put a few game discs in, some other movie discs, then go back to Fellowship. It actually remembers where you left off that disc. Love it.The internet browsing has been very cool. At first it was ok but it did not fill up the screen and the lettering was too small. But then I discovered zoom in and zoom out. And now it is really fun to browse. As an aside when I started browsing if someone was on our lap-top we would get a connection conflict and would not be able to surf on the lap-top. I called Linksys and they were able to change a bunch of settings on the router and it works just fine now, no problems on using both at the same time.As for games I have Assassin's Creed and Oblivion now. Both look amazing. I have also downloaded demos for Mirror's Edge (stunning) and Motorstorm (fun and also amazing graphics). Even as a gamer truly I only really have time for a half dozen games every year or two or even three. A lot of these games last a long time. So in reality the 360s edge on variety is for all intents moot. I am planning to get Little Big Planet and maybe the new Spidey game when it comes down in price. That will more than hold me over to God of War and which ever other few games I will get in 2009. Having a handful of great games, to me, is more important than 50 titles coming out a year.Bottomline is if you have an HDTV (particularly if you have a home theater set up) and no Blu-ray and enjoy gaming the PS3 is truly awesome. You get a great Blu-ray player, an 80gig hard drive, incredible gaming capabilities (just downloading the demos would be cool), internet browsing and video watching on your TV. You can also download the LIFE utility that has an incredibly cool visual globe where you can get live weather and news headlines around the world. And you can help cure diseases by linking to a Stanford project that looks at how proteins work and fold. If you allow it your processor can be added to the processing power being used for the Stanford project (when you are not gamin and such).Sony has succeeded in making a truly great heart of your home media experience. This is so much more than Wii it isn't even close. And with Blu-ray and free Sony playstation network, it really is a much better value than any of the 360 choices you have. Right now heading into the 2008 holiday season, PS3 stands alone as clearly the best system and the best value. Not only for gamers but for the entire family.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2008"}

Awesome Graphics - No Backwards Compatability.","reviewText":"!!Warning!! - Make sure you get a valid warranty on this system when buying it.  I have heard cases where some people are getting ripped off for not doing enough research, from faulty Ps3's.I haven't done a review on the ps2 or the ps1 so i figured i'd start here. I bought this system way back in November & i was so excited when i got it. It was really easy to set up, its really heavy though so you want to make sure you don't drop it to damage the hard drive or the console itself.  The thing that kinda disappointed me was no backwards compatibility with this unit compared to all the others. For some odd reason Sony 'lacked' on getting that function put into the system.  Not that i would ever really 'use' that function because i keep all my old systems & usually i have 2 just in case one breaks down.It could be too that Sony wanted to save money by not having people to replace their units from prolonged use from the backwards compatibility.  After all the more hours you put into the system the more likely it will cause it to die on you or become slow loadings.  I have had that experience before with previous consoles, especially the ps1. I played that system non-stop & of course like i said the more hours you put into a system the more likely it will break down.Best rule of thumb:Play for an hour or 2 or if you're really into the game no more then 5 hours.  Let it rest on standby for about 15min-1hr depending on how much you were playing it.  This system tends to get pretty hot after awhile so its important to let it cool off & also it will keep the lens from burning out too quickly from too much exposure to heat.  Playing it all the time will only allow you to get 1-3 years out of it. After learning that from my first ps1 & ps2 (well my ps2 still works ok) will allow more gaming overall.  My 2nd ps1 still works good as new (not the mini) as well.Other then that the Ps3 seems to be doing pretty well now, it just had a late start in the race & hopefully it'll get better.  There are more games for it & with Resident Evil 5 & 2 Final Fantasy games being released on the system it should do fairly well, even though the X360 will also get the Final Fantasy game as well.  But i've been seeing other great ps3 games coming out so it'll start doing better.  You just have to save some extra money for it. Not that the Wii or the Xbox 360 are bad systems either more of my fav games are on the ps3. Plus the graphics are the best with this system.  It beats the competition with that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"PT Cruiser","summary":"I wish I would have gotten it sooner","reviewText":"I put off buying a Wii for a long time.  We're adults, in our 50's and not really gamers other than solitaire on the computer.  I figured it was mostly for kids or that it was too cartoony and it wouldn't get used.  I even left it in the box for 4 days because I thought I might bring it back.  When I finally decided to keep it I put off \"installing\" it because I thought it might be complicated and take a long time.  It was only 3 clearly marked cords to hook to the back of the TV and into the unit, and the sensor into the unit.Well, it took me about 5 minutes to hook it up (It would have taken 3 but I had to crawl around back of the TV stand) and as soon as we started it up I could see it was something we were going to like.  Bowling was the first thing I tried and couldn't believe how realistic it was.  I even have the same hook on the ball that I do in real life.  After that it was tennis, then baseball, then golf and boxing.  I was surprised at how much exercise the tennis and boxing provided.  It was definitely a fun thing to play with.Two nights later we had friends over, 12 people in all and the people from across the street wanted to see the Wii.  I put on the bowling game, got 4 volunteers to play and that was it for the night. Everyone was screaming when someone got a spare or a strike and they went on to play tennis, baseball, golf and boxing. Fortunately dinner was stuff that could be served buffet style because everyone was gathered around the TV watching or playing the games, with plates their laps or at the kitchen table which has a clear view of the family room.  Two of the people ended up buying Wii's the following week.I'm mostly into it for the exercise aspect and we've gotten the Wii Fit and the Outdoor Challenge which are both great.  But there are lots more games that \"get you up off the couch\" coming out and now having tried a few, I can't wait to get them.  Two thumbs up for this game console!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2008"}

It does not bring anything new to the table, just your usual cover and shoot, although the covering system i really did like, but one of the things I really did not like was the fact that there are no big boss fights, just the same enemies over and over again, one thing that did like was that you are able to use a tank other than that no big challenge, I guess you can finish the game in a bout 5 straight hours tops.

There is so much to like here. It's by the same person behind Super Smash Bros, and it shows. This game has the same emphasis on both fine-tuned mechanics and a package stuffed to the gills with content.Each level is split between flying and land sections. The flying levels are kind of like a less-complex Star Fox, where you are on rails and shoot enemies that come to you. The land sections is 3rd person action. The land sections are really, really cool. The game has no trouble throwing tons of enemies at you and forcing you to dodge and attack nimbly. It's actually really well done - the mechanics are razor sharp. To succeed on higher difficulties, you need to be aware of your surroundings and be ready to dodge and dash-attack at a moment's notice. Truthfully, there aren't many action games this sharp, even on consoles.The graphics are great. This is one of the best looking 3DS games - maybe the best.  The sense of scale is phenomenal. Enemies are rendered with care and have lots of personality. The 3D effects are terrific. The sound is great - like Super Smash Bros Brawl, many famous Japanese composers lent their talents. Some of the tracks are new, some of the tracks are remixes. The game is also fully voiced, with constant chatter during the missions (the story is also fairly funny and well-written). The production values here are insane.Each of the levels is fairly short - maybe 10-15 minutes. It's good for a handheld title, but it has ton of replayability. It has maybe the best difficulty level system I've ever seen - rather than a simple easy/medium/hard, there is a sliding scale from 0.0 to 9.0. At the beginning of each level, you set the scale. Harder difficulty means more enemies, but more treasures and hearts (the game's currency). The emphasis here is clearly on playing each level over and over, on harder difficulties.That's not all. The game's weapon system would be generous even in a full-fledged RPG. There are many different types of weapons - bows, clubs, claws, etc. - and each type has slightly different characters. Every weapon has stats for both melee and shooting, along with some special characteristics (defense +1 etc.). But that's not all - it has a full weapon-crafting system. You get lots of weapons during the game, and you can fuse any two of them together to make a new weapon, complete with new stats and stars. It's really great.But there's more. There's a full achievement system. There's a full set of models to collect (like Smash Bros.). There's . There's even a complete multiplayer system, with both team-based and each-man-for-himself multiplayer. You can even bring weapons from single player mode into the multiplayer mode, and the game even balances for that. Make no mistake - this is an amazing package. A game with this feature set on 360 or PS3 would be lauded. On a handheld system? It's insane.The only issue is the controls. The default controls work by moving with the analog circle, aim with the stylus, and shoot with the 'L' button. It's done this way for a reason - the game is really fast-paced and the stylus provides the fast movement and precision the game requires at the higher difficulty levels. Problem is that it is awkward. It seems like everyone has a different issue - mine is the weird position I need to place my hand to hit the 'L' button with the rapidity the game requires. Other people have problems with the stylus, or the way rotating the view works. Yea, Kid Icarus offers tons of customization options, but that's just because nothing is ideal.This is a real shame, because the game is so superlative otherwise. Were the controls not so ill-suited to the system, this could easily go down as an all-time great. It really is that good. But those controls... it's a real caveat. It will be a deal breaker for some. I took away one star, but that's all I could do fairly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"Best Wolverine Game Ever Period.","reviewText":"First off i really enjoyed the new movie so i was already pumped before starting this game.  This is the Wolverine I know from the comics.  They finally did Wolverine justice.  This game is of course mature rated and oh man is it gory and just plain raw.  I couldn't believe there were severed limbs flying everywhere, this is exactly what i wanted in a Wolverine game.  The graphics are breathtaking and the healing factor animations are a great touch.  Each hit exposes muscle and the adamantium skeleton and heals much like it does in the movie.  They added a leveling system and as you progress new moves become unlocked.  I liked this approach because i didn't have to memorize too many different button combos at the beginning and i was given time to get used to them before new ones became available.  The lunge attack is a blast!  The boss battles are super easy but still fun, although they can get a bit repetitive i still enjoyed them.  This is one of those games that once you start playing, its hard to stop, in fact i think im going to go play it right now.....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2009"}

From shooting around a wall, crouching behind a barrel, etc. all gameplay is very realistic. This gets you into the game quickly.- Weapons selection is excellent. Pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, sub machine guns, this game has a great selection. And they are all available from the get go in the single player mode. There is also a great selection of grenades, smoke bombs, etc.- Sound: in Dolby Digital, the sound is great. Bullets wiz by your head, and you can pinpoint terrorist locations based on voices or gunfire.- Computer AI is good. When you send your team to clear a room, more times than not they do a great job of it. The terrorist AI is also very good. They spot your movement easily and adapt to many different scenarios.- The default difficulty level is perfect. Not too hard, but not too easy. Realistic mode is difficult, as it should be.THE BAD:- Graphics are marginal at best. I was pumped for great graphics during the start up screens, then it gets to the main menu and the graphics go down the drain. Menus, character editing, the entire game suffers from mediocre graphics. There are some nice lighting effects, but otherwise I was very dissapointed. However, the gameplay makes you quickly ignore the poor graphics. (I use a 1080P Sony SXRD TV with HDMI connection).- Online gameplay has some issues. Overall online gameplay is decent, but there are some lag issues, and I found it overall too difficult (however, this is dependent on the difficulty level set by the moderator).- Some levels are too dark and it's difficult to see- Sometimes your computer teammates get in the way (AI glitch perhaps...)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00009MVJ7","description":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliancetook co-operative action role-playing to new heights on the Playstation 2 console. Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"Matt D.

You also get a wider variety of characters to choose from in part 2. The gameplay is almost like Champions Of Norrath with a few minor differences.
