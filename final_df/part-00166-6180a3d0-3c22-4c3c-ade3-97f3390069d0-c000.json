Having grown up with these games they have stuck with me over the years. This is one of the main reasons I got a vita because i cant get enough of the series. First off it plays very well. The graphics which of course are not as great as the console versions of other games in this series are pretty great. But again you cant compare the vita graphics to a console version. The courses look amazing and the controls work GREAT with the vita. All the courses look different which is great because that was one of the main concerns I had. A big part of what is going to keep you playing this game over and over is the daily challenges. You can get online and play challenges on select courses and see where you rank on the leaderboards. You need to be clutch though because it only lets you do it once. Maybe this will change. Then Of course you have online tournaments which of course are self explanatory. I didnt intend to make this review long because if you've played the other games then you should feel right at home with this one. The controls are very easy to learn. If your a golf fan then this is a game that you cant pass up. It is not a hardcore golf game but you will have a blast playing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}

Over 120 plus hours of total combined gameplay, numerous additions and enhancements, and critically-acclaimed game and art design.","reviewerName":"Jonathan Oyama \"Welcome to die!\"","summary":"Crawling through dungeons in high school","reviewText":"\"Persona 3 FES\" soups up science fiction with high school life in one of the most addicting RPGs ever made.For a game, \"Persona 3\" is hardly the usual role-playing routine. Players take control of a high school boy who must balance his high school life with his other job as a shadow hunter. Unlike other RPGs, you actually \"live\" out your life in school by making decisions, studying for tests and socializing with other characters.At first, it seems like a joke. You shop for weapons at the police department and healing items at the pharmacy. You can play arcade games in the mall to increase your charm and courage meters. However, this simulation is exactly what makes \"Persona 3\" an epic experience based on the pressure of high school life. Your social relationships actually build the power of the Personas, the guardian spirits you summon in battle.This also ties in seamlessly with the dark, animated sequences in the game. You plays as a teenage boy who sees floating coffins on the way to his dorm. When he first arrives, a frightening girl reaches for a pistol. After a few days, black spider-like monsters attack his dorm.However, he learns how to defend himself with a sword and a special pistol called an Evoker. By shooting himself in the head with the Evoker, he releases a Persona to defend himself from enemies. He learns from his roommates that he was chosen to lead them to explore a dungeon in an alternate world, known as Tartarus.Anyone would get disturbed from watching these kids shoot themselves in the head so many times. Fortunately, most gamers will accept the gun-to-the-head visual as a gimmick to make the game look grim and dark. The motion is solely to summon monsters out of the person's head, like a spiritual device.The fighting system is surprisingly simple and easy to learn. Players will choose the actions for their main character in a turn-based game, where players can easily see the order in which monsters will attack. The game visuals might bore gamers with randomly-generated dungeons that feature the same dull environments that appear on each section of Tartarus. The dungeon music also can grate on people's nerves, with a lame soundtrack consisting of piano chords and Halloween drum machines. Even the different music tracks loop repetitiously.In spite of these flaws, the game is a surprisingly deep experience, focusing more on the characters' life outside of dungeon-crawling. By socializing with other classmates and friends, the main character can \"max out\" their social links so that they can summon the most powerful Personas in the game.The FES edition adds even more features. Players can fulfill tasks given to them by Elizabeth, one of the supporting characters in the game. Elizabeth will reward players with extra items, including the special suit items that change their character's appearance in battle and inside the dungeon. Experts of \"Persona 3\" can also challenge themselves with the hard mode, or they can play the new chapter, \"The Answer,\" after beating the main game.This is one of the best JRPGs of the decade. It literally reaches above and beyond the limitations of the \"Final Fantasy\" games with a high school environment and an eclectic blend of anime and J-pop. The game is hard to find nowadays, but it's still worth every penny.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2010"}

It's really fun not knowing where the next rush of zombies is going to come from and just picking off the ones that are aimless. It's a blast to see them all running at you in huge numbers and just blasting away. The details in the environment are well done also like scrawlings on the wall from previous survivors and the details of a hospital or house interior. The sound is also pretty good, with the zombies making different sounds and the witches crying. The weapons sound pretty realistic as well. Your AI teammates have a variety of things to say that make sense based on the situation, they yell at you if you accidentally shoot them and call out where the zombies are coming from.One of the things that was nice was there was no real directions given, no map, nothing other than if you wander the wrong way you'll eventually hit a dead end and then have to explore until you find your way. When you get close to an important point it does a good job of letting you know you are there and what you need to do.The things I didn't like were the lack of more than 4-5 standard weapons, a flamethrower, bat or other option would be nice. Granted it does give you the major type of weapons but I'd like to see more powerful and different ones. Also the bots can get in the way at times and lag behind you too much. I didn't have a problem with the save system but if you were playing with others it could be a problem, essentially you can't save wherever you want it has to be at a safe house.Another bad thing was that I don't play co-op online and this is what this game is for really. I want to stay a casual gamer and going online really is a time consuming thing as well as some of the people can be obnoxious. I've played through all of the 4 maps on single player and am interested in playing them again but it's just not enough to really pay full price for.So make sure you are willing and able to play co-op if you get this game, otherwise it is not worth it. I think the plan is probably to come up with new maps and sell them online through Steam or have the modders generate them because even with multiplayer I could see this being too small an area to keep coming back to again and again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2008"}

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life. In the old stories, archons were spirits of fire, who served the long-lost creator gods. But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch.

As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes.

My initial intent on the review was to indicate that the game wasn't as bad as others have made it out to be.  Now I'm hooked!  The story continues to pick up, and there have been a few times when I find myself very much impressed by the sound and graphics.  Over all, SE/Obsidian did a fine job on this one!  Everything seems very fluid, and over all, I'm having a blast!Previous Impression:I'm seeing some negative reviews on this, and I'm rather surprised.  This game pretty much delivers what's advertised.  When I saw the initial trailers, I expected a clone of Diablo/Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, and that's exactly what you get.  The graphics and sound are far sharper than it's predecessors, and the play control is solid.  I'm about 5 or 6 hours into the single player game as Lucas.  The story is fine enough (these types of games never have mind-blowing story lines anyway) and the characters are about what you'd expect. I'd say the voice-actors are about on par with Diablo/BG:DA.Is this \"Game of the Year?\"  Probably not.Is this a fun game?  Definitely!Does this game offer anything new to the genre?  Not really.  It's just prettier and more polished.If you've enjoyed previous dungeon crawlers, you might want to give this one shot.Edit: 8/11/2011I still really enjoy this game, and I'm rather disappointed by its over-all reception; it's a fun dungeon crawl, and I'm not sure why people expected anything else.  Granted, it's a bit short, but there is some replay value here (thank the Trophy system for that.)  I'd expect the average person to play through it in about 10 hours.  Some grinding will be necessary if you want an easier time with the end.  Trying to complete the game when you're in your low-mid 20's can be tough for some.

Christianson \"ABC\"","summary":"Japan's FFV & FFVI (aka USA's FFIII)","reviewText":"First of all I'm going to talk about the better of the 2, Japan's FFVI (aka USA's FFIII).  Aside from USA's FFII, this is the best Final Fantasy ever!  This game was first released in the USA for the SNES console.  Even then the music in this game was comparable to that of games played on the PSX, the 32-bit Sony system.  The graphics are also great, 3-dimensional.  Besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile.  It's a long one!  There's so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that it's almost unbelievable.  It's a wonder why I didn't choose this one to be #1 instead of FFII.  I guess it's because in my mind FFII is the one that started the greatness of the FF series.  Since FFII, the FF series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good.  Not to bag on FFI, but the story was rather weak and besides, it was on the 8-bit Nintendo system.  If you have been let down by any Final Fantasy you've ever played, this is the one to play.  There's so many different characters you can get in this game as well, but you have to know how to get them.  My favorite is the Ninja, because he has a mind of his own, and you never know what he's going to say or do.My second topic is Japan's FFV.  The only reason I gave FF Anthology 4 stars is due to the greatness of FFVI.  This FFV game though... in a word... sucks.  It's the worst FF game I have ever played.  The enemies are too difficult.  They give you too many character jobs.  And finally, the game is just boring.  The graphics aren't any better than USA's FFII if not worse.  To me this game is like FF Tactics crossed with FFII.  I don't own this game anymore due to the fact that I already have FFIII for the SNES console.  If you don't have an SNES or can't get your hands on FFIII, then this game is a definite must just to play FFVI.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2003"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game.

I've played the demo and anxiously awaited the arrival of the second. Being that the demo was ok and they said certain bugs may be present i would have hoped these bugs were ironed out after all the time they spent on it. Well as usual the game is beautiful but the controls are hit and miss, mostly miss, here are the pros and cons because i don't feel like going into real depth at this time.PROS1.As i said beautiful graphics you've come to expect from Capcom, creatures and surroundings.2.Gameplay remains the same but is a little bit cleaner this time around, i do mean a little.3.Not freezing to death is a plus.4.At this point you don't HAVE to pick up the orange energy balls but if you don't you may regret it.5.Multiplayer is decent.CONS1.The controls stink, when i mean stink i mean that the aiming is way off and certain movements are just repetitive.2.Anytime you get hit there is so much chaos in the game, especially in the jungle that you can't tell whats going on and most of the time you dead and don't know it.3.There is whats called the harmonizer now, this is when your energy gets low hold down start to replenish it, takes a few seconds which you DONT have when fighting swarms of acrid or Bosses especially.4.Have to mention its way to hard, more than the first and you can die from one blow to the body now.5.Hitting the top right button makes you do a sudden turn, this control is pretty useless, even in multiplayer.So thats about all i have to say at this time, the game won't change much considering i'm almost done, as much as i love the looks of it and the gameplay(discluding controls) is pretty tight, AI etc. I just can't give this game a recommendation to anyone, not even the hardcore Capcom gaming fans.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Robert P. \"Hugs and Curses.\"","summary":"Phenomenal","reviewText":"I love video games.  I love role playing video games and in my lifetime, Ive played alot of them.  Throughout this time, I've always been unhappy with the Star Wars series of games.  Don't get me wrong, I'm an afficiando of the films and love them dearly, but their games never quite pan out the way they should.  If the graphics are great, the storyline sucks, and vice versa.  Sometimes, neither is present.In Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Bioware has nailed it.  They have created a game with a storyline so immersive, I can't leave my seat in front of the PC until I've cracked whatever code I'm working on, as I need to know what happens to my party next.  The choice of moving towards the light and saving the empire as a Jedi is quite a nice choice, though I've taken every step I can towards the dark side.  The storyline changes around the character, which you rarely see.  As I progress, people in cantinas and space ports wont deal with me, and I usually end up choking them with the force to get the info I need.  I hear the game has a huge amount of story hours built into it, and in three days I've logged approximately 17 hours and I still have so much to see, and so many side quests to do.  Each member of your party has a long quest which unravels slowly throughout the game.  You can choose to help them all, or just ignore them, but I figure....why give up some nice exp and maybe a chance to get even more out of the stories.All of this storyline unfolds and graphically it's quite impressive.  The player models, from the Twi'leks to the Wookies are very well detailed, as is all of the surrounding area and uniforms.  The FMV sequences are incredible, and the first time we went into hyperspace, I felt like I was Luke in the Millenium Falcon in &quot;New Hope&quot;.  Of course, being set a few millenia before the Star Wars films, there is no interaction with any characters that one would recognize.This game has impressed me on many, many levels and I hope that Bioware continues to manufacture quality merchandise under the Star Wars banner, as they have hit the nail on the head with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2003"}

The first game is dated of course (it was a PS2 release originally) but it wasn't too bad and it set up the story for the rest of the games. The second game focused on rebalancing but also removed secondary fire. Things like the ISA assault rifle was given accuracy (something sorely missing from the first game) and more common ammo drops, while the Helghast LMG was crippled and only effective at point blank range. The difficulty was also raised significantly, and that point is a topic of debate among fans. The third game balanced things out a little more, such as the Helghast LMG having some accuracy and the difficulty was toned down some to keep the challenge but not make it a cakewalk. There are more vehicles, a pretty good stealth mission, and like in the previous installment enemies will take cover and try surround you while taking ground. Whether you listen to the fans or make your own judgements will affect how you rate this game, but for around $20 new I think you can take the risk.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2014"}

At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Mario's back...except he whines...a lot","reviewText":"I remember the commercial for Yoshi's Island when it was about to be released. A guy who obviously ate too much explodes and the room looks all messy. It was a weird commercial for this and even today I still don't get what the hell it meant. It just happened to advertise one of the best games ever so I'll let it slide.Story: A stork is travelling with babies and one gets kidnapped while another one falls on Yoshi's Island right on Yoshi's back(which must've at least hurt his spine but oh well). That baby just happens to be Nintendo's resident mascot Mario, only in baby form so now Yoshi has to return him back to his parents while dealing with Baby Bowser.Graphics: Back when this game was released, this graphics looked trippy. And they still look cool. The graphics almost seem to ooze with color as the locales look very vibrant. Much better looking than the first Mario World.Sound/Music: My title refers to whenever Yoshi gets hit. You don't know suspense and heart pounding like when you have to rescue Mario. As soon as that whining starts, you make a mad dash for that kid. It's super annoying of course. Oh and the music's good too.Gameplay: What really sent this game up the critical/fan favorite stratosphere was here. Whenever Yoshi eats an enemy, he makes an egg which he can throw at enemies or clear special paths in terrain. Also here is Yoshi's ability to turn into different vehicles such as the helicopter or a mole.Taking the Dragon coins from Mario World and expanding on it, every single stage on Yoshi's Island as items that you need to find and if you find them all you get rated out of 100. Get 100 on all stages and you get a surprise. Things like coins, stars, flowers are scattered throughout and you have to find them which adds big time replay value.See why this game is touted as one of the best games released on the SNES and one of the best available on Gameboy Advance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2005"}

PH was fun, but it required you to revisit the same temple about, what, 4 or 5 times? That's too much. Spirit Tracks takes everything bad about PH, and takes it to a whole new level.Since Zelda games are heavy on story, I'm just gonna give you the rundown. Link is now a train conductor, and is on his way to get his official certificate in Castle Town. He meets Zelda, and they set off for the Spirit Tower, a creepy huge tower looming in the center of Hyrule. It's certainly seen better days, and it's the cause of the Spirt Tracks' (railroad tracks) disappearances all about Hyrule. When they get there, they are ambushed and some dude kills Zelda! That's right. Kills her. Link brings her soul to life at the Spirit Tower, with help of an old lady, and she tells them a big long story.Spirit Tracks follows a linear format, but with added twists throughout. First, you must retrieve the Spirit Maps from different floors of the Spirit Tower. You get these with the help of your pal Zelda, who's soul is in disguise in a Phantom's costume. Then, you set out to the realm's sanctuary, learn a song, and clear the zone's temple and restore the power to the tracks, then repeat.The graphics looks great, one of DS's best, and are a step-up from the 2007 predecessor. Control is simple, use the stylus to move Link, just tap and he'll come running. Double-tap to roll, and swipe to slash your sword. The train is one of the biggest additions to Spirit Tracks, and it is incredible. Much better than any of his old boats, the Spirit Train is a great new addition to the Zelda Transportation Library. You trace your route on the map, and off you go, controlling your speed, firing enemies with your cannon, and avoiding enemy trains.It's a Zelda game, and what's a Zelda game without new items? Spirit Tracks boasts some old favorites, such as the boomerang, bow and arrow, and bombs, all which use great stylus control (especially the boomerang). New items include the Deku Fan, which you blow into the microphone to send a gust of one flying. Perfect for stunning enemies, activating fans, and getting items. The other new item is the Whip Snake, a Indiana Jones-esque whip. Link uses this to attack enemies, swing over pits, and hang on to flying objects. Both are great. I would've liked to see the Clawshot somehow incorporated into the DS, but that's just me.There's a lot of depth and replay value to ST. Spawnning 5 incredible dungeons, tons of villages and places to explore, and fun addictive minigames such as hunting rabbits, stamp collecting, and collecting treasure. Also, once you acquire a new item from the dungeons, you are encouraged to revisit past areas and find hidden secrets that you couldn't access before using your new items. The bosses in ST once span both screens, like in PH, but these are much interesting. Each have unique ways to beat them, usually using the item you acquired, but aren't too tough.The biggest new addition, in my opinion, is the Spirit Flute, which may even beat the Ocarina in best Zelda Instrument Category. Playing is simple, just drag along the bottom screen to move the flute to its respective holes, and then blow into the DS microphone. You use the flute to restore the Spirit Tracks's power with duets from the Lokomos, access new hidden items, and much more.That about wraps up the ST review. It beats Phantom Hourglass in every way imaginable, and is one of the best DS games out there.

I have no idea how many hours I have into it--easily hundreds. When I complete I just start over as another type of character (warrior, wizard, knight, etc). It is that addicting!Although I've enjoyed other puzzle/seek and find games like Professor Layton, Touchmaster, or Millionheir nothing has come close to knocking out PQ as my main game. Until now that is. Might & Magic has replaced PQ as my favorite puzzle game. It is new, fresh, and clever. A mix of luck and strategy Might & Magic grips you from the beginning. The story is interesting if a bit LOTR inspired (an elf named Anwen?). The graphics are outstanding--not 3D but that's perfect for me..I love me some sprites..the 3D graphic Chibi characters just look funny to me. About the only game I loved them in was Suikoden Tierkreis (another excellent game if you like RPG).Although this is a \"sort of\" match 3 title it is so much more. Each type of unit has different strengths and weaknesses. Quite often your goal is not to just destroy the enemy but to accomplish a specific task--that keeps it varied and interesting. The puzzle's are really intriguing and I've spent many an hour trying to figure them out. Unlike something like Professor Layton I was driven to figure it out myself without help. Is it frustrating? Undoubtedly--especially since luck does play a part. But after each defeat I found myself more determined to win the next time by using a different strategy.Getting around works fine with the Dpad or the stylus (I always prefer D pad). The main story has 5 characters and you play one at a time--in this respect this is similar to Dragon Quest IV. The items you get always help you and you've got to decide which one to go with. It is a very nice balance between items you buy and items you get. I did not have a problem having enough funds to buy what I wanted most of the time.I'll agree with the other gripe that it would be nice to see level of the person you are battling with before the battle starts because once it starts you're in it to win it. Occasionally when you are a level 2 and the other a level 5 it can be a bit of a massacre but I just move on and come back later. I love that it is not just a simple match 3 but has so many other elements.Overall Ubisoft has done a remarkable job on this title. I wish it had not come out so close to Zelda as I think it won't be able to compete but, honestly, I've got both games and I prefer this one. Nothing wrong with Zelda but this title just feels really fresh to me and it is way more addicting!If you can find it purchase it. If this thing takes off it will be hard to find a copy. I had to wait for a copy to show up on the shelves. I should have ordered from amazon. It is very worth your dollars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"Dressi \"K N D\"","summary":"Wee!!!!  Wow, that was a rush.  Let's do it again!","reviewText":"Wow, talk about a game that will grab you.  Is it a \"true\" Metroid game?  Does it satisfy the Metroid fans or do justice to the title Metroid?  Who cares, that game rocked!  If it was called Adventures of Jane Doe, it would have still rocked with the only complaint being the games title at that point.  I'll review 4 topics: First Person; Controls; Loading Explanation; Graphics.Genre: Puzzle/Action.  First Person minus the FPS twitchy requirement.Graphics: StunningGameplay: Curious at first, but you'll soon understand why they did it like that.Challenge: High, depending on you of course.  Many rooms require repeat visits.-FIRST PERSON VIEW-  Alright, first to get it out of the way.  The First person point of view was a good move.  Nintnedo was not focusing on detailed motion of Samus but rather the interaction with the environment.  Though it is first person, there is a Lock-on targeting system and Samus will even lead moving targets.  So there isn't a combat/fighting reason for there to be easily accessible head motions.  And as before, in other Metroids, Samus usually had to be standing still to aim in different directions, so why change that all of a sudden.  The one First person element that I would have loved to see is a Side step that was independent of the turning and such.  But that isn't completely necessary.-CONTROLS-  Alright, so this game packs in every element from the original games and so much more.  The prelude to the game is a wonderful introduction to the controls.  You get used to them pretty quickly.  The newest and most imediately obvious addition is the Detection Visor, which allows you to activate switches, read terminal screens, scan enemies and objects and identify areas.  That'll be used throughout the game.  Now some people would have liked to see the C-stick used to work Samus's head, her view.  But Nintendo instead has it to select the weapons, and co-actively the directional pad selects visors.  I find myself swtiching between weapons all the time, quickly and in the heat of battle.  There are certain enemies in the second half of the game that are only vulnerable to one particular beam weapon... when you have one of each attacking you it's nice to be able to quickly switch to another weapon to hit one of them, missile it, and switch again to attack another.  In short, the controls and gameplay are set up to have every part of Samus's arsenal and abilities a button away, instead of some submenu.  In the Prelude you'll get to experience the controls of some of the cool features, such as the grapple and the morphball... the charge beam and such... but a horrilbe explosion causes a malfunction in all of the powersuits abilities except the beam weapon... so you start the beginning of the game like you do the other metroids... with a blaster.-LOADING TIMES-  Now some people have talked about the loading times for the game.  True, there is probably only a few places where \"loading\" is evident.  One of these is the beginning of the game or when you start from a savepoint, the 5 seconds of \"Chozo Ruins\" on the screen and then there's the animation sequence for the elevators.  But you'll also notice that some doors open quicker than others and some doors take a second or two to open, that becuase the map on the other side is currently loading.  The problem with this is that you can still move around, explore and do what-not while the map is loading.  The larger problem with this is that once i fell into the lava, which will quickly drain your energy, i was goofing off to begin with, my fault, i ran by an enemy and triggered the door to open (shooting it)... well the enemy managed to kill me while i was waiting for the door to open... so making a quick escape in this game depends on the size of the room your trying to escape to.  The game is good enough to load the maps in a \"subconscious\" method which means you never see a \"loading\" screen for the next map.  But then, as describe above, that active time while you wait for the door to open can hurt you sometimes.-GRAPHICS-  Amazing!  The graphics are absolutely amazing.  They have that real look about them and then that surreal look.  One of the coolest parts as far as graphics are concerned is the way that the weapons effect the visual environment... like firing a lot will cause the barrel to give off some heat, which you can see.  Certain weapons will distort the field of vision.  And probably the coolest thing I've seen is Samu's reflection in the visor.  If attacked with something that is bright, like a missile esplosion, you can see Samus's face reflected in the visor and depending on the brightness the more of her face you can see.Well there you have it.  I recommend this game but DO NOT expect it to be a \"first person\" game despite the first person view.  Good luck and Happy Hunting!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2003"}

Overall the amazing story is still here and any changes made were for the better.Gameplay:With all these changes,you would expect the gameplay to have changed to right? Well for the most part it remains unchanged. The battle view is now from the 'behind the back' view (much like the newer FF games) But still retains almost all of the original commands (one of Cecil's moves was slightly modified) And the game is still as hard as it was back when it was released on the SNES&PS1.; One of the changes that you will notice is there is no more pesky item limit (thus making the game a fraction easier).Overall I'd have to recommend this to any FF fan,Its good to see Square Enix remake there original FF's (though I wasn't very impressed with there FF1&2 PSP remakes) Hopefully SE will remake FF6 it deserves it!To summarize:Pros:+Completely redesigned graphics+Voice acting+remixed tracks+Extra side quests+Better translationCons:-Might be to hard for newcomers-Boxart is a little on the disappointing side (it reminds me of a mockup web-sites do to for a sake of having a pic up,like FF13)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title.

The first is that it takes a bit to get the controls down. Not a big deal, just a forewarning. What really bugged me was that pistol aiming was too slow. The number of bullets it took to put someone down was also on the unrealistically high side.

So when I got the UT 2004 demo for PC, I was pretty excited. But nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to experience. I immediately felt at home with the game, considering many of the weapons were the same, and much of the gameplay. But there was sooooo much more. So I played the demo everyday from the time it was released up to the time I received the full game. Believe it or not, playing that one stage in Onslaught for an entire month never got boring, that is just how great the game is. The full game however, is simply AMAZING!! The graphics are absolutely jaw-dropping, especially with the highest settings enabled (you need a powerful system to run this though). I don't think I've even seen graphics this great on any of the nexgen consoles. Also the stages are massive (mainly the Assault and Onsalught stages), its amazing to think of how much detail and creation when into the design of the stages. The sound in my opinion is also great. You can hear every little minute detail, and much of the music is good and suits the stage. The control is perfect, with the default settings being totally comfortable, allowing for maximum gameplay. Ahh yess, the gameplay. You thought Quake was good, you thought Halo was good, well they're pretty crappy compared to this game. The vehicles, the weapons, the bots, the entire style of the game, is simply outstanding. There is not enough to say about the vehicles. They put Halo's vehicles to shame. There is a perfect gun for every moment, each completely different from the other. The single player is exceptional for a multiplayer type game, and obviously the multiplayer aspect is fantastic, with up to 32 player online deathmatch, and no lag (with a proper connection). There are 10 modes of play, and about 100 levels. Then there's still the Unreal Editor which will allow you to create your own. There is also way too much that I cannot list here that you would just have to play and find out for yourself. I would actually go as far as to say this game is PERFECT. There is actually NOTHING wrong with it and EVERYTHING good. If you can overlook the extremely minor 'problem' of the 5.5 gig install, you'd be absolutely happy with your purchase.

{"product_name":"B001CRM3YQ","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"Wolfenstein - Nostalgia of the Legandary PC DOS Game or a WW II Call Of Duty Rip Off","reviewText":"I've been a big fan of the Wolfenstein Franchise since the Wolfenstein 3D PC DOS game back in 1992 (Gives you a clue how old I am), The Wolfenstien franchise by ID Software (Not to be confused with the Apple II's Castle Wolfenstein by Muse Software back in the early 1980's) heavily influenced and paved the wave for most FPS (First Person Shooter) Games that have been released in the last 20 years and played today. This game simply titled \"Wolfenstein\" is actually the direct sequel the Wolfenstein Reboot Game \"Return To Castle Wolfenstein\" that was originally released in 2001. While ID Software licensed and \"Executive Produced\" the game, Wolfenstein was primarily developed by Raven Software (A subsidiary of Activision) and released by Activision.The Plot starts off after the events of \"Return To Castle Wolfenstein\" were the main character of the series \"B.J. Blazkowicz\" has just finished stopping a German Battleship from firing it's missiles on the UK in a Cut-scene. B.J. is then directed to Return to Germany in the fictional town of Isenstadt by the also fictional agency \"Office of Secret Actions\" (OSA) to meet up with the resistance in Germany headed up by a former school teacher and found out about the experimental work by Nazi Germany's fictional SS Paranormal Division.The Plus sides - The game plays similar to the WW II versions of the Call of Duty franchise FPS (Even with the little gold compass as in COD at the top of your screen to show you the next objective) that uses the \"Wolfenstein\" game elements from the franchise. There is a variety of weapons that are found through out the game (Both Fictional and Non-Fictional) like the Karl98, MP40, MP43, Rocket Launcher, flame thrower, and so forth. While playing the game you will find intel, pick up Gold or valuable collector pieces, and ammo for your weapons. As you complete a \"Chapter\" You are paid for completing the level along with the gold you have picked up through the level. With the Money your accumulate you can use it to buy upgrades for your existing weapons off the Black Market(My favorite upgrade modification was the Karl98 and turning it into a Super Sniper Rifle with Bayonet). The Paranormal Nazis are well thought out and fun to engage (Especially the female Paranormal Nazi's), you will spend hours completing the missions.The Negative Side - As much as I love the Wolfenstein Franchise and liked this game I had 2 major problems with it. The first and foremost is that it seems Raven Software Plagiarized a good portion of the game from Infinity Ward's Call of Duty WW II Franchise, as I pointed out in the plus side they even used the Gold little compass on the top of the screen to guide you in your mission without even trying not to make it obvious. The 2nd thing was the use of ID Software's aging 5 year old ID Tech IV engine (This was at the time of the release of the game in 2009) from Doom 3. While the graphic's looked good you could tell it was showing it's age. Raven should have used a more modern game engine like the Unreal Engine 3 which they used on the X-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged Edition for the PS3.Overall, aside from my negative criticisms of the Plagiarism and the use of The ID Tech IV game engine this is a fun and engaging game in which you will have fun playing for hours. I'm hoping maybe with the next release ID Software will come out with a more original and fresh follow up. However due to this games financial disappointment it may not be to soon in the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

Chloe and Cutter, 2 memorable protagonists, are with you for less than half of the game, and then they abruptly disappear-no goodbyes, and no end-game appearances. They're merely mentioned in passing at a later point. Moreover, a significant chunk of the plot revolves around rescuing one of the other protagonists. It seemed like such a poor way to drive the story forward. Lastly, the main villain isn't all that memorable. Not too much about her is actually evil-just her condescending attitude and her ambitions. Other than that, the dialogue, characterizations, and voice-acting are as incredible as ever.Gameplay: 4.5/5----Gunplay----At its core, Uncharted 3 is a shooter, and a well-done one at that. Cover shooting is responsive and enjoyable. More weapons have been introduced, and there's a new grenade throwback system that allows you to lob enemy grenades back with proper timing. You're even able to pick up multiple ammo of the same type with one button press. There's a good amount of enemy variety, with standard foes, armored shotgun wielders, snipers, hulking bouncer-like guys, and fire demons. Unlike previous games in the series, I never felt tedium during combat; there was just the right amount all the way through.----Stealth/Melee----As in Uncharted 2, stealth is an option at some points for this game. It doesn't break any new ground, with simple neck snaps from behind and in-cover kills, but it does make enemy encounters more interesting. Melee has been majorly overhauled. You pound away with punches and counter when appropriate and can even grab enemies and toss them away from you. One thing that really impressed me was the awesome use of the environment. Attack against a wall and you'll have the advantage. Attacking near a table will allow you to use any fish, pots, or bottles on it. If you don't have a weapon, meleeing an enemy who has one will automatically land theirs in your hands. Just another small mechanic that Naughty Dog added.----Platforming/Puzzle Solving/Other----Uncharted 3 masterfully balances its combat portions with other parts. Platforming is very smooth, and puzzles feel more like puzzles than ever before. However, you'll find that they're much more prevalent in the first half than in the second half of the game, leaving you to wonder why there's such a lopsidedness. On top of these parts are sequences that I simply didn't find fun. As Nathan Drake in his youth, you'll wander slowly through a museum, examining displays. In a hallucination sequence, you'll run aimlessly through alleys. In a desert sequence, you'll wade slowly through miles of sand. Even if these were for \"immersion\" purposes, they were genuinely not enjoyable.----Setpieces----The staple of the Uncharted franchise, grand setpieces/unique moments return. There were plenty of interesting moments as well as a couple of mindblowers. These aren't as numerous as in Uncharted 2, but players will find that Naughty Dog did an adequate job here.Settings: 5/5As usual, Uncharted 3 will have you visit intriguing places rich with detail, from a secret underground library to a lost city in the desert. The unique venues certainly help to make combat and platforming much more exciting.Objectives: 4/5Being a linear game, there's little else to do in Uncharted 3 than progress the story, but what the game has you do is quite entertaining itself. There is treasure-collecting, but this is the worst it's ever been done in the series. The in-game store has been completely removed, so collecting treasure earns you NOTHING besides trophies. In previous games, you could earn money by collecting treasure and completing other tasks. The money could be used to buy weapons and unlock tweaks during subsequent playthroughs, but there is just no incentive to do anything else but complete the story in this game. It's a real shame. If it ain't broke, don't remove it.Overall: 4/5This is still a must-play for any PS3 owner. Expect spectacular locations, incredible setpieces, and refined combat and platforming, but be aware of the questionable story elements, lack of treasure-collective incentives, imbalanced puzzle placement, and unpleasant moments of wandering.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2013"}

It's Valve and Valve is notorious for taking their sweet time releasing quality games, was one reason. And then there was the more important question. Was this a cash grab? Is it merely an expansion pack masquerading as a fully priced game? And now it's released and the answer to the above questions is evident: Left 4 Dead 2 had me at \"improved pipe bomb.\"But you're not here to listen to me go on about how cool the pipe bomb is and how awesome the changed effects of zombie bodies literally exploding through the air is. At least I hope not. The fact is, after playing through Left 4 Dead 2, the original game feels more like a blueprint. Everything that was in L4D is in the sequel, but the sequel is a completely different beast. I was surprised, when we played through the opening campaign \"Dead Centre\" just how varied and improved the game was. You begin at the top of a hotel, bringing to mind the small apartment complex that began the first game. Except that this time, there's a whole lot more. You see, the building is on fire, you can create backdrafts through doors, and the entire event feels more context driven than...well, than the entire first game.Fire will cause impromptu passages, forcing you to discover different ways through the crumbling building. This means sometimes climbing out a window and balancing precariously on a ledge, moving from window to window in your escape. The intensity is further exasperated by the introduction of the special infected. Imagine playing this in Versus as a Jockey, hopping onto one of the survivors and moving them off the edges or being a Spitter and spitting the goo at just the right moment. Moving through the hotel, the fire increases and eventually, smoke will cloud your vision, creating an extremely claustrophic even where zombies charge out of the dense, dark smoke or other zombies, wearing hazmat suits, will simply rush, unharmed, through the flames at you. This diversity continues as you race through the chapters. In the first campaign alone, you will race through a burning hotel, tear through a grocery store in search for cola to bring back to a crazed, holed up hermit so he'll destroy a barricade and eventually reach the climax where you have to locate gas cans (like in the new mode) to gas up a car to escape.The thing is, that's only the tip of the iceberg. Later campaigns like \"Dark Carnival\" add a bit of whimsy as you can play some of the carnival games (kudos to Valve for bringing back the Half Life 2 gnome for an achievement), race up and down a roller coaster as zombies chase endless after you, and eventually reach the end which culminates in an inspired ending scenario that's completely different (and a tad whimsical) than anything else in the game. This diversity only continues through the later campaigns as well, with \"Hard Rain\" being my absolute favorite. In \"Hard Rain,\" as you move through the maps, it starts raining harder and harder. It's by far the most atmospheric and most interesting, since you eventually have to backtrack through the zones, but this time they are flooded and the weather adds a completely different challenge to the map. Additionally, unlike the first game where the campaigns all felt a bit too similar, resulting in my group relying on a couple campaigns we liked the most, each campaign offers so many differences, that I find myself wanting to replay them over and over. With five fully-developed campaigns, there's a lot more content than in the original game. Also, if you're feeling especially masochistic, try turning on the Realism mode which gets rid of the glowy outlines around survivors and ammo, makes infected harder to kill (headshots, please) and gets rid of the spawning closets...And that doesn't take into account the other features. Of course, there's Versus and Survival Modes like in the original game, but L4D2 also throws in Scavenge. Scavenge essentially is L4D2's version of a capture the flag mode, with the myriad of gas cans being flags. The survivors race around the map, fighting both the infected and the clock, trying to get as many gas cans to start a generator as possible. Meanwhile, the infected obviously try to stop them. What I love about Scavenge is that it's not the time commitment that Versus is.  It's a quick best of three or five game that ratchets up the tension and can create some truly inspired situations.  My only complaint about this mode is that there's only one per campaign right now.  Ditto the Survival mode which doesn't seem to have as many maps as in the original Left 4 Dead.  Hopefully Valve rectifies this with DLC.After you get past the myriad of modes and campaigns, there's still more tiny additions that made me smile. Guns are now strewn across the level and you won't find conveniently placed groups of weapons that contain everything. The guns also have a lot more variety, with a few different options for each type of weapon (I really enjoy the combat shotgun). The newly introduced melee weapons are interesting. In lower difficulties, they are seemingly overpowered; however, as you start to play on expert, I've found their limitations to be too great. Still, a nice additional and some of them are fantastic: taking down a witch with a chainsaw is perfection. The two grenade types return as does vials of Boomer bile. This operates under the same concept as the pipe bomb, except that the undead will race to the impact point and try to destroy whatever's there...like a Tank. Not that they will destroy a Tank, but they do provide some assistance. Then there's the other miscellaneous items, like defibrillators that will bring back dead party members.And I haven't even talked about the characters and story. I do miss the original gang of archetypical characters; I miss Frank's acerbic comments (\"I hate vans...\") and the camaraderie they had. But the new gang is also better developed and their banter is fresh and entertaining as they move through the campaigns, which, by the way, feel a lot more connected and there's more story here. So here's the thing. Those who didn't care for Left 4 Dead will probably not be swayed by L4D2 because it offers more of what the first one did. It's not a radically different game, it just feels...more complete. When I blasted through the first game, I wanted more...I felt like I played through a blueprint of a fantastic game. L4D2 delivers on that promise. It's not an expansion, it's a great, new, longer and better game.Very much recommended for fans of the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}

I, like many was a fan boy for my system of choice, which was the PS3. I've since realized that each system has their fair share of good to great games worth playing, even the Wii. So, I had to swallow my fan boy pride and purchase an XBox 360 so I could truly experience all it had to offer, and I haven't regretted it for a moment. I've purchased all the \"must haves\" like Gears of War, Splinter-Cell: Conviction and of course Mass Effect 2, however I was never really sold on Halo. I don't know if it was because of all the horror stories I've heard about the notoriously immature online crowd, or was it because honestly the game just looked campy to me, whatever the reason was I avoided it like the plague!  Now the fun part, the other day cruising Wal-Mart while looking for a new game to play, I saw that they were having a really good sale on Halo: Reach which involved receiving a substantial gift card after purchase, so I figured why not. Happily I can say the purchase was worth it and I'm very pleased that I took the chance. Basically my review is for anyone on the fence or who may have felt the way I have, the game is worth it on all aspects, so do yourself a favor and give in and pick it up.My Xbox 360 and PS3 gamer tag is MikeJMele, feel free to add me.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Andy Tatnall","summary":"One of the most engrossing games for serious gamers.","reviewText":"The opinions I've read below on this game seem to be about 80% who absolutely love it and 20% who hate it, and as far as I can tell the people who hate it are either young children who can't appreciate anything other than a hack-n-slash gorefest, folks who prefer shallow, poorly constructed games such as Resident Evil, or worst of all, people who only played it for five minutes or not at all. I fall in with those who love it.Eternal Darkness didn't get the promotion or the acclaim it deserved when it came out, but don't let that fool you. It's still one of the best games on any of the current generation of consoles, hands down.This game is all about mood. Play it at night with all the lights out. Everything from the lighting to the ambient sounds is designed to establish a creepy feeling, and it really hits home in several key parts, especially when your sanity meter is running low.Ah, the sanity meter. Yes, it's every bit as crazy as you've read. One reviewer wrote that there are only 10 different insanity effects. He most likely avoided going insane most of the way through the game, because the truth is there are around 100 different effects, ranging from minor things you'll barely notice to \"What the...?\" I won't spoil them for you, as they're one of the best parts of the game.It's got a compelling storyline and a mythos based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft. You control 13 different playable characters who all exist at different points in history. Although there are really only 4 different stages, each of which is repeated a few times by different characters, the stages do change from one visit to the next, sometimes making them very different places from last time you saw them.The gameplay itself involves navigating through the stages with one of the characters, encountering several types of creatures, and solving puzzles. The combat system gives each character several different weapons, including close-range, long-range and projectile combat. You can target different areas on a creature's body, some more effective than others. There is also a highly satisfying magic-casting system where you combine sets of runes to make new spells.You may notice in other reviews that some claim the game is way too easy, while others say it's too hard. Some also said the game is too short. What happens is, at the beginning of the game there are three different branches you can take in the story, and these dictate the difficulty of your quest as well as the creatures you encounter, including a completely different mid-game boss creature in each branch. However, once you complete the game once, you can go back and start again with one of the other possible stories, and when you complete all three you are treated to a special ending.If you're looking for a quick fix shoot-em-up scare-me bloodfest, don't bother. If you're looking for a disturbing and riveting game that will stay with you long after you turn off your GameCube, don't let this one pass you by!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros.

Haven't been able to stop playing it!","reviewText":"I wasn't even going to write a review. Haven't had time really. Been playing my PS4 since Friday! But I digress. I opened my PS4 and did the 1.5 update. Took five minutes. Now that may vary, depending on your internet connection. Mine is cable internet, but not the really super fast cable. I have heard people downloading the update in as little as 30 seconds. Battlefield 4 was our first game. After going through the setup and we began the Battlefield 4 installation. Not sure how long that took, but it couldn't have been too long. Now I have heard that you can play the game while the game is installing and updating. That is true but you have to get the full updates to the games before you can do multiplayer. So while BF4 is updating, I downloaded, the Netflix, and the instant Red Box apps. Haven't used them yet but I imagine they will function pretty much as they did on PS3. BF4 was ready pretty soon and we fired it up. While we were trying to get the game to come on, we noticed that we kept getting dumped back to the main page. Evidently every time we would get a notification that the PSN was down for maintenance we would get dumped back to the main page to read it. Funny thing was, that it didn't affect our game play. I guess the PSN store and programs like that, run independently of the game network? That's just a guess. I don't know, but what I do know is it didn't affect playing games. Just one more thing. This problem seemed to have cleared up since the first few hours. I have not seen it since. Onward. Once we got BF4 running we never looked back. I was up till 3 AM playing, and my son and his friends took off school the next day and have been on it almost non stop. They took a break last night but was up at 630 this morning with COD Ghosts. I have read about some issues. Namely the blue light of death. I for one have not seen it. I have another PS4 that is being given as a Christmas present so I will update this thread once I get that one up and running. I did have one problem. When my son was trying to set up remote play with his Playstation Vita, during the setup, the PS4 locked up. Just had a spinning wheel on the screen and wouldn't go away. I pressed the power button and held it in for 10 seconds and it shut down. Upon restart, the PS4 informed us that the PS4 had been shut down incorrectly and it had to run though a few tests. Exactly like the PS3 did whenever you would have a lockup on it. After that it was business as usual. That's my experience in a nutshell. The PS4 so far isn't what Id call flawless, but I have really enjoyed it. The new controller is great, the new user interface is great. All in all were super pleased. EDIT: UPDATE I bought my PS4 at GameStop so my review is not \"verified\" by Amazon. Completely disregard my opinion/experience I guess.EDIT: UPDATE #2 got our second PS4 up and running Christmas morning. Had zero problems. Using this one wirelessly, 30 feet away from the router, and on a different floor with just a small drop in connection speed. Been taking full advantage of the free games on PS+. Enjoying Warframe, Resogun, and Don't Starve, very much. Have been using the controllers daily since launch for hours at a time. 100 hours+ on two different controllers, with no discernible wear. Except for the barcode on the bottom side of the controller. It's worn off. I'm chalking the ripped up controllers at public kiosks to morons intentionally destroying them. I have 10-15 teenage boys who haven't managed to even scratch ours yet let alone rip the rubber off the stick. Will update with any problems I encounter. So far there haven't been any with our two launch units.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

It's a magnificent, magnificent game and really deserving of prize place on your games top shelf.Let's get this straight before we discuss anything else. Nobody, and I mean nobody, does Horror like the Japanese. Ringu. Dark Water. Silent Hill. All Night Long. Forbidden Siren. Sweet Home. The list goes on and on until you're left in your own sitting room, jumping at shadows, shuddering as the hairs move on the back of your neck, and stifling screams at the sound of those tiny finger-cymbals clashing. Theirs is a real mastery of the Genre, and the Americans and Europeans can only pray that some day, our own efforts measure up to scratch - compare &quot;The Blair Witch project&quot; to &quot;Ringu&quot;, or the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; series of games to &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, and I promise you, we'll all be found wanting.Anyway, getting back to the review at hand. You play the part of Mio, a para-psychic girl who, along with her deeply psychic sister Mayu, get lost and trapped in All God's Village, a deserted town in the middle of a forest, some days before the sinister 'Crimson Butterfly Ritual' is to take place. Mayu, intermittently under the control of the spirits that haunt All God's, disappears, and Mio must find her and stop the mysterious 'Sacrifice' before it's too late.Firstly, what's new?Well, as with any competent sequel, there is an overall feel of things being 'tighter' - presentation, graphics, and in-game explanations of things are all much more accessible and beautiful now than they were before - and the game feels a lot more professionally done than the still-excellent original.Sound is a huge improvement - not even in the Silent Hill series has sound been employed to make such a huge difference in the tension and atmosphere - and the manual is most definitely to be believed when it tells you 'This game is best played through headphones'. Try it in a dark room. Trust me :-)The controls are excellent, the Camera Obscura (your weapon) is now far less complicated to use and a lot more satisfying to have as your primary weapon. The inclusion of the 'Spirit Radio' may seem a little overdone, but it's a nice touch nevertheless.What really marks 'Fatal Frame 2' out as a Standard-Bearing game is the sense of real, palpable terror it inspires. The ghosts are horrific in their simplicity and all feels very much like classic Japanese horrors like 'Ringu' and 'Dark Water'. The innocence of the girls and some of the spirits' human personalities is drawn in stark contrast to the violent and shocking methods by which they attack. The game is also full of wonderful aural and visual vignettes, adding more atmosphere than I can say.An excellent title, current King of Survival Horror (and I've got through 'The Suffering' and 'Siren' in the last two months) and a definite must-have, I can't rave about this game enough.Get it now.Wow!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2004"}

I really enjoy the fact that the player is able to roam freely and that you are not stuck in battles.  I also like that you can see your enemies in the enviroment and can choose not to fight them instead of them being invisible and probability based.  Another great aspect is that you can choose to skip cut scenes, instead of being forced to sit through a long scene.  Finally, I would say that if you get this game, it is massive, I would definately recommend getting the guide for it, as there is so much to do and so many side quests to perform.  As for the license system it can be quite confusing at first but I find it much better and more tolerable than the orb system in FF10.  Additionally I think the main character, Vaan in this game is far better than Tidus of FF10, I found the main character in FF10 to be annoying an whiney, however I do like the other playable characters Lulu, Yuna of FF10 better than I do Balthier and Fran of FF12.I also own FF10, and while most people tend to like FF10 better I tend to lean the other way.  I am not trashing FF10 as it is a great game, but from my own experiance, I like the leveling scheme, the fighting scheme and the fact that you can skip cutscenes far better in FF12 than I do in 10.  When you compare story line and battle graphics FF10 blows 12 out of the water.Lastly alot of people including myself are not crazy about the gambit system that lets the game 'play itself', however if you dont want to use it you dont have to, its not forced, so it is there if you want it.I definately recommend this game, it will keep you busy for a while, especially if you try and reach 100% completion!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}

It's longer than many other fps games though, ringing in at about 15 hours.  The reason I say this is that people I know were surprised when I told them how long it took me to complete the game in it's entirety.I believe it took me 17ish hours with all of the side quests completed.  The \"open world\" WAS toted as a huge plus for this game, but there is nothing to do in the world except drive around, fight the occasional (read: rare) enemy, and collect these tokens that to reach you have to do certain jumps.For me, the storyline was extremely lackluster.  The over-arching humanity-dying-we-need-an-underdog-hero storyline was cool, but you spent most of your time performing small tasks to try and \"convince (insert name here) that you are trustworthy.\"  Only towards the end does it seem that your actions are having some direct effect against the enemy...Speaking of the enemy, they are pretty sophisticated for AI.  It wasn't extremely noticeable though.  I was never outsmarted to the point that I couldn't just run back the way I came and take cover.  Though, truly, nothing was better than throwing wingsticks at your enemy and seeing their heads fly right off.  =)Back to the story: The game's ending can be best compared to that of the Soprano's television show.  Yea, we all remember how that series ended.  I was beyond disappointed with the ending.  I sat staring at my t.v. with controller in hand slightly stunned, mouth ajar.  It almost *almost* makes me not want to consider replaying the game.The addition of the driving various vehicles and racing them is fantastic.  It really splits up the otherwise potential monotony of the game.  Yes, I feel that the game was slightly monotonous and would've been more so without the driving aspect.  Perhaps it was because the storyline was so sub par.The textures and the scenery are fantastic.  Albeit a desert-type world, it was well done and didn't come across as too plain.  The load/install time for the PS3 wasn't terrible.  Maybe 20 minutes.My take on Rage: It was a good game, could've been a great game.  It is definitely worthy of your time, but don't expect it to leave a lasting impact.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2011"}

For one, it isn't very long, and the storyline is fairly nonexistant. The world is intricately detailed, so much so that I wish I could've interacted with it more. Interactive characters barely say anything except their one scripted line of dialogue.So basically, it is not a Fallout type of game. It has very little to no RPG elements. It is linear, it is simple, and it is what it is.Good thing the mechanics and gameplay are a blast! The shooting in this game is fluid, fast, challenging and a lot of fun. The weapons are fun and customizable, and the driving sections are much better than I had a expected.It's a lot of fun to play, but it doesn't go any deeper than that.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"3 stars for now","reviewText":"It was difficult to give a 3 star review, but based on how I feel about it right now, I have to give it 3 stars.

I WANT MY TIME AND MONEY BACK!!!I bought this game at Best Buy.  I put in about 20 hours into it and regret ever starting on it.Little fun to be had.  The combat is dull, the missions and side missions are dull and boring. Enough said.I tried looking for the fun and excitement that might come after the first few hours and never found much fun.  This game is not worth your time and money. You're just an errand boy running around doing boring missions and side missions while encountering a bunch of dumb and slow zombies on the way, e.g., go find some cans of food, go shut off power, go find a lady's necklace, go to the gas station and fill up canisters of gas and return, go into the forest and find the airplane, ect.For a good zombie game, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, and Lollipop Chainsaw are the way to go--leave this one behind.  This will just waste your time and leave you unfulfilled.  The cognitive dissonance aspect comes into play with this game.  The game is a a very addicting, but dull and bland game.  The more time you put into it, the more your hoping your time will pay off, but really your just caught up in the cycle of insanity.  The more time you put in, the more empty and frustrated you get knowing the game isn't going to became much fun.Game tip: True there is no blocking the zombies strikes, BUT the best way to block an attack is not to be there in the first place. That means to use your footwork and retreat/step backwards when the attack is coming.  Just let the charging zombies come to you and kick them.  You can outrun the \"juggernaut\" zombie.  No need to try to fight him to the death most of the time.+Beautiful graphics.  Beautiful women in swimsuits which wind up being the best part of the game.-Boring and unfulfilling missions and side missions with no light at the end of the tunnel unfortunately.After over 20 hours of trying to get to the fun parts of the game, I traded it in.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2012"}

A comment like that will be in the eye of the beholder no doubt.  Odds are if you love Hitman you're gonna love it no matter what and love the excessive violence, language and brutality along with the humor plus sneaking.  Then again it might not since followers of the series may not like the direction as much.  This is my shot at my experience with the game.Story wise I had no clue what was going on at the beginning and didn't care about the story till about half way through.  If you want a deep story there isn't much here and its not gonna bring you to tears or give you a bout of depression.  I really don't know if it follows a certain story if this is its own story or what.  Really I have not followed the Hitman story lines since usually I like it for the gameplay. It does sound like some weird Quentin Tarantino action film as far as story with the crazy nuns, characters and the such.As far as gameplay I have played all the Hitman games but they aren't really at the top of the list for my favorites but I think this was the funnest one for me.  Could be maybe my memory though since most games I play in my mind are usually not what I remember them being. If you are familiar with Hitman then you are gonna figure out things pretty quick.  I still had fun figuring out ways to pull off the scenarios you are put in and always found different ways to go about it whether just straight forward killing or taking my time.  The funner assassinations were not really apparent and you really had to look around to figure out how to pull a certain way of dying for your enemy.  I don't want to give spoilers since some people come off sensitive when certain things are revealed big or small.  Odds are it won't work out how you want so you have to start over but once you learn how to go about it you'll find it relatively easy.The game maps are kind of small too with a limited amount of space to go about your objective and sometimes it feels like you are going a to b.  It isn't a huge deal but it does have a smaller scope that some will hate and some will love.  You might disagree and that's fine but I am o.k. with small maps but do miss big ones.  I did like how on one level instead of having an invisible wall you walk up to the train tracks and a endless train comes by to limit you.  Other than that there are stacked cars or whatever that keeps it all within a certain boundaryThe big letdown is the AI since a disguise really isn't one and people will recognize you pretty easy which defeats the whole purpose of getting a disguise.  This game makes up for it by hitting the RB button kind of puts your hand up and head down so you won't be recognized.  I just found myself getting caught to often and really tossing a bottle from my direction across the enemies face but not have them searching for the source but the impact.  If they find a body they search but then they stop after a while like \"lets disregard that we found this corpse in a bin.\"  It does make you become more careful when in the presence of enemies so it kind of adds to the tension.This wasn't really a nail biter with tension at least no for me.  If you are suspected you can either run and hide or fake surrender and beat the crap out of everyone.  Seemed like I could easily sneak mostly but the annoyance was when they would recognize me quickly and sometimes they wouldn't.  I didn't really like to have a gunfight since everyone tends to come out.  I thought it was funny how the swat team came for me along with the police unleashed a barrage of gunfire into a crowd of people.Another thing is it feels like you are punished for playing the game with the people you kill and you have points deducted.  Oh yeah the checkpoints kind of stink too since you have to find them and activate them but the maps are small so its easy to do.As far as sound the game is great.  The dialogue from the characters is really over the top but the Hitmans voice comes across monotone which is pretty much how it should be.  The guy in the cowboy hat sounds like possibly the sheriff from Smokey and the Bandit somewhat.  The thing that made me laugh was just the people you come across who think they recognize you or call out to you.  The random conversations were the best parts to hear.  One thing I loved was how you were in a club walking up to the entrance to it and you hear thumping and as soon as you walk in the sound just explodes with ambience and music.  Guns have a nice boom to them and so do the explosions.  With the dialogue I could never take this game to serious and I don't think its supposed to be.Graphics are kind of a letdown and kind of grainy at times with some blurred textures.  Not the blur face from Mass Effect but just merely bland in appearance at times.  I don't mean the locales but merely the up close of the objects that surround you.  I think the cutscenes are not the best quality either but none of its really that big of a deal.  Other than that I didn't notice much but I was hoping for more polish and shine.  I have read reviews bragging on the graphics but I didn't really see it.  It doesn't detract from the gameplay but it doesn't add anything either.  You do come across some places that are crowed with people and others not so much so it is nice that the game does run smooth.  If you notice graphics first than I think you will nit pick this game but it seriously not that big of a deal.  Its not NES like but its not a decked out PC look either.I ran through the game in roughly ten hours give or take and you mileage will vary depending on how you play.  I find myself rushing through games since I have a limit on how much I get to play.  There is certainly something worth a try on this game so love it or hate it just try it.  I know it will probably letdown the people who follow the games for some time but it might just please you to play it as well.  Last thought is just really have fun with it and see what you think.As of now I haven't played contracts or proof read this so my review might change or get updated.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Oh Ezio Could Only DREAM...","reviewText":"Now don't worry - I won't be comparing Assassins Creed to Hitman.  But you ARE an assassin in Hitman, so there's a small amount of correlation there!I've never played any Hitman games before, so this review might cater well to folks who are considering checking this game out.Right off the get-go we're presented with a conspiracy story.  This is something of a problem for a newcomer such as myself, as I have no idea what's going on, or who these characters are.  Our first target, located at the end of a well-paced tutorial mission, ends up begging us for a \"favor\" on her dying breath, and our character promises to oblige.  Personally, I have no idea why.From there we're dumped off on our own, depending on an abundant range of difficulty options available to the player.  Each mode holds your hand a bit less than the previous mode, and it's a welcome option to players such as myself who have no idea what they're doing.  That being said, if you play through the game on the easier modes, the harder modes will be much easier because the AI itself does nothing different.  I could see this being upsetting to repeat-Hitman-players looking for a real challenge.  Let's face it though - those players are going to START on the harder levels.  It just means that us first-time players won't get much from upping the difficulty level after beating the game first on a lesser difficulty.The point of Hitman is to accomplish your objective - most of the time assassinating a target - and then making a clean getaway.  What I have found so fascinating is the absolute wealth of options available which allow you to accomplish the primary assassination.  In fact it's so much fun that the \"getaway\" portions of each mission - which are the majority of play - can become a bit tedious.  The second in-game mission, Chinatown, is perhaps one of the best examples as you are able to enter the play area, find and kill your target, and exit the game within 2 minutes.  However, several other options exist which - at the encouragement of the \"Challenges\" menu - truly show the depth of options and gameplay included.  I probably spent 2-3 hours in Chinatown.This is where I personally have had the most fun.  I generally aim to finish the mission the first time through however I can, then repeat the level several times, attempting to complete each challenge.  Challenges range from simply finding items laying around each level, to overly creative and sometimes complex methods to kill your main target.  These playthroughs can be frustrating at times, but pulling off the successful assassination or combo-kill or whatever it may be is often wildly satisfying.That isn't to say that Absolution isn't without it's issues.  The AI in the game can be frankly stupid, allowing the player to get away with things they shouldn't.  In addition, the game seems to suffer from behind-the-scenes glitches.  In one particular instance, I was able to don a disguise as a janitor and was not suspected by a single NPC character.  On a subsequent playthrough, I donned the same disguise and was almost immediately spotted by another janitor in the same outfit.  I was very confused since no janitors had paid me any attention in my first playthrough.  This has happened on more than one ocassion: the first playthrough always seems easier because something gets missed or forgotten by the game's engine.  Was this intentional so as to increase the challenge, or is there just a mistake somewhere?At other times NPC's would see you when they shouldn't, or - more often - ignore you when they shouldn't.  More than once I felt as if I were getting away with murder...  (pun intended)...  But despite these small technical issues, the game feels smooth, challenging, and quite simply, fun.  What I enjoy most about Absolution was that - at least up to this point in my gameplay, I have never felt rushed, have never encountered a time-limit - even in a burning building - and have always felt encouraged to try things however I'd like.  Even more importantly, I've felt encouraged to try something again in a different way, and that's something very few games developed today can accomplish.I haven't played much with the included \"Contracts\" mode, which basically adds additional assasinations to each play area.  In addition, players can create challenges to then upload to the internet for other players to attempt.  My brief playthrough with one contract didn't feel as immersive or creative as the storyline itself, and I wasn't compelled to keep playing it.  Whereas I suspect the intent is to add more life to a relatively linear game, the lack of comparison to the main storyline may deter players from coming back for more.Hitman Absolution is a great game because it's a DIFFERENT type of game.  In an industry absolutely inundated with shooters and platformers, Absolution is a real breath of fresh air.  If you're looking for something a little different, you'd do yourself a favor to check out Absolution.  If you don't like it, don't worry; the next CoD game probably comes out next week...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"\"thereaper104@yahoo.com\"","summary":"I rented, and I NEED $40!!!","reviewText":"OH MY (...)

At its core, this is just a large collection of puzzles that are strung together abstractly by an often unrelated narrative.  However, taken holistically the experience is a positive and refreshing one (at least for its time).+Professor Layton is a wonderful character to play as, and his gentlemanly ways are an excellent role model in contrast to say violent and dumb roughneck space marines in other games.+Charming atmosphere that competently invokes the feeling of wandering about some lost European village with cobblestone streets and cozy town houses.+Very nice art style that effectively rips off the movie \"The Triplets of Belleville\" in fine form.  The characters all look unique to one another and the backgrounds are well designed.+About half the puzzles are actually clever and well conceived.  There's some really great logic and sliding block puzzles to be found here.+Lots of bonuses and hidden extras to find and unlock in the game, plus some mini-games you wouldn't expect.-Luke has nowhere near the charisma that Layton has.  He just feels tacked on as a conversational outlet, and I really don't care for his voice acting either.  It's obviously a woman doing her best cockney boy accent and it's just grating after a while.-Music while well composed gets repetitive quickly, and the exact same music box \"puzzle tune\" is used for every single one of the puzzles in the game!  You'll probably just turn the volume down after a while.  Also the old world instrumentation (accordion, organ, French horn...) could use more variety.-Too many mathematical problems presented as \"puzzles\".  Figuring out geometry measurements, liquid quart distribution, total miles driven etc.; If a calculator can find the answer it's not a puzzle, it's just plain mathematics folks.-There's no back story explained as to who Professor Layton or Luke actually are, or where they even came from.  Nor are we told what Layton is actually a \"professor\" of exactly.  Also, the main villain of the game couldn't be more cliche. And to top it off, Layton didn't even seem to know why said villain hated him in the first place.  These elements make you feel like you're starting a story in the middle of a narrative rather than the beginning.  Intentional or not, it wasn't fulfilling to have no idea who our heroes or bad guy really are.-Overall the plot ended up being a bit too nonsensical... and how it made it through production is a puzzle unto itself.  However, I'll admit there were a few pleasant plot twists that were unexpected.-Through all the conversation the player is never given the option to respond in any sort of variation whatsoever.  It's just tap / read / tap / read / tap / read.  Some input choice in the dialogue from the player would have been a great way to feel more involved in the plot instead of only the puzzles.Overall, Professor Layton's first game is merely a decent DS adventure, and certainly not in the same league as the likes of Ace Attorney or Hotel Dusk (HD is the best adventure game on the DS btw).Every overrated game has its score: 7/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2013"}

It is not enough to distract you from the game.Graphics... they are perfect and by far the best and most smooth graphics I have ever seen. The detail is almost too much to take in at times. And with the PS3's amazing talent to have real, life-like movement, the graphics are top notch.Game-Play... after getting use to the controls, the game play is simple and fun. With the ability to throw your back against a wall or object to protect yourself from gunfire and shoot behind you while running, the game-play is very well balanced with the rest of the game and could not be any better.Sound... the sound quality and the soundtrack are just right. With the DTS option and full surround sound put you right in the action.Over-all, this is by far the most fun and prefect game I have ever played. The story is very good, but not too good as to distract you from the game-play. The story keeps you interested throughout and the game does not get repetitive at all.

{"product_name":"B0050SY0L2","description":"","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"Not for serious racers","reviewText":"To be fair, I realize I have higher demands on a wheel than some. I've been playing racing sims since the first Gran Turismo (PS1), and I'm at the point where I need a real sim-capable wheel. Being on a budget, I thought I'd give the speed wheel a spin to see if it could tide me over until I could invest more. Given my impressions, I do not reccomend this wheel.Pros:-Cheap. You certainly won't find anything on the market at this price point, especially not something made to the same durability standards as the Xbox360 controllers as this is.-Does work. There are some applications where I think this controller would work relatively well, which I'll list below.Cons:-Perceptible lag. Imagine if someone installed a system on your real-life car, where the car wouldn't actually turn until a fraction of a second *after* you turned your wheel. You'd demand it off immediately, as it could cause a serious accident. Same here.-Missing shoulder buttons. Why? These are standard buttons, and this contoller is Microsoft official. They should be included.-Not universal. Not only is the speed wheel not recognized by all games, but due to the missing shoulder buttons cannot function in some games even if manually configured. F1 2012, notably, requires the shoulder buttons to be able to advance through menus during a race. Should the developers have put in a workaround? Sure. But the developers had every reason to think Microsoft wouldn't start hacking buttons off its controllers for no reason.Games this will work for:-NASCAR, and other oval or even drag racers. The speed wheel will beat a controller any day for being able to hold a specific angle.-Arcade games. Where control may be so floaty you wouldn't mind a lack of precision anyway, and fun factor is what matters.-Beginning race sims. Kids and absolute newcomers to racing sims might not yet know car handling well enough to detect the wheel's faults.Detail on the Real Big Cons:-The lag in the controller is pretty bad, and frankly controller-less driving with Kinect is as good or better. The motion sensing is a real failure on this point.-Missing buttons! Why? Especially in driving games, every single button on the controller may end up being used for something (from e-brakes to horn to lights to changing the view) so this is just not the place for this kind of decision.-The point of getting a wheel is to immerse yourself in the game, and/or to accomplish feats of driving that are difficult on a controller. Immersion is ruined by the slow response and weird glowing circles, and for every area the controls excel in (holding a constant angle) it fails at another (slow left-right response) meaning the end result is really no better than the controller.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY0L2","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane O. Laake \"camera nerd\"","summary":"Surprisingly good with a silly flaw","reviewText":"The good news is that this controller is way better than a Wiimote in a plastic wheel.  It's honestly a great solution for driving games without the bulk, hassle, and cost of a full fledged wheel setup but better than the standard controller or the aforementioned Wiimote setup.  At first it was a tough transition from the standard controller at first, with oversteer being the biggest issue.  In time my times improved, mostly by avoiding the wild spells of oversteer turning into a complete loss of control.  As an added bonus, in Forza my corners used to score mostly 1s and 4s, where now I routinely get 2s and 3s (plus the 1s and 4s).  I'm guessing it's showing a greater deal of consistency, and I know passing and drifting is way easier.  Would a full wheel setup be better?  Definitely, but it would take way more room in my living room.  With this, I can throw it under the couch or whatnot.The bad news?  Well that's baffling.  I understand the lack of analog sticks, as the wheel replicates most of that, but the wheel has no should buttons.  That's a huge loss for driving/racing games, as these buttons often are used for shifting.  Hell, even Microsoft's own Forza series uses it extensively for setup.  I couldn't even change the setup (to reduce the oversteer I mentioned above), as you need shoulder buttons to tab over.  Frankly I cannot fathom why Microsoft didn't find some place to put the buttons.  Even a crappy location is better than nothing.  The light up ends are gimmicky, and I'd rather have should buttons.  Other than that, ergonomics aren't great.  It's not a huge deal, but, it could be quite a bit better.  Do know that this wheel isn't compatible with rechargeable battery packs, the charge and play kit, or and voice chat capability.  Frankly it really doesn't seem like a 1st party effort.  It does work beautifully wirelessly however.In the end, I really like the controller.  It didn't cost too much, and it's not another bulky peripheral.  If it had shoulder buttons, it would be a 5 star product.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

Especially if the game is as well done as Assassin's Creed II is.  There are any number of things that amaze me - the quality of the animation and illustration, a plot which creates a perpetual state of mystery.  And so forth ad infinitum.  In a year where there have been an unusual number of fine action/adventure games (RPG or otherwise), Assassin's Creed 2 is remarkable.  Ubisoft has put everything they had into making this a landmark game, and they have succeeded.Rather than go on and on about each flash of brilliance I just want to touch on a couple of details - one positive and one negative.  And then I'll leave you at peace to do what you should be doing -- playing the game.The positive is one that is often overlooked - the amount of effort into making the game accurate from a historical point of view.  The Italian Renaissance is one of the most complex and rich periods of European history.  Rather than simply glossing this over, Ubisoft has put effort into making out assassin an active participant in the events of the time and in depicting live in some of Europe's most beautiful cities.  Art, culture, politics, you name it and it is represented here.  This is one of those rare games where the player is richer for having played it.  There should be a special prize for this kind of effort a Nobel gaming prize, if that doesn't sound too outlandish.My criticism will reveal my own weaknesses as well.  As a 60 year old desk jockey I am lacking in the finely honed fighting reflexes that this kind of game demands of the player.  I fumble, and my fingers spaz out at critical moments.  To be really effective at this game one must have strong controller skills.  What Assassin's Creed demands of the player is a high level of accurate control, or a great deal of luck - probably both.  Very slight differences in thumb position or timing can produce frustratingly different results.  Since game saving is left to the whims of the machine it is possible that a string of actions will be wiped away by a slight misstep.  I had to reminds myself not to throw the controller at my brand new flat screen television on more than one occasion.  That being said, though, I did finish the game and almost all the side quests so the issue is hardly insurmountable.  Rest assured, if I can play it, anyone can.Assassin's Creed II is a treat to play and participate in.  Since it is a violent game with more than a little rough language there will be those who take exception to it.  But for the rest of us it is well worth the purchase price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2010"}

You knew since its 1st announcement that it was coming for all platforms so why do you think that the PC version was going to get some kind of special treatment? It's really bugging me to know that people are killing the ratings because of common knowledge they had beforehand of what the game was going to be about and where to play it.With that said:I am running a PC with an AMD Phenom II X6 1065T, 8gb of ram and a Geforce GTX 460 graphics card and it ran Witcher II with no problems so I expected no issues out of Skyrim.Yes, Skyrim needed Steam to work...another issue people knew about but still are complaining over. The ONLY complaint I had with the Steam DRM was initially trying to input the numbers was a small hassle because the initial 15 code screen didn't pop up but eventually with 10 mins, I was done and on my way. Unlike most people, I had no issues running the game. No freezes and no crashing. I played for 9hrs yesterday and it was absolutely fun.Control - I am using an Xbox 360 control on my PC so yes it fit right in and I really liked how they did the GUI because it felt more streamlined than Oblivion. I could find everything that I needed with fewer button pushes that I needed on Oblivion. Yes combat fighting is a bit hokey but nothing that I couldn't handle.Graphics - My tower is hooked up via HDMI to my 55' HDTV so I am getting as much as I can out of it. The draw distances look great and the variety and detail are A+!! Some of the dungeons have an ancient and haunted feel to them and sometimes when you go in, the ambient atmosphere feels so tight and confining, you can't wait to come out!  Same with climbing some of the mountains.  Because this game has a radiant weather control, a blizzard can come out of nowhere making you , regardless of how warm a room you are in, want to find a blanket until you find sanctuary. The facial details as well as the clothing details are varied and look much more lifelike in HD. I don't think Oblivion ever looked this good! Even when choosing the faces is a lot more detailed than it has been in the past!Audio - somewhat a mixed bag.  I have  7.1 surround system and at times the ambient sound is really good but my issue is that when you are in a crowded room, the main speaker you need to hear is drowned out by surrounding people also speaking. Some of the voice acting is better this time around but there still have been times I have talked to different characters in the same area that the same voice actor did the voice for....it's not game breaking but overall still a lot better then what you got from Oblivion.The game itself - easily one of the best games to get lost in. A virtual time sink to stick around for until spring! I don't know how many times I found myself walking to my main objective and get sidetracked with a watchtower to explore , a stranger to talk to or a mystical fountain to check out. This does so many of the things that I wished the Witcher II would have allowed to be done. There are so many stories to hear, sides you can choose to be on, people who need help that you can help or ignore but most of all everything is up to you to decide. and some missions you can complete early find the person giving the task later and have done and the story will continue on without that awkward going backwards feeling.Then there is one thing that it seems like no one has mentioned and that is the ability to take a companion with you. While not chatty like characters in Dragon Age, at the very least you have someone you can use as muscle/pack mule. One good thing I do like about this is even though you don't have the ability to customise them, they can however wear/use the strongest pieces of armor and weapons you give themIf I had one gripe about the game, it would be the map.  It's sort of a 3D isolinear map but the problem is, it doesn't quite rotate all the way around like it should.  I was trying to find the way to High Hrothgar and was lost for over an hr because the map didn't rotate far enough to show me that I needed to take a different path but all the same in my being lost I found 8 areas that I want to go back and explore so at least getting lost was worth it.I will give a hint however...if you ever get lost in the game, there is a clairvoyance spell that you can use that will paint a short line to the direction you should head in for your objective.I love this game and can't wait for the mods to come!Those of you complaining of crashes and freezes, now might be a good time to check your system to make sure it's running at its best and update your drivers, because I have yet to experience problems most others seem to have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

To speak more clearly, there are some things that you can do only once, if you fail on doing it, you have to reset and retry it, there are people that you can speak with to advance in the percentage and there are people that you should avoid to advance in the percentage, if you speak to somebody you shouldn't in the chapter you'll miss the percentage needed to see what you came looking in this game, then if you miss something you cannot do it again if you're in a different chapter.It's confusing the fact that you cannot do everything when you see the people or get the mission, because you've to do some thing in the 3 chapter to get +3% but you can do the same thing in chapter 1 but you'll get 1%.To really \"enjoy\" the game, you need a gameguide, TO BE READING ALL THE GAME ALONG (the official one won't serve you by the way), you need something done to get all the percentage, the game has five endings but only one ending that you wan't to see, the 100% ending because the others just suck.In conclusion, the traditional talking to people and nice walking around the world is jeopardized by the fact that you're going to screw it talking to somebody you shouldn't until chapter 4 or 3, causing it to give you less percentage or not giving you percentage at all. Those people you saw with bad eyes because they constantly use game guides to beat the games, well you'll become one of them with this game.True FF fans avoid it at all costs, this game sucks big time, just stick to the story of the X and you will remain happy with Yuna and his friends.People of Square, Hironobu Sakaguchi... what where you thinking when you created the percentage system? i can see now why namco is gaining ground on the rpg games.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

It's the race of a lifetime, as you guide Samus to the relics before other hunters can reach them - and use them on her.","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Sturgeon","summary":"Play control needs work.","reviewText":"Controls- The stylus takes quite a bit of getting used to. It's one thing to use the stylus briefly during key moments of a game. But to use it as a primary control system gets bothersome. It's an awkward position trying to counterbalance the game system itself along with fire and strafe controls in one hand, meanwhile you're other hand is pressing down on the screen right next to it. The center of balance of the system just isn't physically right for it.You can set the system up to control things with buttons only, but only at the cost of extreme precision control.Normally you use the control pad for strafing and running. The stylus is used for looking around and turning your character (among other things). The stylus can be used to turn your character as slowly or as quickly as you want depending on how fast you swipe the stylus. This is the one good point that Hunters has over the other Prime games. You can do quick turn-arounds or you can turn Samus different directions as slowly as you want. That's one of the very few advantages of using the stylus.So there's a trade off. You can either use an all button control system, which costs you precision in control. Or you can use the stylus, which tires the hands holding the game and gets irksome if your hand happens to shake the slightest bit when you get to an exciting point in the game.So in the world of Controls, I give Hunters 3 stars. They finally have a way to turn Samus quickly. Doing things with a stylus has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I just don't thing first person shooter is the way to go with Metroid as far as hand held goes.Game play- Like the previous Prime games, this is a first person shooter. As such, it would seem some of my favorite power ups are missing again. No space jump, no screw attack, as far as I've seen, no grappling beam. I fear that many of the power ups Metroid fans have come to know and love may have died out along with third person perspective.One of the biggest problems I have with Hunters, both in game play and as a whole, is the time limited escape sequence after every board. Of course, this is Metroid. So a time limited escape sequence is to be expected. In fact, escape sequences made its debut in Metroid. But after every single stage? That's just too much! Give the player a chance to breath. Put an escape sequence at the beginning, at the end, maybe one or two places in between. But not after every single stage! It's annoying.Only being able to save at your ship is also annoying, but that's been covered quite well in other reviews.I have yet to play using the Wi-Fi connection. I intend to at some point. But I have played multi-player using bots. This is where I think Hunters shines (and what boosts my overall rating). Finally being able to use Samus online to test your skills against others is one innovation with the DS that I cannot wait to use.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2006"}

It trumps its impressive predecessor with one word: Freedom! Not that any of Activision's earlier Spidey games have been slouches, but in Spider-Man 2, you really will feel the thrill (and hectic pace) of being Peter Parker. The plot traces that of the film and its villain, Dr. Octopus, but the game expands to include appearances by Mysterio, Black Cat, Rhino, and other Marvel folks. Developer Treyarch has built a half-scale model of New York City with no loading times and no boundaries. Want to swing from Harlem to Ellis Island? Would you prefer to run through the streets on foot? Or maybe hitch a ride atop one of the hundreds of moving cars? With tons of mini-missions and goals strewn about the city, and various icons to collect, Manhattan is yours to explore-anywhere, any time, all the time. Doing so becomes a joy thanks to the locomotion system. Web-swinging takes a little practice, but in short order, you'll feel massively powerful, shooting webs that visibly auto-attach to buildings and trees, zooming around corners, pulling 360-degree loops, even grabbing onto a helicopter and getting an aerial tour of the city. The city looks great; the pedestrian models could be higher res, but it's a sweet Big Apple with cool day/night effects and detailed textures on both machines (though the Xbox version looks noticeably prettier from a distance). Spidey seems a little small on the screen, but that facilitates a better view of the terrain during swings. The street missions do get repetitive -- stop an armored-car robbery, get ambushed by some thugs, chase down a carjacker, um...deliver some pizza, save a child's balloon (!?), then stop another armored-car robbery with the same script as the first one -- but the combat is never the same twice. There are so many ways to take down the bad guys, in terms of combos, unlockable special attacks, and aerial juggles, that the framework for the conflict doesn't really have to be stunningly original; it's the actual beatdowns that contain all the flavor. And they're quite tasty. It's a strangely silent game without much music, but you will hear pedestrian chatter as you pass -- everything from &quot;Spidey, you da man!&quot; to &quot;Menace!&quot; They could be less repetitive and cheesy, though. Film actor Tobey Maguire delivers Peter Parker's trademark sarcastic wit smoothly; Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, and Bruce Campbell provide voices as well. It sounds like hype, but it's fact: This is indeed the best Spider-Man game yet made. From the rich combat system to the simple, inexhaustible joys of swinging through the city, Spider-Man 2 delivers the experience web-slinger fans have been begging for since time immortal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2004"}

I've been going through with this with them since the Commodore 64 days when I got 'Adventure Construction Set' and about every Madden NFL game since and upon further recollection I cannot think of a single one of their games that ever came close to living up to the hype that they promise.So I give this game 2 stars, EA itself 2 stars and myself 1 star for being the big idiot in the entire equation.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Covino","summary":"Reviewed by a Playstation Fanatic","reviewText":"The Hitman (code name 47) was cloned by a scientist for the purpose of assassinating worldwide terrorists, gunrunners, and drug lords. Mr. 47 works under cover of a mysterious agency that assigns him on missions around the world to takeout the most wanted criminals, and is rewarded with large sums of money per hit that can exceed thirty thousand dollars. But this is no takeoff of any James Bond movie. 47 is much too inhuman to thrill-ride all the ladies, and was designed to feel no emotion, or desire in an underground laboratory.Now some details on game play itself. Expenses at times are taken out of your income if you accidentally-or purposely-kill unnecessary targets such as police officers or civilians that often stand in your way (can't buy all the best guns if you blow all your money on just killing people, which includes sniper rifles, and an assortment of automatics, some of which come with silencer attachments to further improve your performance as a professional killer). The game encourages you to find alternate ways that are not always so obvious to make your hit. Encouraging stealth and perfection. Hence, the game's primary challenge. Besides, if you just open fire on anything that moves in this game (like what we see with too many other games) you'll maybe live 10 or 15 seconds after the first shot. Stealth is the key. Every mission can be beaten without you ever getting shot, or spotted (I know people don't believe that, but believe it or not I can make those Columbian levels look as easy as the very first mission). Ways to avoid detection include hiding the bodies of the people you kill, dressing as the enemy (gangs and terrorist groups alike often have certain dress-code and you can take the clothes of any person you kill in this game) poisoning, waiting for certain patrolmen guarding your main target to separate and taking them out one by one with a silenced pistol. And many other ways, depending on the situation.The AI of all moving people in this game is superb. You can literally hide behind any given object (dresser, tree, bookshelf) after you have been discovered, and the enemies won't know where you are until they see you, even when they are in the same room. In most games they just come right to you. If their backs are turned you can sneak up on them to either slit their throat or strangulate them, which I've seen in a few other games, but not to this astounding degree. If you sniper someone from afar, people will gather around the body (which could be helpful if the congregated group of people are all people you prefer dead). Your un-silenced weapons will be heard if fired and frighten civilians or alert the enemy. People turn their heads to look at you if you walk by. If one yelps too loud in the instant it takes you to pull out your gun and shoot him, others will come. The thing is, they REACT! They are not just mindless, close-knitted colored pixels on the screen. They react to sound, to your presence, and to the things you do.  In fact, the AI is too good. There have been incidents where I was following someone too close and the draw of my weapon was actually HEARD, causing the person I pursued to turn around, to see the gun in my hand, and to draw a weapon of his own in the second it took me to shoot him smack-dead in the face.Close one. Amazing how many miles per hour your heart can accelerate in a matter of seconds...This game can be sick, challenging, exciting, and most of all, engrossing. You can just kiss all the hours of a whole weekend away playing this beautiful game. The only drawback is that there is no in-game save. It saves automatically after you complete each mission. Hitman 2 is just as good, if not better (some of the quirks in the AI in Hitman 1 was corrected in Hitman 2, the graphics are ten times better and there is in-game save in Silent Assassin). Hitman 3 is out this Spring. Don't neglect this series. Buy it now. Hitman 1 is available for PC only. I would have never played it if it were not for playing Hitman 2 on playstation, the best game console ever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2004"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

So, i waited to pick up 3 knowing the graphics would be superb and make for a much more well rounded experience overall. The game is extremely graphic, but nothing that most of us haven't seen before, also your not really killing TO many people, mostly creatures, so its all good! I can't stress enough how great the graphics are and how much it feels like you are in an absolute movie and its an amazing feeling to experience. Playing through it on Hard took around 10 hours, wasn't really what i would call hard, you really just have to have quick fingers, and focus on what your doing. I love all the giant rock creatures and i think the coolest looking boss to fight(the whole scene) was Possiden. All the flying, and cut scenes really keep you enthralled even if the gameplay is pretty basic and at certain times tells you to hit, 0, X, R1 etc. I also loved Dante's Inferno, its not quite as intense as this as far as story and excitement, but its really foul and a lot more vile, actually disgusting at times. So get both games together, this one definitely rules the roost and is the original brutal thrash and kill series. Also both games touch on different issues, Dante touches on hell and the seven deadly sins, while GOW goes for a gory mythological message and does it very well. I don't give many games 5 stars and this one is no exception, i'm just strict that way, it really has to WOW me, as did Resident Evil 4 and really be something i can just get totally lost in. GOW 3 is close, but i want more of an engrossing story, and puzzles to figure out. Not much of that exists in this game, but then again thats not the type of game it is. The controls are very very good and responsive as is the FPS, i don't think i've ever seen a better looking stable, no lag game on any system to date, sorry Killzone 2 its gotcha beat. So i may go through it a second time, i'm finishing up Dante right now, no nightmares of bloody demons and guts yet, suprisingly!! Dante seems a bit longer, or in some ways just more tedious, and difficult, its not as well thought out as GOW 3 but has its great moments. I'm not really comparing the two even though they are alike, i just really am glad to see PLATFORMING games making a BIG comeback, more more this year i hope, love it. Really looking forward to Lost Planet 2(doesnt seem to be getting hype), and also the New Castelvania in October the first on a next GEN SYSTEM! So it seems to be a good year for games like this, and i hope first person shooters take a back seat for a while, because i have become way burnt out on them. Also whats up with Xbox and NO exclusives? Mass Effect 2, come on. I love my Xbox as well but they need something fresh, i hope Alan Wake does the Trick. So pick up GOW 3 its worth the money just for graphics alone, but you will love ripping off the heads, and disemboweling giant creatures for fun, it does ROCK!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2010"}

My computer wasn't powerful but I had chance to play on friend's computer and was totally WOW!!!When I heard about the sequel to Crysis was going to be released, I had two thing in my mind, gameplay & graphics. And of course the story, which allows to develop the universe of whole new gameAnswer to two things:IT DELIVERS AS PROMISED!!!!!The gameplay of Crysis 2:It has been streamlined significantly to have more responsive and faster pace shooter experience. The powers of Nanosuit 2.0 makes you feel sometimes like super solider going in guns blazing or stealthly assassinating enemies. With exciting new story which starts out a little slow until half way through the game, it picks significant pace and development on the bond between you and your fictional Nanosuit. It truly makes your think and feel wonders of this technological weapon of future. You can be bullet sponge, then blow up everyone with grenades or get perfect headshots. Cloak right away and dissappear from your enemies. These are some of the features of the game. There have been some glitches in campaign, for example most common to be AI tend to become dumb otherwise most of the time, they are intelligent to take cover, try to flank or regroup and mount assault with a larger force, anything to stop at all costs. This gives the player the opportunity and challenge to play the game your WAY!!!Graphics - Crytek worked very hard to make their new game engine \"CryEngine3\" to be multiplatform. I have got game for xbox and this game engine demostrated high end graphics from really old xbox 360, which has severe amount limations, but still Crytek deliver an superb graphics, appreciation of detail is very high. The shading is so organic with lighting effects to be perfectly go together, giving the feel of New york at your screen. As the game progesses, you will see specatular situations, all render realtime while playing. They just too beautiful.Multiplayer = Probably the weakest linkThe realase of demo of Crysis featured mutliplayer with two maps. I have played long enough that I really liked but there were a lot of bugs. I hope they would remove most of it. Still the full version of game tends to suffer in networking issues mostly. This has caused alot of angry fans cannot enjoy a simple game without any problems. Otherwise it offers a lot of things to do in multiplayer. Various maps, tons of suit upgrades to weapon customization. In the upcoming days, I am quite content with my progess in multiplayer.Crytek said that they are working real hard to patch up the problems. Hopefully providing a smooth experiece soon.Verdict: As a gamer, we should embrace newer technology, so we can enjoy true next gen games with mindblowing experience. It is safe to say that Crysis 2 has bombed the stanards of FPS in the market now. Go ahead the campaign is very long about 12 hours on Soldier difficulty. Some really memorable moments which are simple worth playing over and over again.Personal Message me, if you wish to specifics of the gameCrysis 2 FTW!!!! enjoy going Maximum gamingCLOAK ENGAGED!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

Carlson","summary":"Effective but repetitive","reviewText":"My Word Coach for the Nintendo DS is an educational video game designed to teach new vocabulary words. I really wanted to like this game, but ultimately, it fell short of what I had hoped it would be.The most important thing to know when considering purchasing this game is that it probably will help to build your vocabulary, but only if you use it to the point where all the word games get old. In fact, in my experience with this game, I had to play on average twenty to thirty minutes just to reach my daily quota of words. The problem is that there are only about six games, which means that things get old fairly fast. Perhaps I am just not a very disciplined person, but I began to lose interest in the games after a few days, and by a couple of weeks, I stopped playing the game altogether.However, the games really can help you learn new words. When you start out, the game evaluates what level your vocabulary is at. Then it gradually introduces new words. I felt the balance was good between new words, words I already knew, and words that I was in the middle of learning. Also, the game has a dictionary feature included, so you can easily look up definitions to words.The games are fairly fun, but nothing super spectacular. Some games are more helpful, like the game where you write a letter in to complete a word matching a given definition, while other games are less helpful, like the falling blocks game that teaches you how to spell words rather than what they mean. I felt the handwriting recognition was fairly good.In conclusion, if you like educational video games and are a very disciplined, consistent person, this game might be able to help you learn new words. However, I think for most people this game will get old after only a few weeks or less, so you may want to reconsider purchasing this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2008"}

I began to feel uncomfortable near the end when playing it, it's almost like a decent into complete madness.Highly recommended for people who want something more in their military games than just nameless uniforms to shoot at.

There is such a seamless and fast transition between guns and melee that it makes taking on LARGE numbers of enemies almost effortless.  The multiplayer is alot similar to Gears of War but slightly better.  There is no cover system, which at times seems to get in the way in the Gears multiplayer.  The campaign is good and well written.

{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Far from perfect. However, it's perfect for me.","reviewText":"After playing and loving Darksiders 1, the anticipation for this title was through the roof! Being that Darksiders is my favorite game on the PS3, it's safe to say that I had high expectations for Darksiders 2.Combat - My oh my, I must say that I've never played a game where the combat was so effortlessly and fluid! Before I go any further, lets get one thing straight. I suck at videogames, especially the combat aspect of them. When fighting in Darksiders, I always felt like I had a chance to win whatever battle I was trenched in. Death moves quickly, and he's very agile. When I press a button in the heat of combat, he actually does what I expect him to do. I know this sounds like a silly, juvenile concept, but with some of the games I've played, you'd be surprised... Death mainly uses melee attacks, but you'll also get a chance to do a little third person shooting, as well as some magic attacks if that's your thing. This may bother some of you, but there's no ability to block attacks, you can only dodge them. This works well for me because I'm too dumb to block half of the attacks in videogames anyway lol.Weaponry - By far, this is the best selection of weapons I've seen in any game I've played. I'll try and name them all, but forgive me if I forget some, quite a few to name. There are several ways to gain new weapons. The easiest way is to get them from slained enemies. Once you kill an enemy, there's always a chance they'll drop a weapon, you just have to wait and see. If you're the adventurous type, you can look for treasure chests and find weapons inside. The third way (and my favorite) is to simply buy them. I like to have plenty of options to choose from, and finding money comes extremely easy in Darksiders 2! If you choose to buy them, some of the choices are Scythes, Arm blades, Glaives, Gauntlets, Hammers, Axes, Claws, and my personal favorite - the Mace! You can equip Death with 2 weapons at a time (although you can have many more in your inventory) a Scythe, and your choice of one of the other weapons I listed. Your friends can send you weapons as well, I think that's a nice touch.Enemies - The enemy types and variety are just average, especially for a game of this length. Each map/world will provide you with new groups of enemy types, which satisfied me for the most part. Overall, you'll face a pretty decent challenge when going against the baddies, nothing too hard, nothing too easy. Boss battles are a HUGE mixed bag! I usually try and refrain from mentioning other reviews, but a couple people 'claimed' that Darksiders 2 was lacking in the number of boss battles. Umm, if you call encountering a sub-boss, and then a boss in just about EVERY dungeon, then yes, I agree that this game is lacking in its number of boss battles. Some of the battles were awe inspiring, will others inspired me to second guess what the heck the developers were thinking. I'm not going to go into detail, but the last boss battle was kinda ________ nevermind, I've already said too much, don't wanna spoil anything.Miscellaneous - It'll probably take you anywhere from 40 to 50 hours to beat, depending on how you play the game. Heck, you'll have a ton of stuff to look for if you enjoy that kind of thing. The game saves at very convenient spots - this is huge for me because I often have to abruptly stop play, and I'd hate to have to restart a checkpoint. Puzzles will also be a big part of the game. If you're the type that hates anything puzzle related, you're going to have a rough go at it - you were warned...The verdict? I absolutely loved this game! Does it have flaws? Absolutely. Do I give a rat's you know what? Nope, sure don't. Like my title suggests, this game is far from perfect, but it's perfect for me. Darksiders 2 was heavy, and a tad bit long. I need something light to play - Super Hero Squad, The Infinity Gauntlet, you're up next!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

This being Bond, the game includes tons of techno gadgets and sophisticated spy craft.Agent Under Fireoffers an immersive experience built specially for the GameCube, and a story line that builds on the Bond legacy with a combination of new and familiar villains and allies. The action takes place in fantastic, detailed 3-D environments seen through the eyes of Bond. The game is intended for up to four players.","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"Entertaining, but too short, 007 game","reviewText":"The makers of &quot;James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire&quot; made some missteps in their development of this Bond effort.  While still a very entertaining game with some levels that truly capture the imagination, &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; comes across as a truncated mission.  After investing just a few hours in playing &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot;, the game is over and the enemy vanquished.  That may have been passable for older gaming platforms with less memory power, but it's unacceptable for a game on a system like the GameCube.  I encountered a similar aggravation when I played &quot;Rebel Assault II&quot; for PlayStation.  However, &quot;RA II&quot; failed to possess any redeeming qualities, while &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; does.&quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; provides an array of fascinating gadgets and weapons for the player to use in helping Bond accomplish his mission.  There are gadgets like a laser for cutting locks, a decoder for getting past security systems, and even a grapple hook to help Bond get into out of reach places.  The weapons run the gamut from his famous 'golden gun' to the most sophisticated rocket launchers.  Let it not be said that Bond doesn't get to travel in style.  He gets to create some high-flying mayhem in his classic BMW.  He also gets to attack the bad guys aboard an underground tram system.  He even gets to storm the streets of some downtown European city aboard a tank and take out people, cars, and helicopters!Despite the shortness of the game, many of the individual boards are quite challenging and satisfying to beat.  Battles ranging from fights on an oil drilling platform to taking on a bad guy above molten lava to final mission in a remote, snowbound mountain hideout are quite a treat to play.  The weapons, gadgets, vehicles, and levels that one would expect from Bond are what make this game worthwhile.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of my favorite games, period","reviewText":"I can't think of a single game that caused as much hype and anticipation than this, except maybe Halo 2. But whereas that game had a set release date(famously confirmed when a game member got November 9 tattooed on his arm), Twilight Princess was pretty much delayed so often that people wondered whether the Gamecube would ever get it. Then came a surprise announcement: while it would still be in essence the Gamecube's final knockout blow, it would also be a launch title for Nintendo's recently released Wii system. But unlike let's say Halo or Super Mario 64 which got had an \"anyone can play\" accessibility, Twilight Princess seems mainly geared to the more hardcore crowd but you'll still find one of the best games on any Nintendo machine and probably any of them.Story: Arguably the most darkest storyline and the first one since Majora's Mask, the game tells the tale of Link living in Ordon Village who gets thrust into a battle between 2 worlds: his world and the \"twilight world\", a world full of vicious creatures and a foreboding atmosphere. With the help of familiar faces, new ones and a new gift, Link once again has to save Hyrule. There's a strange sense of melancholy in the game, like it's not as obviously uplifting like Wind Waker or a game for all seasons like Ocarina of Time with shifting atmospheres, this feels more darker, more epic and more compelling as a result.Graphics: One common issue brought up with the Wii version's reviews was how un-next gen they looked. On the Gamecube though, this is easily the most gorgeous game that to me even eclipses graphic powerhouses like Resident Evil 4 or Metroid Prime. Graphics look much sharper and detailed and facial expressions during cut-scenes give characters even more personality, including Link. If there is a quibble is that the unmistakable \"Nintendo texture\" pops up where things look kinda blurry up close.Sound/Music: I noticed a couple of soundbytes in regards to voices but it's strictly one word phrases although it did sound like new character Midna spoke a language. If there's one thing Zelda rarely disappoints in is the music and despite the fact it's not a fully orchestrated soundtrack, it's still got lively tunes and moments of serene gentle melodies.Gameplay: Since this is the Gamecube version, we don't have to deal with manually aiming, instead using the analog stick like always. You map items onto the Y or X(no Z this time, that's to talk to Midna, your new friend when you enter the twilight world). The major shift is that Link can transform into a wolf which will have controls that will feel at home with Okami fans. Also, Midna acts as a kind of jump helper where at certain points you can actually jump unreachable distances should Midna be over there. Speaking of which, she's not as famously annoying like Navi and will generally be a worthwhile character to have around.The main thing of course with a Zelda title is the puzzles and this game has some pretty big brain testers but then on the other hand, towering bosses are actually pretty easy so I guess we're exercising our brains more than our bloodlust. You'll find as much as at least 9 or 10 of these dungeons filled with puzzles and bosses, not to mention Hyrule itself is huge and there's plenty of sidequests to do, then of course the story itself can rack up the hours easily. By and large, this is a longer and epic game than we've seen and many will welcome it since it's an easy world to get lost in.Is it for everyone? Doubt it. Even Mario 64 and Halo had its detractors but as a swan song for the Gamecube, this was a fitting end but more importantly, just an all around perfect game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Hardcore Fans Rejoice!!!  Everyone Else... Might Have Something Better to Do.","reviewText":"Those of you who are hungry to play a Classic RPG will enjoy Dragon Age, but this game will strain the patience of many non-hardcore fantasy fans.Story  7/10You must unite the Elves, Dwarves, Mages, and Humans to battle against a Dark Lord and his race of Darkspawn.  Yeah, it's the Dark Lord story again...  Only this time, the Dark Lord is called the Arch Demon... and he's a Dragon... Demon...  Demon Dragon?  Anyway, he's tough... and Dark.  As far as fantasy goes, the story is pretty vanilla.Graphics  5/10Graphics snobs beware!  Unfortunately, even on the highest settings, Dragon Age looks about six years old.  It fails to measure up against older games like Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and The Witcher.  If you've been playing games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, then you may end up hating the graphics.  The lighting is bland and there is a noticeable lack of detail.  However, the art direction is pretty good and there are distinct styles for all of the different cultures of Ferelden.  The Dwarven architecture is rocky and blocky.  The Elven items are finely crafted and heavily inspired by nature.  The Human castles are regal and the slums are depressing.  Medieval Fantasy Fans will appreciate the look of the game, but the graphics snobs will be disappointed in the quality of the art.World 7/10One of the most highly detailed worlds in a Single Player RPG.  It's HEAVILY based on Lord of the Rings, but there is a darker twist.  Elves have been enslaved, Magic is under the strict rule of the government, Human Kingdoms backstab each other to expand their borders...  All of the different races have their own beliefs, religions, cultures, trade, customs, governments, and opinions.  Hardcore fans will love this!  However, Dragon Age violates the \"Show Don't Tell Rule\" as much as possible.  Instead of having interesting missions in unique levels to depict the cultures of the races, the game stops all of the action and simply explains the cultures to you through the NPC's and Text via Codexes.  Just about every NPC will gladly have a 5 minute conversation with you about their homeland.  Unfortunately, the NPC just stands there with a blank expression on their face and simply talks at you.  It is like someone is reading a fictional encyclopedia to you...  and they keep going... and going... and going...  The game would have been much better if YOU learned about the culture through the action and the quests, rather than dialogue and text.Characters  8/10The Character Creation system of Dragon Age is great.  You can make just about any type of character that you can imagine.  The NPC's that join the party are also very well thought out and have their moments.  In Bioware fashion, they also bicker with each other when they join your party.  Some of this is pretty funny.  Unfortunately, because the world is dark, there is more arguing and pessimism than interesting or funny moments.  The game picks up at the end, but throughout the middle, it's pretty dry.Interface  2/10The good news... there is a \"Party Inventory\" that is accessible by your current party.  No more micromanaging items and trying to see who has space in their bag for this extra belt of frost resistance that you may need later.  Any party member with you can give or take from this inventory at any time.The bad news... buying and equipping items is fairly broken.  Final Fantasy has been doing this correctly since the late 1980's and it's shocking to see a new game drop the ball like this.  Items that you sell must be unequipped first.  So, shopping goes a little something like this:> Talk to shopkeeper.> Get the \"I want to buy something option\"> He says something witty.> He opens his store> You see a cool sword that Alistair could use.> You buy it and put it in your party inventory.> You exit the shop inventory.> You unequip Alistair's old sword and equip his new one.> You talk to the shopkeeper.> Get the \"I want to buy something option.\"> He opens his store.> You sell Alistair's old sword to the shop's inventory.You should be able to easily swap items in and out of NPC's inventories and shopping could be streamlined 90%.It gets worse if you see an item for a party member that is back at your camp.> Talk to shopkeeper.> Get the \"I want to buy something option\"> He says something witty.> He opens his store> You see a cool bow that Leliana could use.> You try to \"Compare\" it to her bow.> But she has her sword equipped.> You end the conversation.> You exit the store... Load Screen> You exit the town... Load Screen> You access the World Map... and select your Camp... Load Screen> You walk over to Leliana and toggle her weapons.> You exit camp... Load Screen> You access the World Map and select the Town... Load Screen.> You walk to the shop and enter it... Load Screen.> You do everything that you did when Alistair bought his sword.This process could take 10-15 minutes and it may be a deal breaker for players who like their games streamlined.Gameplay  7/10There is no exploring because the game is linear.  Levels load and there is a linear path through them with a few side areas where you can find treasure chests.  Unfortunately, 95% of the loot that you find is worthless and you end up selling it.The combat is tactical.  You control 4 party members and you can give preset commands like in Final Fantasy XII's Gambit System.Examples:\"Alistair - If an enemy is using magic - Attack him with Shield Bash.\"\"If my Health is &lt;50% take  Medium Health Potion.\"During combat you can pause the game and issue commands at any time by clicking on an action bar, then on the target.Click on Heal, then on your character to heal them.Click on Shock, then on an enemy to shock them.Then unpause the game and continue the battle.If you try to play in real time, you'll probably get destroyed.So, keep an eye on your characters and be ready to hit the spacebar to pause the action.The good news is that they have a ton of spells and attacks that are very useful.  There are area of effect spells, there are stunning attacks, there are buffs and de-buffs...  There are plenty of tactical decisions that you make to control the outcome.  These combat techniques and spells are unlockable when your character goes up levels.One Additional Note: Dragon Age doesn't take advantage of damage types the way other RPG's usually do.  Elemental Damage (Fire, Ice, Electricity) pretty much works the same on everyone.  As a result, many of the battles feel repetitive.  Cast Paralysis on the toughest bad guy, wipe out the minions before the spell wears off, then tackle the tough bad guy.  You'll win 90% of your battles with this strategy.  Dragon Age really could use enemies that are resistant to Mental Attacks or must be slain with Elemental Attacks like Mind Flayers or Trolls, respectively.Sound  8/10The music and sound effects set the mood, and the voice actors did an amazing job.  There are probably 200 hours of dialogue in the game, depending on what decisions you make and it all sounds pretty good.Pacing 2/10If you have a busy life or want to rush through this game... don't even bother playing it.  I have friends with Level 80 WoW Characters who love Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale, Oblivion, The Witcher, Final Fantasy, etc... that quit playing Dragon Age.The shopping is cumbersome, but the Load Screens are the worst.  This is one of the slowest paced games that I've ever seen.  Even when you travel on the World Map, the map loads, you pick a town directly to the east, you see splotches on the map marking your progress, you head north, then east, then south, then you get attacked, then the encounter loads, you fight the encounter, the map loads again, you head south, and then the town loads.  This could take 25 minutes, depending on the random encounter.  It feels as if the game is mocking you.  If you don't have much time, you will not be able to enjoy this game.Note:  There's also a memory leak bug, that lengthens the Load Screens, the longer you play.  When you first load Dragon Age, the screens are about a minute.  After playing for an afternoon, the same screens can be four or five minutes.  If you notice this, just Save and Exit the game, then start it up again.Some nights, I just bought supplies, talked to some NPC's, organized my party, and did two side quests... I looked at the clock and 3 hours had passed... no joke.Replay Value  9/10This is an 80 hour game with multiple endings, an array of party members, and a variety of outcomes.  You could play Dragon Age for 320 hours if you wanted to see everything.Why the PC Version is Better:The PC version is better than the Xbox 360 version for the following reasons:-  The graphics are slightly better on the highest settings-  The difficulty is a bit harder-  You can zoom the camera back to an isometric (Baldur's Gate Style) view.  This really helps you make tactical decisions in battle.-  You can pause the game and command your party members as much as you want.  In the 360 version, every time you pick a target, the game unpauses.MaturityM for violence, blood, gore, language, and 'romantic' sex scenes that you could see on any tv show where the characters do it in their underwear.Overall 7/10Dragon Age is a very long game that moves at a turtle's pace.  It's got high adventure, strategy, and party based gameplay; and there aren't a lot of single player party games out there.  If you're a dedicated fan of the genre, appreciate deep fantasy cultures, have 80 hours to kill, and like tactical battles, you'll love this game!However, if you need great graphics and want to enjoy a reasonably fast paced game, forget it.  Dragon Age will test the patience of most of the gamers out there.If you enjoyed the world of Dragon Age, check out The Witcher or Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.If you enjoyed the party based combat, look for Knights of the Old Republic, Baldur's Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale 1&2, and Planescape Torment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2010"}

That's about all though....","reviewText":"I am so glad I rented this.  I think I paid like 9 dollars to rent it.  I think that was a rip off for this game.  Please allow me to tell you why.  First let me say that the graphics are great.  I'm not one of those people that really care about the way a game looks though.  I mean I guess I like a good looking game.  But I will judge a game on the fun it brings me.You start this game with a cut scene telling you what's going on.  I still have no clue.  I watched the full cut scenes and I have not a clue.  Anyway the controls are good.  Jumping, running and fighting feel tight and easy to learn.  The camera though will get you.  I had to jump on a pole at one point and the camera kept doing a half circle.  Stopping me from seeing the point that I needed.  This has not happened that much.You can hit the L1 button if you need help on a level.  Doing so gives you a special vision that turns everything red.  The place you must go, or the objects you must destroy to get somewhere are in blue.  This really helps make things a little better.  Not that you will need this.  The game is pretty easy.  I'm the guy that can never figure any games out.  Yet this was a breeze for me.  You can also upgrade your weapon.  You go to the menu and go to either your sword or your ninjutsu and you can add points that you collect in battle to upgrade your weapons.  This could have been done a little better.  It's upgrading  in the simplest form.  You can customize your character.  Meaning you can change the colors of the items he uses.  Again, so much more could have been done here.Then the restart thing.  At times in the game you will be asked to hit buttons to make thing happen.  Be it left stick up, down , B , Y , X or A.  If you don't do this within like 2 seconds you have to restart the entire sequence.  This didn't bother me at first.  Then I would have done like 10 things right and miss one.  The game makes you restart the entire thing.  I probably spent more time doing things like that than I did actually playing.  Not everyone will get annoyed by this.  But some of you will.  It is good kind of.  I mean at least they let you restart at the beginning of the thing you need to do, and you don;'t have to restart the level.Speaking of the levels.  Well let me say that one thing really bothered me.  No save points.  I did not have any option to save my game.  If I had to do something I had to leave me xbox on while I did it.  Hello electric bill!  That was really annoying.  I don't think they self save either.  You just play a level until you beat the boss.  Then it saves.You can hit the L1 button if you need help on a level.  Doing so gives you a special vision that turns everything red.

Again, so much more could have been done here.I found the game kind of boring.  I mean you basically run through each level with nothing going on.  Firstly you have nobody to talk to.  Sometime someone will talk to you and tell you what's going on.  I couldn't hear a word they said though.  Not sure if it was the music or the fact that I was trying not to get killed and couldn't pay attention.  Then all the game has you do is run through levels and kill.  I know it's a hack and slash.  But at least give me a little something extra.  It gets old fast.Basically this feels like an arcade game.  And a bad one at that.  While the graphics and controls would get like a 4 out of 5, there are so many other things in the game that are bad.  Or that leave you wanting more.  You get the feeling that you're playing a demo and not a fully finished copy.  So anyone looking to play this game.  I would say rent it first.  If not you may regret it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2009"}

Character development is versatile and open-ended, allowing for true freedom in character growth through battle. The fully 3D battlefields allow players to move freely and control a party of three simultaneously, utilizing the advanced real-time battle system. Players can execute synchronized attacks and collaborate to unleash a deadly blow to the enemy. While moving from one section of the game to the next, fully polygonal graphics create a magnificent environment for one to explore. The multifaceted story is presented in gorgeous CG movies and event sequences. The entire experience inStar Oceanis also enhanced with Dolby Pro Logic II sound.Set in SD 772, four hundred years since the climactic battle with the &Ograve;Ten Wise Men,&Oacute; humans and aliens now co-exist together in both advanced and less-developed societies, as the Galaxy Federation continues to research the cosmos to gain more influence in Space. The story begins asStar Ocean&Otilde;s protagonist, Fayt Leingod, brings his family and childhood friend, Sophia Esteed, to the Federation-managed resort planet Hyda for a vacation, but the dreamy holiday is abruptly ended when Hyda is attacked by an unknown space military. In the heat of the attack, Fayt is separated from his family and Sophia, and he begins an emotional quest into the unknown to find his loved ones. Along his journey, he gets caught up in the war of an uncharted planet, but in the end, he learns the terrible untold secret about the world and himself.","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"The Most Controversal Game of the Franchise","reviewText":"And that's mainly because of the huge plot twist which I refuse to talk about. The plot twist was enough to hurt the entire franchise.You play as a college student named Fayt who is on vacation with his family and childhood friend when they suddenly get attacked. He escapes but gets separated from his family and ends up in another world. Soon, he meets a man named Cliff who takes him on his ship before they end up on another planet (which you're be stuck on for the majority of the game).From there, Fayt and Cliff try to get off the island but the only way to do that is to basically work with the uneducated people of the planet (as in not aware of technological advances).The story as mentioned is rather generic but the only thing keeping it different are the plot twists especially the big one near the end of the game that is the plot twist of all plot twists.Characters...well...you get some good ones some meh ones and then a bunch of obnoxious characters (Sophia and Roger come to mind). In this game, there are 10 characters but you can only have 8 in your party meaning that you have to decide carefully on who to take with you in the game. The four possible characters are Peppita, the performer you meet at the beginning of the game, Nel the warrior from the kingdom of Aquaria, Roger, the obnoxious raccoon kid and Albel, the cruel leader of the Black Brigade of Nel's enemy country Airgylph.I'll say this right now, you're more likely to take Albel and Peppita with you as the last two party members mainly because Adray is forced upon you and Mirage joins you at the very end. This is mainly because of gameplay issue.You see, you get 3 party members to play with and when all are KOed, it's gameover. You can switch between them and not just play Fayt meaning you need a well balanced team...but since Fayt can never be swapped out despite you don't have to play as him, it's very limited. In this game, you can be MP killed which is a hassle in later portions of the games where enemies prefer to kill you with MP instead of HP (given almost all the characters have a higher HP stat). Fayt and Maria are well balanced characters that can use magic and great physical attacks (that you can customize) but Maria is slow for some strange reason. Cliff and Mirage are slow characters but pack a punch (but against the later enemies, they're pretty useless given they cannot outrun the enemies and easily get MP killed). Nel is the third person who joins your party at the beginning who solves as the combat medic but she gets overshadowed by Maria, Albel and Sophia who do things better than her thus is she left out when she permanently leaves the party. Adray is a slow mage but has a good endurance. Sophia while she starts at a crappy level, does get all the magic in the game and casts them relatively quickly once she's at a good level. Peppita is one of the best characters in the game once she reaches a high level with her dance skills and Albel is a lightning bruiser being one of the faster characters and attacking relatively quickly (but his HP stat isn't too good and his MP stat is crap.)This leads to ANOTHER thing. The game has a sudden difficulty spike around the Moon Base arc and by the end game, the enemies are suddenly 20 levels higher than you. You spend more time leveling up to keep up with the enemies instead of enjoying the story before post game. And post game is insanely difficult. It's like Square Enix decided to take Atlus' lesson in hard bosses and run away with it especially when most enemies can kill you in one hit. The only way to prevent one hit kills is to focus so much of your time on the item crafting. This is not fun and is very annoying unlike Disgaea that makes the item world fun. You basically need a lot of money and even if you have lots of money, you need a lot of luck to make the items needed to forge the best items or to even upgrade them. You tend to lose to NPC in terms of making items and that means its harder to make weapons. The cycle is endless but is needed to even stand a chance post game.The final thing I like to point out is the relationship values. This is very useful but tends to backfire gameplay wise. Fayt's relationship with the characters determines the ending and how often other characters like Sophia heals you. This backfires when you're playing other characters given that the group in this game are all drawn to Fayt but can't stand each other meaning Sophia will almost never heal Albel when he really needs help. Many events in the game determine if a character's affection will go up and down and there is no map in the game to tell you how the relationship is, so you need to keep track on your own. Otherwise you either end up with Sophia by default (joy -_-) or alone. I'll say it now but if you want everyone else, you better be prepared to do other sidequests. In fact, getting characters like Albel's ending requires many things to be done from choosing Albel as the 7th member to completing a side quest right before the final boss and completing other events (and being a jerk to the other characters), to even have him look Fayt's way. It's like that.After this long review, I would recommend the game but prepare the hard spike near the end of the game and the plot twist of all plot twists. :3","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

It uses the same leveling system of the last two games. As you rank up you can unlock new weapons, and you can unlock accessories for those weapons, scopes, grenade launchers, extended magazines.  Map wise they're more or less the same size, you have a couple of urban and rural  environments to run around and pown your friends.MW2 single campaign is insanely weak and contrived. It also messes with your head.  The game can be broken down into five \"What the F___\" Moments.The story peaks up five years after you(Soap) and Captain Price pass out on that bridge. It turns out everything you did was for absolutely nothing. The Ultranationalist party wins control of the Russian Government, Price is MIA and  while Imran Zakhaev,  the one armed man you blew away, is turned into a national hero and relations between the US and Russia dropped to Cuban missile Crisis levels.You start out as hot shot soldier recruited from the battlefield of Afghanistan into the CIA.

The big bad terrorist knew you where an American spy and kills you at the end of the level.WTF moment number two. Right off the bat the first character you play gets killed, (which is oddly poetic since I felt dirty after playing that mission), your body is left for the Russian police to find.This prompts Russia to declare war and invade the East Coast, ala, Red Dawn.The single player campaign jumps around and is confusing in the sense that you ultimately don't know what is really going on, you only see small pieces of the bigger picture in WTF moment number five.And it's short, I beat the game in a single day totaling only about ten hours of game play, half of what the other two games where.Had to make more room for that multiplayer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}

My first compliment is the details that have been added.  It makes you really feel like you are part of the action.Okay my beefs:Controls.  They went and changed the control configuration; yes they added an option to revert to the classic style but...You cannot easily look behind you anymore using classic controls.  Gun targeting and aiming is horrible.  You can take auto target off, but then you spend a few precious seconds trying to find the target.  With auto target on, it is very tricky trying to manual aim; it keeps locking on to every other thing...and there is little help to correct this.Also of irritation is the fact that you fly through the windshield every time you get in a serious collision.  Ever heard of seatbelts?Plus: the motorcycle handling has been seriously lowered.  I used to speed about in bikes, but there is no serious cornering, even on the previously excellent PCJ 600.The missions are rather dull at first and repetitive.  The story is watered down as well.  In previous versions, everything started with a bang: in this it starts off with a leisurly drive...I would have preferred GTA Vice City's excellent story and missions with GTA San Andreas' excellent range and side missions.  I only hope that the next version might go back towards the perfection that was Vice City.Despite all these issues the game is incredibly enjoyable.  The graphics are stellar, despite being screwed on the PS3...(360 got the 720i).  With all of the rumors about Rockstar being purchased by Electronic Arts, possibly this was a little rushed in order to increase their asking price.

I saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen last night... and guess what? Alien Invasion...Government cover up... same story!!  I am really enjoying the single player campaign so far, and find the story interesting and compelling.There are going to be plenty of lengthy reviews for this game, so rather than rambling on, here ares some things I love about the game so far:**PRESENTATION: this game is PRETTY.  Lots of cool lighting effects, the enemies are alive and animated, everything looks really detailed.  One of my pet peeves for a game in the FPS genre is when your character's hands look weird (See my review for Quantum of Solace for Wii... Bonds hands look like 2 pig hooves!!)... but happily HVS did a wonderful job designing the characters hands, as well as the ASE.  The ASE is constantly in motion, and looks REALLY cool... I also really love the way they animated the various character deaths in the game.  It feels a lot like Half-Life 2 (my FAVORITE fps of all time), which is quite an achievement on the Wii!  Several reviewers have mentioned that the levels look \"bland\", and it is true... you will never get the wide open feeling that you get in games like Gears of War 2 on the 360/PS3... but this is, hands down, one of the best looking games on the Wii. In fact, the only game on the Wii that can even begin to compare with what I have seen so far on The Conduit is Metroid Prime 3.  And that, my friends, is quite a complement!!**DIFFICULTY/HARDCORE GAMEPLAY: I hate easy games.  I started the game off on \"Guarded\" difficulty, which I assume is Medium, and was pleased with the AI.  The controls took some getting used to, so initially I was getting my butt handed to me (by the second level you find yourself surrounded by LOTS of enemies), but once I got the controls and camera configured in a way that suits me (see \"Controls\" portion of review!), the tides began to turn!  One thing that I was glad to see was that the enemy AI is intelligent:  they would flank me at every opportunity.  I couldn't just crouch and shoot in one direction until all enemies were clear.  I tried that once, and out of nowhere: WHAM! I was hit from behind with one-hit melee that killed me! =)  Also, the AI is concerned/aware of it's mortality.  If an enemy is injured or is alone, it will run or seek cover rather than dumbly running at me, guns blazing. This makes for some interesting fire fights.  I will probably be ramping up the difficulty in the future... which brings to mind another nice feature: you can change the difficulty at any time for any level.  If I am playing through a level and find it too easy, I can pause the game and change the difficulty on the fly! Very nice.**CONTROL CUSTOMIZATION: One of the most outstanding features of The Conduit is that the controls, camera, etc are COMPLETELY customizable.  This is an awesome features, and all FPS really should follow suit.  After all, PC fps have been doing this for some time now.  Anyway, I was really impressed with this feature.  Typically, I don't change controls.  I hate \"that guy\", who whenever he comes over has to remap all of the controls.  That drives me nuts.  However, when I started The Conduit, I found that the camera turned a little fast for me, and the aiming reticule was a little too sensitive for my liking... so what the heck!?  I decided to try adjusting them.... and WOW.  In no time I found myself changing the bounding box size, adjusting my running speed, and making other miscellaneous changes.  This feature is wonderful, and also makes the game accessible for people new to the FPS genre.  If you find it too difficult to thrust the Wiimote to perform a melee attack... then remap the melee to a button press or something.  Simple.**ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: In a word? SUPERB.  The online multiplayer was lag free, and I found PLENTY of people online already on the day of The Conduit's release.  There are several modes to choose from... and the much-anticipated \"Bounty Hunter\" mode was my absolute fave.  The maps are surprisingly large, and the various multiplayer modes are tons of fun.  I havent had a chance to try out WiiSpeak, but I am sure it will work wonderfully.  The online portion of this game is really steals the show.  This game is gonna have LONG legs... especially for people like me who are obsessed with ranking and scores.  You are given \"EX Points\" for kills/performance, and when you play online, your ranking is displayed when you are linking with other players.  I only had an hour or so to play online, but it was smooth, fun, and intense.  A+!!I really can't say enough good things about this game.  I knew it was gonna be good. But, having actually played it, the game is great.  This game makes it clear that 3rd party developers can really up their game on the Wii. No more shoddy ports.  No more mini games.  This game has really raised the bar for gaming on the Wii.  So, if you own a Wii, then The Conduit is a MUST BUY for 2 reasons:1 - The game is AWESOME. My new favorite game on The Wii.2 - Support QUALITY game development on the Wii!In closing, here is how I rate the game:1- Presentation: 10/102- Gameplay: 9/103- Multiplayer/Online: 9/10 (would be 10/10 if they included LOCAL multiplayer)4- Sound/Cutscene animation: 9/105- Replay value: 10/10Do yourself a favor: BUY IT!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2009"}

The kind that needs to sink in for a bit after finishing the story, and give it another play. The look of the game is very appealing and mind boggling once to find out how Rockstar pieced together 90% of 1947 L.A.Gameplay is smooth with very little hiccups. The A.I. is kind of lacking and easy to run over, but I understand that the focus on LA Noire is the story of the characters and the investigatory aspects, so I can see why they didn't want to put road blocks of enemies everywhere. I could go on for quite a bit, but all I can say is; This is a nice change of pace from whats on the market, a bit slower and very immersive.

The graphics are a bit more realistic and more polished, the backgrounds add more details, the images that you're following look like slightly phased out real people, with smooth, fluid movements, and a polished, slightly frosted look to them overall. These minor adjustments make the game even better to me, while staying true to the game's original style, yet upping the ante just that little bit more. An example is the Marie Antoinette-esque costume that the character is wearing while dancing to Lady Gaga's \"Applause\". I'm sure it's quite true to the costumes La Gaga wears in her video, but it's that much more polished and realistic-looking as rendered here, and this is the case for each of the costumes I saw in the game.Another clever little detail I enjoyed was seeing an actual background set, very reminiscent of \"The Cosby Show\"'s set, in the \"Blame It On The Boogie\". It just added that much more charm to an already great game, and overall series of games.Whether you dance with these games solo simply for fun, for a workout, or for use at a party with three other participants, Just Dance 2014 offers plenty of options, and fun features. Points can be earned for a number of things, allowing you to unlock a variety of features, and I even got a few points added to my account when the game detected previous saves of my other Just Dance games on my system! Nice!The song list, as always, has a little something for everyone from the tiny tot to the grandparents, and I can easily see this being a fun hit at holiday get-togethers! It just screams \"work off some of that Thanksgiving turkey!\" to me, all while being fun enough to forget that you're actually exercising!I have a friend at work that has talked about taking a shortcut, and simply playing to video clips on a popular social video site where you can find videos of anything and everything, but for me, there's just so much more fun to be had in playing directly on console, knowing that YOU got that move right, and now, laughing to the video clips of yourself dancing (no matter how badly)! ;)Just Dance was there before all the other dance games were, and there's a reason the series is still going strong!

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"austin","summary":"Super good","reviewText":"This game is an awesome RPG.

You progress through the game getting older and discovering the true fate of your family.Gameplay: From the hero's guild, you select quests to go on. There are main quests that advance the plot or side quests. During the game, you can choose the light side - dark side effect and your character will start appearing as evil or good depending on your choices. You start off very young and get older as you complete quests and advance the plot. You fight with weapons both for close combat and ranged combat. You also get to learn spells that help you fight throughout the game. Your character can level up with experience orbs earned from defeating enemies. There are multiple towns and you can engage in multiple activities including buying clothes, buying houses, getting married (men or women), selling supplies, etc. You can woo the ladies (or guys) with gifts and work your way up to a wedding ring. This doesn't affect the main story at all, but it is fun to dive into the fantasy for a while. Everything you do has an effect on the game such as what you wear can make you scary, drinking to much beer can make you puke, and eating to much can make you gain weight. If you are scary or evil, you can get boos from the crowd. If you are charming and good, you can get applause from the crowd.The combat is fun and the side quests add to the enjoyment.

Their last entry gave birth to one of the best mini games in video game history Nazi Zombies. What would this one have to offer? Well plenty of content that's for sure. Let me start out by talking about the campaign.The story is a well written narrative that shows the life of a CIA operative named Alex Mason. You also take over two other soldiers during the campaign, but a majority of the time is spent looking through Mason's eyes. There are twists and turns abound as the story is rather complex for a  Call of Duty game.  It appears that Call of Duty has moved past using historical battles in their games because this one takes a lot of historical privileges to tell it's tale. That's not a bad thing necessarily, but I miss the days of playing historical moments.The level design is rather well done, but the campaign does fail to grab you right away. The narrative has to develop first then it really kicks in gear. It has a lot of intricacies in both story and actual gameplay to be a step above most. The voice acting is excellent, but I do wish there were some more cut scenes to enhance the movie-like feel that they are striving for. The graphics are decent, but they feel like a step down from how good Modern Warfare 2 looked. Your AI brothers in arms are as stupid as they come. They allow enemies to run right by them and kill you while you're reloading. This added to the terrible number of respawing enemies lead to many moments of anger while I tried to beat the campaign in Hardened difficulty. There were times I had to run to the check point because the enemies just kept spawning. I had to lower the difficulty it angered me so much.This game does involve more gore then the previous games as there are many times when your enemies skull is exposed. These moments seem to add some grittiness to the game that really does help the cold war feel. There are many locations to explore in the campaign and it will easily last 6 to 8  hours to complete. There are also some vehicle missions that add some variety. Overall the campaign had a great story, but some technical issues kept it from being spectacular.Zombies is back in this installment as well. You get two maps right on the disc, which is awesome. They both add some new features like the pulse, and freeze gun, along with all the weapons from the campaign. No MG42 in this one but at least the Ray Gun made the cut. These new weapons are powerful enough though so don't worry about killing those Zombies. Also now when you are playing single player you are allowed to buy Quick Revive to revive yourself with four times. It really helps out those people who only play by themselves. These maps are great and I'm going to put a lot of time into them as I know most of you will. They added just enough to keep it fresh while leaving the spirit of the original levels intact.  If you buy the hardened edition you also get the four original maps with the new weapons and updated graphics. The old maps now seem harder so you better buckle down to get to your old high score.Another great add on is Black Ops Arcade. You fight hoards of zombies from an over the top view. It plays like Commandoes on the NES and is a great extra mode that I'm sure they will develop further with the next map pack. Also \"Zork\" the old text based game is included in full. Assuming you can find it.The multiplayer plays a lot like Modern Warfare 2 but has new ways to get your weapons. When you rank up you don't unlock weapons. You gain the ability to buy them using your XP points. It really makes you think about how you spend your money, or you can bet it all in one match hoping you finish in the top 3. I have never used this betting game mode but I hear it's rather addicting.Call of Duty Black Ops is a great installment especially considering all you get on one disc. The multiplayer is tweaked to add more excitement, the campaign is a conspiracy tale that won't let go, Black Ops Arcade is a great new mini game, and classic zombies is back. Not many games give you this much content on one disc. I'm not usually one who puts Call of Duty in the running for Game of the Year, but this time it's worthy of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}

He was infected with a parasite simply called &quot;X&quot;, which has now infected his space station. Now immune to the virus, and possessing the ability to gain power from the virus, Samus sets out to find the source and eliminate it. The story is classic Metroid, and any avid player will eat it up.The graphics and music are pure SNES gold, with nicely detailed backgrounds, characters, and monsters. As with al 2-D platform games, it is easy to know where you are going, and you rarely get lost. This is a common problem with a lot of 3-D shooters. The same mapping system that has been used in other metroid games (including Metroid Prime) is also used here, with Pink highlighting the rooms you've been in, while the uncharted rooms appear in blue. It saves the player a lot of guess work in terms of knowing which rooms they've been in. The control is also a snap, benefiting from the design of the GBA. The learning curve is overcome on the first play.My one complaint, and perhaps this is not the game's fault, but it can be quite dark at times. Since I have not seen a good light for the GBA, players might have trouble seeing what is happening, often even in direct sunlight. This is not a huge problem, but it can be troublesome at times. This is the same problem that plagues &quot;Castlevania: Circle of the Moon&quot;. Otherwise, I have few complaints with &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;.&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; is a crowning addition to the ever growing library of quality GBA games.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Scarlet","summary":"Experiece One Of The Iconic In The Series","reviewText":"Final Fantasy VIII is a great re-visit for fans of the series or anyone playing it for the first time.

I don't think it should count, since it is a pack-in with the Wii, but whatever. Nintendo hopes to advance it's popularity with a sequel, titled Wii Sports Resort. Wii Sports Resort takes place on Wuhu Island, and to get there you must skydive. I can't mention the games without mentioning the Wii Motion Plus. This adds extra sensors to the remote and makes it very responsive. You must calibrate it each time you put on Wii Sports Resort, but it didn't detract from anything. Let me tell you, this is motion control. It's like you are reaching out and touching the screen. It is terrific.Wii Sports Resort consists of 12 sport mini games, 2 of which return from the original Wii Sports (Bowling and Golf). These sports range from Archery to Basketball to Dueling. They are very fun and require a lot of skill and practice. Here are a few of the sports:1. Frisbee - In Frisbee, you can throw a frisbee to a cute dog, which is very relaxing, or you can hit the golf courses and play some Frolf.2. Canoeing - This is one of the water-based games in Wii Sports Resort. You must move the Wiimote just like an oar, and reach the goal. It is very fun in 2 player.3. Table Tennis - Essentially an update of the original tennis, Table Tennis has you rallying a ball back and forth across a table. This is one of my favorites.4. Archery - Archery is a blast, and just like golf, you have to take into consideration the wind speed, and the distance you are from the target. Very fun.These are just a few of the many sports in Wii Sports Resort. Another fun feature is the Stamp System, where you complete 5 fun challenges for each sport. These range from getting a 300 in Bowling, or sinking every shot in Basketball. This added a lot of replay value.My only complaint is that if you want to play with friends, then you must buy extra Wii Motion Pluses. This was kind of annoying, but they are cheap, and easy to find.Overall, you'll be playing Wii Sports Resort for years to come. It is truly a great Wii gem.Total Score - 10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2009"}

If you played either of the previous titles on PS1 or GBA you will love this game.  If you're new to the series, I still recommend this game to anyone that enjoys turn based strategy rpg.There are many improvements in this game from tactics advance:1. Having dual screens is awesome, so much more information always visible without having to always go into a menu screen.2. More jobs and races to keep you busy hour after hour.3. After a mission is completed, it notifies you of any character that has learned a new skill; its a lot easier to ensure that each member of the clan is always working towards a job/skill.4. More elemental attacks and effects, lots of variety in strategies.5. Much richer display, the game looks great and plays great.The game is not perfect however, I still recommend the game but I wish they hadn't:1. Made so many dumb laws that I don't have control over.  One law prohibits knockback.  But on a critcial hit (which is random) knockback occurs.  Also, the enemy doesn't have to abide by the law which doesn't really make any sense for having a law in the first place.  Since breaking the law has little repercussions that's almost no incentive to abide by the law.  Another law is that I can't end a unit's turn standing next to another unit, another one is I have to move exactly 3 squares...these all are just so dumb.2. The top screen during battle should have more information.  Its great having two screens, the bottom has the battle and the top screen has the character information - but they could have put so much more information on the top screen. An example is when you are selecting your units for battle, they are listed on the top screen (with crappy sprites that look badly pixel-lated) but for each clan member it only shows a picture, a job, and a level.  So...what if I have all Humes that are mostly the same level and mostly the same jobs?  I've got to place that unit then check its name, why?  Why couldn't they just put the name on the top screen, along with the unit's inventory for that matter?  Having the second screen is a big improvement but they really wasted so much potential for the information that could have been put on the screen.3. The computer takes waaaaaaaaaay too long to make decisions.  Ever played Military Madness on the Turbo Grafix 16?  That AI could make decisions faster than this game does.  The battles already take upwards of 20-30 minutes, why couldn't they optimize the decision making of the computer units?  Some battles, all the computer unit is doing is moving and waiting...not even attacking or using abilities.  Yet it still takes a noticeably long time for the computer to make these decisions.  Only a few seconds is not a big deal...unless its dozens of times in a mission, with 300 missions.  It really starts to add up.The cons may appear longer but its just because I'm ranting.  This game is fabulous, especially for fans of the series to see the improvements made.  If you are into turn based strategy I would recommend this game.  Just don't hold your breath for the story, its weak.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2009"}

Once the controls become second nature(and the aches in your shoulders and arms go away) it becomes clear that this title has some of the strongest legs in the replay department that the Wii is currently offering.  The usage of Miis is remarkable(unlike say NBA 08) they look good and can be used in Circuit and Single Event Mode- for record setting and unlocking goodies.  This being basically a multi mini game experience hard wired into the Summer Olympics the events represented are done so in exceedingly fun and accurate representations (Archery and Table Tennis are reasons enough to own this title) When the game does veer from the more realistic events you are offered things like DREAM RACE a Mario Kart style footrace that is loads of fun particularly in multiplayer mode.  The Wii controls are excellent once you read either the manual or the in game control tutorials and after a day or two of practice should become second nature, some remain tricky once learned however and increase in difficulty as you proceed through the circuits.  The gallery offers five minigames with five levels of difficulty with OLYMPIC trivia scattered throughout.I haven't even mentioned the character specific missions which require specific tasks during events.  The controls require real muscle behind them and kids will need some patient adults and the right characters on their side to succeed and enjoy this title to its fullest.  After spending five days with this game I am really impressed by my desire to keep coming back and besting my records and unlocking everything.The only real negatives might be that a ranking system is the only online feature and the slightly non kid friendly controls- also the fact that you NEED the rubberized Wiimote covers currently included with the console just to a get a proper grip on the controller for alot of the events.  If you have a plethora of Miis in your Wii to experiment with as well as a love for the Mario and Sonic worlds you are in for a very fun, VERY PHYSICAL Wii Sports style workout that rewards the gamer around every turn.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2007"}

True, I own an Xbox 360, but I don't hold one console over the others in terms of \"omggottahave.\" However, I am quite fond of the new Xbox 360 controller.  Its design was much better implemented than the original Xbox controller that was HUGE (then just big after the S type) and clunky.  It felt like a block of heavy plastic.  Button spacing was weird and it just felt clumsy.  Now that the Xbox 360 controller is out, I have to say that it is my favorite of the 3D-based controllers out there.  But this isn't a review about the actual hardware as much as it is for the uses for it.In short, it works perfectly for the PC.  I am not a huge PC gamer mostly because I have grown up on the console side.  There are some games that I do really well with the PC (RPGs, MMOs, point and click adventure games, etc.) but there are some that I'm okay with (FPS) and some that I am terrible with (Platforming, third person perspective).  On top of that, I could never find a gamepad made for the PC that I liked as much as the ones for the consoles.  So, when the Xbox 360 controller came out that was compatible with the PC I thought the gaming gods were smiling upon me.Getting it installed takes just a matter of minutes; mostly, your install time involves going to the xbox.com website, downloading the drivers for the controller and then just running that application.  From there, the computer recognizes the controller and when you get into a game, you can easily calibrate the controls.I have used three games with this.  F.E.A.R., Tomb Raider: Legends, and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  Dreamfall didn't recognize the trigger buttons.  The bumpers, the face buttons, the analog controls and the direction pad work perfectly, but the triggers aren't recognized.  F.E.A.R. was a bit tricky, mostly because there are so many buttons that need to be used that it makes using an controller problematic.  Tomb Raider worked wonders and made me happy since I didn't want to shell out $60 for a game I could get for $40 on the PC.Also, gamers should be pleased to note that Ventrilo recognizes the controller and you can use the press-to-talk function with the controller.  It doesn't recognize the triggers, but any other button on the controller is fair game.  Really helps when you're playing a game that Ventrilo helps you with.Overall, it's a great controller.  I will note that you can't use a wireless controller plugged in with the plug and play charger.  You have to use the standard, wired controller.  But for those looking for a good controller to use with the PC, I can't recommend the Xbox 360 controller enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2006"}

This game is just 100% entertainment, The the whole premise of being trapped in a mall with zombies is a idea that has been done in movies but not in a game. You have total freedom going anywhere and everywhere in the mall with dozens of different stores that have items you can use as weapons, the game doesn't take itself seriously when it comes to this idea as you can so pretty funny stuff to zombies and gameplay feels arcady in that sense as you rack up points for taking pictures and killing zombies at the same time. Its a fun game regardless if you like zombies or not but its a challenge as well, the start of the game your character is pretty weak and in general slow but ask anyone who has played this game and they'll tell you dying is part of the game, in the beginning anyway. When you start the game focus on leveling up you character by taking pictures of zombies attacking,survivors and anything that looks important and you'll get a lot of PP which levels up Frank. Then you can focus on beating the game in one playthrough. good luck and enjoy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}

So my greatest fear going into this title was that developers would bow to the unrelenting pressure of today's handheld gamer to provide the option of saving more frequently, adjusting difficulty settings, or otherwise cheapening the brutal, punishing style that made the first game such a classic. This was the single fear of mine that went unexploited by this game. True to the original, this game will beat you without mercy from the minute you venture outside your cell.Keeping this brief, Dark Souls is more punishing, more demanding, more challenging than the original. I beat Demon's Souls thinking, \"this isn't quite as bad as the reviews made it sound.\" However, that is untrue of Dark Souls. What (if any) punches were pulled in the first game are nowhere to be found in this one. If you're squeamish about a challenge, run away. This is one of the most beautiful, horrific experiences you will ever have the privilege of playing through. I once heard the moon described as \"magnificent desolation,\" and can think of no better description for this game as well. It's built for a very specific type of gamer, and unapologetically so. Others will undoubtedly decry it as a frustrating game not worth your time, but this is because they do not have the patience to stick with and truly appreciate magnificence. For them, immediate gratification is the only form, cheap as it may be. This game is near perfection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

The graphics are very detailed; There are some truly crazy battle parts, a nice weapons variety, and some cool vehicle stuff(and I usually hate it when they put those into a FPS).

I delayed purchase of the game after all these horrible reviews, picking it up later on sale.  Where I paid full price for the first two.I get it--the ending doesn't satisfy everyone.  There are plot holes, the \"deus ex machina\" thing at the end, the fact that the outcome is always the same.  I might have expected a little more from Bioware given the execution up to this point.But ONE STAR? The sheer number of one star reviews, plus the blind down voting of positive reviews (and corresponding blind up voting of negative reviews) makes it obvious this is more of a campaign than honest individual reviews--tied to social media campaigns to \"take back mass effect 3.\"I generally get what Mass Effect is about, but definitely wouldn't consider myself a Mass Effect expert, so I didn't get so worked about problems with the ending.  Yeah, it was kind of stupid.  And kind of short.  And left GAPING plot holes.Besides that, though, this is the best Mass Effect yet, and perhaps the best RPG on the 360 to date.  The game-play rivals that of Gears of War--and that's saying a lot about the quality.  Gears is the benchmark for 3rd person shooters, and I couldn't help but be impressed at how close ME3 is to that.  The graphics are better.  The cinematics are better.  The environment is better.  The maps/menus/RPG stuff is better.  EVERYTHING is as good or better than it ever has been in ME.If the ending keeps you from enjoying a finely crafted game for 20+ hours, then by all means:  DON'T BUY THIS GAME.Or if you really really really hate EA.

It's some of the highest quality work in the gaming industry I have ever seen. I wasn't happy with the ending either, but it by no means ruined the entire 100 hour Mass Effect Trilogy. Also, Bioware are actively listening to your \"Feedback\" (whining) and are going to adjust the game to satisfy everyone... so shut up, will you?Okay, now that that's over with: Mass Effect 3 is the best game in the series. The gameplay has been refined to incorporate the best elements of the first two games while adding some new twists that really improve the experience. Biotics feel more powerful, weapons more responsive, and upgrades are more rewarding. The graphics are noticeably improved. Facial animations are much more realistic. The storytelling is flawless throughout. It no longer feels like Paragon/Renegade choices and more like two (or more) right answers that have a downside. You'll be scratching your brain and trembling with fear as you decide what to do.Look, it's a good game.

For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon.

We heard a lot about it. Now the game is out, every bit that was promised is delivered. My most favorite parts in the game are the co-op missions. It is so much fun to play with buddies split-screen, the game levels are randomly generated. The experience is never the same any time you play back the levels.Co-op missions are class based. Dont try to run around and get killed. You need to be organized and push inch by inch. Every one has a role to play and all of them are fun. You can play with upto 8 people online. The game completely suits itself for the number of people playing at a time. I like it when there is a minimum of 4 people, with a good medic. It is so satisfying and epic.They have also pushed the competitive bar to 60 players. It gets really crazy at the last min when every one converges to the center. It has a similar feel to UT3 warfare mode. If you are tired of the vanilla kill count based games, R2 is the decisive answer.We are going to be talking about R2 for a long long time to come. This has set the bar for multi-player. We are going to see a lot copy cats too. The engine has been revamped a lot from R1. The game never slows down with all the explosions and 60 people running around. It is a amazing technological achievement.  Even PC games couldn't do what R2 has done on a console. Competitive levels are much more methodical than run and gun. It takes a few shots before the person dies. So you can always move away and find a better flanking position.Competitive multiplayer levels are very well balanced. It is not winner takes all. If you play well you become a bigger bulls eye in the map. So every one has a chance. It also increases the challenge for higher skill palyers. It is a win-win. Very well thought out maps. Take your time and play slowly. It is a very enjoyable game. If you are looking for a simple  bunny hop and shoot multi-player; you are in for disappointment.The game is slightly different from R1. No more weapons wheel. You can just carry two weapons at a time. You also get a Uncharted style fully recovering health. Some of old weapons are tweaked to make it more interesting to use. Art direction also has changed. Now visuals have a pop. Forest is no more the post apocalyptic gray burnt one.. it is a green lush forest. Every thing feels fresh and natural.Resistance 2 is in direct competition with LBP for its massiveness. I don't think there is any other games that packs so much content in a single disk. I have a strong feeling Insomniac filled up the entire Blu-ray disc.Single player mode much more narrated. The game walks you through a very cinematic presentation. The games takes control of the camera to several times to show all the glorious backgrounds and set pieces. Boss battles are huge. Some of the levels are just one single big boss battle. You are just circling around slowly taking the health of the big behemoths.So far I have killed more than 1000 enemies in single player. The game sincerely makes you feel helpless. AI is stunningly smart. My winning formula is survey, find a safe position, move & fortify, then survey again. Run and gun doesn't seem to work. I was able to be finish R1 without thinking this much.Audio in this game is amazing. This time it feels lot more like Hollywood. Weapons pack a punch. If you have a 7.1, close all the doors and crank up the volume. You will be in the edge of the chair through out the entire mission.The franchise has solidified its base now. Iam very eager to see what they have under their cloak for R3. I would love to see the weapons wheel back in R3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2008"}

C'mon.","reviewText":"This review is just my opinion of particular aspects of this game, mostly the offline co-op, or lack-there-of. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Please don't get mad at me.I loved the first Resistance. Great story and solid game-play. The big seller for me was that you could play the full story co-op split screen with a friend, offline. Plus the online was fun as well.I bought Resistance 2 hoping for basicly the same co-op story mode. Sadly, I was let down. I bought it so my girlfriend and I could play it together; story split screen co-op. Resistance 2 does NOT offer the FULL game in co-op split screen. Only the single player story mode. Everything else is online or a few offline, quite low quality split screen levels.Dispite the fact that you can't play the full game split screen with a friend, the single player game is amazing. The graphics are a huge step up from the first one and the game-play is perfect and very fun. I was also astounded by the amazing DTS quality sound.I bought the game for the Co-op split screen story game, and nothing else. So yeah, I'm pretty ticked off. But the single player game is good so far. Between the great graphics and perfect sound, you are in store for quite an intense game. If you liked the first one, this is worth buying without a doubt.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2008"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"THE GILZ","summary":"great game","reviewText":"this is a nice secuell of the first game very improved and explains a lot more of the mistery, if you love get scared when you are playing don't think twice in buying this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003171CEW","reviewerName":"C. Leonard","summary":"Not the worst game out there","reviewText":"I deleted my last review to give this game another shot.Pitching:  It's decent overall.  However, there will be points in the game where you'll want it low and he'll pitch it high, you'll want it outside and he'll pitch inside.  You'll want it low and in, and he'll plunk the batter.  You'll want it outside and low, and he'll throw it down the middle.  I would say only about 50% of your pitches will end up in the general quadrant of where you wanted it to go, 40% will be in a different quadrant, and the last 10% will be right where you wanted it to go.  This ends up costing you in the end, because you will rarely have a good sense of where the strike zone is going to be called, because your pitcher wont locate it.  I have even tested this pitching system with max stats on the pitcher and you still have issues in which the pitcher will miss horribly.  But if you look the overall stats, you will still fall within MLB standards.  Which I suppose is to create realism in a \"Video Game.\"Batting:  Mechanics of batting are what you would expect them to be in real life.  Timing, patience, pitch type, the pitcher, and hot/cold streaks play into your success/failure at the plate.Umpires:  Inoconsistent.  Strikes for the computer aren't called the same for you.  You can keep track of it yourself if you want to, by using the strike zone rectangle.  It makes it obvious when when the umpire calls two balls in a row that were over the white part of the plate and above the knees.  It's not about figuring out where their strike zone is, it's about them not keeping consistent.  It's hard to gauge where it is when it changes every inning.Fielding:  You can go a whole game without an error.  But the collision detection is off.  Such as being in the line in which the ball is travelling, and have the ball go past your fielder (with no reaction at all from your player).  I have the controls set for x being home, square being third, triangle being 2nd, and circle being 1st.  I would press square and he throws it to 1st, I would press triangle and he throws it to home.  If it is just the mechanics of the game then the people who created this game are idiots for making the buttons throw it to multiple bases, especially when you have 8 buttons to work with.Graphics:  Great graphics, probably the best I've seen as far as sports games.  The crowd, however, is still monotonous.Commentators:  The color commentator is annoying.  They need to reduce his role, and bring the other guy into the game more.  I don't need to know that I swung at a ball out of the zone, of which was within the strike zone.  \"It's alright to take a pitch every now and again!\"  \"It's really bad when you take a first pitch strike.\"Overall this game is entertaining, but I can't give it more than three stars because there is no human factor when playing against the computer.  It knows where the ball is going, so most of the time when you try to trick them into swinging at an 0-2 slider outside, they will just watch it go by.  Another reason is the pitching.  So sue me if I want my pitcher to at least throw the ball in the general direction of where I want it to.  The computer can gain momentum in the blink of an eye, but it takes you considerably longer to do so.  And usually, the computer will end up just picking you off to ice it.  If I were someone that was just looking for a baseball video game to play, I would skip this one or at least wait til they reduce the price.  This is the first game I've bought for the PS3 that I regret buying.  And I've played UFC Undisputed........","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

The story is so good and the characters are so well done. I love all the dialogue that you can share with every interaction. Another great addition to the conversation system is the ability to take certain actions by pulling one of the trigger buttons during dialogue. It really made you feel much more involved in the actual interaction with people because some times you just want to punch some idiot in the face for going on too long.The combat systems is hugely improved. One of my only complaints with the original is that you could only map out one biotic/tech power to a quick use button. In this one you can map out up to 5. 3 for yourself and 1 for each companion you have out with you. The only thing I didn't like in this game's combat system is a switch over to ammunition as apposed to the first games overheat system. It felt out of place at first but quickly became natural.Cinematics and graphics in this game are beautiful and really draw you into the story. There are several points in the game where the cinematics got me cheering at my T.V. because of just how awesome the things going on on screen were.Also another huge improvement from the original was the level design for side quests. Every side quest has a well put together world with a mission on it that involves more than just driving around until you find a building to enter.Mass Effect 2 is a very very good game that I would recommend to anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2010"}

It was such a fun game with amazing graphics (for the time it was released in that is), amazing 3D play, different worlds to choose from with over 100 stars to collect, etc. It was HOURS of fun and I honestly never thought they would ever make a Mario game like this one again. This saddened me, for I truly did want to play a sequel to SM64.Until about a week ago, I won this game off of ebay for a fraction of Amazon's price (I prefer to write my reviews on Amazon over ebay ... don't ask why lol). I was so happy I got this because it arrived in the mail yesterday and so far I have played all day yesterday and all day today. It truly is an amazing game and reminds me of SM64. Mario still has most of the same movements as he did in 64 (back flip, triple jump, etc) so it feels like a sequel in a sense. It's as if my childhood was brought back to me at the age of 21. It truly does put a smile on my face =)Now, let's go further into detail with this game: You use the nunchuck and wii remote to play this game. Some people have complained, saying they want the option to use the classic wii controller, but in all honesty I am not at all bothered by this. To me the nunchuck with the wii remote is exactly like any regular old controller, just that it allows you to separate your left hand from your right hand. Plus, Nintendo didn't have much of a choice to begin with because the controls in this game involve aiming your wii remote at the screen in some parts to collect star bits (helpful little items that allow you to pay for things or stun enemies), turn into a bubble and float around in the galaxies, steer yourself on top of a rolling ball or sting ray that's in the water, etc. So to those wishing they had the classic controller, there are just far too many controls in this game for Nintendo to have done this with just a normal controller.Now, going even further into detail: The object of this game is to go from galaxy to galaxy, collecting as many stars as you can, again similar to SM64. Some stars are extremely easy in my book, but others are definitely more challenging and require several tries before you manage to get the star. Even on the stars that are overly easy, it is still a ton of fun to play. I enjoy in certain galaxies where I can jump anywhere I want and I can never fall off! After all, it is SMG so we know gravity is meant to pull you down in this game to prevent you from falling (so long as no black holes are around to suck you in that is ... those you have to watch out for). I also enjoy the newer power ups in this game such as having Mario turn into a bee where he has the ability to fly and stick to the bee hive, or Boo Mario who can turn invisible and slip through solid bars and float to higher places, or ice mario where he can freeze water and walk on it. I haven't beaten the game yet, so I do not know all of the power ups, but I love the power ups I'm seeing so far!I do have ONE complaint about this game though that I also had with SM64. That is the camera angles. At times I have died in this game as a result of poor camera angles. I'd have times where I was unable to see where I was going and then suddenly run into an enemy or something. Sure, you have the ability to adjust the camera angles on your own, but even when I do this I'd still have a bit of trouble or I wouldn't be fast enough because something decided to come attack me. Despite this one flaw, I still feel the game deserves a 5 star rating. It is that good!Overall, if you were a fan of Super Mario 64 then you will love this game. I highly recommend this game to any Mario fans =)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2011"}

Unfortunately the controls are still just as chaotic and you still find yourself going the wrong way and commiting suicide because the controls can be hard to use.  When the game works right it is a beautiful sight to see though.  On top of the sheer size, the story is quite enjoyable and historically accurate.  Black Flag still has all the same great humor and in depth descriptions of everything you encounter from fauna to people.  The new crafting system is fun and for those that don't want to craft they can just shop in stores for the required items.  At its core this is still just a game about exploring.

The only game that could surpass Silent Hill in the disturbing arena is Silicon Knight's forth comming Eternal Darkness.Silent Hill 2 addresses the complaints I had about the first one, the option to have a point and go there control style is there. So I just go, no pivoting! The problem is that the camera was not designed for this control method, and so it has a few quirks. Nothing too drastically bad, but it really needed work. It's sadly not as disturbing as the first one though, it seems that Konami has bent to the will of irresponsible parents blamming games for thier kid's problems and toned the game down dramatically from what it was. Over all though the game is still a good renter.The reason I recomend renting this is because there is a director's cut in the works for XBox that is comming out soon. It will have much more material than this one, and while I hate it when people do director's cuts it's nice that Konami announced that they were going to do this in time enough to stop me from buying the PS2 version.

{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"ITBeast \"ITBeast\"","summary":"Will the Real Batman and Joker Please Stand-Up!","reviewText":"This review is for the Batman Arhkam Asylum: Game of the Year Edition for the PS3.When this game originally came out in 2009 (Being a Big Fan of The Comic Book since the 1980's) I had originally planned to get this game on the PC Platform but waited for the price to come down. Then about 7 months ago my son acquired a launch 60GB PS3 from his friends for Christmas (which I quickly upgraded the drive to a 500GB hard drive) and I got hooked on that gaming system. So after purchasing my own PS3 (The 320GB Slim, inferior to the PS3 Launch Model but still does the job) a month later I purchased this game from a competitor for the PS3 instead. However, I did not actually play it until just over a week ago (Got stuck on Playing the Uncharted Franchise, COD: Modern Warfare Franchise, RAGE, and so forth) which in hindsight I regret not playing sooner. All I can say is that this game is the closet you will experience in actually getting to the \"Real Dark Knight\" Experience originally written by Bob Kane & Bill Finger and later more closely emphasized by Frank Miller's version of the Dark Knight.Plot: The Game's Cut scene starts off with Batman (Voiced by Veteran Batman Voice Actor Kevin Conroy from the 1990 Batman Animated TV Series Circa to Present) transporting a recently recaptured Joker (Voiced by Veteran Joker Voice Actor Mark Hamil AKA Luke Skywalker from Star Wars fame, also from the 1990 Batman Animated TV Series Circa to Present) back to Arhkam Asylum in the Batmobile (The Batmobile from the \"Tim Burton\" Batman Movie Franchise) after once again escaping Arhkam and trying to take the Mayor Hostage. As Batman turns over the Joker to the Arhkam staff, Batman feels skeptical about the \"Ease\" of the Jokers capture and accompanies the Arhkam staff (who agrees somewhat reluctantly) into the Asylum's \"Intensive\" Treatment Ward as the Arhkam staff \"re-process\" Joker back into the Asylum. Near the end of the \"re-processing\" the Arhkam Security start to escort the Joker back to a cell (Batman tried to follow him but the guard stopped him so he would not \"agitate\" the other inmates), As the Guard and the Arhkam Orderly pass the first security checkpoint Joker trips and falls then subdues the guard and orderly after faking his \"injury\" while being assisted by his twisted Assistant and Psychotic Girlfriend Harley Quinn (Voiced by Arleen Sorkin also from the 1990 Batman Animated TV Series Circa to just recently) who has taken control of Arhkam's main security center and allows Joker to escape using alternate Security Doors. At this point Batman reaches the area of Jokers escape to late and must find a way of re-capturing Joker and anybody else that has been set loose by Harley Quinn before it is too late.Gameplay: The Majority of this game is in the 3rd person aspect with only in the First Person Aspect when Batman is crawling through Arhkam's Air Ventilator shafts (There is one small part where Batman is in the Full First Person Aspect but this is near the end of the Campaign and is only for about 15 seconds). For the Most part Batman will Fight, Problem Solve, and be challenged throughout the Island of Arhkam Asylum. You will be able to upgrade not only your own abilities (Fight Combo, Armor, Weapons) but also get additional items throughout the game (Multiple Batarangs, explosive gel, Zip Line Gun and more). In line with the \"Infamous\" Franchise Arhkam Ayslum is pretty much a Open Ended Sandbox game (At least as far as being \"confined\" to explore the Arhkam Estate) that allows you to continue to complete the \"Side Missions\" after the end of the Main Campaign, you can also do this during the actual Campaign as well while in between \"objectives\".Plus Side of the Game:- I love the \"Free-Flow\" combat system of the game to where you can earn extra point by consecutively keep knocking out henchman.- The graphics are just astonishing, makes you feel like you're actually in a Batman Comic.- Superb Job on the Voice Acting, Mark Hamil is definitely the Heath Ledger Voice Actor version of the Joker and Arleen Sorkin's Brooklyn accent is just hilarious as Harley Quinn.- The problem solving is not hard and not to easy which makes it fun to do (You also need to do it to completely finish the game at 100%)- Great Story by Veteran writer Paul Dini who did a good job about getting a good handful of Batman's Classic Rogue Gallery other than Joker like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, The Riddler (In Voice Only), Scarecrow, and of course Bane.Negative Side of the Game:- While the game itself did not have any real \"negative\" aspects in it does have one annoyance and that the controls do not always perform like they should, but nothing I would deduct a star from.DLC (Downloadable Content): The game of the year edition features exclusive DLC from the PS3 PSN Store (There not included on the Disc like the GOTY Edition of Arkham City) like the Joker Challenge where you actually play as the Joker in both the Fighting and Predator Challenges (Available only on the PS3), Batman and Joker themed Wallpaper, along with additional challenges and Maps that are completely free (Again they are available for free via the PSN Store). There are 2 Predator Maps however that are unfortunately $3.49 a piece at this time, which is not bad but would also like to see dropped as well in the near future.3D: As far as the 3D goes I am unable to comment on this since I prefer to play the game only in 2D, Just call me old fashioned but I feel the 3D would \"ruin\" the experience for me. Also FYI, The 3D Glasses DOES NOT COME WITH THIS EDITION OF THE GAME (The Red Box of GOTY). You will have to go to the Trioviz web site at www(dot)Trioviz(dot)com to order the 3D glasses (Or just do a google search for the Trioviz website).Overall: This is by far the best comic book themed Video Game I have played to date (This includes The X-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged Edition and the Infamous Franchise). I love this game so much I have gone ahead and ordered theBatman: Arkham City (Game of the Year Edition)already from Amazon, which from I heard only gets better. If you have not picked it up there is no reason to wait, for approximately $17 you can take this home today and live the saga of the Dark Knight.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2012"}

When the PS3 \"Super Slim\" was announced, I had mixed feelings about its design. It's definitely smaller and sleeker than the PS3 Phat and Slim, but the disc loading system seemed a bit cheap to me, and not a fan of those grooves on top either. Looks aside, this PS3 performs just like its older brothers while using less power. Because there is less material between the disc and the shell of your console, you can hear the disc drive spinning louder than other PS3 versions, but you would only notice it if you were playing with no sound. In the end, if you are in the market for a PS3 than this is definitely the best, most efficient version to get, but if you already have an older model it really isn't worth upgrading because it adds no new features.Good-500gb HDD-replaceable HDD (2.5\" HDD bay)-50% smaller than the original PS3-25% smaller than the PS3 slim-comes with Unchartered-uses less power than older versions-performance is on par with previous models-good build qualityBad-12gb flash version is not available in the U.S.-cheap disc loading system-glossy parts of the console are easy to scratch-noisy disc spinning compared to previous versions-no stand included-no hdmi cable included-only 2 USB slots-no PS2 compatibility-no price drop-no increase in performance from previous modelsRemember when the redesigned PSOne and PSTwo came out? Those were awesome because they were both significantly smaller than their respective versions, and the build quality was top notch. I wouldn't be surprised if Sony redesigned the PS3 again as an \"Ultra Slim.\" That would put a proper end to the PS3 era.*The OEM HDD in this PS3 is actually smaller than your typical 2.5\" HDD, it's the drive you find in some Ultrabooks.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Cinematic indulgence at its finest","reviewText":"Trailers and screenshots come up which send fans into a frenzy about the next installment in the long-running and successful Metal Gear Solid franchise. With new hardware, more ambitious storyline and gameplay changes, many heavily hyped up the next chapter in the series. However, the game in the end became known as being graphically beautiful but ridiculous in its plotline and over-the-top to the extreme. That game was \"Sons of Liberty\", the second game in the series released for the Playstation 2. Its sequel/prequel \"Snake Eater\" improved some of the storyline indulgences and introduced some key gameplay ideas and it ended up being my favorite of the 3 on the Playstation systems. How does the fourth, \"Guns of the Patriots\" fare? Well it repeats many of the blunders the second one did but it's even more epic and ambitious than any of them so go figure.Story: Taking place a few years after the Plant Incident of \"Sons of Liberty\", we find Snake has been aging rapidly thanks to some unknown problem. He's been hunting for Liquid, now completely taking control of Revolver Ocelot's body. With military companies at his disposal and new and powerful threats, Snake has to join up with old friends in order to finally take down Liquid and the control over the group known as the \"Patriots\".To spoil any more than that would cause a great disservice since, by completely avoiding plot spoilers and explanations, the storyline's many changes and twists were all the more shocking and thrilling. Similar to the second game, the trailers and screenshots showing the Middle East is just tip of the iceberg as there is way more locales and things to do where you'll go around the world to track down and stop Liquid. While there's moments are thrilling, it's the inbetween that will make one recall the chattiness of \"Sons of Liberty\" and you'll literally at times put down your controller and not pick it up for at least 20 minutes to half an hour. While anyone who's played any of the previous games aren't in for a surprise that way, be warned this game is quite lengthy in its storyline and just as ambitious/excessive as before.Graphics: \"Guns of the Patriots\" was one of the first games that I played on the Playstation 3 hooked up to an HDTV and even running at 720p, I have to say this game is absolutely gorgeous. From remarkably detailed character animation to the direction of the cutscenes, anyone hooked up to a high end set will be in for a real treat. And it's no longer burdened by jungles or industrial plants in its locales and many look quite stunning. The in-game graphics look just as well as they're more polished and beefed up though if you've played Snake Eater, imagine a more enhanced look of that.Sound/Music: It's often been said that the MGS series has always been in line with Hollywood blockbusters so of course we get Harry Gregson-Williams to provide the score, who did scores Spy Kids, Shrek 2, Team America: World Police and Kingdom of Heaven. With heavy orchestral numbers and big bombast in its sound, anyone with their machine hooked up to a stereo will be in for a good one. And of course we have the voice acting which continues its top form (though Otacon's whining is still grating) and the frequent voiceovers and even ingame flashback clips are quite welcome.Gameplay: This is that part where I say MGS has always been more watched than played most of the time. The gameplay is relatively unchanged from the rations to the weapons to CQC so it's quite easy to just go and play. Introduced though is the Drebin Store where the character you meet in the game provides your own weapon and ammo purchases where they can be customized or restocked with ammo. While some feel this makes the game easier, it works well when you're taking on a big beast (such as the Metal Gear offshoots \"Gekko\") and have to get more missiles for your launcher. But it sucks you can't purchase noodles or rations and when you're in the middle of a big boss fight and you haven't come across any health items in awhile, it gets a bit annoying. Similar to the camouflage in \"Snake Eater\", Snake this time has what's called the OctoCamo which basically acts as a chameleon-like suit that mimics the pattern of whatever you press up against or lie down on. It's a lot more handy than changing your suit in the menu and isn't quite as burdensome. There's many more gameplay changes from just controlling Old Snake in its familiar form though I'll leave that to you to uncover.One thing I always never liked about the series is the times when playing borders on frustration and you're sent a trip to the Continue screen because of some little mistake you didn't even think would get you caught. A couple of other times I'd get very annoyed since I knew what to do but actually pulling it off was a thing in of itself. The storyline and presentation are certainly high-caliber but the gameplay can get seriously patience-trying.With many, many secrets to unlock from FaceCamo to dolls to iPod songs to emblems, MGS will keep many a fan busy who are into 100% completion. While I still find Snake Eater my favorite, Guns of the Patriots is certainly one of the best games available for the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Dark Movie with Interactive Action Sequences","reviewText":"Max Payne 3 offers the kind of sarcasm that can only come from a drunken killing machine who's addicted to depressants.  Although the game is heavy on story and repetitive on action, it still manages to be entertaining, but the amount of cutscenes and lack of boss battles will alienate a lot of people.Story:  8/10The story is well told and well acted through a plethora of cutscenes that span more than a decade of Max Payne's life.  The story is engaging, very grim, darkly humorous, and compelling.  But the sheer amount of breaks in the action for unskippable cutscenes really make you feel like you're watching a movie rather than playing a game.  If you just want to jump into a level and kill bad guys, you're going to need a lot of patience.  The story is also disturbing and many people may not have the stomach for it.Gameplay:  8/10It's a shooting gallery with a lot of features to polish the gameplay.  Max primarily guns down low life bad guys with guns.  He can do this from behind cover or in bullet time, where it's much easier to take out the bad guys with a clean headshot.  From cover, Max can duck and shoot, blind fire, and quickly move to other cover.  A few shots to the body will down most enemies, a lot more shots to the body will down bad guys in body armor, and a head shot takes care of just about everything.  Max can also enter his trademarked bullet time mode, which slows the action and allows the Player to take aim and quickly dispatch enemies.  Max can also initiate bullet time from a diving roll, where he jumps into the air, time slows, and he guns everyone down.  There's an assortment of weapons from hand guns, dual wielding, sub machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, and the occasional explosives.  The AI is pretty good and will duck and shoot and occasionally charge and flank.  One nice feature deals with Max's Pain Killers.  If your health reaches zero and you have some in your inventory, you get a chance to save yourself.  Max falls to his back and if you can kill the guy who is shooting you in a few seconds, you recover.  If you cannot shoot him, you die.  Unfortunately, sometimes, due to camera or animation issues, it is impossible to shoot the guy in time.Sound:  8/10The voice acting is great and a large portion of the story takes place in Brazil.  Many of the actors were recorded in Brazil, so it's authentic.  The soundtrack is moody and grim, which fits the tone of the game.  There are also some action tracks to highlight the action.Replay Value:  5/10The campaign has 4 difficulty levels, but it is so deliberately paced, I can't imagine anyone wanting to play the 12 hour campaign more than once.  There is a level select, so you can go back and get achievements.  There is also an arcade mode with a very complex scoring system which rewards risk taking, aggression, and defense.  You can compete on leaderboards for bragging rights.  Max Payne also has Multiplayer with a character advancement system.Maturity: M+This is for adults.  The game features porn, drugs, gore, very disturbing scenes, glorified violence, language, and a bleak outlook on life.  Having a kid play this is a very bad idea... unless he's already in Juvie... then he will like it.Overall:  8/10At times it feels like you brought an airsoft gun to the movies to watch some Hollywood Blockbuster and you're firing at the screen during the action scenes.  Despite the grim atmosphere, the ton of cutscenes, and the repetitive gameplay, Max Payne 3 is still a memorable experience.  It's fun and it will have you cringing and laughing at some of Max's one liners.  For the price, it's worth playing.Buy this game if you like really dark stories like Breaking Bad, Sin City, Oldboy, or Dexter.Buy this game if you like the series and the shooting mechanics of the other games.Rent this game if you have 10-14 hours to finish the campaign.Avoid this game if you don't like really dark games or stories.Avoid this game if you need a variety of gameplay.Avoid this game if you need skippable cutscenes.If you liked Max Payne 3 for its gunplay but want a more open ended experience, you should definitely play Red Dead Redemption or Far Cry 3.If you liked Max Payne 3 for its adult themes, check out the Darkness 2 or GTA.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

While I'll be the first to admit that the N64 never really did well enough in my book I adamantly refute the naysayers who refuse to acknowledge GameCube's greatness. The fact of the matter is that the hardware is almost as powerful as the XBox, and even has a texture capacity advantage. Characters tend to look more realistic, while XBox looks cartoonier, but that's okay! I like XBox too, now.Nintendo had a huge amount of great games during its 2002 run, Resident Evil, Eternal Darkness, Star Fox Adventures, Mario Sunshine, and even its first online game, Phantasy Star Online.I have now 14 GameCube Games, compared to 8 Playstation 2 games and 7 Xbox games. Being that I place my scores on the amount of games I end up buying for any given system during that year that puts GameCube in the number one spot. I bought 7 XBox games this year, and only one PS2 game.I have a track sheet I've made. If I have the money by the end of 2003 I should have 35 GameCube game, 29 Xbox games, and 21 PS 2 games. The bad news is that for both GameCube and PS 2 many of those titles are already released games that I have yet to get, and am planning to get used. Nintendo has not announced very many first party titles (the reason you buy Nintendo is for first and second party games) and with the absence of Rare (now owned by Microsoft) I wonder if Nintendo will be able to keep up this momentum, especially since XBox has a ton of stuff coming out this year that is much higher in my priorities. It is possible that Xbox may end up over taking GameCube in my personal collection, something I didn't think was possible six months ago, but they are only five games behind in my \"games to buy list\", but as soon as Rare starts cranking out their new Xbox stuff that may change very quickly.I recommend buying both an XBox and a GameCube. The games of these systems are so good that if you don't have them both you'll be missing out on a great deal. The only system I can do without right now is PS2, and that is because most of the noteworthy PS2 games are also available on the other two systems. If you haven't gotten a GameCube yet go get one, along side Eternal Darkness, Metroid Prime, and both of the Resident Evils. Those games alone should be enough to justify the purchase, not to mention the ton of other really good games that are also available for this small but amazing, and highly under rated console.The only weakness the system has is its lack of an online plan. Only one game features online support so far, which is disappointing. But even without much online content the GCN is still well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2003"}

So despite playing through the entire game, I only earned 16% of the trophies, which is unfair. I've said it before and I'll say it again, online play should not could toward Platinums. Motorstorm Apocalypse doesn't rectify this, but the repetitive gameplay is corrected with a new 'story mode' and an overall superior presentation. The loss of a customizable soundtrack is a bit of a bummer though.California has been destroyed by The Big One. Cities are in ruins and the decent citizens have fled, leaving everything behind. The Motorstormers have taken the city and turned it into a giant, crumbling arena filled with instant, very violent death. I'm not going to lie, there are several moments in this game where you'll leap right out of your chair as buildings crumble around you, the ground cracks open with new fissures and chasms, and bridges collapse as you fire across them. I hope your lung capacity is good because you'll be holding your breath a lot, and sweating through your shirt. Very exciting stuff indeed.It scores better than Pacific Rift, but still disappoints with the now dead online play mode.

{"product_name":"B004H0J5S2","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Wiles Parker","summary":"Needs Work, but Overall Not Bad","reviewText":"The premise of the game, you are a knight Templar in search of the holy grail, is decent.  That the creators found a way to incorporate a female character into what is a very male-centric universe is a nice touch.  But, the gameplay is tremendously repetitive and amounts mostly to button mashing in a lot of situation.  The story itself certainly needs work along with the graphics.  Cut scenes are always incredibly awkward as the characters have no real movement to speak of and give the game a late nineties, early 2000s feel.  However, that said, the game package overall is kind of fun as long as you are not looking for something too deep or overly involved in terms of character control.  You'll spend a lot of time using the same two or three buttons when attacking and blocking, which is mostly what you do in this game.  The voice talent is probably the best part of the game despite the cheesiness of the dialogue at times.  It's too bad the game creators did not spend more time making the world more free roaming or fleshing out the graphics as that would have really set The First Templar apart instead of making it a middling sort of experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2012"}

However, I heard many great things about God of War.  So I tried it out, and yes, it's pretty darn good.First off, it's really a hack and slash game, but with easy to use combos and blocking techniques, with a slight mixture of platforming.  It's extremely polished and well done.  The enemies are smarter than average, well animated, and overall pretty well made.  The scenery and playing atmosphere is near the top of all console games ever made, with ICO and Prince of Persia barely surpassing it.  The action is also good solid fun.The backgrounds and levels vary tremendously, and they all look and feel spectacular.  You have ships, Hades, deserts, Athens, and more.  Since I'm not that fond of fighting games, I stuck with easy mode.  With that, the fights were really easy, but that's all right with me.  The puzzle, though only a few, are good too, sometimes slightly annoying, but all in all pretty fun and harmless.  Usually the puzzle consists of moving a rock here or there to open a door or something like that.  The platform elements are not really up to par with the rest of the game, but it doesn't detract too much.The fighting elements are really what stand out.  Mostly, it's the graphics and animations that do it.  The fighting itself is pretty fun as well.  Their are quite a few weapons to use and magic spells to cast, and each can be upgraded and each work well in certain situations.  The action is smooth, fast paced, and at times crazy.  Sometimes it's a little too crazy.The game flows well.  The cutscenes are hollywood caliber and are captivating.  The constant regeneration points and save points allow the game to continue with very little repetition, meaning that the 15 hours of gameplay is a true 15 hours of gameplay.  It's also pretty well balanced.  The latter third of the game gets a bit tough, but not exponentially hard like other games like this.The main problem I had was that it was just a little too repetitive.  There are only so many times one can defeat the same enemy before being bored to death.  If I was on a harder difficulty, I can see frustration brewing because of wave after wave coming, to only die at the last wave.All in all, it's a great game for it's genre, and I would recommend it to all.Pros:PolishedGreat GraphicsGreat cutscenesAction packedCons:Static cameraRepetitveTime to complete: 15 hoursDifficulty level (on easy): EasyFrustration level (on easy): Low/Medium","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2005"}

I liked the 3D format for this game, but it really looked like the developers spent a lot of time and effort on the 3D and hence, sculpting worlds that really showcased the technology.  Not a bad thing really!  You bought a 3DS because you wanted some flashy 3D right?  The only drawback is that this game plays like a meshing of Super Mario 64 (my favorite Mario game of all time), Super Mario World, and Super Mario Brothers 1 and 3.  Not a bad mix, but it seems that the depth is what I find lacking.You get 8 worlds (at first) with 4 stages in each.  So like the old school NES games you have 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and so on.  Plus a castle.  Plus a few bonus stages (that are usually Toad Houses, or mini games).  So you have 40 stages initially.  Not bad.  But then you can replay the 'Special Worlds', which sound really cool (like Super Mario World's Star World), but they are just tougher versions of the original 8.  You can play the special worlds out of order as well, but not the original 8.The game does play like Super Mario 64 except that the stages are more linear and there is a timer.  I would have enjoyed a more open style of game much more like Super Mario 64 of Super Mario Galaxy, and had Nintendo stick with the old school format for New Super Mario Brothers.  That's where I get conflicted of course.The gameplay is sometimes a bit wonky.  Controls can sometimes be sluggish or sticky, the characters do seem to have a bit more forward momentum so that you end up sliding into chasms pretty often.  And with the view point mostly stationary (you can switch views slightly with the touch pad) you don't really get the 'big picture' feel.  The camera basically points you in the direction you need to go.The challenge is medium, even in the later stages, but often the game can either be cake walk easy or frustratingly difficult.  Once you get the hang of things though, it becomes very easy.  The main challenge is in collecting all of the Star coins.  But as a completist, I liked getting more extras such as the myriad extras to collect in Super Mario World 2, or collecting all of the stars in SM64 or even unlocking all of the extras in both New Super Mario games.So my bottom line?  Buy it! As a youth, I cut my video game teeth on the original Super Mario Brothers game, so it is with open arms I welcome this great, retro style action game.  I look forward to a more 'adventure' style Super Mario title with more in common with Mario 64 and Mario Galaxy.  Fingers crossed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2012"}

But these are very nitpicky things. The game itself is so undeniably good that you won't be bothered by either of these facts while playing.I was warned that the controls were a bit tricky to get down, but could find no evidence of that here. The setup is very basic if you've played any shooter from the current generation. Mastering certain aspects, however (such as executing a thrust burst after your double jump), require a mild amount of practice. In this regard, the controls remind me of most 3D Mario games (the ONLY way these games are alike); the basics are immediately intuitive, but the more complex moves come with time and never cease to make you feel like a gaming badass when you get them down to an art.This is one of the best third person shooters currently available on the PS3.

I personally enjoyed I Ran(So Far Away) by A Flock of Seagulls and Radar Love and my buddies got a kick out of Turning Japanese.  However, that is where the fun ends.  I bought it three hours ago and already I earned everything.  As an encore I'm not surprised that Red Octane changed very little of the gameplay from Guitar Hero II but it seems as though they left out all the good stuff.You can only purchase one additional character (Grim Reaper) so the other bonus characters are gone.  This is sad as several of my buddies played exclusively as certain bonus characters.  They also took out the bonus track section severely limiting songs.  Red Octane barely edited the loading screen advice leaving most of the advice from Guitar Hero II on there.On a few plus sides, I'm glad they kept co-op mode and many of the bonus guitars.  I also wish they would've chosen better songs from certain groups (I think We're Not Gonna Take It would've been a better choice by Twisted Sister) but this is a criticism I have of the other Guitar Hero games.Overall, I'm glad I waited in line to purchase Rock the 80s as I loved playing songs from my childhood but this could've been done a lot better with better bonus materials and less Guitar Hero II look-a-like but I should have expected as much when I saw \"encore\" under the title.

If you're just looking to see how good the graphics are on the XBox 360, at lesat rent this game. It's quite impressive!!You choose from a number of real cars. There are Ferraris, Jaguars, Aston Martins, Lamborghinis, McLarens and much more. The cars look AMAZINGLY good with full detail, and you can choose the color as well.You race your car through a number of circuits around some quite recognizeable towns. You end up in London, Las Vegas, New York City, Tokyo and Nurburgring. Each location is full of detail. When you drive down the river Thames in London you pass Big Ben. Vegas has gorgeous hotels that I remember from my visits there.Doing fun stunts earns you Kudos points, so not only are you aiming to win your races to earn cash, but you also want to rack up Kudos points. That makes even the easier races fun, as you do spins, slides and much more.The world you're in is quite interactive. The people watching the race take flash pictures as you drive past - but if you crash into a fence near them, they all cringe. There are clouds floating by overhead. Mostly, though, there are other racers on the track trying to get by you and steal the lead.We found the controls to be very intuitive, and the cars handled quite nicely. Note that this is a GAME racing system - i.e. it's not pure realistic. If you smash into a wall at 100mph, your car does not explode into a thousand shards of metal. You simply spin off gently and keep going. That being said, most gamers really don't want a \"realistic\" racing game. They want a fun one, and this game delivers across the board.I have to admit that for me, half the fun in this game is the gorgeous landscapes. In Vegas, you drive past the Excalibur and Treasure Island, and the details are picture-perfect. New York, New York is by the track in quite amazing clarity.I also love the sound in this game - because the soundtrack options are simply awesome. You can choose from a number of soundtracks, from classical to alternative to J-Pop and more. You can even stream in music from your iPod or other MP3 player!I suppose if you hate racing games, you probably will find this game to be boring. You're just racing cars around in circles with pretty scenery and great sound. But you'd have to be in the minority to not enjoy this game. The cars are amazing. The graphics are amazing. The sound is amazing. Because of the multiplayer options, including up to 8 simultanous live players online, you could play this game for eternity and still find people to challenge you.If you want even MORE of a challenge, you can even create your own custom route through their maps! You can design your very own custom lap system and challenge others to play on it. Talk about variety!Highly, highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001G3B0HC","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Blast From the Past","reviewText":"Pros:+Revamped version of a classic Gameboy Advance title+Interesting card battling system+Updated Graphics and Sound+Enticing storyCons:-Not enough voice actingAround 2004, Square-Enix released Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories on the Gameboy Advance.  It was easily one of the most rewarding games on the system, but it didn't really fall into the hands of too many GBA owners.  That was pretty sad when you consider it was not simply a spin off.  Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories fits into the canon of the tale of Sora, Donald and Goofy.  If some of the story in Kingdom Hearts II seemed confusing, it may have been because you didn't play Chain of Memories on the Gameboy Advance.  Luckily, Square-Enix has released it on the Playstation 2, fully revamped and largely unchanged.Chain of Memories takes place right where the first game left off with Sora, Donald and Goofy chasing after Pluto to find King Mickey.  Their chase eventually takes them to Castle Oblivion, a place that holds all of Sora's memories.  As Sora traverses Castle Oblivion, he'll be forced to conquer many of his memories from the first game.Castle Oblivion consist of thirteen floors which are all representative of worlds you've been to in the first Kingdom Hearts game.  Throughout you'll run into plenty of familiar faces.  It's here where you'll first be introduced to members of Organization XIII and other elements that played a fairly large role in Kingdom Hearts II.  As you play, it's easy to be overcome with nostalgia yourself.Combat in this remake of Chain of Memories is pretty much the same as the original.  While in the original two games combat was pretty standard and straight forward, Chain of Memories has a card based battle system.  Cards dictate just about everything.  It dictates items, magic and when you can attack.  Each time you swing the Keyblade the card on top gets sent back to the bottom of the deck.  You'll find yourself having to reshuffle your deck a lot of times.  There's a big emphasis on strategy here as well.  You'll be forced to really consider your actions.  You definitely can't rely on button mashing this time around.  As a result, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is also a pretty hard game.  You've also go no Donald or Goofy to help you unless you've got the right card which summons them into battle.Your enemies also have cards in play.  The success of your strikes depends largely on the number.  If you've got a higher number than the enemy, you'll be successful.  Likewise, enemies are always dropping cards.  You'll need them to access new areas and just to have a better deck overall.  You'll also need cards to perform sleights, which are more or less Sora's special moves.The card system is surprisingly complex for what is otherwise a simple game.  As I said, there's a lot of challenge to the game.  Overall, however, it probably makes it more fun to play.  You could easily conquer Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II by relentless button mashing.  Most Kingdom Hearts fans will probably welcome the challenge.  You probably won't have to level grind, but you will find that you need to battle much more than in the other games.  Battling with this card system in place, however, can get repetitive.The biggest difference between the Gameboy Advance game and this one is obviously the graphical overhaul.  Truthfully, the Playstation 2 game looks no different than either of the other Kingdom Hearts games.  This is a very good thing.  It's always running consistently, despite all the chaos that can be going on at one time.  The music has also been revamped.  The game sounds much better.  There's been some voice acting thrown in as well, but not nearly as much as you might think.  There's quite a bit of unspoken dialog throughout.For those who've played Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II to death you need to pick up Chain of Memories.  It answers all the questions of what took place between the two games and it comes at a bargain price.  It's a game that no Kingdom Hearts fan should pass up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"The expansion that is better than the original...","reviewText":"Heart of the swarm does everything better than Wings of Liberty and is one of those instances where the sequel is actually better than the original. The interface is much better both visually and usage wise, the units are lot more balanced and less redundant and the story is lot more cinematic compared to Wings of Liberty. Right from the beginning the story grips you and you realize that there is a well-developed central plot to this expansion and you dive right into it as compared to Wings of Liberty which took it's sweet time to get going. The graphics have been notched up too and there is lot more terrain and model details visible and the rag doll physics makes the combat lot more satisfying. The game still requires fast strategic thinking to complete all objectives in a mission and unless you play Casual there is no way you can just zerg your way to victory as the AI knows that you have the Zerg now, so well-conceived obstacles have been placed to balance the game-play. This cut-scenes are lot more dramatic this time around and Tricia Helfer voice acting as Kerrigan really gives life to the character. As far as multiplayer I can't offer any detailed insights as I have only played Arcade and I found it to be fun.  The full-fledged multiplayer aspect of the game is frankly too fast for me and inspite of the claims of balanced match-making I always end up with a twitch-master who zergs me within minutes of the game start. Don't know how they do it but there is no way I can match that so I stick with arcade for now.In all I really enjoyed playing the expansion and looking forward to the last expansion Legacy of the Void . Let see if Legacy of the Void can top Heart of the storm as this expansion has set the bar really high.*Even though I have no real complaint gameplay wise with this expansion, the reason I give it 4 stars is the always online requirement to play this game. Recently I was without internet for a month and I realized how unfair this requirement is for paying customers. Blizzard should have a temporary offline mode for gamers too and that's why I can't, in good faith, give this game a 5-star rating which it really deserves. *","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Same game as previous, with solid improvements","reviewText":"I'm a fan of the Dead Rising series. I believe, being a Romero traditionalist, that the only true zombies shamble. Dead Rising adheres to this generally, though some zombies are a little more active than others, while others are mutations: zombies hopped up on goof juice or such. Decidedly adding challenge and difference in the form of psychopaths - survivors whom are crazed into horrible acts and fits, or greedy survivalists. Nothing much changes here, there really is no need, it's a rock, paper, scissors formula that works, and they appear to recognize this and, instead of games such as Resident Evil, haven't perverted a tried and tested formula.So what has improved? ...The clumsy work bench based modification system was replaced with an immediate system - just access your items in real time and combine - same with vehicles. This boosts DR3's arcade feel and pace.More zombies - always a good thing. It's quite impressive and a clear advantage of the next generation of XBox. I've had non-gamers visit while I was playing, and they were impressed at the sheer volume of bodies and carnage (love the steam roller + motorcycle vehicle... flame on!).The mostly open world, even in buildings, was a great addition - DR1 and DR2 (pre-addons) suffered the most due to load times. It was in the minutes, even just to get into the main menu. And saving games took a half minute to a minute. This new addition loads pretty fast, and with the open map, it loads in real-time, so you barely notice. Some times the LOD (level of detail based on distance to objects an textures) doesn't kick in as you'd hope; things can appear low detailed for a few seconds, but this is an exception to the general look.This does bring up a negative, the graphics aren't as an incredible leap as I'd hoped for. More detailed models, Better textures. Better lighting. The lighting isn't very good in general, and, at times makes the game frustrating. This is perhaps to aid the open world and reduce LOD draw quality problems - not my problem to solve, just our loss to bare. And there is why this game isn't a five star game. I know it could look better, but it was a problem I don't think they fully solved.The game isn't incredibly long, and replay value is probably kind of low, especially compared to the previous DR2 Off the Record, where they added game modes. There really is only one game mode, with the addition of various difficulty modifications, such as time to solve the game. To get the Day One achievements, I played through it twice - standard, then nightmare. Once you reach the highest level (or more, unlock all abilities), nightmare is more like a day dream - I beat it in about two to four hours (with an hour to spare for the day one achievement).My biggest complaint is shared with all other versions. The controls. They play almost identical to DR2, which means our hero is a little slow to recover form jumping, falling, climbing - in general, I don't care for his sluggishness, but I realize it's &#34;as designed&#34;, so I won't do anything but mention it. Also, the controls aren't incredibly natural; I put the game down for a few weeks, and when I came back I had to re-familiarize myself to how to get into a vehicle, and attempt to remember (by trial and error, it turns out), which vehicles have an alternate attack that doesn't result in jumping out and blowing it up.In summary, the game is great. If you liked earlier Dead Rising games, you are very likely to appreciate this addition. The story works and fits into the previous stories, and, I think, would even make Romero smile. Don't expect the greatest visuals, it's not a graphics tech demo in the least, but do expect better frame rate, an improved resolution, less time wasted due to loading and saving, and much much more zombies!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

This game is wonderful. Metroid is easily my favorite series of all time , with Zelda following, and this game doesn't disappoint. Being a huge fan of the original Metroid, I was blown away by the idea of it being remade. I haven't been excited about a video game for a while, but Zero Mission had me pretty excited. Playing the game brings back both memories of Metroid and Super Metroid. The gameplay/ Graphics, and the terrain are much more like Super Metroid than Metroid Fusion. Super Metroid is my favorite Metroid game, but Zero Mission is right behind Metroid and Super Metroid. The game is recreated almost flawlessly, with much of the area resemblant to the original Metroid.  I'll break it down for you...Graphics- 10/10 The graphics are great as usual...no complaints here. Much like Super Metroid.Sound 10/10 Wow...the sound is brilliant. It is all remixes of the original Metroid soundtrack, which had great music to begin with. Take amazing music from an NES game, remix it to todays standards, and you have Metroid Zero Mission. Brinstars and Norfairs theme are wonderful, and also Kraids Lair.Ridleys Lair is also wonderfully redone, with a much more dark sound. Listening to the remixed music brings back memories of sitting in front of the TV playing Metroid all day and having so much fun, definitely a masterpiece aurally.Gameplay- 9/10 The only minor issue with this game is that it is very short, and the Chozo statues shouldn't have been added to the game. You roll your ball into the Chozo statues hands it it shows you where to go. However, this isnt nearly as bad as the terrible Navigation Rooms in Fusion, which destroyed the entire game. It's only minor here. This game also has a Hard option, but after you beat it it really seems pointless, since the only thing changed on Hard is the fact that the enemies deal more damage and you get less missles/health.Overall- 10/10 This game is definitely worth all the money, especially since when you beat it you unlock Metroid, possibly the greatest game ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2005"}

After about 5 hours of playing I finally accepted the fact that really nothing new was going to be introduced in this game. That's not all bad, Bioshock 1 was a very fun game... The environment is still one of the best conceived for a video game. The game play is dark and twisted which I enjoy it just felt like for a sequel there wasn't much new content that will keep me playing this game.The new Hacking is too easy but at the same time they give you a pain in the a$$ gun to shoot hacking darts. ( I hate that gun personally, switching to it in the middle of a fight causes serious frustration). The new weapons they have are nothing to write home about. And to me the graphics looked the exact same as the last bioshock. After seeing how Mass Effect overhauled graphics from 1 to 2 I was kind of hoping for the same thing here. That's not the case.All in all the game feels like a clone of the first one with a story that doesn't pull you in the same way. If you were a fan of the first bioshock then you will appreciate this game but doesn't expect the single player to give you anything more then the first.

There are themes of drug abuse, depression, and overall life choices that really tell the story.What is so engrossing the game boils down to the subtle clues and decisions that you make throughout the game and while on the outset this game seems like a QTE button masher, it's really not. Sometimes certain outcomes and scenes are played out based on buttons you may NOT push. Certain things you may or may not hear are based on conversation lines that you do or do not choose.If anyone is old enough to remember the old Dungeouns and Dragons \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books would really feel good in having a game where at any moment the story can change for your choices. This also gives this game a lot of replayability where you can go back and play scenes and change up what you did to see if you get a different result and from what i was told, this game has many endings.Graphically speaking, there was a lot of detail put into this game. So much so that sometimes you may forget that you are playing a game and watching a show. The settings, be it a store, seedy apartment, or a crime scene  are done very well which is why I will add, when playing this game, look at everything. Pay attention to the details, questions can sometimes pop up later based on what you heard or saw earlier. The facial features are among some of the best I have seen in a long time. You can feel the emotions through all the expressions that they give through their performances.I will have to admit, there was once scene in which something happened to one character that because I could relate being in a similar situation, I was a bit teary eyed.There is very little to complain about for this game. So far the 3 that stand out the most would be for one, the control set up is a bit more complex for some things than it needs to be. Walking for instance is a 2 button affair. If a sequel for this comes out, I would hope that it's streamlined to just the thumbstick. The other very minor issue is, and this may be due to hardware limitations, as graphically good as this game is, there are times where the character animations look a little too 'stiff' especially climbing stairs. Occasionally, it takes you out of the immersion that you may feel but not by much. Lastly, the voice acting is good in some places and bad in others also a minor issue but it's excusable by the fact that it's not like they hired tons of A list talent to voice this game.One last big plus is that there is a decent amount of DLC that's coming that adds to the story of this game, so keep your eyes open.Otherwise this game is a must have for those that want a break from MW2, Bioshock and everything else that has popped around. I would hope to see more games like this come out and use different genres like sci fi or fantasy to tell great stories. This is a game that requires some patience and good observation to get into and once you think you got it, you will want to play it again to see how it plays if you did things differently.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2010"}

To my surprise I got about 35 bucks in store credit for what I had to trade. So I asked the clerk for a game recommendation to use my credit with. When I told the guy that I'm a big fan of single player, story-rich games likeThe Last of Usor especiallyThe Walking Deadhe recommendedBEYOND: Two Souls, but I said that I'd prefer to be able to walk out of the store without exceeding the amount of my credit. So he said, \"No brainer: Heavy Rain used for under 15 bucks.\" So that's what I did and....What a great game!Heavy Rain is an intense psychological crime thriller where the decisions you make throughout the game will have a major impact on the end to your game (I believe it's 6 possible endings with the Director's Cut). You play chapters alternating between four characters, each with their own motivation to hunt for a serial killer. The game earns its M rating probably due to some nudity more than graphic violence, but make no mistake there is indeed some violence. But the real mature theme is the emotional toll that you'll experience during a playthrough, and depending on the ending you get the game will be more emotionally draining than you might expect.I forget what stopped me from playing this game when it came out in early 2010. I think that someone said or I read somewhere that the controls and QTEs were awkward. And as it turns out, that is very true; for some reason Sony and Quantic Dream felt that re-writing the traditional controller dynamic was a good idea for Heavy Rain. The most annoying aspect of the controls was that the left stick provided direction only; in other words it doesn't move you in the direction you are pushing unless you are also holding R2. This combined with often ambiguous QTE button prompts and hard to read onscreen button commands that often shake or rotate around the screen made for some unnecessary frustrations in the gameplay.All in all, like I said, great game! Definitely worth the time if the new releases aren't doing it for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

It has to be charged out of the box.  Charging takes about 3 hours.  It has a stand you can plug it into then you plug your USB cable into the stand and the PS3.  Turn on the PS3 and charging begins.  The outer edge of the mute button will flash red off and on as it is charging.To use it with the game you have to pair it to the PS3 console.  It comes with a six inch USB cable that you plug into the unit and the PS3 wait for the charging light to flash steady red then it is paired.  At that point you can turn the unit on by holding down the power button.  It will flash green a couple times to indicate it is on.  To turn it off you hold the power button down until the green light does a series of flashes then stops.With the game the unit works well most of the time.  It it doesn't work at all try pairing it again.  When you use it to interact to the game it orders are understood 90% of the time.  Sometimes you may have to repeat orders.  Sometimes the wrong unit will respond to the orders, most of the reviews I've read say as much.  It gets the job done.  Overall I give it four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

It&#8217;s not a typical remake of the movie in game form either, it actually serves as a sequel. The events are tied to the events of the movie, and takes place a few months after the movie.I will say, right out the door, that this game was better than the movie(Although, to be fair, it kinda would have to be right?) and is currently the best spider-man game I have ever played(taking the title away from Ultimate Spider-man game)The first thing you are going to notice is that the graphics are eye explodingly beautiful! The attention to detail cannot be praised enough, and it feels more like a movie, than the actual movie!Everything from the lens flares, to the window reflections, to the level of shine on cars! Even the water reflects so perfectly! I haven&#8217;t seen a game achieve this level of awesomeness in their graphics, since the last Uncharted game.The controls are also top notch, and works well! They kind of have to, since the entire control mechanics is taken right from the much praised Arkham BATMAN games. In fact, much of the entire game plays like an Arkham game, with Spiderman instead of batman. Translation: Kick ass!The DLC is where the game is lacking. I would love to have seen some campaign DLC. Mini-missions and so forth. Instead, I got Stan Lee swinging around gathering Pages, a few different &#8220;Be the bad guy and tear s*** up&#8221; and of course, a spider-man inspired game of  Snake.I would much rather have gotten a &#8220;Rhino is rampaging through time Square: Save the citizens and stop his carnage!&#8221; mission, or a &#8220;Vulture has been spotted above the city!&#8221; or some more Black Cat!On the upside, while I am not looking forward to the movie Amazing Spider-Man 2, I am anxiously awaiting its game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Modern Day Masterpiece","reviewText":"I admit, I am very, very tired of the latest \"Call of Battlefield\" military-themed FPS games out there. They are all indistinguishable from one another - all involve saving the world, all involve similar tactics, and 10 minutes into such a game, you have a firm, \"been there, done that\" vibe. I played and greatly enjoyed Bioshock 1 and 2, because they were set in a very unique and atmospheric setting, and had a great story-line as well.By the time of this review, this game as long been out and reviewed to death. Still, I wanted to throw in my two cents because I have now played through the entire game and feel it deserves every bit of critical praise heaped upon it.You play as Booker Dewitt, an ex-Pinkerton sent to a city in the clouds to rescue a girl. It is set in the early 1900's. You have plasmids (like in Bioshock) but they are called Vigors here. The story is quite good, the voice-acting is outstanding, and the action is fresh, with plenty of action. About half way through it started to feel a bit repetitive, as most shooters do, but once I understood that I needed to upgrade my Vigors, I started using them more creatively and the combat finally clicked for me.The graphics and colors in this world are stunning. It was amazing how much detail and thought went into even the smallest details, details you would miss unless you were looking carefully. The game ended, and I found myself searching the internet to see if others shared my interpretation of it. The overall story is quite thought provoking - something I expect from a book or good movie, not a game. Play it yourself and see. I don't want to risk spoiling anything, but if you love a good story in an FPS (think Half-life 2, or the original Deus Ex) this game is worth a look. At first blush it may seem more of the same, but it isn't. This is a modern day masterpiece - an overused phrase but once that applies here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Computerdude1032","summary":"A very worthy way to finish the figh","reviewText":"I have been waiting for Halo 3 since the day Halo 2 came out. I have listened to every Bungie Podcast, and read every Bungie weekly update. That being said, my hype for this game was way higher than that of the average user. Based on what I'd seen in the beta and read/heard from Bungie, I knew the game was going to rock. I just didn't know how much it was going to rock. I will say it right now: Halo 3 is the best game that I've ever played on any console or computer. Period. And I've played a LOT of games. From the epic story to the amazingly in depth multiplayer, the game delivers extremely well on all fronts. I have no doubt that every gamer (or even somebody who's not a huge gamer) will love Halo 3. Due to the complexity of the game, this review consists of two main sections (Multiplayer and Campaign), each of which is broken down into subdivisions.Campaign--Story: 10/10--If you've played other Halo games, then you basically know what the story in Halo 3 will be like. I can't really say too much about the story without spoiling anything, however the story starts out strong right where Halo 2 left off, and goes on strong. Bungie learned from their mistakes from Halo 2, and the story takes place only on Earth. The game does use an excessive amount of cut scenes, however they use the same engine as the game, so it never really feels like you are out of the game at all. Note: Be sure that you stick around to watch the credits, because there is more to come afterwards :)--Graphics: 9/10--The graphics in Halo 3's campaign are some of the best graphics I've ever seen on the 360. When you consider the fact that you can play 2-player co-op on one system with the same graphics and framerate, it is really amazing. The lighting and particle effects in the game are probably the best on any console game I've ever seen. Overall, the graphics are probably slightly worse than Gears of War or BioShock, but again, considering what this game does, the graphics are absolutely amazing. Loading takes place only in between levels, but the loading screen looks so amazing, you will probably wish you saw it more often.--Sound: 7/10--If you've watched the E3 2006 trailer for Halo 3, you've heard the music in Halo 3. Yes, the music is amazing, but Bungie chose to repeat the same song over and over and over again. The song always manages to fit what's going on the screen, but with Bungie's large budget, I'd have thought they could do better. As for the game's sound effects, they are absolutely amazing. Each gun has its own set of sounds, and they sound differently when they are far away or in a small area. The characters make some hilarious noises when they die, and the voice acting in the game can't be beat. Bungie has gone to great efforts to ensure that the voice acting is interesting, and they have really succeeded. Other than the poor variety of music the sound in Halo 3 is absolutely amazing.--Gameplay: 10/10--Gameplay is where Halo 3 shines the most. The controls have been perfected for the Xbox 360 controller. They may take some time to get used to, however once you do, you will see that the changes are amazing. Of course, if you refuse to change, Bungie does offer a Halo 2 control scheme option that you can choose. Some have complained that Halo 3 is too much like Halo 2, but that couldn't be further from the truth. There is such a large variety of new weapons, and characters that it feels like you are playing a completely brand new game, not a copy of Halo 2 like some have claimed.--Online Co-op Play: 10/10--It was only a few weeks before release that Bungie finally announced what everybody had been waiting to hear: 4 player campaign cooperative play over Xbox Live. Why did Bungie wait so long to reveal this feature? They needed to be sure it worked perfectly before they promised it to gamers. Let me tell you, thanks to co-op play with meta scoring (gives you a score based on your in-game performance), the Halo 3 campaign is going to be replayed, and replayed, and replayed over and over again for tons of years to come. To start a co-op game you simple choose campaign from the main menu, and then invite your friends. You can play with 3 people online, or you and a guest can play with 2 others online. Either way, you are ensured a great experience. During my play with co-op, it has worked much better than I expected, and only lagged when I was playing with a friend who had a bad DSL internet connection. I should tell you right now that you need to play co-op on legendary difficulty, because as you might expect, the game gets substantially easier when there are 4 people fighting. Also, the only time you revert to the previous checkpoint is if all 4 of you die at once.Campaign score: 9.2/10 (an average of the above scores)Multiplayer9.2 is an amazing score for the campaign. But you haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet until you've heard about multiplayer. For the past 3 years, Halo 2 has remained the most played Xbox Live game. Nothing could beat it. Except Halo 3, of course. I am amazed at all of the features included in Halo 3, and I'm always finding new stuff every time I play. The Multiplayer will be played for tens of years to come. That's just how great it is. Now, lets dive right in and try to take a look at all of the multiplayer features:--Graphics: 9/10--For obvious reasons, the graphics aren't as good in multiplayer as they are in campaign. That being said, the graphics are still flippin' amazing. I have no clue how Bungie has pulled off these amazing graphics with up to 4 players split-screen with no framerate hitches at all. Every time I play Halo 3 online, I catch myself stopped in the middle of the action staring at the detail in the environments. No two explosions are alike, and you will continue to be amazed at the level of detail in the graphics for a long, long time. My absolute favorite graphical feature is the water. I have died countless times while staring at the water. At first glance, the water looks great. Its flowing realistically, with waves and sloshes, and all that stuff. Then you see somebody jump in the water. There is a realistic splash, followed by realistic ripples around the person. My favorite thing to do is to stand in the water, and just watch how it ripples around me. The water effects are seriously that great. And so are the explosion effects, the wind effects, the lighting effects, and the particle effects. Combine all these amazing graphical effects, with the option to watch everything over again in slow motion (more on saved replay's later), and you have what is probably the most visually stunning multiplayer game ever.--Sound: 10/10--We have already covered how great the sound effects were in the Campaign, but multiplayer is even better. Shoot in the water for a realistic sound, shoot a wall for a realistic sound, kill a person for a realistic sound (or yelp in some cases- you will see what I mean when you are playing). The sound in Halo 3 multiplayer is unbeatable. Period. It's really hard to describe sound, so the most effective thing I can say is: Go get the game and play it for yourself to see how sweet it is.-- Multiplayer maps/game types/game play: 10/10 --The multiplayer maps included in Halo 3 are the strongest maps to date. I've played over 1000 multiplayer games, and have yet to find a map that I dislike. They are varied in size and shape. This time around, Bungie has really strayed away from the symmetrical maps to more asymmetrical maps. The change is really nice, and you will definitely appreciate it for games such as capture the flag, as it provides more of a fun experience. As for game types, all game types from Halo 2 make a return, as well as some of the popular ones from custom games such as \"zombies\" (renamed infection). All of the games and maps seem to be balanced perfectly, and it is never too difficult to complete an objective thanks to this great balance. And of course, even in the rare instance that you get a game type that you don't like in matchmaking, you can simply press X to veto it, and if more than 50% of the players in the game agree, a new map and game type will be chosen. The game play is similar to that of Halo 2, although the old weapons have been balanced (the energy sword still owns, but now it owns in a fair way), and the addition of equipment really has a fun effect on the game. Equipment items include a bubble shield, a portable gravity lift, a trip mine, a power drainer, or power regenerator, just to name a few. These can be activated by pressing the X button, and are thrown sort of like grenades. They last for about 30 seconds or until somebody blows it up. Overall, the multiplayer experience is the best in any game, ever, and won't be beat until Bungie releases their next title.--Online rankings/other extra features: 10/10--The amount of extra features included in Halo 3 is absolutely astounding. First, you have saved replay's, which let you save a replay of any multiplayer (or campaign) game and watch it back from any angle, frame-by-frame. You may or may not think it sounds cool, but once you try it out, you will wonder how you survived Halo 2 without it. It makes your smack talk so much more powerful, and you can now prove to your friends that you \"got a 100 kill spree last night.\" (or they can prove that you didn't). Of course, once you have your film, you naturally want to share it, so Bungie lets you upload up to 6 files to their server for storage and sharing with other members. Another great extra included in Halo 3 is Forge. Forge is a basic map editor. It lets you move spawn points, weapons, scenery, etc. You can edit basically anything other than the physical layout of the map. And after you get the perfect map, you can save it and upload to your file share for all to enjoy. It really is extremely amazing, you just have to see it to believe it.--Lasting Appeal 11/10--When you consider everything that I've mentioned in both the campaign and multiplayer aspects, its really amazing. You could spend an entire day exploring the features I've mentioned in this review, and still not have seen everything. Halo 2 never lost its popularity (even after the release of Halo 3, there are an average of 40,000 people playing Halo 2 online every day), and with all the exciting new features in Halo 3, it is going to retain its popularity for even longer. I know people are going to be mad that I gave lasting appeal an 11/10, but I firmly believe that by the time Bungie's \"next project\" is released, Halo 3 will still be my most played game.Multiplayer Rating 5/5 (an average of the above scores)Final Score and ThoughtsI've said it before, and I'll say it again: Halo 3 is THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED. I don't know how Bungie got this much game made in 3 years, but it is simply amazing. Everybody should purchase this game- you won't regret it. As a final sum-up I will offer some pro's and con's.Pro's:Amazing graphicsAmazing AIGreat soundBest Multiplayer aroundCon's:Could use a better variety of musicRewinding saved films is a bit awkward- you will see what I mean when you try.A matchmaking feature for custom games promised by Bungie has gone strangely missing :(Overall Score: 5/5- PERFECT (overall impression, not an average of the above)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2008"}

Not to much is new with this game but considering Asylum and City were my favorite games on this generation of consoles this is one of the times I would say thats not a bad thing. The one thing new that separates it from city however is Multiplier which if you can manage to start a game (doesn't seem to be many playing online yet) it can add some extra fun to it expecilly taking down thugs with batman and robin and it appears like there may be more modes in the future. However I feel its more of a bonus if your getting this game for the multiplayer you may be dissapointed. Also The have improved crime scenes in the game but its more for show your still basically holding X for scaning it kinda feels like batman is cheating on his detective skills. Anyway while the combat is basically the same as Arkham City its still great fun I think the made them look and feel smoother then ever before. As for the voices I think the did a great job with sure it doesn't have Kevin Conroy or Mark Hammill but the new actors fit this game more since its about the early days of batman when the were much younger. The one thing I am dissapointed with in this game however is the Easter Eggs theres rarely ever if any random tie ins anywhere which the previous developer was amazing for so there isn't quite as much detail and of coarse the city is all criminals with few random citizens on the street. I can understand not being many because it takes place on Christmas Eve and the police rader warns everyone to stay inside but in reality there would be at least a few people that would go out anyway, but if your a fan or the previous games or batman you need to play this game 4.8/5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"\"I Attack the Darkness!\"","reviewText":"I've never read The Darkness comic.  I couldn't get past the fact that the character looks like a badSpawnrip-off and the quote from Brunching Shuttlecocks about the truth behind Dungeons & Dragons: \"I attack the darkness!\"The Darkness is essentially every Mafia movie clich&eacute; mixed with the brooding atmosphere ofThe Crow.  In fact, the protagonist, Jackie Estacado (Kirk Acevedo), looks and sounds at lot like Michael Wincott, who played Top Dollar in that film. If you've seen The Crow, you know that Wincott's got a very distinctive appearance, with his long black hair, leather overcoat, and hawkish features.  In The Darkness, Jackie is affectionately nicknamed Ratface by his girlfriend Jenny Romano (Lauren Ambrose). As you can imagine, having personal connections in a dark game like this is inevitably a liability, but I digress.The Darkness owes a lot to films likeReservoir DogsandPulp Fiction, with random narrative from our hero, outrageous characters, and an uneven mix of action and drama. The first cut scene (created with all in-game graphics) gives a perfect sense of what's to come: lots of cursing, lots of gore, absolutely no respect for authority, and plenty of violence, all taking place in New York.  It's the New York of the seventies, when crime and graffiti were rampant and sane people didn't wander out alone by themselves. And you're one of the reasons.The Darkness is a two-headed demonic symbiont that lives within Jackie and, we discover later, the entire Estacado bloodline.  In that respect the game is a lot like Spawn or Venom; the Darkness is a personality as much as it is a thing that augments Jackie's considerable gun-fu skills with the ability to create black holes that suck everything into them, whiplash barbed tentacles, magical guns, and snake-like mouths. In the dark, Jackie can summon other demons to do his bidding, which range from kamikaze critters loaded with explosives to gatling-gun wielding warriors.Jackie's opponents have no such superpowers, and it's a credit to the game's creators that any supernatural monsters you encounter all fit the plot.  There's no inevitable escalation of the villain gaining superpowers to do battle; indeed, the villain behind most of Jackie's woes, Uncle Paulie Franchetti (Dwight Schultz) is as much a moral foil as he is an arch-foe.  Killing him isn't the point.The game revolves around the issue of Jackie's soul.  Mob life is a violent one, and The Darkness contrasts the mythical honor of the \"old ways\" with the mad-dog frenzy of Franchetti.  When Franchetti starts blowing up orphanages, the older mobsters use Jackie as their form of vengeance.The Darkness uses the New York subway system as its primary means of shuttling Jackie from place to place.  This makes a lot of sense and provides a sense of realism to an otherwise route form of travel that bedevils so many first-person shooters.  The streets are filled with entertaining characters who all have missions of their own to complete. Two of the most memorable characters include Butcher Joyce (Mike Starr) and Aunt Sarah (Norma Michaels), but there are many more and the voice actors are all superb. Between screens, and there are a lot of load screens, Jackie narrates his life and death to Jenny, which provides a humorous series of quotable anecdotes.  These are the first load screens that actually distracted me from the load time.Despite the age-old Mafia tropes, The Darkness takes the themes explored in The Crow and Spawn and amps them up to eleven, without ever losing focus on sacrifice, violence, and even love. I wasn't entirely convinced that saving Jackie's soul was feasible (I earned the anti-hero rating from the game), but the very notion of redemption being possible is a breath of fresh air to the first-person shooter genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0001B15RA","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"PS2 Vs. Xbox: OBJECTIVE Comparison","reviewText":"After being a dedicated Playstation 2 fanatic for the better part of 3 years, I never thought that someday I would resort to an Xbox unit. Since the Xbox 360 is out and the new unit will not probably produce good games until a year or so has passed, you might just want to get this thing to hold you over. At least until the new PS3 will be released so buyers can compare it to the 360 and make a smart financial decision.Compared with the more popular PS2, the Xbox is much more advanced when it comes to Hellified graphics. Unfortunately, a good portion of games for the Xbox do not use the full capacity of the unit's superb capabilities. Video Game producers knew that the PS2 was more popular and they designed games that that particular unit could handle, which forced the Xbox to lower itself to PS2 standards. Some exceptions were made with game titles strictly limited to the Xbox, such as Call of Duty, Doom 3 and Men of Valor.Keep in mind that just about all PS2 games originally meant for PS2 can also be found for the Xbox. This cannot be said about the PS2. I guess if you buy an Xbox, you risk never seeing a few of your favorite Japanese titles, but that number is close to zero. Most video game producers sold out to both units, because that's how they make their profits. The only series of games that I can think of which the Xbox dose not have, but PS2 dose, is the Final Fantasy series, which, by a large vote, is a HUGE loss for Xbox.Now, it can be argued that PS2 has more game titles than the Xbox if one is to buy all sorts of converters for his/her PS2 unit that will allow them to play Japanese titles never released in America. I don't think the Xbox can do this, since this is an American machine, designed by Microsoft.The Xbox is capable of online gaming. Can rip CD tracks and create MP3s. Is capable of playing DVDs if you buy the accessory for it. But the best thing about the machine is that it has its own memory stored into it so that the owner will not have to worry about buying Memory Cards, such is the burden PS2 owners carry. More memory can be supplied to the Xbox with Memory Expansion discs that fit into the controllers if desired.At one time there was a lot of complaints about the Xbox controller being too hard to control. They improved this fault and made it more like a PS2 controller, which is easier to work with.Overall, a very sophisticated machine. If you would ask my opinion, I would say that once again America remains one step ahead of Japan in the ongoing competition for making the best products. HOWEVER, I feel the PS3 is biding it's time and the delay in it's release could very well be a tactical postponement while they watch for mistakes made in the production of the Xbox 360 so that they don't make the same mistakes with PS3. I'm telling you, it is smart to WAIT and see the final result and just get the Xbox Unit to hold you over. The PS3 will use Blue-Ray technology, which will make games and DVDs alike look phenomenal on a TV, especially a HD TV or Plasma. Wow...it gets me excited just thinking of the possibilities. I think Japan will win this one, but you never know. Anything can be made to look good in PRINT and NEVER trust the word of the Developers themselves!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Mizov","summary":"More Than Just an Update: An Overhaul","reviewText":"I see a lot of reviewers dismissing MW3 as just a small update, the Madden 12 of FPS so to speak. In my opinion, this is not the case. The fundamentals of the multiplayer have been changed and the story that was started in COD4: MW has finally been resolved.While the maps seem similar, the weapons are mostly recycled and the graphics haven't gotten an update there are a lot of changes that make this a completely different feel from MW2. The kill streak rewards are the biggest change, and not only are they different, they've completely changed the way a match can play out.There are now 3 different types of kill streaks: Assault, Support and Specialist. Assault is the standard; you kill, you build, resets when you die. The other two are completely new and have totally changed the feel of the multiplayer experience. Support counts kills over the course of the MATCH. Death no longer stops your kill streak growth bonuses, meaning that you can earn the top tier kill bonus on every match (if you accumulate enough kills). People are no longer punished for a cheap death or a stupid mistake, and can help change the course of the match for their teammates without camping off in the corner hoping people stumble by.The third type, Specialist, is even more unique. It unlocks perks as you kill. This means that after a few kills you can have MORE perks active instead of only three, making you a far more formidable foe (so long as you know how to USE the perks). Once people figure out the sheer options they have for multiplayer, believe me, you'll be noticing a serious difference.As for the single player narrative. It's semi-interesting but is a bit rushed. You're after Markarov, he's a bad guy, etc. etc. I just wanted to see the end of the campaign and I got it. Hooray.The final part of the game, Spec Ops, is more fun than it was in MW2. The missions are a bit more varied and the new Horde mode is a ton of fun (especially if you enjoyed the Gears of War horde mode). It has a lot of varied enemies, from dogs to vehicles and has its own in-game system for upgrades, it's fun, trust me.SUMMARY - I think this is a worthwhile purchase. There are enough changes throughout to make it into a new take on an old formula. The killstreak changes alone make it so I'll never be going back to MW2 multiplayer. The burning question: is it better than Battlefield 3? It's DIFFERENT. I love Battlefield 3 but Modern Warfare multiplayer isn't designed to be a direct competitor. It's claustrophobic, over the top, and fast. You don't run across the map to kill someone, they're right around the corner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

The combat is very similar to Arkham City.  I don't know when guns enter the game, but it's certainly not early in the game.  The vehicles are a bit clunky, you drive on the left hand side of the road, and the &#34;free look&#34; while driving stinks.  It's not a bad game, but it's nothing I would really recommend either.  The combat is decent, but if you've played Arkham City you'll note that it's been done before (and slightly better by Arkham City).  I read in another review that you are better off getting a 360 controller.  The mouse and keyboard works decent, but maybe the controller would help.  You can tell this game is a port.  Also, motion sickness warning.  Depending on what I'm doing in the game, I start to get motion sickness.  I had the same happen with the new Tomb Raider.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Uber Awesome Sauce!","reviewText":"Finally...a new Tomb Raider game for current gen systems, and one that does the franchise justice & gives it a much needed face lift!  Easily one of the best games of the year if you ask me!  I did purchase the collector's edition of the game.  I will be reviewing primarily the game, but I will also review the collector's edition content a little bit as well.First of, graphically, Tomb Raider contains some of the best Playstation 3 graphics to date!  The animation is wonderful, and it is all touched up pretty well, with some pretty good attention to detail.  I have not seen really any discrepancies in the animation to be honest.The control and gameplay mechanics are almost nearly flawless...this game is probably one of the most top notch games in that department that I remember playing in a while.  Any little faults that I came across in any of it was very very rare, so rare that I couldn't even venture to remember a specific instance.Storywise, it is very well written out and gives us a feel for the character that is Lara and the Lara that comes out when thrust into this hazardous environment and struggles to survive, seeing as how this is a rebirth of Tomb Raider.  It cuts a very keen story on the start of Lara's ascent as the renowned and beloved Tomb Raider!  You really feel for her as she struggles through the challenges she faces!  There isn't really a whole lot of in depth background on the rest of the cast though (Lara's crew, etc), aside from some tidbits you'll pick up in journals and such along the way, but the scenese that any of them are in is pretty well done, and the voice acting is legit.Gameplay wise, the game is exciting and intense.  What I like too is that in any given instance, if you think about it or observe your environment, there is many different ways in which you could handle a specific situation in combat.  You can chose to engage your enemies on your own terms...whether just straight up blasting em, utilizing environmental stuff (which I did a lot because it's so awesome and effective), or even just challenge yourself to take on a heard of enemies with only one specific weapon...whether with bow & arrow or pistol or even just hand to hand combat, like I did a few times...move from cover to cover and get close to them and start hacking at them with the climbing axe or counter killing (once you achieve such perks).  Several different options to chose from when engaging your enemies.  There are also some intense and insane parts that will keep you on your toes...such as sliding down a steep embankment dodging and shooting through obsticles before Lara skewers herself on something on the way down, just as an example.  Very exciting!Though it's not an open world sandbox type game, there are great opportunities for exploration in various areas to find more loot and to find all the hidden tombs and everything, which is very cool too.  Plus, what's even cooler is that you can chose to explore those areas right away or fast travel back to them later to try and find everything and find all the loot & earn all the little trophies that come along with it.  I explored the areas a lot right away, but there is a few things I have missed and will probably go back to later to try and find everything.But there you have it...my best review I could give on the game without giving away any spoilers or anything like that, because that isn't cool.  Don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't played.  If you are one of those people and love a great action adventure game but maybe apprehensive on whether or not you should pick this up, my friends...go pick it up!  You'll be glad you did!  I don't know what happened with a couple of the people that said they had glitches and problems with the game or whatever, but they may just need to exchange it...I've experienced hardly a single issue with my copy!  This game is a definite keeper...very high replay factor!  In fact, my next time through, I'm already planning to challenge myself to stick to primarily bow & arrow and melee in combat...only exceptions would be the parts you have to use a particular weapon to get through or if I am going to like die if I don't use something else.  LOL.  But yeah, it's a high quality game folks!  Check it out!  I have honestly not tried any of the online play and not sure yet if I will or not...really more of a solo gamer so I tend to stick to campaign and story modes usually.As far as collectibles,Tomb Raider Survival/Collector's Editionhas some great stuff in it!  There is a collectible figurine of Lara with interchangable weapons and even different hands in which to hold different weapons or the weapons in different fashions.  A little of it seems a small bit flimsy, but it's not too bad.  I could probably break one of Lara's arms off if I wanted to, but it would require a bit of force, and I personally don't plan to play with the figure, LoL...just for display atop my book case.  There is also a reversible poster that has a cool picture of Lara on one side and a full map for the game on the reverse side.  There are also a few black patches in it that feature the symbols for some of the skills in the game...you can iron them onto clothing or a backpack or whatever, or just display them like I have.  There is a fun 5x7 lithograph of Lara that is pretty sweet.  Comes with the complete soundtrack of the game too, which I have already listened too, very enjoyable.  There is also a code for use of some Hitman Agent 47 weapons in multiplayer mode, which is pretty cool...maybe I'll use them sometime if I decide to play online at all.  The packaging is pretty sweet too, all of it comes packaged in a Survival tin container which is really neat.  Heck, I've even displayed the Tomb Raider dust cover that was over the top of it all.  It's all pretty sweet stuff folks.  If you're die hard about this kinda stuff or just enjoy collectibles like I do and you plan to get this game, try and get your hands on this set...it's pretty cool.There, that concludes my review of Tomb Raider...I hope that I have inspired many of you action adventure gamers out there to pick this up and give it a go, if you haven't already...you'll be glad you did!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"One of the best games of this generation; a must-own","reviewText":"What...a...game!  Start to finish Tomb Raider pushes the hardware to its limit, dazzles with great story telling and gameplay, and is a clearly finished product that every gamer must experience.Graphics:Lara looks amazing; beautiful and sexy but still like a real person (to be blunt she has C-cups in this game).  The backdrops are many and look stunning, the weather effects are the best I've seen, especially wind, there are no issues like pop-in or collision detection, it all looks outstanding.  Lara puts her hands on walls as she navigates around them, clutches at a fresh cutscene wound, and otherwise does countless subtle things that add realism.Sound:Finally a game that shows what my 5.1 surround system can do.  Atmospheric noises from stumbling through shallow water to creaking and cracking as ruins are strained to an outstanding orchestral score, the sound creates the perfect mood.  The gunshots are loud and very realistic, giving my sub woofer a workout.  It's beyond me why other games don't have gunfire like this.Far and away the best part of the sound is the voice acting, particularly Lara's.  She has a beautiful British accent, conveys emotions well, and her breathing can be very labored when appropriate.  After an especially nasty sequence ending in a hard tumble and wound, her breath even squeaks as she tries to keep it together.  She starts the game inexperienced and afraid, and as things get rough and she has to begin taking lives to save her own, she toughens up little by little.  I can't commend the studio enough for being so gradual and believable with Lara's maturation through the course of the game.  It would have been so easy to make a stereotypical \"strong woman\" who didn't flinch in the face of mortal danger and friends dying, but Lara always acts how a real person would thrust into chaos for the first time.  Other characters are all solid but don't get that much dialogue, save for Matthias, whose voice is perfect for his role.Story:I don't want to spoil anything, so let's just say the story involves getting shipwrecked on an island and trying to find a way off, learning along the way that something unnatural is going on and leaving is not as easy as securing transportation.  Lara has close friends as well as acquaintances she merely tolerates during the expedition.  She routinely communicates with them with a walkie talkie, which allows for a lot of character development.  It's so much fun hearing her friends tell her to seek shelter and just stay alive early on, having to reassure her regularly, only to talk her down from being too adventurous later as she becomes battle tested and gains more nerve.  Most of the game is spent with the theme \"something about this place isn't right\" as opposed to constantly waving the supernatural at the player.Gameplay:95% of the combat involves battling human enemies, who are fairly intelligent about taking cover and working together to take Lara out.  Lara gets several weapons during the game and can add many upgrades to all of them like steadier aim, faster reload, longer clips and secondary functions.  I fell in love with her bow and arrow right away, with its heavy damage but slower speed to target.  Flame tipped arrows that create a pool of fire became my favorite weapon.  There is no auto-aim but it isn't needed as the controls are very precise.  There are also many skills Lara learns by experience points you get to spend in the many camps which are set throughout the game.  Dodging melee attacks and counter striking is satisfying, as are the executions you can initiate on a stunned enemy.  As has been said, some of the sequences when Lara dies are very gruesome, and are exponentially more effective because Lara is a character I grew to care for and wanted to keep safe.  The platforming is very good provided you look before you leap.  On occasion I didn't jump from one ledge to the one I meant to, but that's thanks to the analog sticks being so much less precise than a d-pad, which is only used here to select weapons.  There are tons of hidden items to collect to unlock various artwork and videos, including treasure maps that show where they're hidden.  The optional tombs are always worth doing, and are challenging to solve but not excessively so.Final Thoughts:Tomb Raider takes the best elements of Uncharted, graphics and voice acting as good as Arkham City, shooting controls that are always precise and intuitive, creative puzzle elements, very solid platforming that never leads to frustration, and makes a game that's an early contender for game of the year.  I urge everyone reading this to buy it immediately; you will have a great time and it's so important to reward a studio and publisher for putting forth the effort to make a polished, outstanding new game and not one more sequel or FPS.  What are you waiting for?  Buy this game right now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2013"}

It's fast paced, action packed and a blast to play for as long as this adrenaline ride can last.  It has fun, intense boss battles and over-the-top attitude, characters and fast-paced upbeat action.  One thing that really holds this game back is the lack of being able to hold like 10 different guns.  You'll be in a boss battle unleashing hell from different weapons in your four weapon arsenal, and then you'll be like, \"heck, I need a rocket launcher\" and then you'll proceed to slide around the level looking for one, wishing you didn't have to drop your shotgun to pick it up.  I remember growing up and playing FPS that allowed you to hold like 10-12 different guns, and I remember the first time I was only able to hold 2 different guns which, granted it's more \"realistic\", but so impractical.  Now it's in like every single video game, and I miss the days when you could hold a collection of guns so big that it was simply ridiculous.  Anyways, that's my biggest gripe with the game other than some repetitive enemies.  It looks good, it feels slick and it's a blast to play but it's more of a weekend rental than a cherished game that you'd want to keep in your collection or want to replay in the months to come.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2011"}

Buy it, it's cheap and worth 5 to 10 bucks.  I have always been a fan of nice sword play and this game has it.  I really liked all the controls on this game.  You have pretty good control of the camera and although it can get tricky, I liked it.  I can see how some would say that it gets repetitive in the game with the missions, but I stuck with it and I am glad I did.

I loved Fallout, and probably would have loved Oblivion if the game wasn't so buggy.  Dragon Age is a welcome addition to the RPG collection for the PS3.The interface is intuitive, and if you've played any CRPG's before, you'll be right at home when it comes to conversation choices.  As far as graphics and sound, I've read some complaints about the PS3 having bad frame rates.  I've experienced this from time to time, but it doesn't really interfere with the actual game play.  Once or twice, the voice acting didn't kick in when it should have, but if you're reading, again, this won't affect game play.When it comes to the story, the game's quite immersive.  There are plenty of sidequests to complete and all of the party members that you're able to recruit banter with one another through out.One regret I do have about my decisions in playing the game is based on the choices of party members that you can make.  I made a warrior.  You're given 2 warriors right off the bat (and there are up to 4 more available throughout the rest of the game.)  The 2 mages you come across are fairly decent (and one appears pretty early on.)  The 2 rogues that are available are terrible.  I highly recommend that you roll up a rogue that can pick locks and make traps.  Alister will take on the tank roll for the party quite well.  Morrigan can learn heal at the first level up and keep the party alive (though I replaced her with Wynne as soon as I had the opportunity.)  The 4th party member can be any of the characters...  Though I recommend one that puts out a decent amount of damage.  Another reason I suggest a rogue is due to the ease of finding equipment.  Almost everything that you find early on is leather and one handed weapons.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2010"}

So I got this game seeing all the great reviews, and I don't regret it at all! First of all, this game works a lot of the muscles that games like Wii Fit neglect, like the back and side muscles. And you don't even notice how hard you are working yourself until you are done because it is so fun! So far I have lost 10 lbs using this.But I know most of you don't want this for the exercise, but for the fun aspect of it. This game is incredibly fun to play! The songs are upbeat, and there is a great selection from 80's music to music around the world. And multi-player is really fun (and chaotic lol). I recently brought this game to a haloween party, and it was a hit! The songs like \"This is Haloween\" and the mummy song (can't remember the name) were great for the party! Even though it was a bit messy having four people at a time, it was still fun watching each other fail because we all are terrible dancers :POverall, I would recommend this game to anyone! It's fun, it keeps you moving, and it's a great way to have fun with friends!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

There are no frame drops in the game, even though you see lots off fx and objects in the screen and everything occurs in milliseconds; people must understand that in order to have a great gameplay performance in a fast paced game you may have to sacrifice some graphics. TM does have great graphics with amazing gameplay.GAMEPLAY (5/5)TM... Mr. Jaffe, you know your stuff man... great game, plays superb, the controls are tight, everything feels correct, great success. By the way, for newcomers, I recommend the racing control scheme, the classic one feels kind of old and complicated imo.STORY (3.5/5)The campaign and events are great overall, I know that the theme in the game is psychotic and violent, the stories are rated for matured,they are really gory; but overall weak, each character has like 3 movies that tell their dreams and ambitions in TM but they feel kind of weak (SPOILER: Mr. Grimm enters to TM tournament in order the to the past and warn his dad from a fatal accident... I mean, come on, you can do better than that). Is hard to relate to a character since all are sinners (Except for Grimm). The campaign is also weak due to the lack of characters, the game itself lacks of characters. Only three?
