{"product_name":"B002EE1P2W","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Robert T.","summary":"Great game with some frustrating flaws","reviewText":"Never played Dead Rising, but I love the sequel. Lots of fun, mindless violence with great zombie humor thrown in for good measure. But there are a few flaws. Yes, there's lots of loading between areas, but really the load times are very short. No worse than the Fallout games. Yes, the controls are a bit clumsy, but nothing to worry too much about. My real gripes are: 1. Save points--you can only save by visiting certain areas (restrooms), which means you're going to be re-playing a LOT of missions and reacquiring lots of cash/points due to lost play. Saving is not convenient AT ALL, and you're going to want to throw the controller through the TV every time you die. 2. When you check your watch (i.e., to check your mission status, choose another active mission, etc.), gameplay doesn't stop. Even though you can't see what's happening around you, the zombies will continue munching on your brains as you read messages and check mission details. 3. Timed missions. This is one of the most frustrating, depressing things about this game. There were times I wanted to just kill zombies, grind away for experience points, level up, or just have fun in the open world environment. However, you're always on the clock. You'll have 5-6 active missions at any time, all of which are timed. Seriously. 5-6 separate timers counting down the seconds for active missions, most of which activate automatically (not by choice). Run out of time, lose the mission forever. That seriously takes away from the fun. All in all a great game, doesn't deserve the heavy criticism it's getting from some reviewers. BUT, there are times I want to take the power drill from Chuck Green's hands and use it on whoever made some of these bad gameplay decisions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"atrainfb \"A-TrainFB\"","summary":"Congrats, you've earned your Man Card!","reviewText":"There are a lot of reviews that rated this one star because they bought it for their kids. This an M rated game. At one point in the game you get a mansion and have slave girls that you chase around the grounds and catch to do nasty things to. You get a barbed dart with a rope attached so you can hang enemies from the side of a building. Several kill animations have you stabbing a guy through his head with a sword. Do not buy this for your kids. You are not smart if you do.So with that out of the way, I give it five. First off, this is the first Assassin's Creed game I've played and I'm pretty damn hooked. It's just fun. It's so fun that I bought AC3 and AC2 after playing this for about 2 hours. Quite literally paused the game and jumped on Amazon bought two other AC games. I made those purchases based on friends of mine talking up the other two and from reviews stating that those were the better ones to get.Now, the free roam and free run portion of the game is pretty damn cool. There's a lot to explore. Way more than I initially thought. I actually thought this was going to be pretty linear. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is not linear at all. You can travel anywhere in the world you like from the get go, if your skills are good enough. Some parts of the world require you do some missions first though.I like the Animus object hunt, though the game does not explain at all what the Animus objects are or why you collect them. You just do. Same as the chests. I like the hunt for the chests. Some of them are actually placed in places you have to think about how to get to. Like you can see it, but you have to figure out how to get to it. Then there's the sea shanties. These are little flying pieces of paper. As soon as you approach them to get them, they fly away and you have to chase it down. Some are pretty easy to get. There were a few that really tested my patience. On a few occasions I had to go over a building and Ed would cling to the corner of a roof and just stop there while I'm violently mashing buttons to get him to move onto the roof and the paper flies away and then I have to retry later. That got frustrating. Not enough to deter me from playing on.The combat was pretty smart until I started raiding ships. On the mainland combat is actually pretty fun. You have guns, swords and hidden blades. You can quite literally walk past someone, stick them in the ribs and keep walking without stopping. The drop in assassinations are a pretty cool way to take people out, as well as get the initial upper hand when taking on a few guys at once. Another little thing that irritated me was the rope dart. It's really cool and provides for some entertaining and morbid ways of dealing with enemies, but you don't get it until the end of the game. You don't get it until you're at about 85%-90% done. As far as taking over a ship once it's disabled, I've run into issues with Ed not responding to commands. Like he will draw his swords when I press the button but won't actually use them. Some ships require you to detonate explosives, but if your swords are drawn he won't respond to that input either. Combat also includes parrying opponents which is very useful. Sniping people from the bushes with a tranquilizer to sneak past them helps to break up the sheer violence of the game.The stealth in the game is done rather well. It's reminiscent of being a child actually. It reminds me of running through the woods playing hide and seek as a kid. Hide in the bushes, shoot a guy with a dart that makes him take out his own men or fall asleep. Get their attention by whistling and drag them into the bush with you. Pop out of a hay cart and take a guy down. I think the stealth of the game is fantastically done. It does require patience. Some guards walk a wide loop and you may have to sit for a few minutes before you get your chance to take them down or sneak past undetected.The naval combat is awkward and clunky at first. At times in the beginning of the game it's somewhat of a bummer. After a few upgrades to your ship's weapons and armor, naval combat is a lot of fun. After you get used to the controls and motion of how to operate the ship, the naval combat is a whole game by itself. Launch mortars, use heavy cannon fire, chain shot (it's a real thing.. pirates would actually chain two cannonballs together and fire them simultaneously from two cannons to basically cut a ship in half (which in the game is extremely under-powered with that in mind)). After you take a ship over you can use it to refill your ship's health bar, lower your wanted level or send it to your fleet.The fleet is a little hidden gem in this game. It's a turn based, strategy game, very similar to Sid Meyer's Pirates table top game. Pick a place you want to go, choose the ship you want to send to the place and that ship will run the mission in real time. Some missions can go as long as 24 hours. So basically send it on a mission, and come back tomorrow. It operates through Ubisoft's U-Play channel so as long as you're connected to that you can turn off your console or keep playing after you send for a mission. This feature of the game, for those of you who like strategy games and whatnot, will add replay value to the game after you beat it and unlock everything.The main story itself follows a selfish, Edward Kenway. He's a pirate who crosses paths with just about every known pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy. I didn't really care about the story line itself as much as I just used it to unlock new features and areas to explore. There are a multitude of missions that have you follow someone without being spotted and also have you eavesdrop on their conversations as they walk about. The following is an easy challenge and while you have to do it often it doesn't get too tired. The eavesdropping on the other hand sorta sucks. Nothing worth repeating is said during the conversations so you don't actually have to listen. You just have to stand in the green circle without being seen. While it's just like following people, it gets tired a lot quicker. You inevitably end up killing the person anyway.So some of the nuances that irked me a bit, but didn't drag me to say don't get this game: Eavesdropping missions (like following missions but worse). Sea shanty chasing while at first was good to get my feet wet with how to move through the world got to be a pain in the ass later in the game because the game knew you were good at it. The rope dart is really cool but you don't get it til you're done. Every now and then Ed glitches during a fight, but only while raiding a ship. You can get the best swords in the game after about 20 minutes of play. You can get the second best guns in the game after about 20 minutes of play. You can buy crafting items instead of hunting animals to craft armor upgrades which sorta takes away from the immersion.Which reminds me... The parts of the game when you're out of the Animus and in the office building are kinda lame. The graphics for that part of the game a little lower resolution than the in Animus graphics. Also none of that part of the game lends towards anything at all. It gets a few Xbox achievements and that's it.After starting the DLC: Freedom Cry, I really gotta hand it to the developers at Ubisoft. It's a much heavier attitude compared to the main game. It's still fun, but you play as Ed's quartermaster, Adwale, an escaped slave. You're on a mission to free more slaves. And other stuff. In the towns you'll see slaves on an auction block and in cages and being beaten. Though it's not part of the mission, you can free them by killing their captors. The way it's designed, even though it's a game you actually feel like you shouldn't leave them behind so you go about killing overseers and freeing slaves. The bad guys in the DLC are a bit tougher as their moves are lot less predictable than the main game. You get a ship and set about the ocean taking over slave ships and freeing them as well. The way the game makes you feel as you play it actually lends towards how great it is. I don't think too many games have touched on such a taboo topic like slavery in such a well delivered way. It's tasteful yet displays the violence of the era.Didn't play the multi-player too much. I got my feet wet on it and I will say that the controls are similar but there is a very rigid set of rules, not only to how you play it, but how to move in general. That strict set of rules really turned me off to the multi-player which I didn't really care about in the first place.So minus the little nuances that irked me, this is a solid game and I can't wait to get into the past titles. I had a lot of fun with it and I'm actually still playing the Fleet mini game. You are a pirate with ninja skills and big ass ship with lots of guns (Congrats, you've earned your Man Card). 70+ hours on the main game. 7+ on the DLC. However many hours you want on the Fleet minigame. Multi-player seems like it will get old fast. 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play.

I watch all their shows all the time.  This game is the best WWF game there is SO FAR.The hair on wrestlers with long hair (Kane, Y2J, Lita...) are just joke!  They look 2D and seem out of place from the rest of the body.  The characters themseleves look close enough to the real person.  The character animation is good.......P>The controls take awhile to get used to.  I prefer fighting in one on one battles instead of fighing more people because it's really hard to fight more than one person.  It's hard to tell who you're locked on to and you may just end up fighting the ref.The story mode is a joke!  You fight 3 or 4 matches before it ends.  Some story!  You get a little branching paths to deside which belt you want but they're all basically the same.  The only reason you would want to keep playing it is to unlock the secret items. ...There are a lot of matches in the game.  Tag, royal rumble, hell in the cell, TLC, iron man, i quit, etc.  This is the part you would probebly play the most.  It's funner to just  play those matches instead of the story mode.The last thing in this game is the Create a Superstar mode.  You can unlock extra things from the story mode to add to your character.For my final say, this game is just fun to play with your friends or once in awhile.  It gets boring quick.  In order to improve this game, they need to make the story mode much BETTER and LONGER.  The WWF type storylines you see on tv are NO WHERE to be found in this game.  I was hoping you would get to go to all the PPVs and shows.  Instead you do: RAW, Smackdown!, Wrestlemania and then that's the end.  WWF fans should not waist their money to just play as their favorite wrestlers.  Save it for the expensive PPVs instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0050SW4OC","description":"","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"Another great golf game - fun, challenging, and full of content","reviewText":"I've always been a fan of the Hot Shots Golf series, and this game doesn't disappoint.  It's one of my favorite games on the PS Vita so far, and I've definitely gotten more than my money's worth.If you're unfamiliar with the Hot Shots Golf series, it's been around for more than a decade.  Unlike the Tiger Woods series of golf games, Hot Shots Golf goes for a deliberately cartoony, over-the-top visual presentation.  Don't let initial impressions fool you, though - the underlying gameplay is deep and can be very challenging.  This game still sticks with the old-fashioned three button press system for hitting golf shots (push once to start swing, push again to set power, push once more to hit accurately), with the usual additions of allowing you to impart spin and extra power.  The single-player part of the game primarily consists of a series of 40-something 9 or 18 hole events across the game's 6 different courses.  A good portion of the events have modified rules to keep things interesting (maybe you get extra strokes if you hit in bunkers, maybe it's windy and rainy, etc.), and all the events have an optional bonus objective which usually is considerably more challenging than just winning the event.The game starts easy enough, but near the end both the courses and the scores you need to shoot on those courses become very challenging.  Some of the optional objectives are even harder.  If you read mainstream reviews of this game, many critics have negative opinions about the game's difficulty, but I think a lot of those critiques are off-base.  The difficulty ramps up slowly, so you have plenty of time to master the more advanced techniques you need to finish the latter stages of the game.  If you are skilled, you can win all events without luck - just like in real golf - although luck at certain key moments doesn't hurt.  There's certainly no luck involved in hitting good shots: if you have good timing, the ball goes where you ask it to go.  Most importantly, the game provides all the tools necessary to help you improve and overcome the most difficult courses.  There's a practice mode which allows you to play any hole an indefinite number of times with any conditions you like, so if certain holes (or even certain shots on certain holes) are giving you a lot of trouble, just experiment and practice to your heart's content until you figure out how to best approach that hole.  Good shot selection becomes as important as execution by the end of the game, so don't be surprised if you have to experiment with different shot shapes and clubs to figure out how to play the hard courses (especially the final course) in a reasonable manner.  Every time I failed to win a tournament, there was always something I could improve on.I wouldn't say that any of the touch-screen or gyroscopic capabilities of the PS Vita add anything useful to the gameplay, but they don't detract from the game either.  The graphics are fantastic, and the audio is, for the most part, well done.  Each character only has a small number of catchphrases, so it can get a bit repetitive to hear them saying the same things over and over, but that's just a minor quibble.  A 9 hole round only takes about 10 minutes to play, so you can get a quick session in while on a car (if you're not driving!) or during a lunch break.  In any case, if you need to stop playing immediately, you can always put the PS Vita to sleep in the middle of the round and then wake up the PS Vita later.Considering how few courses there are, the game lasts for a surprisingly long time.  If you want to 100% complete the single-player and unlock all of the items in the game's shop (there's equipment, music selections, art, additional outfits for characters, etc.), expect to put in at least 40 hours.  The game does a good job of constantly providing you with rewards, so you always feel a sense of progression, even if you're having difficulty winning events.  There's also a multi-player component, although it basically consists of playing a round by yourself and then posting your scores to a global server.  You can also play with friends locally, although I never had the opportunity to try this feature out.  Then again, in real life golf is ultimately a solo game, so it's not too surprising that the multiplayer is a lot like the single player.Are there any negatives to the game?  There are a few minor improvements which I think would make the game more enjoyable.  It'd be nice if there were more courses - 6 isn't really very many, although fortunately none of them are similar to each other.  And if you've played a lot of Hot Shots Golf in the past, don't expect anything dramatically new here.  Nevertheless, on balance, Hot Shots Golf is a lot of fun.  It's a polished, deep, challenging game with a good amount of content.  If you enjoy playing golf in video games, definitely give this game a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

After almost a decade, Mario 64 still stands as the standard for all 3D platforms on any console to date; if you think games like Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank and even Banjo-Kazooie rival or best the ingenuity of Mario 64, then you have been completely mistaken: Those games are great because they used Mario 64's blueprint-- they should be viewed as homages to the finest 3D platformer ever, and that's that. Mario DS takes the graphics and gameplay of the 1996 classic and adds a fresh coat of paint to them. This time around, players control not only Mario but Yoshi, Wario and Luigi as well. While this approach could have been a short-lived novelty by all accounts, it succeeds by utilizing different attributes to each character a la Super Mario Bros. 2-- Mario is well-balanced, Luigi can jump higher than the other characters, and Yoshi is much more sprightly that his counterparts. Wario, on the other hand, is a sluggish oaf who makes up for his shortcomings with extra muscle-- the addition of these character attributes adds more depth and replay to a game that was never lacking in either department in the first place.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2005"}

Frantz 2.0","summary":"Decent Zelda Title","reviewText":"This game was a little different for me. I'm so used to using the D-pad to control the character that controlling everything via stylus was the most frustrating thing for me in this game. I got used to it after a bit and died countless times because the stylus either didn't respond to what I wanted to do or I overcorrected and fell off of something. Other than that this game was great. The storyline was awesome, the ability to customize your ship was nice, and the \"dungeons\" werent too difficult, which I really enjoyed. Plus, if you register it online with Nintendo you get a free special \"feather\" stylus to go with the game... pretty cool. I didn't think the game was too short like some reviewers have wrote. I'm actually glad it didn't go on longer. Most Zelda handheld games I've played have disappointed me and didn't live up to the Zelda standard, but this game does.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Silent HELL","reviewText":"Silent Hill revolutionized the Survival Horror Genre by creating a world that attempts to scare the player on a deep, psychological level. Previous Survival Horror titles (Clock Tower, Alone in the Dark, and Resident Evil) relied upon sudden and unexpected encounters with enemies to get you to jump out of your chair, whereas Silent Hill introduced a world of subconscious, and was not simply a test of your reflexes.The basic story to this game has already been told, so I'll move on. There are so many elements that work together to make Silent Hill an excellent horror experience that it is hard to even begin writing what makes this title the best in Survival Horror. I guess I'll start with the basics.I considered the graphics to this game one of the best during its time. Better, perhaps, than the original Resident Evil. On my HD TV, the pixels are more noticeable than they were on my regular tube, but considering how into the game you'll be, this setback will quickly disappear.This is an exploratory game where you can tread every street of the New England town. Often objectives are made very clear, and the desired destinations are always marked on the in-game map. The map shows your current location, the direction you are facing, and where you have already been, like a GPS. It's very unlikely you'll ever get lost as you explore Silent Hill, but don't think it will be a walk in the park. You will be faced with quite a few challenges.Streets often have obstructions (or mysteriously drop into oblivion) and you have to search for hidden routes to reach desired destinations.Strange horrors come flying at you as you explore Silent Hill. Harry carries a radio that screams white noise every time a Demon is around. Since the fog constantly obscures your vision, and no street lights work at night, you turn in circles with your gun pointing at unseen monstrosities, the white noise getting louder the closer They make their way to you.You are required to solve many puzzles in order to advance in the game, some of which are morbid poems you must analyze to extract the riddle of opening a locked door, or to receive a vital item.Interrelated with the exploratory aspect of the game is the downright dark and haunting atmosphere of Silent Hell. In addition to the town and its many streets, you will have to search a few buildings that Harry suspects his daughter to be. Imagine treading alone the dark halls of a rundown elementary school, or the dank rooms of a deserted hospital, or beneath the streets of an abandoned waterworks. Imagine visiting a soulless amusement park at night where the spinning rides are devoid of any occupants. Occasionally the sleeping, haunted town goes into a deep REM state, where buildings and streets and hallways shape shift. Doors that were not there before are there now. Streets that led one way go another. At first, you may blame this on your own inattentiveness, but eventually the changes of things will become too obvious for you to so easily blame yourself. Walls formerly white will appear charred and rusted, adorned with strung up corpses. The monsters become even more monstrous during these transformations. Regular streets turn into metal gratings, and through the gaps you can look into an endless void as if the whole town is just a floating ROCK teetering on the edge of reality and someone's nightmarish delusions. And somewhere in this madness is your daughter, and what's left of Harry's sanity, which he himself comes to question.The music of the game pounds and screams, often with no consistent rhythm that coheres perfectly with the insanity of the world you have just entered.As if that was not enough to go out and get this game, arguably the best trademark of all the Silent Hill games is its ability to explain the chaotic world of Silent Hill through suggestion, rather than the answers being spelled out for you in dialog or movie scenes (cutscenes). This is a trick the Japanese in general have implemented and mastered over the years. Often the end result leaves a lot of topics open to discussion on Silent Hill forums. It's usually up to the player to make an effort at interpreting the horror.This is perhaps why Silent Hill is more effective as a horror game than other titles. The events that occur in the game is not of natural phenomena that can be explained by science like what we have with Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark, nor is the problem as simple as trying to outrun a serial killer like what you have in Clock Tower.Silent Hill works to scare you in so many ways a horror enthusiast that doesn't even play video games would find it worth their while to buy a PS2 just to play the series (at least the first 3 games). It's the one game that got me into gaming in the first place.And after you finish with Silent Hill (although you may want to periodically return) you can dive right into another very scary series of games called Fatal Frame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2002"}

Being as this is my first Shin Megami Tensei game, I won't be comparing this to others in the series.  So, on to the review!Graphics (score 8/10): Graphics aren't bad.  They're not as spectacular that they could be for the PS2 but I've never really been one to nitpick over graphics.  The art style is very anime-ish, so if you don't like that, beware.  I really like that style, though, so it was not a problem for me.Music (score 7/10): Well, how much you like this music will depend on how much you like Rap and J-pop with nonsensical lyrics.  I'm not really fond of it, but neither do I hate it, so I was pretty neutral towards the music.  The thing that really bugs me, though, is that the songs start to become really repetitive after awhile.  Part of this is due to the fact that there aren't many locations in the game, so you hear that location's song a lot.  The music does change up as you progress past certain points in the game, but it does little to alleviate the feeling of \"song overload\".  There IS voice acting, and it is very good.  So, no complaints there.Characters (score 9/10): Well, the main characters (aside from your avatar character, which I'll get to later) are very well developed, and the NPCs even have very good character development.  Everyone has great character depth and feels like they could be a real person, with real personalities.  However, your main character is a strange anomaly in a game filled with deep personality characterizations.  He doesn't even have a default name (let's call him Minato for the purposes of this review), nor does he possess a personality of any kind.  Yep, it's another \"silent protagonist\"- a tired RPG convention that I'm frankly getting sick of.  I mean, when Dragon Quest VIII did it, it was pushing it, but now I'm just sick of it.  Main characters are just not memorable or likeable when they are mute.  Well, glad I got that out of my system.  At least the other characters make up for it.  Another thing of interest, the social link system has you talking to various NPCs, which is basically a dating/friendship sim.  Answering \"correctly\" for each person will increase your social link strength and benefit your Personas (which are monsters you can summon to aid you in battle).  I must say that after playing through this, I'm starting to feel that Minato is either a social whore or a sociopath.  You spend all your time simply choosing whatever answer will please the person you're currently with, even if it blatantly contradicts what you just said to another person.  Minato is basically manipulating these people for his own gain (the Personas' strength) just like a sociopath.  And the way that he just gives whatever answers will please people is kinda whore-ish.  If you think about it that way while you're playing, it's hilarious.  I would've liked the ability to choose whatever answer I want without being penalized (if you choose wrongly, you won't strengthen the social link and power up your personas).  Although I suppose the game developers had to give you some incentive to talk to people, otherwise their dating/friendship sim would've been completely worthless.  Anyway, I knock a point off for Minato's lack of personality.Story (score 9/10): The story itself is very interesting.  It involves a bunch of Japanese High School students discovering that there is a special extra hour in the night called the \"Dark Hour\" that most people do not experience, and that there are monsters that come out during this time called Shadows.  And, of course, only they have the power to fight the Shadows.  The story just evolves from there, and is very entertaining.  I also liked the themes of the story, which include elements of Jungian psychology, various philosophies, suicide and mortality, responsibility, and even a little bit of existentialism.  On the negative side, while I love the story itself, the pacing could've been better.  I really complain about this more in the gameplay section (and knock points off the score there), but I'll make mention of it here.  You must wade through bunches of only mildly interesting filler consisting of just going to school and talking to people before relevant portions of the story are revealed.  If only the pacing of the story was better, this game could've been that much more enjoyable.Battle System (score 8/10): Well, battles are turn-based, which I like.  The party is AI-controlled.  I would've preferred to control them myself, but their AI is pretty darn good, so hat's off to the game developers.  I do wish they had replaced irritating magic names like \"Agi\" and \"Bufu\" with simple to understand thing like \"Fire\" and \"Ice\".  I don't see why they couldn't; every other RPG has already done this and it is very helpful.  You can see enemies on-screen, which is also pretty cool (no random encounters here! ...not that I really mind random encounters).  Anyway, there's not much to else to say here.Gameplay (score 6/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, Persona 3 has several aspects which normally spell doom for an RPG:  randomly generated dungeon floors (I'm not a fan of these), a time-based gameplay system (this game operates on a \"day by day\" system, where time passes in a day by entering certain locations and choosing to \"spend time\" with people), AI-controlled party members, being limited to a single town/dungeon for the duration of the game, and a dating/friendship sim that constitutes a huge portion of gameplay.  Sounds like a recipe for disaster, doesn't it?  Surprisingly, it isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, but it's still bad.  That's right, you heard me.  First, let's discuss the good points:The randomly generated floors of the dungeon aren't too difficult to navigate, so that's good.  The AI of your party is pretty good, especially compared to other games, like Kingdom Hearts (in which your A.I.-controlled party members are idiots).  The dating/friendship sim isn't too bad since the individual stories of the NPCs are pretty interesting.Now, having gotten the good points out of the way, let's discuss the bad:I must say that this game is really tedious and there is a feeling of excessive grinding throughout (which I despise).  I mean, all RPGs have a little grinding (and I love RPGs) but this is just ridiculous.  You spend most of your time courting various \"friends\" in the ONE town of the game and the other half of your time is spent grinding through the ONE dungeon in this game.  So, you see how this can get tedious after awhile (and this game is long!).  I kind of wish they had cut out 70% of the grind and just made it a shorter game because the pacing feels like your crawling along.  If you've ever wondered why other RPGs have teenagers unrealistically skipping school and traveling across the world, it's because doing it the realistic way by having them attend school every day (like Persona 3) is tedious as all heck.  I sort of felt like I was going stir crazy after awhile from being stuck in the same repetitive locations--the couple times that the characters went on vacation to somewhere new I was like--OMG! Something different!!!  Unfortunately, the vast majority of your time is spent in that one town or that one dungeon.  Despite its flaws, strangely, I still found this game to be fun, but it just doesn't merit a higher score in this section.  There is one really good thing that would make you want to replay this game--there's a new game plus option which allows you to keep all your weapons, items, Personas in the compendium, money, and your main character's level.  So, if you play it again, you can breeze right through (well, sort of, it still takes a long time).  I'd probably enjoy this game much more on the second play-through since the majority of the grind is already done.Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I feel so conflicted about this game; on the one hand, it's tedious and irritating to wade through all the dreck to get to the interesting bits of story, but on the other hand, the game is oddly compelling and enjoyable to play in spurts.  In fact, I think this game would have been much better if it were shorter.  I don't normally say things like that, but if they had cut out some of the calendar days so that the game takes place over half a year instead of a full year (so that the game concludes in 50 hours instead of 100+), then maybe it wouldn't have felt so tedious and grinding.  They could've cut out some of the filler and more concisely told their story, which would have made this game amazing.  Still, I enjoyed this game enough to try playing other games in the series.  However, I honestly can't decide whether I should recommend this game or not.  This game seems to be rather hit or miss for people, so I suppose the best way to know whether or not you will like this game is to just rent it or buy it, and just see for yourself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2009"}

I was NOT let down, after a few hours of playing yesterday and today I can say that I am happy I got this game day one. Seeing as other releases that I have paid full price for and was like WTF? I finally feel like I got my money's worth with in a game.On to the game itself, the driving is spectacular. I say this because it is just like old school arcade driving and basically anyone can get this game put it in hop in a car and be awesome at driving. Aside from that the KUNG FU is a heck of a lot of fun but is kind of repetitive regardless of the different combos that can be learned. With that said it should be noted that this is not a shooter game, you can have guns but this is not the way you will kill most enemies. Most of the time you will be fighting which to me is a good thing because shooting really takes no skill and gets real boring, it seems every game has guns these days. The story is really good, I am almost done with it. I would say this game is easily beatable in 12 hours. Although, the side missions and collectibles are actually useful to do so you can obtain certain upgrades like health and money to buy new sweet vehicles. A little more info on the side missions; the side missions to me do not feel like annoying side missions, most of the time I find myself having fun doing them and doing them without bother.In an all around way I would say this is one of the best games this year and should be on your to play list because it is truly a good game.

Though it was not as good as the Final Fantasy games, it is a decent RPG. I am glad I have it again, since the SNES cart is a rare find these days.The original 16-bit graphics and music have been restored, making the game feel very retro. This is a major plus for me, because I cannot imagine Playstation quality graphics on such a tiny system. Every element of the original is here: the battle system, the characters, the secrets, and the stories. The story is typical RPG standard, which now seems cliched since all the similar RPGs have come out on the PSX. But I always say that the originals are the best, and I am not wrong in this case.The only real drawback to this version is the often fuzzy sound, which can be quite annoying. The editorial review mentioned that the sound is a bit tinny, but I found it more fuzzy. Maybe it is just a problem with my GBA, but I haven't noticed it on any other game.BOF is a nastalgia trip for me, and will prove just as good for first time players.

{"product_name":"B00007KQC4","description":"Resident Evil 2 FOR GAMECUBE","reviewerName":"Yuri Cunha \"Juggalo\"","summary":"A fine port","reviewText":"In this game, you take control of a cop called Leon Scott Kennedy, who is in his first day of job; and a woman named Claire Redfield looking for her brother Chris Redfield (one of the main character of the original game). Unfortunately, they're both unlucky. The whole Raccoon City is infected by a new virus, who turn people into zombies, dogs into monstruous creatures, and other horrendous monsters. Considered by many the best Resident Evil charpter ever, it's finally on the Nintendo GameCube... Let's check out what's it all about:- Graphics: Ok, this is the worse part in here, but it's not that bad. Do you notice any differences in this graphics and PSOne's, talking about this game? Yes, you do.. But it's not a big difference, not a thing to notice at first. In the GameCube version, the characters' and monsters' faces can be seen clearly, unlike in the PSOne versions. Background is the same as PSOne's. So, if you were expecting a graphic evolution like from PSOne's Resident Evil to GameCube's, then I'm sorry.. You'll be disappointed in the graphical part.- Sound: There is not a difference between this version and PSOne's if you're talking about sound. Sometimes the music can be too loud when characters are speaking, so you won't understand wha they're saying. But that's no problem. Just ajust the sound effects and you're done. The soundtrack is scary and classical, voice acting is not bad either.- Fun: It's such a great thing to play this fine Resident Evil charpter with the awesome GameCube controller. It feels like a new game. Even though I've played (and beaten) this game before in the PSOne, I must say that I was still scared of those weird corridors with that scary soundtrack. The game story is really good. Overall, this game is really fun if you're a Resident Evil fan. You have to beat the game twice with every character, because both have 2 scenarios, and you will not know the whole story if you don't finnish the game's four scenaries. Plus there are three mini-games. One of them is called Extreme Battle. In this one, you'll have to take and plant bombs all around the RPD, but time is limited so you have to hurry. This game can be played with many characters, incluiding Chris Redfield. Another one is called Hunk - The 4th Survivor. In this mini-game, you must get to the helicopter room, so they will rescue you (you are Hunk, the only one who survived trying to take the G-Virus from William Birkin), but it's not that easily because they have really few items and lots of zombies. The other mode is almost the same thing, except that the difficulty is extreme and you play as To-Fu (a cheese, yes), and the mini-game is called Tofu- The Survivor. Still, it's far from being my favorite Resident Evil charpter.- Educative: Ok, this game is not educative, not at all.. Lots of blood, violence, body parts falling down zombies, heads cut off and all this kind of thing, that you'll see in nearly every Resident Evil game. But there is no cussing in this game. So, parents... you should only buy this game if your children have played this kind of games before and if they do not get scared easily, unless they'll have nightmares, lots of 'em...The veredict: Resident Evil 2 i very cool game, it's in the Top 10 of the Best PSOne Games Ever. So it can't be bad... If you've played Resident Evil 2 before and you own an authentic copy for another plataform (PSOne, Dreamcast, Nintendo64 or PC), I don't think you should buy this game unless you want the whole series in the GameCube console (which is my case, because I bought the GameCube to play the whole Resident Evil series in it). If you've never played it or if you do not own this game for other plataform, it is a must-buy. One of the best Survival Horror games ever. In this game, if the suspense doesn't kill you... something else will.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2003"}

In gaming industry, 2 yrs is a very very very very very long time.  In that 2 yrs, the graphic should very top notch, the campaign should be at least 10 hr long, and have many new ODST weapons!!! Yeah~ Master Chief is super strong so they can carry gigantic weapons but not realistic for ODST.  But, what did they do? Oh let's cut down the cost by using 90% of the code in Halo 3.  Let's just mash some map, throw in weaker version of Spartan, and maybe 1-2 new weapon.  Do 10% of the code and sell it for $60! Oh wait!! Let's throw in Halo 3 Map Pack, why not~ it's already coded and give these guys early release of 3 new maps!! Brilliant! Now it's $60 package!!!  How can you guys be so blind?

It has an excellent story with some disturbing sequences, but the gameplay is dull, tired and very linear.  the graphics are pretty bland and movement is undesirable.  The weapons sound good, fire okay and run out of ammo quick.  The enemies respawn at an annoying pace and until you land a headshot, don't seem to die easy enough.  Multiplayer is fairly addictive and doesn't seem to get old.  It's unique in it's approach to the standard multiplayer first person shooter in that the maps are large, the teams are 32 players and the killstreaks are a bit more involved than the Modern warfare or Black Ops ones. This game would have made a good movie, but on it's own as a game is only moderately entertaining.  Glad I waited for it to be found at a pawn shop.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

People that aren't satisfied with a game they have payed $ 40-50 dollars for and it disapoints them because they had high expectations, many toooo high.So, now that the game is out and everyone can play it you hear the horror stories and the raving about this game. If you remember right, BF1942 was the same way. People complaining because the game did not produce what they wanted, but it was still rated the best Multiplayer game of 2002. I doubt this one will get the award for this year mainly due to all the competition out there right now but you never know do you?OK, enough of the small talk here is what I think of SW BF.The game is a lot diferent than I expected. I did have trouble installing it on my DVD drive so I tryed my CD Rwritable and it worked fine. I think it is a formatting issue as one mentioned in another review on the site.I will rate this game up to BF1942 to get this settled for good!When I started to play the game I wasen't impressed by the graphics but they are diferent. To me they seemed faded out but maybe it is my graphics card I have a 5200 GEFORCE FX 128 MB  not the best but not the worst either. Single player had the best graphics especially on Hoth and Naboo or what ever it is called. I really haven't played all the planets or levels on single player but those few I have.The AI is single player is a lot better than it was in sp BF1942. and they don't try to all come after you at once which is good.The vehicles are relalistic. The AT-AT is slow like it should be but the fire power should be greater than it is. I know they had to make the game as fare as possible. I agree. I played in a few of the other vehicles and they are alright nothing great about them. They all are just as good as BF1942 or even better.The maps are small but so were BF1942's and the same thing happened when you flew a plane out of the battlefield, it would threaten you with your life so no change there.The sounds need some improvement really. Too weak. Need more of a push. Really, if the the sounds were great this game would of been 10X better. Maybe they'll release a patch for this in the near future.Multiplayer is the same. You shoot and be shot. Nothing different than it was in BF1942. The controls of your character are a little different than in BF1942. For instance does anyone know how to get the dark trooper's jetpacks going? I tryed to figure it out but couldn't find it in the list of controls? Let me know.Here's what I like about this game.Good AI and single player even though it is no different than Multiplayer a server with bots instead of real players.......is not bad and 10X better than BF1942.Graphics for the most part are good but different than what I am use to seeing. Really, single player had the best graphics which were good.Interface needs some improvement but it is unique. I like how when you choose a mission to play weither in single player or multiplayer it shows the planet from space then goes to the surface then to the map like it is zooming in on the location. That's pretty cool in my book.Load times for missions or servers are a little slow but so were BF1942's. No change.In all, this gameis no different than BF1942 was just a few minor things as I mentioned above.What I don't like about this game:Controls need some improvement in mainly how your guys accomplishes his tasks like shooting or equipment use. Vehicle controls are the same as BF1942 and that's OK with me.Multiplayer needs tweaked a little but a patch is out (1.0) for improvements on the interface and a few other things.Graphics in multiplayer need improvement for the most part. To faded out for me.Sound needs a big improvement! Some of the laser guns sounds way to weak for my taste. Some are OK like the guns of the AT_AT are close to the movie sounds. The back ground music is good as I expected with a star wars theme to it.Expected.Overall, not as bad as some are saying it is but like any game out there it needs some work. Really, it's not as bad as some of the games I've played for example Soldnier that was released in July of this year or what every it is called was the worst FPS I've ever played! Horrible. So it could be a lot worse. If you like something different than killing Nazis or Americans in WWII then this is the game for you. I am a big Star Wars fan and have been for years since the Return of the Jedi was released back in 83' when I was eight. I had to have this game of course as did so many others but don't buy it just looking for something that's going to knock your socks off like Call of Dutys' Multiplayer did for me and the newest release United Offensive! These make this game and BF1942 look like little toys so take this rating for what is worth to you. I do recommend this game to the general public but don't get your expectations to high or you will be let down and don't compare it to any other FPS other than BF1942 because that is what it is based off.Overall 4/5Recommended for casual online players or FPS fan, hard core fans will be disapointed most likely.Other (better)options out there for hard core fans:C of D: United Offensive (awesome game)BF1942 (game play the same as Star Wars BF)Far Cry and DOME 3: (The best graphics out there right now on the market and great gameplay-more for single player though)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"My Least Favorite Uncharted, Yet Still Better than Most.","reviewText":"*** No Spoilers ***The Uncharted games are by far my favorite game series and I have played them many times through, because of this I was very much anticipating the release of Uncharted 3. Sadly, after a play through and a half, Uncharted 3 has not lived up to my expectations or the Uncharted series. Below are my reasons why I feel this. They are my personal opinions and I am not saying that all will hate this game, I am simply stating the facts as I see them. I also purchased the hard-copy walkthrough book. It is an amazing guide for this game and truly helped. One quick note is that the game gets much better as you play on. The first half is very slow, dull and boring. The second half is much more interesting and the levels and their design are great. Seems like they spent more time on the later levels than the beginning.What they did Right:+ Basically everything in Uncharted 2 has traveled over to Uncharted 3. The menus, options, trophies, statistics are all basically the same. Some of the bonuses are now downloadable content instead of being included in the game like usual. They just wanted more money out of it.+ Great graphics which are a bit better than Uncharted 2.+ There are no boss fights. This could be a good or bad thing depending on the player. I rather like not having a boss fight in the Uncharted games. God of War games, yes I want a boss.+ Flashbacks, hallucinations, and blurred vision really made an interesting impression on the game play. Finding out a little of Drakes past boosted the story for a while.+ Voice acting is fairly solid as usual, however the lack of jokes and little comedic relief was also a huge let down after Uncharted 2 did so well with that.What they did Wrong:- Aiming over all is a little different.- Story is lacking interest and depth. I lost track of what the mission even was due to just being bored.- To much gunplay and hand to hand combat. I wanted more of an adventure game, not a shooter game.- The hand to hand combat gets really old very fast and it still not perfected. I just want to punch a guy out, not have to keep pushing the triangle or circle buttons.- When locked in hand to hand combat, other enemies will contiune to shoot at you. More realistic, yet very frustrating.- Characters now have this annoying habit of touching walls when they are near them. Sort of like a balance thing if they are running or maneuvering though narrow areas. I find it distracting.- Treasures now lifelessly blink in a quick flash instead of the usual polished shine. I hate this new technique for making the treasures semi-visible.- There are to many cut scenes and times in the game which they disable your control or ability to run. Very distracting and takes you out of the game. I want complete control over the character at all times and much less cut scenes to interrupt the game play.Over-all Uncharted 3, as well as the other Uncharted games are much better than any other game out there. The Uncharted series has perfectly combined action and adventure with breathtaking graphics and pristine control while still focusing on a story which keeps the player motivated. The majority of games lack most, if not all of these qualities which the Uncharted games have raised the bar in.My idea as to why Uncharted 3 has not fulfilled what I expected it to is this; I feel like Uncharted 3 was rushed. They wanted this release by the end of this year due to preparations for Uncharted 4 as the main title release for Playstation 4 which is said to release holiday 2013. That is just an idea as to why UC3 seemed to be lacking in areas which the other games excelled in. Times in UC3 seem almost sloppy.My 3 favorite parts of this game are most of the chase scenes, The cruise ship level (Cruisin' for a Brusin') is amazing, and the plane (The Stowaway) level where the plane falls apart and crashes in the desert. The cruise ship and the plane are amazing levels and truly impressed me in this otherwise dull game. Those scenes seem to have had the most time spent on them, as they were flawless. Unlike the rest of the game which I spent most of my time searching for treasure and figuring out what I need to do next.Like my review title suggests, this game is very good in the sea of games. However it is by far the lesser of the 3 Uncharted games. The story, game play, control, combat, and exploration simply do not impress after such amazing titles like Uncharted 1 & 2. It is a great game, and I will probably play it again on crushing, however I will not come near to enjoying it as much as the other Uncharted games. Hopefully they take their time on Uncharted 4, which will be the first big title for the Playstation 4.PSN Name: adrielaugust","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"Katalizator","summary":"Don't listen to idiots","reviewText":"Alot of the video and/or written reviews from game sites will tell you that this game is like a combination of God of War and Zelda; or a copy of this; or a copy of that. They are completely wrong. I wish people would stop comparing awesome titles such as Darksiders to games that have somewhat similar mechanics.This game is NOT GoW or Zelda, nor does it feel like either. God of War is God of War. Zelda is Zelda. And Darksiders is Darksiders! It's really fun and awesome to look at. Really smooth controls when it comes to fluidity, and HUGE bosses that make you think, \"oh damn, there's no way I can kill this guy!\" I love it. It feels like you're playing an animated comic book. A very BRUTAL comic book.It has a perfect blend of cartooniness vs realism. Not too much of either. A game that is developed to be \"real life like\" in it's entirety is horrible. Because in real life, if you get shot once you're dead(most of the time). And a game that's too cartoony feels like you're playing pokemon. Darksiders has the perfect balance of both.There's plenty of upgrades for weapons, an awesome story, and alot of all around enemy mutilation as well as really satisfying combos that are not too hard to execute. Just because it happens to be a hack n slash does NOT mean that it is a GoW copy. This game is it's own game. (Don't take me wrong, I love GoW to death).I'm actually extremely happy to finally have a game that isn't another FPS. It seems that most games developers want to release these days are FPS games. (can't wait for Dante's Inferno too).If you're a fan of hack n slash games with a perfectly blended amount of intriguing puzzles here and there, & a great story then Darksiders will satisy your needs. It IS NOT a rip off of any other game, and anyone that says so needs to ease up on their analyiticalism and just enjoy a great game for what it is instead of comparing it to everything else. Darksiders is bad@ss and I can't wait to resume my game after writing this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Anja Rebekka Schultze","summary":"Machine Gods and Chrystals!","reviewText":"For many RPG fans this game was longed for from the time we first heard it was in production, it was a reason to get a Playstation 3 when it was said it would only be out for that machine. However with all that anticipation the actual game was a kind of a letdown. I think that Final Fantasy 13 actually suffers from being so anticipated. It is an average to good turned based JRPG, but being a Final Fantasy game I think many pepole had expected more. I know I sure did.Final Fantasy 13 had a rather ok story. It is set in a sort of futuristic world where the huge city of Cocoon is being protected and ruled by machine Gods known as fal'Cie. Now these creatures sometimes choose to bestow magickal abilities on human beings, making them into l'Cie, servants of sort that the machine Gods give a mission to, called a focus. Now a l'Cie never know exactly what his or her focus is, and there is a time limit, if the focus is not completed by then the unfortunate l'Cie will turn into a ravaging monster, if they manage to complete their focus then they are turned to crystal, so it is kind of a loose/loose situation. In addition pepole generally fear l'Cie, especially those from Pulse, the land below the floating and protected city of Cocoon. In fact pepole fear Pulse so much that when a Pulse fal'Cie is discovered in Cocoon in the start of the game the corrupt and totalitarian government decides to banish all the pepole living in those areas of the city, effectively killing them. It is this event, battling to stop pepole from being banished, or just to stay alive in the start of the game that bring the main characters together.Now off course the main characters rather quickly become l'Cie and the game is mostly about them trying to survive while at the same time finding a way to control their own destiny instead of having various forces decide for them. The story is rather interesting, and I will not give to much of it away here, however the problem is that there is to little story compared to to much grinding, fighting and general game play. The story is so important in a computer RPG but I feel that in FF 13 it get pushed to the side for combat, something which really do not work to well since the combat system is horrible.Ah yes, the combat system. This game is one of those semi real time things. Now this point in my review is just personal preference but for me semi real time do not really do it for me, I want either to have the time to think up strategy of a turned based game, or the more realistic action of a real time combat game, however I have seen good semi real time combat systems, this is not one of them, basically the game bases itself on having various paradigms or attack patterns if you will and game play is mostly about changing these around for best effect. For example you might start a battle with a paradigm where the characters cast spells to add bonuses to your character or weaken the enemy, and then shift to all out attack, and then over to a healing paradigm when the party is getting low on health. Now there are some problems with this, one is that the system is hard to get into, but one you get it there is so little involvement from the player, it is just press button shift paradigm, press button shift paradigm constantly, it get very monotonous after a while. Another problem is that in the start of the game the party constantly split up meaning that the paradigms you usually use do not work and you have to grind allot to build up the characters enough to get usable paradigms so you can make it past a section where you might just have two characters to work with. The system is boring, needlessly complicated and unsuited to large parts of the game.Now for the graphics. The character graphics are breathtaking, they are so realistically made, the facial expressions are just perfect. The character design is beautiful, to bad the rest of the game is not as good. Now the animation and level design is always theatrically good, the problem is that in large parts of the game the areas are so bland. You can program a gray wall masterfully but it is still a gray wall. There is also very little variety when it comes to the enemies and in a game where there is so much grinding this becomes a problem. The bosses to usually is not that impressive, they are perfectly animated, but they are boring to look at or is something one have seen a million times before. Technically I would give the game's graphics 10 out of 10 but it often fails in the art department to say it like that.Now many have complained that this game is to linear. I honestly have no problem with a linear game. I do not need there to be multiple endings and all that to enjoy myself, but this game at times is not just linear with the story, in the first part of the game you literary just walk in corridors. This gets better halfway through the game, but before then you can not even wander of to explore different rooms, you just walk along the path, grind, walk and grind and walk some more, then it do not help that the game's environment is created technically good.You have six characters in this game. Lighting is the chick on the front cover, she is an ex soldier and is your typical though girl, then you have Snow, and idealistic freedom fighter, Vanille, the required cute girl, Fang, another though girl but a bit more feminine this time, Hope, a young boy, there always have to be a child in JRPG's it seams, and then there is Sazh a pessimistic father looking for his son that have a baby chocobo living in his afro. The characters are interesting and well developed, but hell do they whine. In most Final Fantasy games the characters experiences bad things, often they are put in emotionally difficult situations or seam to have no hope of survival and there is often deep emotions and that is fine, it is part of what makes Final Fantasy good, one starts to care about the characters. However in this game there is hardly a cut scene without one or more of the characters on their knees on the ground crying their despair to the sky and mourning their cruel fate. Now I understand that it is not particularly funny to have the future prospect of either becoming a monster or a crystal, but seriously Auron from Final Fantasy 10 is dead and Tidus don't really exist but somehow they manage to not behave like a emo on speed.The voice acting for this game, at least the English that we had on while playing through it is fine. In fact every technical aspect of this game is great, that is why I give it 3 stars, the story is good and the technical qualities of the game is better than in any other JRPG I have ever played. I am sure fans of JRPG and fantasy games in general will enjoy this. However the game is not up to part with other Final Fantasy games. I was disappointed in it. It is a middle of the three to good game, but that is not what I expect from a FF game, it is clearly one of the weaker games in the franchise. Now I really hate one to five stars, it is so hard to give an correct opinion with only five, but if this was one to then I would give the game about seven. It is good, you will enjoy it, but it is not good enough for Final Fantasy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

This makes the game very challenging.It's important to realize that the Wii has lower quality graphics than the PS3 and XBox 360 - they did this on purpose to keep the price down. It also means that normally the Wii aims towards cartooney games where it doesn't matter at all. With Call of Duty 3, the game is a much more realistic, WWII shooter. You need precise visuals to be able to see your camo-covered enemy in amongst the rubble. Where this was a challenge in the PS3 version, it was bordering on extremely difficult on the Wii because of the pixels.We love Call of Duty 3 in general - the open gameplay, the realistic environments, the storyline. We were really looking forward to the Wii controllers letting us \"live\" the experience. While some actions were pretty straightforward and became second nature after playing for a while, others were never quite right because of the Wii remote design. Buttons weren't within easy reach.The sound was exactly the same high quality as on other platforms - thundering gunfire, screams and shouts of your friends and enemies. You really get immersed into the fog of war.I also wonder why they didn't offer a widescreen version, or multi-play. The Wii obviously supports both modes, we've seen multiplay in other games and widescreen in other games. To have black bars down the left and right of the screen didn't make a lot of sense, when the game was obviously done widescreen for other platforms. And part of the whole fantastic play-for-months feature of the Call of Duty series is that the single play mode is just training for the real challenge of multi-play. Is it really hard to kill off the enemy soldiers when they keep coming in, one after the other, through the same door that they just saw their friends die in? If you snipe someone out of a spot, a friend will leap into the exact same spot to take his place. I longed for real humans to challenge me.Still, if you're a shooter fan and only have a Wii, this is definitely better than previous-generation games. It's a step up, a step in the right direction. And, with this being a launch title, I cut them some slack for not quite having figured out the best ways to use the joystick and to hone the graphics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2006"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR12","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Boeshaar","summary":"Call of Duty is losing its luster. Long in depth review","reviewText":"I've played every Call of Duty ever made, pretty extensively I might add, and in addition I've put in over +50 hours to date into Black Ops 2 to give it as fair a review as possible.Make no mistake, Black Ops 2 is just about the same as the previous iterations of Call of Duty with a futuristic paintjob. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, Call of Duty has gotten a lot of things right, but you can't help but feel \"been there, done that\" for much of the experience.SINGLEPLAYER:The campaign is what you've come to expect, killing hundreds of respawning enemies with a pretty dismal D movie action flick script and a villain who refuses to ever die. The introduction of choices and consequences add some intrigue, and the strike missions can be amusing, but I can't say that it was very memorable. I didn't bother beating it again after one playthrough, which took roughly 6 hours on Veteran difficulty.MULTIPLAYER:The weapons and killstreaks are basically the same as they have been in previous Call of Duties. Many of the older weapons are available (An-94, 870 MCS, MTAR) whereas the newer fictional weapons are just remakes of older guns like the M8A1 which is an updated M16 or the KAP-40 pistol which is a remake of the G18. Many of the familiar killstreaks are still here as well, the usual suspects of UAVs, Care packages, sentry guns, RC XDs are still here along with a few new faces like the AGR and Dragonfire drones.One of my biggest complaints of Black Ops 2, as of 11/27/12, is how poor the weapon balance is in the game. Call of Duty has always been very SMG and Hip-fire friendly, but the amount of prevalence of both in Black Ops is really disheartening.Hipfiring with an SMG is the way to go in Black Ops 2 if you want to dominate, and I feel I can say this with a an overall combat record KD ratio of +2.0 (I don't say this to brag, I state this so people don't assume I'm bad at the game and that's why I'm complaining). People who take Assault Rifles are punished and will almost always lose a 1v1 engagement in close to mid range against an SMG user. Shotguns have awful range, and without attachments will literally not reach a target further than a few feet away.The game actually encourages hipfiring in my opinion, which almost always guarantees a kill against a close range target. The nature of weapon recoil in Black Ops 2 is very random and makes it difficult to properly ADS against a moving target, hence why most people avoid this and hipfire which will almost always net a kill if it is within the general vicinity of an enemy. The poor weapon balance will often force you into an SMG class if you want to perform well and punishes players for experimenting.But this is only a miniscule problem to the elephant in the room of Black Ops 2, Treyarch have abandoned the perfectly functioning server browser of Black Ops 1 and World at War and have replaced it with, you guessed it, matchmaking. The matchmaking is identitical to the one implemented in Modern Warfare 2-3 with the difference being that rather than player hosted it's on Treyarch servers.With matchmaking you can't choose your own settings, you're forced into games with whateverTreyarch decides. For example Team Deathmatch (my favorite mode personally) is limited to 6v6 and a 75 kill limit, meaning that many times when I got high level streaks like Warthog or Lodestar (which require +10 kills in a row) the game ended 15 seconds afterwards.Another problem with matchmaking is that I have friends who don't live nearby me, and as a result when we queue as a party we get into a server that is not perfect latency for any of us. We're forced to play with 2-3 bars when playing together (yes, they've also removed latency numbers and replaced them with bars so you never actually know what your ping is).And of course the worst problem is that no one can ban the racists, the flamers (thank god for the mute botton), and of course the cheaters and the hackers. Yes  the cheaters and hackers that plagued MW2 and MW3 are back in full force, I'm talking about people who aim at you behind walls when you have Ghost/Cold blooded and players who go 40-2 headshotting everyone with an LSAT. I would especially not recommend League play to anyone, a mode which Treyarch introduced to be \"competitive\" but it is already filled with obvious aimbotters and wallhackers. It's not so bad so far in normal mode, but it's getting progressively worse and the game has only been out a few weeks. VAC and the report system are extremely ineffective at getting rid of cheaters, as anyone who has played MW2 and 3 can tell you (I have over 200 hours logged on Modern Warfare 2 and had to quit because of the prevalence of cheaters).SUMMARY:Keep in mind that despite all these flaws, Black Ops 2 is a fun game. I wouldn't have logged over 50 hours if I didn't think so. It's basic formula is very addictive and the controls and gameplay are very smooth. The pick 10 class creation system is cool and the scorestreak system is the best in the series in my opinion. But truth be told I doubt I will be playing much longer, and I will definitely NOT be buying any of their DLC thanks to the issues I've listed above.Black Ops 2 is a decent game, but it's not a great game. I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone, and would suggest that you either A) Wait for the price to drop B) Buy it on Xbox 360 or PS3 C) Avoid it all together. You won't be missing out on much.Hope this helps if you're on the fence about Black Ops 2.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2012"}

It doesn't matter to me how many millions play it online every night, what really got to me about Call Of Duty 4 was and will always be the campaign. I'd never seen a game so epic in scope; it was like being inside a Michael Bay-movie set in the Middle East, complete with the music of Hans Zimmer and James Newton-Howard. You're right there in the middle of the gun battles, bullets whissing, with numerous explosions and fighting soldiers shouting orders all around you. The opening sequence alone is fantastic; it slowly unfolds just from whose perspective you're seeing it, and then comes a startling revelation and you're hooked right in there. The mechanics of the game are linear and simple, sure (go from point A to point B, shoot, throw grenades, duck, run), but playing through it for the first time is like unearthing some gem of action-packed coolness. That sounds lame, but it's the only way to put it.And sure, the multiplayer is a lot of fun. I've had my share of hours where it was just local play or splitscreen with my buddies, and it doesn't get tiresome when there's Hardcore and different classes and weapons to explore. The maps are smaller, tighter and overall a lot more interesting than those in MW2 in my opinion. You could actually spot (or guess) the location of your attacker, and that makes it a lot more fair (which is crucial for my level of enjoyment). If you don't stand a chance, you don't stand to have any fun, ever.Speaking of challenges; you can also tackle the game on Veteran. After countless respawns and fine-tuned tactics, and lots and lots of luck, I finally made it through the absurdly difficult final task, and the little \"Mile High Club\"-achievement popped up on my screen. It may seem daunting, it may leave you in fits of rage, but I guarantee you; with the right approach and an absolutely tremendous amount of patience, it can be conquered. NowCall of Duty: World at Waron the other hand, is just downright absurdly challenging on Veteran, I'd recommend giving that an attempt next if you feel cocky about your Mile High Club-achievement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000095ZH6","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Gruesome Monster-slaying fun.","reviewText":"I bought The Suffering while waiting for something I really wanted to come out, but I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of effort and detail that has gone into this game. Be warned though, it's dark and horrific, and the game seems to really revel in showing all the gruesome ways people can be sliced up, mutilated and tortured. You play Torque, a man imprisoned in one of the harshest prsions ever built, and it's up to you to make sense of what is happening when staff and inmates alike start getting mowed down by bloodthirsty supernatural monsters which appear seemingly from nowhere. The story hits the ground running in the first few minutes of play, when your character suddenly finds his cell door open and the prison in total chaos. Once out of your cell, it's a matter of making your way through the prison, and outside, hoprfully to freedom.The thing that struck me while playing was the attention to detail present in the locations. Many of the rooms have working telephones, light switches, taps, lockers etc, and even though interacting with them sometimes proves to have no effect (flushing the toilet for example!) it's a great and realistic addition to the game world. Of course many of these things are important to the action, such as unlocking doors or finding supplies, so it pays to explore just what you can do in every new location. A word of warning also, be alert or else some parts of the game will pass you by. Some pathways and rooms containing supplies and even weapons can be completely bypassed if you are not thorough in exploring, so it pays to be cautious. This, of course, is only possible once you have cleared any areas completely of marauding monsters, and it's here that the meat of the game lies.The creatures invading the prison are pretty gruesome and relentless in their attempts to kill you. Some very Silent Hill-esque creatures inhabit this world, including agile metallic creatures with blades instead of arms and legs that just love to leap at you from the ceiling, and crawling mutants who like to pull loaded hypodermic syringes out of their skin and throw them at you like darts. Early on in the game you will be hard pushed to come through fights unscathed, so it's a blessing that healing supplies are scattered liberally throughout each stage. However, just when you find the best (in my opinion ) firearm - the shotgun - and start cackling with joy as one or two close-range blasts send the creatures flying in a hail of body parts, the game ups the challenge and starts sending wave after wave of critters at you, some of which respawn endlessly. It sounds unfair, but it's not really, as in these cases the game is either telling you to get the hell out of there, or find a way to plug up the seemingly endless stream from it's source.In several ways, the game reminds me a lot of the similar PS2 adventure \"Ghosthunter\", in that you have to run around whilst manually aiming, and things seem to be far more capable of dashing around the screen than you are. But, in a great additional aspect, you can also switch to first person view at any time, and still run around, attack and jump, etc. So that's almost two games in one, if you prefer to play it that way. Plus the weapons are a lot of fun...when I found the fire axe it was definitely playtime, heh heh...As for the plot, it's very minimal, with escaping alive being about the only important issue here. There is a sub-plot involving Torque's memory of his wife and children and what has happened to them and him leading up to to the current situation, but it's very much a peripheral issue to the main action of the game. I found Torque's constant flashbacks and visions to be rather pointless after a while, as the script doesn't give Torque any personality whatsoever (he never speaks or changes his expression during the entire game), so it's impossible to feel any sympathy or even tell what emotions he's supposed to be experiencing!The gameplay improves further once Torque gets outside of the actual prison, as the repetition of cells and offices gives way to a variety of forests, roads, rivers and cliffs, and the freedom to explore is pretty impressive (or maybe I should say that the disguising of the restraints the game uses to stop you going where it doesn't want you to go is pretty impressive!). Towards the end of the game, you'll also make it to a delapidated asylum/residence, a shoreline complete with shipwreck, and a clifftop lighthouse, and the graphics of these locations is wonderful, well worth waiting for.So I recommend this game. It's challenging, although some of the killing can be avoided if you just want to run past everything. Still want more? Well, actions such as your willingness to help other survivors (even when they might be actively hostile towards you) will change the ending you receive, or open up extra goodies if you keep certain NPC's alive long enough - pretty tough to do in some cases.  And there are several situations featuring puzzles and traps to test your problem-solving skills. There's also an \"insanity\" meter which, when full, allows Torque to transform into a super-strong monster himself and dish out insane damage....to find out how and why, you'll have to play the game. It's definitely worth a look","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0029ZBZ0I","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Great Game Once You Get Used To It","reviewText":"I got this game on sale for about $10.50 a year ago. Right away I played the first level, but quickly lost interest. I tried it again a few months later and quit in the same place. Then a couple of weeks ago I decided to give it another chance and force myself to play past that first bit. I'm really glad I did because this game is one of the better I've played in a while.I had only played one other resident evil game, Nemesis, prior to this one. If you're used of those older style games you're going to be in for a surprise. The gameplay is more like a first-person shooter, even though it's third person, then it does to the older games. The rooms aren't just a fixed camera angle backdrops, you have full-motion. You're also not alone on this adventure. You have a very competent partner to help you. The only thing your partner does badly really, is that she tends to waste ammunition.Nearly everything is done in real-time, including your inventory management. You can trade inventory back and forth between you, but you'd better be quick if there is an enemy attacking. You also have to be within proximity of each other so you can toss stuff back and forth. This leads me to one of the few complaints I have with the game. Because the inventory system take some time and is a little clunky, some of the enemies seem to pause an unnatural amount of time before attacking. It feels as though they're giving you time to at least be able to swap weapons or swap inventory. That's not to say they'll stand by and let you do it forever, but they don't take every chance they could to attack you.The other problem I had with the game, simply ammunition. You have very little ammunition in this game and no way to buy ammunition for anything except the grenade launcher. To get ammunition you must either find it, sell a weapon that uses it, or break open crates and vases to find it.  After boss fights, you end up having to go to level 2-1 or similar level with boxes towards the beginning, breaking them open and taking the ammunition, exiting the level and saving, and going right back in. It's extremely tedious and would've been done a lot better by letting you just purchase ammunition.The graphics in the game look really good. The character models are extraordinary. There are certain number of cut scenes and you'd almost think you're looking at a movie during them. Once you finish the game you can also unlock new costumes for your characters. For several different costume skins you can unlock by beating the game. I think you may be able to buy it separately for the consoles, but the PC version has the best costume of all. Sheva, your female partner, gets this awesome business suit. If you picture a slutty secretary with a short skirt, then you pretty much have an idea what this looks like. The best part is the costumes that you change to our also changed in the cut scenes!  If it matters to you, yes you do get a couple of brief instances of an upskirt due to the way the character sits, normally in pants, and there are a couple of lude poses where she's facing away from the screen but would be showing off quite a bit to the other characters.  Mostly though, she just looks smoking hot.  Just a word of warning, when you start a new game you don't get the new costumes at first. I was confused by this, but looking it up online you have to wait until you pick up your gear at the butcher shop before you change.The bosses in the game are nearly all entertaining. As long as you farmed enough ammunition from level 2-1 (or similar) to be able to face them, they're quite a bit of fun. There's even one you get to take down with a guided orbital laser bombardment. Very cool. The main villain in the game is also quite entertaining as well as powerful. There is a good chemistry between him and the character you control. The plot is pretty much the standard villain trying to take over the world fare. There's a supposedly major \"plot twist\" which is so obvious you should be able to see it coming a mile away. The main villain even chides your character for not figuring it out sooner. Still, even with the bits that don't make much sense or any sense at all the plot holds things well enough together that you'll stay around to see the end.One more final thing to warn you, even during cut scenes you shouldn't put down your controller or take your fingers off the keyboard. Some of the cut scenes require you to press certain key sequences to avoid death. They're generally pretty simple, but sometimes come up at weird times that you wouldn't expect. Just be ready.This is a game that I'm truly glad that I purchased. I'm equally glad that I actually gave it a chance to get moving before I quit at this final time. My advice would be if you do try it and don't like it at first, at least try until the second level before putting it away. I'm almost certainly going to play this again sometime in the future, if only to watch Sheva run around in her short little skirt. What can I say I have a sick mind? Even without that though, great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2012"}

With the release of KOTOR2: Sith Lords, Obsidian tried to recreate the magic that Bioware had created with the original. This is where they succeeded on some things but failed miserably on others. For one, the epic storyline from the first game was better fleshed out and was just better overall. After playing through this game, it took me roughly 33-35 hours to complete, i was disappointed not only with the ending but with the dumb mistakes the story writers and programers made. Play it through on light side and you will see what i mean (and darkside to some extent), which brings me to my other big complaint that playing through as a darkside character really doesnt change much this time around. The first game really felt like the decisions you made effected everything and made the game seem different, but KOTOR2 does a poor job of this and just seems rushed. The graphical improvements are laughable as it is clear that they just used the work bioware had done and created a storyline from that. All of that being said, the game was still great fun. While the storyline lacked and at the end a few things made no sense, it kept me interested and playing throughout. There really arent many rpgs on the xbox and there are even fewer playable ones, so that takes kotor2 from a lackluster sequel to a must play for rpg fans and xbox owners. The addition of the influence system (which you can either embrace or ignore altogether) was a decent addition although i had hoped it would effect the overall storyline a bit more. The new force powers are cool but playing through with the lightside with a jedi guardian, i only used force push, heal, and destroy droid. The stances might as well have been nonexistent as well. KOTOR2 is a fun game and would be a great addition to any xbox owners library but i cant help but feel that if bioware would have made the game the quality would have been much higher.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2005"}

The game is slow and choppy, the story is fragmented and difficult to comprehend, and there are holes bigger than the space slug's mouth.  That is in comparison to the first KOTOR.  If you're looking to enjoy a sequal I have to recommend that you avoid KOTOR 2 unless you can buy it at a steal.If we view KOTOR 2 as a stand-alone product - which is conceivable - then it has some qualities that are worth playing at least once through.  First off there is a great inventory system with a seeminly endless cornucopia of cool gadgets.  Character development is rewarding and fun.  Although the story is hard to follow, but you can play this game just for the action if necessary.  The controls are easy to use once you understand them.  And some of the character interaction is humorous, sad, and involving - to a degree.  Perhaps the best selling point - to me - is the long gameplay.  I think a novice player who takes their time could go 50+ hours on this game.So it's all in your viewpoint.

The game is not bad at all but just couldn't keep me interested even though it has a good story.The game looks fantastic on the Wii U maybe even better than the other versions. You can move the entire HUD to the gamepad and have a more cinematic experience. So visually the game is very nice.The controls are good for the most part but in some cases they just don't respond well. For example when free running the character will start to climb barrels/railings even if you did not intend to. Also sometimes in combat with multiple people you can end up messing up your target and intended move/counter. It isn't that annoying but it does get in the way sometimes when you are trying to do something important. Basically the controls should have been more refined and just feel more solid.The game also has naval combat and even though it is nice I feel it could have been refined as well.The story is actually good and the cinematic scenes look very nice. You meet a lot of historical characters and its pretty cool being in 1700's Boston and New York. As a virtual history ride the game delivers and since I kind of like history it was cool to relive it virtually.Now the main problem I had with this game is that first of all it was way too cinematic. Even though I praised the cinematic scenes they felt excessive in my opinion. Sometimes it felt like I was just watching a movie that allowed me to interact within some scenes. I complain about this with many of today's games...I want to play not watch.My biggest complaint is that the game is not that FUN. I'm sorry but I did not enjoy this game as much as I wanted to. I mean it was fun in some parts but just not enough to keep me interested from start to finish.Still overall the game was a good virtual history ride. I finished the game but doubt I will play it again even though there are some things I didn't do...I just wish it was a bit more fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Good Step Forward for Nintendo's Prime Handheld","reviewText":"Pros:+Bigger and slightly brighter screen+New interface is easy to navigate+DSi Ware is a nice implementation+Digital camera to take photos with+Internal memory and SD card slot are nice for storing data+Downloaded games are inexpensive and the service has a lot of potentialCons:-Photos taken on camera only really look good on the DSi screen-Shorter battery life-Web browser isn't the greatest-The lack of a GBA slot means you can't play GBA games, use some of the DS Lite's accessories (such as a rumble pack) and makes some games like Guitar Hero World Tour virtually unplayableIn 2004, Nintendo released the original Nintendo DS.  Just two years later, the Nintendo DS Lite debuted and was better than the original by far.  Since its original release, the Nintendo DS has gone on to sell more than 100 million units worldwide.  With sales numbers like that, why would Nintendo need to release another revamp of their prized handheld?  More than that, are the new features worth picking up if you have a DS Lite or if you still have an original DS?  Well, it can be, but if you're perfectly content with your original DS or your DS Lite there's nothing wrong with that, and you don't have to buy it.  That's not to say it would be a bad investment.  For some it might be worth it.Certainly if you still have the original DS, it is worth investing in this newer update.  There are quite a few new things about the Nintendo DSi that can make it worth buying.  One of the first changes that is obvious from the moment you see it is that it's slightly smaller and designed a little differently.  The power button has been moved and now doubles as a reset button.  The screen is also slightly bigger and brighter than the DS Lite.  When turning it on, there is also a notable difference in the interface which has been completely reworked all together.  It's been made a bit easier to use.Perhaps the biggest and most notable difference is that the DSi no longer has a slot to play Gameboy Advance games.  If you're still playing your GBA games a lot, this is probably a pretty big subtraction when it comes to the DSi, no matter how much it includes.  If you're someone who hasn't used your DS for playing GBA games in a while, it's probably not a big deal, but I would've gladly taken a slightly thicker handheld just to maintain the GBA slot.  There is, however, a slot for an SD card to store more data.  The first of these is the wi-fi service which you can get on and download some downloadable games for the DSi.  Much like the Wii, you'll spend points (100 points is equal to one dollar) to buy games.  There's also the built in web browser, but this is not something to jump up and down over really, as it isn't a very good web browser.The camera is a nice addition, allowing you to customize and mess around with the pictures you take.  They don't look good on anything but the DSi screen, however, but you can store them on an SD card or the DSi's internal memory.  You can take quite a bit of photos, and mess around with them in interesting ways, such as drawing on them or manipulating faces.  It can be fun to mess around with.While the new additions are nice the more expensive price is a bit much for those who are already carrying a DS Lite.  There are some new features but there isn't too much done here to enhance the gaming experience itself outside of a larger screen.  However, that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile.  The download service in particular can be very worthwhile in the future.  The games on the download service also aren't too expensive.  In short, even DS Lite owners might find it worth the extra money after a while.Another big hit to the DSi is that the battery life just isn't as long as the previous incarnations.  For those wanting to use it primarily for gaming, it might surprise you that the DSi will need to be charged a lot more frequently, as the battery last five hours shorter than that of the DS Lite.  It takes a bit shorter to charge as a result, but you'll find yourself charging it quite a bit, especially if you play with the screen on the brightest settings.In the end some may wonder if the upgrade is worth it.  It's a bit more expensive than the DS Lite and doesn't have a GBA slot and a shorter battery life.  However, you are getting some nice extra features, and with Nintendo planning to implement them in some of their games in the future, it's at least worth consideration.  DS Lite owners may not need to upgrade immediately, but in the future it might be worth considering.  If you don't own a DS at all, the DSi is probably the best bet.The Nintendo DSi is a nice step in the evolution of Nintendo's handheld.  It has a lot of new features that can go a long way.  Even DS Lite owners might want to consider updating at some point, but it still stands: if you're content with your DS Lite or original DS you don't have to get it.  It's certainly worth considering, though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}

Devil May Cry 3 and DMC 3: Special Edition follow the same general formula as the original game. Plenty of combat laden areas and cool looking weapons, a hero and an antagonist seeking power. The storyline of the series has never been the main focus and that is apparent in this game. Characters are brought in almost at random and with cloudy reasoning for their motivations.What has always set the DMC games apart from the rest is the action packed sequences and boss battles. While DMC 3 has plenty of both you'll end up lamenting purchasing the game due to it's definitively tired controls, abysmal voice acting, broken camera system and poor storyline.In deciding to make DMC 3 a prequel to DMC, Capcom presents a much younger version of Dante. In an effort to project the younger version Capcom also made him somewhat immature. While you may argue that this decision is appropriate you'll quickly realize in playing the game that Dante resembles a hyperactive adolescent boy. The sequences in between combat are laughable as any time Dante opens his mouth it's an embarrassment to the talented folks at Capcom.More than any other complaint - the terrible controls, broken camera system, dated formula - it is the voice acting that prevented me from liking the game. The script is cheesy at times and the voice actors are always unbelievable. Stay away.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2008"}

Hayes","summary":"It's Never too Late For Uncharted!","reviewText":"Once again I come about two years to late to the video game front. However, even two years from its initial release date, Uncharted is a still a game that must be added to every PS3 owners library.Uncharted plays out like a virtual action adventure movie.  You play as Drake who is on a vessel with a TV host as he tries to find Sir Francis Drakes long lost treasure buried in the ocean.  As a treasure hunter he is faced with opposition and the story starts from there.  The beginning moments start out amazingly, nearly like a movie to be honest but you are actually playing. In several of these \"would-be\" cutscenes you can actually move around and start fighting enemies.The games continues on from there and you go through the South American jungle searching for the treasure.  It actually feels like an action adventure movie and I do not think it can be said enough.Gameplay revolves around a mix of platforming puzzles (finding ways to manipulate the environment to open hidden passages or reach places that couldnt be reached such as scaling the cliffs) and firefighting scenes in which you are fighting opposition forces as they try to undermine and get to the treasure before you.The game last approximately 12-15 hours on Easy difficulty and a bit greater depending on the other difficulties.  The game can last longer if you want to get all of the trophys and unlockables such as concept art, music.  Once the game is finished all of the cinematics are unlockable too.Speaking of Cinematics the game is perhaps one of the most beautiful on the PS3.  There are several moments in which you can tell the people who made the environments wanted you to stop and look out at the beauty of the waterfall, or cliffside, or the setting sun. It is amazing.  There has been so much detail given to the characters faces that the emotion is definitely apparent, the game takes cutscenes to an entire new level.  Speaking of which, there are no load times either, so the seamless play is all the better.The soundtrack by Greg Edmondson is amazing and is also available to purchase.  It is perhaps one of the best soundtracks available on the PS3 to date as well.  Voice talents are splendid.  This can also be seen how everyone clamors around the voices of Nathan Drake, Sully, and Elena whenever they appear at events. It is awesome.The only con to the game is that some people claim that the shooting segments are too numerous or predictable, however in the context of the story it would make sense to have these moments.  A moot point but the segments only take at most 10 minutes to complete (if you are not impeded by nasty traps).Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is one of the games on the Playstation 3 that highlights all aspects of a good game; fun gameplay, high production values in graphic technology, voice talent, and story, and great unlockables.  Definitely check this game out if you have not. IT is never too late to pick up Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.

I didn't care for it, so I was hesitant as to what to expect from a sequel, but I gave it a try.This sequel feels like a sequel. I mean, it feels like the original creators created it, that they built on the same engine, but improved it, they updated the graphics, game play, and abilities, all the while not loosing the features that made the original unique.The graphics are fantastic! I feel like the creators too full advantage of the hardware. The sound is great. The effects are very good. All in all the graphics are very well done.They improved the inventory and equipment system. It's not perfect, it's hard to tell if a new equipment is better than an existing one, but you figure it out. It feels very much like an RPG in this fashion.Missions and the main story is very compelling. The ending is worth the play through.Combat is VERY nicely done, and improved. It felt like a display of finesse, with your various button press timings in total control. I liked fighting in this game. Very excellent job!Distance combat is, no pun intended, hit or miss. When you don't get the results you expect, having felt YOU told the character the correct motions, but he just decided to go his own way, it is some what frustrating. But it really does hit more than miss. Though, some distance weapons are almost useless. I am vague to avoid spoilers.Roof top running/acrobatics are fun, though, most of the time I feel he did what I wanted him to do, there are many times he decided jumping to his death was a better choice than to the ledge right next to death - it happens, it's not perfect, but when it works, it feels like art.I do not believe you die that often in this game - the potential is there, but you feel you have choices in riskiness most of the time to mitigate death. So there is very little trial and error, more choice and result. That is at least how I felt.The voice acting is stellar! Loved it! Wanted more! The history is VERY interesting! I found myself researching things mentioned in the game. The often use real characters and locations, with details and blurbs - very interesting! I didn't always stop and read about a place, but I did often.All in all, the developers have benefited the franchise, and I look forward to a sequel. It's already released, and I've already played it, and I will review that game once I feel I have a proper opinion. Until then, I feel that his game is a good purchase, especially at the price it is going for with the sequels out. I don't recommend starting at the first game. There will be references to the first character often, but you are NOT missing anything if you haven't played the first one.I hope this review was helpful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2011"}

After 6 years, Gran Turismo 5 is finally out. But oh no! Horror of horrors, our worst fears have been realised.I'll hark back to my review of GT5 Prologue here and say a loud \"I told you so\".What I wrote then was the following:1. It looks gorgeous2. The AI is abominable.3. There is still no car damage (* see below).To use a lovely english expression : it's all mouth and no trousers. Look past the HD graphics and hype and you'll find Gran Turismo 1 lurking here.Sadly, this is exactly the case in the now-complete Gran Turismo 5. Whilst there's no doubt that it's chock-full of content - more cars than you could name and a decent selection of tracks both old and new, the two core problems that have existed in GT games are still present and correct here in GT5. The AI is still stuck in the 1980s and the crash damage - well - technically it actually does exist now, but it's so slight and laughable that they might as well have not bothered - it's completely useless. It provides zero useful input to the game. If I clip the car in front because I'm a bit too aggressive, I expect some damage and probably some handling issues. Same if I go wide into a corner and slide the tail into the armco. Same if an AI car slams into me (which they will do with horrendous regularity - see below). You'd expect them to bust a radiator or rip the front bumper off. But no. No punishment, no visual feedback, not even a detectable change in handling. Do it again. And again. And again. And - wait - a scuff! Holy cow! I hit the wall at 130mph and it scuffed the paint. Keep going. Four, five, six times. Seven. Eight - ok now we're getting somewhere. After eight slams into the barrier at 130mph, finally the front bumper is starting to wobble a bit and there might be a vague pull to the left in the steering.See the problem there?As with GT5 Prologue, the game is further ruined by the abominable AI. Once again, Polyphony make a great deal about how much work has gone into it, but once again, it's the AI from GT1 or GT2, and as such it is comically bad. The other cars, again, take no note of your presence, instead preferring to just ram you out of the way if you're on their line in a corner (and without any penalty in the form of crash damage to them). It's not that the AI is dumb, it's just not there. The other cars all drive on rails, irrespective of where you are. My check for this is on the High Speed Ring - a track that is lovely to race on in isolation but impossible to race on with AI drivers because of all the AI problems. Park your car looking at the two corners that follow the large bridge and watch the AI drivers. Lap after lap they will cut the corner in the same order, with the exact same puff of dirt, the same tail-wiggle and the pinpoint same line. No variation, no deviation, ever, and that rule extends to when you're racing. If you're at that point when they want to be there, tough - you lose. They'll swat you off the track. What makes it an absolute insult is that the AI cars are not punished for things you get disqualified for. The Top Gear test track is a prime example. The AI vehicles will mow down cones with wild abandon but if you touch even one of them, you're instantly disqualified.AI and crash damage are game features which have all been solved for years in every other racing franchise. For Polyphony to delay GT5 for so long and then release a game which is still so flawed is inexcusable. They so want it to be \"the real driving simulator\" and from a physics and handling point of view, it really is, but amazing handling reproduction and flawless graphics (in the cars at least) do not compensate for the failure of this studio to solve the two biggest problems this franchise has always had.Speaking of graphics - what about the other issue that GT5 Prologue showed - bad popup? I almost can't bring myself to tell you this but yes, it's still here. Be sure it's not as bad as it was, but you'll race some tracks and be caught off-guard in a corner as your eye is drawn to something on the horizon winking into existence. The far grandstand in the Daytona track is very, very obvious when it blinks in. This visual 'pop' as a building or feature materialises is very distracting. The same pop exists in between the levels of detail on the car models. I guess they've crammed so many surfaces into the car models that they can't afford to show the highest level of detail until you're nearly on top of them. In-race, the result is that as you approach a lot of the cars from the rear, you'll see a jarring change in the shading and highlights as the shape of the car switches from medium to high level of detail. OK I work in CGI as a living so its my business to notice these things but again it's something that this game simply should not have. The distracting effect is too much and it's another thing that drops you out of the realism of the game.The Audio for GT5 has been considerably revamped, but once again there's a caveat with that. If you're inside the cars, there's still very little distinction from one engine noise to the next. The biggest difference comes when you use the on-the-roof-cam. From this point of view there is an immediate and obvious improvement in the engine noises over the previous GT games. But that's the caveat - the roof-cam is useless for racing. Just like the above-and-behind cam, it's a dated concept that shouldn't exist in ANY racing game, not just GT5. If you want to drive a racing game, you do it from the driver's point of view. And from that point of view, the GT5 engine sounds are just not up to snuff.What about the physics and handling then? Well for sure they're top-drawer and the GT franchise has never skimped in this department. I did notice that they seem to have paid more attention this time to weight transfer under braking. You can quickly get all out of line if you wrench on the brakes too hard coming into a corner now. The earlier GT games were similarly punitive for ham-fisted handling but now they've upgraded the braking part of their physics engine, you really do need to fine-tune your learning of how each car behaves. This leads however to another odd disconnect in the \"simulation\" which I don't understand. You can upgrade your car with bolt-on goodies just like you've always been able to do, but try as I might I couldn't find how to upgrade the brakes any more. So I can easily add on Stage 1 and 2 turbos and engine tuning, lightweight driveshafts, NoS, weight reduction, seam-welding, roll cages, racing clutches and gearboxes but I can't upgrade my brakes. I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if that's been taken out of the game now. It does seem odd because it's now extremely easy to upgrade a car to the point where it simply overpowers the brakes on the way into a corner and leaves you bouncing off the weeds.The track selection in GT5 is spectacular although there are a lot of derivative tracks - the same basic course but forwards, backwards, with slightly different chicanes and corners here and there. The new Rome and Madrid street circuits are dripping with graphical beauty and are wonderfully tricky to race. They're a great addition to the series and have the same look and feel as the London and Paris circuits both in their complexity and graphical prowess. My favourite new track though is the least inspiring of the bunch - the famed Top Gear test track (the UK one, not the awful US version). A series of oddball corners painted on to an airfield in England with not much to look at, but that's not the point. The point is that you can now do what Clarkson, Hammond, May and the Stig do, from the comfort of your own living room. You can be your own star in a reasonably priced car! As a huge Top Gear fan, the inclusion of this track could have been the redeeming feature of GT5. However - horrors - you can't get at it in arcade or career mode - you can only get at it in the special events modes. And only three of those are set on this track. So close, yet so far.The track designer is an interesting addition this time around. You're not going to be able to recreate your all-time favourite piece of racing history, but it does allow you to create unique tracks to race on. With a variety of corner options and straights, background scenery and such, it will lead to massively increased replay value as you try to tweak and refine tracks to catch your friends out.There's more \"add-on\" series available now in GT5. They've put more WRC rallying content in this time around and for the first time, added the completely unnecessary NASCAR. Now you too can turn left for 400 miles. I give NASCAR this few lines in this review because that's all it deserves. The inclusion of karting is a fun addition that you can get at early on and its well worth investing a few minutes in kart racing to boost your driver level easily (you'll always finish first, with a massive margin).It's obvious that Polyphony's expertise is in car and track modeling because their human figure and face modeling, especially Jeff Gordon, are hilariously bad. All the human animations look like they were motion-captured from a 90-year old and the rubber-elastic facial expressions and total lack of lip-sync are hilarious to watch. On top of that, the voice 'talent' sounds bored and lifeless to the point of distraction. That's not a bad mark against the game though - it is after all about racing, not watching a racing game studio trying to animate people.It's worth taking a moment here to speak about controls. You really, REALLY need to get a decent steering wheel and pedals to play GT5. Don't expect to use the PS3 controller and be able to compete or enjoy the game. I made that mistake all the way up to GT3 and since then have always used a decent wheel/pedal combo. If you've not taken the plunge yet, then GT5 or Formula 1 2010 are the two games you should really use as an excuse for treating yourself.The online play does seems to have improved a lot over GT5 but it does still seem to be a bit picky if your PS3 and network aren't set up perfectly. GT5 still requires NAT type 1 or it won't connect to the servers. Once up and running though, the improvements over GT5 Prologue are clear and Polyphony have obviously spent some effort refining the online experience.So GT5: it's amazing eye-candy. But the two biggest, most long-standing problems with the GT franchise are still present. Tragic AI and car damage so laughably poor that I would classify it simply as 'no car damage'. As with previous GT games, Polyphony just don't seem to have made many changes to their underlying game engine between the 'Prologue' and the full version of GT5.As I said in my GT5 prologue review, I dearly love the GT franchise - I've had every one of them and I've been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the AI problems and the lack of car damage. GT5 has proven that this simply is never going to happen now. Polyphony are more interested in the way the game looks than the way it plays. They want it to be a simulation but it has too many problems to be a simulation - too many things that pop you out of the 'zone' and make you think 'wait a second...'So what to recommend? Well - I'm not sure. It's a stunning game to look at - just amazing. To the point where you could be mistaken for thinking you were watching live footage in some of the replays. However if you want a proper racing game that's a lot of fun to play, then you should absolutely go elsewhere. Forza, Grid, Need For Speed Shift - any of these franchises long ago solved crash damage and AI issues. If you want a proper simulation of driving, then for sure GT5 is for you, but be warned - the little issues present everywhere in the game will eventually ruin the 'simulation' aspect of it for you.And that's the biggest problem here. It's a lovely game to look at but it's just not exciting to play. It's simply inexcusable that Kazunori Yamauchi delayed GT5 for so long without ever fixing its most basic problems. To end on a metaphor, it's like the Titanic. The GT franchise is sinking under the weight of its crash damage and AI issues, and the captain of the ship is at the back somewhere, making coffee.I don't want to give the review 5 stars because the game clearly doesn't merit it. 5 star reviews of GT5 are from people blinded by the eye candy to the point that they can't see the flaws.But one star is too punitive and despite the axe I have repeatedly ground about the AI and damage - there's enough here that a lot of people will be impressed and enjoy it.I give it four stars because it is, when all is said and done, a totally middle-of-the-road racing game, but with lovely graphics. (ie. 3 stars plus a bonus 1 for eye candy)*Update - 48 hours in*To be fair my original review here was based on only six or seven hours of gameplay and it's been noted in the comments that the AI and damage don't really start to improve until you're at a higher driver level in career mode. I'm now at level 23 and things have not improved. The damage is still poor to non existent, and the AI is still box-of-rocks stupid. You can get at the full-on AI and damage modes by playing Arcade mode and things are no different there - so I doubt you'll ever see a change in career mode - there's definitely no \"gradual\" increase.It's also been pointed out that the whole idea of this game is to race, not to crash into things. This is true, but a great fanfare is made of the \"real driving simulator\" and in the real world, racing cars race with damage - it's part of the sport. Find me an F1 race, or NASCAR, or DTM, WRC, Australian Touring Cars - any major racing series - where you can see cars racing in pristine condition from start to finish. It simply doesn't exist, and that's why I have such a bone to pick about GT5. It's not a true simulation like Yamauchi thinks it is. A true simulation would simulate *everything*, not just 75%.*Update - two weeks later*Well I have to say I'm done with GT5. My copy has now been sold through Amazon's used items listings. I just couldn't give it any more time. In the end, the idiotic AI became too frustrating. The lack of any usable damage model became overbearing, and I came to the horrible conclusion that it's just not fun. You can get at the full AI and damage modes right from the start if you race in Arcade mode - in Career mode it does sort of build them up in stages. Even when full on though, the AI is still stuck in the early 90's and the damage is useless. At no point do you ever have a wreck so bad that you can't go on to win the race, and as such, it means there's zero incentive to learn the nuances of any of the cars or tracks. I was in a particularly hard race at Trial Mountain (and by hard I mean it was difficult to stay out of the way of the AI-on-rails of the other cars) and I clipped the inside of the last corner too closely. There is a steeply banked hill on the inside of this corner and it flipped my car up into the air, slamming it into the bridge behind it, then spinning 8 or 10 times end-over-end. I was able to wait for the car to settle, get back into the race, and win. It was at that point that I boxed up my copy and put it up for sale on Amazon.The truly horrible thing is that if you run the game in B-Spec mode, where you get to give instructions to your own AI driver, an amazing thing happens : the AI of the other drivers in the race is suddenly 100 times better than it is when you're racing in your own car. It's astonishing to watch - they make mistakes, they spin, flip, crash (without damage of course), countersteer, avoid other vehicles and generally behave like realistic drivers. How can this be? How can Polyphony put such amazing AI into B-Spec mode and not make it available in A-Spec mode? It's a crime. I suspect part of the reason for this is because your own AI driver is essentially an untrainable kindergartner. You can give him a 300bhp beast, fully tuned, and he can't even win a race on the Autumn Ring. Hop in the same car yourself and you can win the race a full lap and a half ahead of all the other cars. Sure you can gain experience for your own AI driver but he never really competes. It's just another in the increasing list of problems for GT5 and ultimately, another of the contributing reasons for why I can't give it any more of my time. I've since been playing Formula 1 2010, and NFS Shift. Both have AI that is lightyears ahead of GT5, both have a far greater sense of speed, both have mechanical crash damage that penalises you for getting it wrong, and above everything else, both are actually fun to play.So GT5 : pretty to look at. Not much good as a driving game. Definitely not a simulator.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}

We used the controllers for DVD's, Netflix and Hulu for a couple of years, so it was definitely doable, but got tired of the limited options and various controls for different services.  Also, the fact that a simple bump of the controller could mess everything up was getting annoying.This controller has all the controls intuitively located on the unit (including the mute button right next to the volume control, which is the first time I'd seen that) and operates DVD's, Netflix and Hulu (I have not tried Vudo or any other service).  I was able to link this to my Panasonic TV as well and make it the TV and PS3 controller.  This has been an incredible convenience and well worth the relatively low cost.I would have given this 5 stars but someone brought up a good point about there being no back lit controller face.  For someone who likes to watch movies in the dark this would have been a great addition and seems like it should have been a no brainer to include.Overall great product for DVD, Netflix and Hulu viewing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2012"}

Only you can&nbsp;mix and match their tops and bottoms, put them on the newPortal of Powerand help save Skylands.","reviewerName":"Don Walton Jr.","summary":"I'm sold.","reviewText":"This is my first experience with Skylanders, so here's my random observations...- Your character is SLOW.  Holy smokes.  SLooooooW.  I swapped the Octopus guy top with the fireball guy's bottom and made a guy that has jet legs with a gun and sword.  If you hold down the C button, he powers up and then flies around at a slightly faster clip by using the jet legs.- There is some kind of chip in each toy that stores it's information!  Very cool!  You can level them up, and it stores it in the actual toy!  Not sure if there is a way to 'reset' the toy.  They have no buttons or switches or batteries or anything.- Wow.  You can earn/buy hats in the game, and they give you different abilities, or better stats rather, but they look AWFUL.  Really, a stone crusher robot dude in a pimp hat?  A dragon wearing a coonskin cap?  The awful part is that they not only don't fit the 'environment', they also don't fit.  Literally.  They just kinda hover over your head.  It might be better if they were built around each character design, and molded to each different head.  As is, they look...dumb.- Some of the figures light up!  Very cool!  Different color LEDs light different parts of the toys.  Awesome.  The toys have a really great design too.  Nice artstyle, but also well sculpted.- The Swap Force toys are well made too.  They have two small, but powerful magnets inside their waist, and then you basically snap them off at the belt line and swap the tops around.  It works well and feels like a high quality build.- TONS of stuff to collect.  Like...TONS.  Fun to relax with, good goals for kids, fun variety, etc.- TONS of voice work.  Every Skylander talks and pretty much every major voice actor in the industry voices someone in the game. BUT you can't skip much of the talking.  Sometimes, you can press '2' to skip, but not often enough.- Save points are in weird places.  The levels are kinda long for what they are, so you're looking at twenty minutes or more between save points.  Not cool.  I had to watch a long, unskippable cinematic twice even when I quit out of the hubworld.  Lacks polish.- TONS of stats, information, codes, add-ons, etc.  I still don't understand it all, but you can also just mess around and blow through the game (like a small child might enjoy doing), so none of it is really mandatory.- The cord on the portal is kinda short.  It's probably 8-10' long, and plugs into the back of the Wii.  I have to sit on the floor by the TV to play... not super comfortable.  The first game, two years ago, came with a wireless portal, but I couldn't ever get it to work.  This one works, but you would think they could have nailed down the wireless format in the past few years.  Clearly, this is less of an issue for children, but should be noted.- I'm assuming you could get through the whole game with only one character, but you'd miss A LOT of content.- I was in an 'air' section with an 'undead' figure.  He was issuing 39 hit points per hit.  I swapped to the recommended 'air' character, and it went up to 59 hit points per hit.  I swapped to an 'mountain' giant and he issued 70 hit point per hit.  The Giants have cool figures, cool moves, do more damage, why not just play as a giant the whole time?- You end up swapping figures on the portal a lot.  Some of it makes sense, entering a forest for 'life', or water for...'water', but sometimes you'll pass something and it'll go into dialog and change the 'effective element' (ie. best tool for the job), so you swap your dudes, and then when the dialog is done and you take another step, it turns out you need a different element unless you're entering the door you just passed (for example).  It probably takes less than ten seconds to 'boot up' your new character, but its still a little annoying.  And man, this game LOOOOVES the 'Undead' element.  Expect to break that dude out quite a bit.- Some areas cannot be reached, but the game doesn't explain why.  For example, you might see a chest on a short ledge, but cannot jump high enough to reach it.  I'm assuming at some point your character can level up, or have a higher jump or something.  I tried Spyro himself and couldn't reach it.- The graphics are a little meh.  The environments are nice, but everything is pretty jaggy.  Maybe I just haven't used the Wii in a while compared to the Xbox 360 or PS3.- It comes with three 'elements' - life, fire and water.  There are eight elements in the game, and also 'giants' AND also different bases on the SwapForce characters, so... I'm guessing at least 17 different characters are needed to open everything.  Wait, not everything because some gates are sealed by two elements, by using swap technology.  So... I guess if you buy all your elements in Swap Figures (which are more expensive), and a Giant, then maybe you could open everything?  I just counted, and the game menu lists 16 Swap Force figures. Besides the cost of the game, I'm guessing you're in about $100 in figures just to get all the elements.  Now is a good time to buy if you're not picky about which characters you get though, because all the old Giants and figures from the first series seem to be on a fire sale at many retailers.  I got two figures from the 'Giants' set (but not actual giants) for a total of $6 at TRU this week because of a fire sale.  I'm not picky about characters though.  ALSO, some characters are more 'rare' than others, so they cost more (if you are picky) and used game chains don't carry used figures because 'someone might have put them in water' is what I was told by a store associate at GS.  Isn't that true of all cartridges?Overall, a great idea for a game.  I wish the gameplay were a bit tighter, maybe it is on the Xbox or PS3?  The premise is great, obviously it can become a huge money pit, but its fun to play and mess with the figures.  Ultimately, I found myself longing for the play mechanics from Ratchet & Clank and it would be a home run.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

Brought to you by the development team who did the \"Sly Cooper\" series on the Playstation 2, here was this PS3 exclusive game coming out yet I wasn't like \"oh my god I have definately got to get this game\" but felt more like \"well looks like fun, probably rent it when it comes out\". This is the part where I'd eat my words if I only had naysayed the game because this thing is fun and strangely addicting since I'd often find myself playing for extended periods of time and sure it's got a couple of issues but it's one of the top games released so far this year and I even find it funner than \"Killzone 2\".Story: You play as Cole McGrath who after delivering a package which subsequently blows up, near destroying Liberty City and branded a \"terrorist\" by the city people, Cole finds himself gifted/cursed with the ability to control and harness lightning and electricity. The city contained to keep in the Reavers, infected people terrorizing the populace, Cole strikes a deal with an agent named Moya: find her husband John and find out about something called the \"Ray Sphere\" and he'll allow her to leave. But Cole has another thing to find out: who gave him the package, why did he have it and the voice he hears occasionally.Graphics: Graphically Infamous looks nice though you're probably not gonna go \"wow\" a lot. In a way the graphic style is more pleasant to look at and looks really great but in terms of POP, the game doesn't have that wow factor you might get with Killzone 2 or Metal Gear Solid 4 or even the other open world sandbow game, Grand Theft Auto IV. I did notice a couple of glitches such as jittery civilians where they seemingly get stuck, I actually fell through the streets and died once but I barely noticed any drops in framerate and slowdown, especially one mission involving a bus and...let's just say you can spam attacks and graphically? Awesome. Having cutscenes be comic book style? Excellent.Sound/Music: Music-wise I didn't notice a whole lot special though it's by no means forgettable but music in games is usually meant to enhance the game whereas I felt it drifted in the background. Big action shootouts are frenetic but not intense which the music should've done. Voice acting though is quite good with Cole having the standard gruff cig-smoker voice while the other actors are quite well characterized. The city populace is nice as well and the constant complaints about your stink (probably because you can't shower thanks to your powers) can get funny though it's like \"Yes I know I stink, shut up\".Gameplay: \"Infamous\" gameplay combines the open-world of Crackdown and Grand Theft Auto with upgradeable abilities which ties into Cole's gifts with electricity. He starts out with your standard electrobolt which is basically like your ammo until you unlock stuff like shockwave which acts as a \"pusher\", a electro-grenade which you can stick to people Halo-style, and your main mode of transport, grinding where you can surf the train rails or power lines. Upgrading your abilities is pretty fun since you can unlock some actual useful upgrades as opposed to just \"this but tougher\" and XP is actually pretty frequent and though they're usually just 10-15 for enemy takedowns and maybe 3 for dealing with fallen enemies and civilians. Also since you can be evil or good, the abilities can change how the powers actually work. My one complaint is how you get them as there is a clear formula: go down a manhole, charge a station, get your power and make it through a really dark sewer with your new gifts but all and all, using electricity is super fun.One complaint that I will address is the enemies and I will say this: you will die...frequently. While the checkpoint system is incredibly forgiving, the enemy aim is exceptionally skilled even at long distances, you have to contend with missile launching buggers, turrets, turrets on top of trucks and more than once I died from at least 8-10 and some sections even more. The game's not Ninja Gaiden difficult where you feel like giving up or call the game unfair but more than once it's like \"oh come on, give me at least a little chance\". Another thing the game includes is a good/evil mechanic where the more good you are, the more celebrity and popular the city sees you, putting up posters and even helping out during shootouts and taking pictures. But if you're evil, they'll boo and even throw stuff at you but when you can cause as much mayhem as you want, just fry the buggers. Only problem is that there's no grey area where you really have to think about your choices it's either: save these people and not take their goodies or kill everybody and take it all.Some of the side missions are slightly repetitive where they range from fun to extremely tedious and/or frustrating but the story is intriguing and really well-told. But as an exclusive, Infamous is definately worth checking out for PS3 fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2009"}

I've played through this game at least 4 times now and still continue to play it over a year later.  While infamous is not a perfect game, it blends some very nice elements together to create a classic PS3 exclusive.Infamous sets you up as Cole, a regular Joe who is pretty much given super powers.  The game has a very GTA meets Spiderman feel.  Pretty much the game is restrictive free roam (like you can't cross to area 2 because you didn't fix the bridge yet but you can free roam area 1).  Cole will start as pretty much a novice so the more you fight and adventure, the more XP you gain.  Using the XP you earn you can unlock upgrades for Cole.  On top of this small RPG element, you can influence how the game reacts to you.  GOOD and BAD karma skews your ability for upgrades towards a hero or a villain, while the citizens equally react to your decision making.The storyline isn't ground breaking original, but it has been a tremendous burst of fresh air in the gaming market I think.  The storyline really fires on all cylinders, making you see what life might be like as a superhero and how your decisions influence people around you.  There are two endings to the game, Good and Evil  obviously.  Each major storyline plot point has a good / evil moment that makes replaying Infamous a must!  The length of the game feels just right.  It spends plenty of time early on helping you get accustom to the controls and primary abilities and then speeds up to push the storyline along.  The game isn't short but it also isn't too long.Your Karma even influences how you fight.  Killing citizens gives evil karma (which gives XP but reduces your good karma aka, affecting how fast you can unlock upgrades), while healing and 'live capturing' enemies gives you a nice good karma boost.  Of course you could be a real jerk, live capture an enemy then zap em for an execution(major evil karma) .  There are lots of varieties to the combat, plus there are loads of stunts to perform and see how many you can rack up.  The voice acting in the game is very good. The characters are all quite believable.Overall Infamous is a game worth owning if you have a PS3 and enjoy those open world adventure games.  There is so much to do; finding dead drops, shards, good/evil side quests, storyline missions, stunts, exploring the map etc.  An official score in my book, I would give it a 97%.  It is a high score but this game delivers in my book.  If you are a fan of open world style games you'll be revisiting this game multiple times.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2011"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Looked good, the color palette could use more variety, but it seemed like a solid game.Here's my impression of GoW2 based on a rental.  The story is some sort of grunged up, alternate Halo 3 type story.  Essentially, you're a \"space marine\" type and-wouldn't you know- aliens have the human race on the run.  Its up to you and a scrappy platoon of colorful characters with frightening guns and course language to save the planet.Gameplay itself is pretty quick to pick up.  Many of the controls are similar to those seen in other FPS games.  The one thing that consistently messed me up is the \"A button\" that allows you to dive/take cover.  Its context sensitive, which is awesome because you can dart and move and hide with ease.  But sometimes, when I would think I was going to smoothly roll around a corner, I would accidentally just dive right out into the open.The weapons are a good, if rather standard array.  Again, it seems like GoW2 is merely a slight variation on the shooter theme, rather than anything that is truly unique (aside from the graphics).And boy aren't those pictures pretty!  This is one of the better looking games on the XBox 360.  The one complaint I have is that, despite all the high detail and excellent artwork, the color pallette hides a lot of what looks so amazing.  The variety of enemies is impressive and their designs are so diabolical, but they are all just grey and brown.  Even broad daylight in the GoW world is drab. I guess they had to stick to a \"mood\" or something.As for multiplayer, I found it to be satisfactory so far.  I haven't experienced any glitches so far, and matchmaking the multiplayer games i played (a few rounds of Horde) were suitable for a game following its launch.  Its going to take a little longer just because there are so many people online.  Once the game started, it ran like butter.  There are the usual map varieties and objective games.  The one unique gametype in multiplayer is called Horde, a game in which you simply must survive wave after wave of ever increasing aliens.  As the levels go on teamwork becomes more of an assett.  The enemy AI in these levels is pretty impressive.  It is a great change of pace from capture the flag.I give it four stars for two reasons: 1) this game just looks amazing.  on top of that the action is well paced and the game flat out plays well.  2) a solidly executed multiplayer system.  Maybe not as good as CoD or Halo, but better than many.If I may place an emphatic warning to parents of younger gamers here: this is an extremely violent game.  Buckets of blood, exploding heads, excecution moves, some of the most frighteningly realistic burning animations I've seen.  And to top it off, the characters are dropping F-bombs in the cutscenes.  For older gamers, this is all good fun but hopefully parents won't get suckered into thinking this is \"just like Halo 3\".  Yes you can turn the \"gore\" off and the cursing, but I don't think that's really going to stop anyone from noticing when you stomp someone's head off.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2009"}

Skyrim is probably 50 times bigger - and that's not even including dungeons and caves.  in short, it jumped into my five favorite games of all time.but...as everyone knows by now, as soon as you hit the 6mb save file mark, the game began to suffer.  freezing, choppy frame rates, etc.  patch 1.02 fixed that and i was able to continue on my merry way.  all seemed well and i was happy to send the creatures and people of Skyrim back to Oblivion.but...patch 1.03 all but ruined the game.  i'm 135 hours into the game with an 11 mb save file (the size of TWO mp3's, maybe) and the game is completely broken.  last weekend i had no fewer than *16* game freezes over the course of two days.  each freeze required a hard restart on my ps3 and the subsequent system check.  after the 16th freeze i quit for good.  it's simply no fun. and it's unfortunately because i feel i had barely scratched the surface.  there's simply hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content to work through.  and i was looking forward to it.bethesda had to have known about this issue.  there's no way they couldn't have. bethesda seems awfully slow (or unwilling) to address the issues.  The game's been out six weeks now.  this is simply unacceptable.to charge $60 in this economic climate for a game that doesn't even work past a certain point is unforgivable.  i can only suppose there will be some sort of class action lawsuit in the near future.5 stars for the game when it works.  1 for the crappy techincal issues.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

I'd never played it before, but had fond memories of Ocarina of Time. For whatever reason though, I just couldn't get into this game. It just doesn't seem to have aged well and I can't justify playing it, especially when compared to all of the other games and activities I could be doing with my time.Some of this isn't the game's fault. After being spoiled by Twilight Princess' graphics and the more intuitive game control of the Wii, this N64 game just feels clumsy and not aesthetically pleasing. Admittedly, the graphics were great for their time, but look old now. The music and characters and scenery are all well done, but just don't provide the epic scale of Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess.However, my biggest problem with the game is the central game mechanism - the 3-day time limit. You have 3 days (not 3 actual days, but 3 in-game days) to complete a quest, and then you have to reset the game and try again. Thus, any items you need must be acquired within that time. Even though this is usually plenty of time, it still feels rushed to me. I always like taking my time and exploring in games, not rushing. In Twilight Princess, one of my favorite things to do was ride Hyrule Fields on Epona and kill goblins. The 3 days takes some of the fun out of the exploration for me.Overall, I'd really only recommend this to hardcore Zelda fans. If you want to try a Zelda game, try Twilight Princess for the Wii, or better yet wait for Skyward Sword, which should be out later this year or early next.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2011"}

Add the fact if you lose someone, you lost them completely.  However this new installment kept all the favorite things people love about the series and added new features.  One is casual mode - someone dies they come back after the fight - good for beginners (or in my case as i already beat the game on hard classic mode) or as a casual replay - lunatic mode is back - with the added lunatic + as well.  The choice of avatars is a plus, first time having a female main character changes quite a few things.  Next is the interaction between characters - as they fight and pair up, they develop friendships, or even romances - so you can match anyone with nearly anyone (like the fluffy fearing knight with the bunny girl, or the gothic stalker with the oft-forgotten knight), and as the bond grow stronger the more involved and more bonuses the pair get (and in some fights you need to have those pairings so you can survive).  Now some reviewers say there is no story and the supports are not needed - but I found the soudtrack to be perfect, great voice acting, the music was spot on, and the animation (especially in the movie moments) was georgeous - and there was quite a few support conversations that had me laughing hard.overall the game is a must for those who love a game that is more than just button mashing or shooting.

Sure, a lot of fans of the original game did not get what they were looking for, but for gamers new to Deus Ex there is a lot to like.For one, the story is much better than in most other games. Here, you can team up with any side you like and apply your view of the world to the game. It will probably take to the very end (and a few surprising turns) before you really know which way you want to go. No other game before has presented so many meaningful choices to me.Of course, compared to Deus Ex 1, there are a number of simplifications. Unified ammo is something a lot of people do not like. It didn't bother me too much, although it is a bit odd that rocket launchers and pistols use the same ammo. The bio-mods I am not to crazy about. There are too many options to upgrade your mods and not enough meaningful choices there. But there are other aspects in the game that make up for it.Of course at this point, the graphics engine can not quite keep up with Doom 3 or Half Life 2, but it gets the job done.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2004"}

The result: a very mediocre game that is very disconnected and frustrating.I have a fascination with pirates, I've read several books on the \"real\" life pirates of the 16th and 17th centuries. While it's true that all the stuff you would want in a pirate game is present: buried tresure, swordfights, ship battles, land battles, etc. etc, each of these events are represented in their very own boring and most of the time, corny mini-game.Actually navigating your ship is really frustrating. I still haven't figured it out. The wind blows in a certain direction, and if you are not headed in that direction your ship moves at a snails pace. It takes forever to get from one end of the map to the other. The rest of the minigames are either really boring or just plain corny. For example, one minigame involves dancing to impress the Governor's daughter. Dancing around like a fancy boy is not what being a pirate is all about, let's get real. Ship battles are cool, but if your ship is somewhat far apart from your enemy it's VERY difficult to get close to them. For some reason in the ship battle mode your ship doesn't really move at all.The swordfighting is ok, but is pretty cheesy and gets boring very quickly while the land battles are excruciatingly slow. It's like moving chess pieces. Buried treasure I haven't even tried yet because the map they give you to find is very difficult to read.All in all, I really don't understand the high reviews for this game. The game is VERY disconnected and just really not that fun. I do not recommend this game to anyone.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2007"}

There are way to many things happening on the screen at once for me to be able to pay attention to.  One level has traffic lights on fire swinging back and forth, other racers shooting stuff at you as well as you having to worry about going off the track and trying to get the goals you need for the set goals.  I can't even hear the music when playing the later levels.  It is like everything blends into one mess.  Sometimes only on these later levels, it feels like I am not the one controlling my racer.

I will be in first, then all of a sudden everyone comes at me and hits me with everything and I am in last.  Hello Mario Kart!!!!  As I said, this game was a lot of fun.

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"William J.

{"product_name":"B005YR308S","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"A great interactive expierence","reviewText":"First off, this is not so much a game as it is an interactive movie, there is even a trophy that is called 'Interactive Drama'. So if you're expecting this to be something like Last of Us or something, you're gonna be disappointed. (minor spoilers below)- Characters and Story -The 'game' starts out with Ethan, a middle aged (maybe early 30's) father of two waking up in his very nice home getting ready for his son Joshua's 10th birthday. You do a few things (shower, eat, mess around before his kids and wife get back home), throughout this time, the game teaches you the controls.After you've done all that, you go to the mall (not sure if it's the same day or a few days later, I'd assume the latter) and your wife takes Shaun, your youngest to get shoes. You eventually lose sight of Joshua and must find him, the game treats this as a very serious situation, as would any parent of a lost child and the camera is very jostling.After a tragic event, Ethan's life crumbles (I'm sure you can guess what happened). His wife divorces him and they split custody of Shaun. Ethan begins having periods in which he blackouts and reawakens to remember nothing, this causes him to lose his Joshua, and he suspects the Origami Killer, a serial killer who's murdered 7 kids over the last 2 years, to be involved.The game is split into a few playable characters, Ethan, Madison (a photographer), Norman (an FBI agent) and Scott (a Private Investigator). Each of which have some connection or desire to find the Killer for their own reasons.- Graphics -This was a middle life game, so the graphics aren't as top of the line as newer games, but they still look pretty good. Some of the textures are half-assed, but most of the things such as expressions and details to the characters faces (hair, eyes, mouth) are very well done, in fact they were motion captured, so you can expect very realistic movement and looks.- Controls -The controls are a bit odd and take getting used to, for example, you don't simply hold the joystick to move, you hold R2 and use the joystick to turn. When interacting with something, you'll be given a prompt (slide the stick this way or that way). The game is very QTE (Quick Time Even) oriented, you'll often have to press, mash or pull the controller/buttons quickly to execute a command. The thing that sets this game apart from other games that use QTE's (like Resident Evil for example) is that if you fail a QTE, you won't die right away, in fact you're given several chances to recover, you may miss a series of QTE's before actually dying, how fast you respond effects what happens to the character and therefore the story.- Audio -Most of the game is well-done, however some characters (like Ethan) are very mono tone or unenthusiastic), when he's looking for his son, he'll shout his name as if his life weren't in mortal danger, he always seems to say it in a happy way regardless of the danger.Music is rather heart-wrenching at times and they play the right music at the right time, sometimes low and quiet and sometimes louder with more base. This helps add to the ambiance of the area you are in.Sound effects are very realistic, especially the rain. However I was very disappointed when I shot someone, the gun sounded like a firecracker, a small one at that. Other than that one occurrence though, I've been very happy with the sounds.- Other -Even with the few shortcomings the game has, it is an overall enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of these types of games, I suggest buying it (for the cheap price it is now, there's no reason to not play it). If you're on the fence and need a similar game to try, I suggest Indigo Prophecy, it's much more dated, but made by the same people and also has an amazing story and similar mechanics.Pros+ Great Story+ Interesting Mechanics+ Many possible endings+ Very emotionally drivenCons- On rare occasions, very poor VO- Might be a bit too many QTE's for some","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2013"}

Seriously, good lord.  Anyway, this game is basically a cookie cutter theme park mmo like many others, but it's probably the most stream lined and polished one I've played.  The rifts are the gimmick of this game and they are pretty fun, but can get a little annoying at times.  Still, it's a nice addition.The best thing about this game - the developers.  Crazy thing I know, but it's true.  They pump out INSANE amounts of content, easily more than double or triple most other mmo companies, and it's not just crap content.  I have a lot of respect for a company like this, and they address what players ask for.In general the game has a lot of nice features:  great UI, rifts and zone events are awesome, constant world events, collection system, nice exploration carrots like puzzles and so forth, robust achievement system with rewards, alternate advancement system, nice realistic graphics, world full of immersion with npc chatter and scripted activities, swimming, day / night, weather, creatures, etc (if you've played SWTOR you've seen the exact opposite of world immersion).The game does have negatives though like only 1 starter zone each, minimal races to choose from and they are all humanoid, lacking pvp, generic quest types, typical end game mechanics of raid or pvp, smallish community, etc.In general it's nothing completely ground breaking in design - the rifts are just another cherry on top of the same ole sundae like the story and voice acting is for SWTOR.  However, it's a pretty good cherry, and the sundae it's sitting on top of is pretty darn good also.  Definitely give this one a try if you haven't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2012"}

Really fun and challenging along with the Precision driving points and Aggressive driving points and stars awarded for racing objectives completed during the race.*Dirt 2 is really fun off-line and on-line: really beautiful game and upbeat game.*Dirt 3 is good, BUT not beautiful and upbeat like Dirt 2.  It has different events, but is dull and lifeless compared to Dirt 2.*Shift 2 is pretty good (you can enable damage in the options menu).  The tires are a little skiddy, but you can go into the options and tune your car.GT5 is good, except for career mode where you are allowed to enter cars that far out-class the competition.GT5 is a beautiful game graphically, but the career mode is broken.  Race the on-line challenge events, on-line racing or Arcade Mode to get your money's worth.UPDATE: 08/27/2012I've since bought Forza 4 and have played it for about a week religiously. And I really can't play GT5 for more than 10 minutes.  GT5 is an arcade game with some simulation-type elements, but is far from being the best racing simulator.  Forza 4 (and Forza 3) are more realistic in every way shape and form. Forza 4 is the closest you can get to the real thing on a video game console. GT5 does not compare. After playing Forza 4, GT5 makes me retch and gag.  GT5 looks good, but is one of the worst racing games you can buy.If you're looking for good and fun racing game, you'll have much more fun buying one of the following as a first choice:Dirt 2Need For Speed Shift (the original)Forza 3 or Forza 4As a second choice:Shift 2 UnleashedRace ProDirt 3And as a last choice when no other options are available:GT5I won't go into too much depth, but I'll just give the major good and bad.The Good:+Arcade Mode+Career Mode only if you don't upgrade your car, or keep it upgraded to a minimum most of the time.+Special Events You must have an Internet access for these.+Track creator+Events and competions outside of Career Mode: karting events, rally events, and other events outside career mode+Weather, rain, snow, day and night driving and the ability to select from different tires (casual, sport racing, dirt, snow, hard, medium and soft).The Bad:*For a game that has a reputation as being the best or is supposed the be the best and bills itself as being \"The Real Driving Simulator\", it falls flat on its face.  It's not even in the same league as Forza 3.  And Forza 3 came out a long time before GT5.  Forza 4 no doubt stomps GT5 in the ground even harder.*Where's the damage?? There is none.  There is just a generic \"thud\" sound.  In Arcade Mode, you can enabld damage.  When enabled, it is very arcady in nature. According to other reviewers, you will get that unlocked after reaching level 19 or 29 (after you've played the game for about 25 hours).  I'm currently at level 20.*Long load times all throughout the game--before you start a race, when you retrieve a car from the big rig, playing on-line.  You can enable damage in Arcade Mode. It's okay, but not the best.  There is just a generic thud for any all all bumps you get.*In career mode, GT5 allows you to enter cars that aren't competitive to enter races--cars whose Performance Points and/or Horse Power are way out of the league with other cars or is way under-powered in the PP and HP to enter the competition.  You can have cars that are either 100 to 300 or more PP and/or HP superior or inferior to the competition.  You can just fall asleep at the wheel and win if you've got the superior car.  You aren't the least bit competitive if you have the inferior car.For example, If you have a car that's qualified to enter an event--and that car is halfway fully upgraded, or fully upgraded, you will be at least 1/4 mile ahead of the #2 guy in just 3 minutes and stay so far out in front of the 2nd place guy for the entire race. You'll start out in about 7th place.  Within 2 minutes, you'll be in first place. Another minute later, you'll be about 1/4 mile in front of the guy in 2nd place.  And this is with all the assists turned off. Or if you can enter a car whose HP and/or PP are 100 or more below the rest of the competition--you will have no chance of winning.  You be battling just to stay out of last place or be in last place with the guy in 1st place a mile ahead of you.  In Arcade Mode, the cars are all competitive, regardless of the car you've chosen.Another example: If the car requires a British car, German car, or only allows only one specific model of car, and you upgrade that car, you will be allowed to race even though your cars is 100 PP and/or HP or more than every one else.  Within a minute or two you go from 7th to 1st and then win by a mile.*If your car is over-upgraded you would like to enter a competition that your vehicle would be allowed to enter otherwise, you aren't allowed to remove upgrades. For example, I wanted to enter a special event whose only requirements were Soft tires, FR, and &lt;500 PP.  My car met the requirements, but was over upgraded and was at 517PP.  I tried to remove the upgrades, but couldn't.  If I wanted to enter that competition, I would have to buy a new car.*Falls way short of Forza 3 (and I assume Forza 4) in so many ways for the enjoyment of the gamer.  I have to mention this because this game bills itself as \"The Real Racing Simulator\" and there is the fallacy that GT5 is the best (but is not). So just for the sake of comprison, I'll touch upon the major comparative differences:*Career Mode in Forza vs. GT5, there is no comparison.  Forza wins.  GT5 is a non-competitor here.  Forza is in a league all by itself with the number of events, competitions, vehicle tuning, upgrading your car, removing upgrades, ect.  You always have a car for the event you are entering in Forza.  When you complete a race, you usually get a new car and you are immediately taken to the next event on the calendar. You have three different racing choices for each event.*Overqualified on under qualified vehicles--Forza ensures the cars are all on same level.  You aren't allowed to race a car that's in another league--or better or worse--to enter the competition.  All races in Forza are competitive, unlike GT5 as I've mentioned above.*Forza immediately tells you if your car is not qualified, but would be if upgraded, or would be if some upgrades removed--or if you have the wrong car--Forza will immediately display all the cars you own that are qualified to enter.  After just a couple hours of gameplay, you'll always have more than enough cars in Forza, unlike GT5.  If desired, Forza will immediately install or remove upgrades to make your car eligible in just a second, if needed.*Forza allows you to select the racing skill of your opponents from 4 different levels (in Free Play and from the Events list).  GT5 only has this ability in Arcade Mode (beginner, intermediate and advanced).*Difficulty Customization, Forza in unparalleled:  GT5 doesn't reward you for disabling assists.  Forza gives you more XP or credits when you race with fewer assist.  The less assists you race with, the more you are rewarded in Forza.  In Forza, there are the about 6 different presets, but you can customize each setting too.  The number of assists, and the degree of assist (the degrees in between no assist and full assisted) in unparalleled.*Vehicle setup/tuning:  again Forza is unparalleled in the amount of tuning department.  You can tune your car any  way you like, race, chose to race again, re-tune your car a different way before the race ect.  All aspects of your vehicle can be tuned to your liking (unless its an economy car like a Geo Metro, or the like which doesn't allow tuning).  Forza gives you a full description and its very user friendly.  In GT5, you can only tune a couple of parts and that's only after you bought the most expensive transmission or suspension and it's not user friendly  like Forza (or Dirt 2 and Dirt 3).  GT5 does have a nice graphic, but no help.*Telemetry.  Press down on the D-pad and you can schroll over to six different telemetry screens.*Forza is much more user frienly in every way, none of the hassels long load times like GT5, ect.You spend all your time in Forza having fun racing without all the sill chores and excessive load time and wasting your time in races where your vehicle is so far over or under powered.*Forza has its Event list in addition to its Career Mode / Season Mode.  There are so many different event and competitions to choose from.  It's unparalled by GT5, Shift 2 and many other racing games combined.*In GT5, the first 5 races are also so easy to win, they should just give you the victory.  You need to complete the races to get the credits so you can buy more cars to enter other events, so you'll just have to suffer wasting your time being 1/2 mile ahead of #2 without trying.*In GT5, at the start, you can only enter a couple of events. You need to keep buying new cars with your limited amount of money just to buy a car to enter an event if you weren't fortunate enough to have one delivered to you.  This means you'll have to re-race many events to get the credits.  As mentioned above, you'll have to drive around the track for three laps a mile ahead of the guy in 2nd place.*The maker of GT5 was so concerned with ensuring he got the graffiti on the track just perfect and other things that didn't matter, that he forgot about actual gameplay.  He obviously didn't play the competition and try to emulate it or surpass it.  So for a game that is supposed to be the \"The real racing simulator\" or \"the best racing simulator\" isn't.  Forza ripped the torch out of Gran Turismo's hand, won the race by over a mile and while GT5 is still stuck at the starting line in first gear.*Both Forza 3 and 4 and GT5 run at 60 FPS, contrary to what one self-deluded PS3 fanboy posted in response to another review.I owned Forza 3 for about a year, then I bought GT5 in around Nov. of 2010 and was disgusted by by unuser friendly it was and lack of damage.  I did like the Arcade Mode and the track creator.  There was only one Seasonal Event which had expired.  I got rid of GT5 after owning it for just a few months  I rebought GT5 XL edition because it was selling for $20 and had the $20 DLC code.  I haven't played Forza 4 yet.  But Forza 3 blews away GT5 in every way.  If Forza 4 is better than Forza 3, then Forza 4 blows away GT5 even more.Forza (3 and 4) and GT5 are two different game.  They are enough differences in them that they are far from being the same experience.  GT5 is more of a role playing game with lots of drudgery and tedious tasks mixed in.The only real similarities is that both try hard to have the cars look and sound real, in addition to the real tracks.Forza in unparalleled in Career Mode/Season Mode, the events list menu on Forza 3 is HUGE, and on-line play is much better in Forza on the 360 period.This game is good, but flawed in career mode.  The fact that you can enter an noncompetitive car in GT5 career mode really spoils  the career mode and you can uninstall upgrades to make it competitive.Again GT5 positives:+GT5 is a great arcade racer with damage element.  The graphics are great and shinny, but on a smaller scale than Forza 3 and 4.  The tracks, handling, damage are all more realistic in Forza.  The damage in GT5 is very arcady.+Good in career mode with a non-upgraded car, or minimally upgraded car most of the time.+Arcade Mode.  It seems like damage is enabled from the start too.+Track creator.+Seasonal Events.+Events and competions outside of Career Mode: karting events, rally events, and other events outside career mode+Weather, rain, snow, day and night driving and the ability to select from different tires (casual, sport racing, dirt, snow, hard, medium and soft).+When using the controller, remap the buttons in the options menu so the analog L2 is for the brake, the analog R2 is to accelerate, and the right stick is used to look left and look right.  When you enable the look left/right with the right stick its similar to looking left and right in Shift 2 and Driver: San Fransico as long as you press the stick slowly to the left and right.-Non-competitive cars allowed to compete in Career mode.  I'm going to go buy Forza 4 today so don't have to put up with GT5's BS and other shortcomings. I sold Forza 3 a few months ago, but haven't bought Forza 4 because I have too many games for my 360. I re-bought GT5 because of the XL edition, the $20 dollar price and the fact my PS3 collects dust too much.-no damage, until you reach a high level.  Damage can be enabled in Arcade Mode, but its more \"digital\" in nature.-load times-doesn't compare to Forza in any way shape or form in vehicle setup, difficulty, damage, graphical damage and percentage of damage from minor hits, accumulated damage, ect.  GT5's damage is arcady in nature.-not in the same league as Forza for Forza's vehicle setup, difficulty customization, user friendliness, load times, ability to select the racing skill of your competition, Career mode, events list, but that doesn't mean GT5 isn't a good game.-GT5 is a good game as an arcade racer and for all the positives it offers. The graphics are great, but on a smaller scale. Forza's graphics are larger the track you're driving on is realistic in nature.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}

Heck, the 'mote even looks half way like the glowing sword, so you'd think this would be a no brainer, right? No, you would be wrong.From a controller standpoint, Force Unleashes' combat should be percise and fluid, using your hands to mimic force powers and lightsaber attacks. Krome Studios prefers the Alzimers approach of 'wild wiggling', the same low-quality efforts that most Wii titles are plagued from already. Throughout the 8 hr (really!?) experience, you'll be treated to the linear level desgns with bland color schemes, while you randomly wave you're arms at the inginite army of brain-dead stormtroopers. All planets are intitally the same, the enimes' textures are so horendous, it's hard to tell them apart, just random isles of thugs, with one jedi at the end. The bosses, jedi's at rave, follow the hack-n-slash gameplay of the levels, only to be finished off by choriographed quicktime events(which are one of the only high points of the game). The only time I was a true bad-ass was  when the game is in cinematics? I can't be one on my own accord?When a game gives box quotes on how 'you can choose good or evil', I was thinking allong the lines of havin that desicion more than once. The story was carefully thought out for a Star Wars game, or even movie, but when the cut-scene animations have characters with no emotion and such stiffness, it felt as if I was acting out a movie with action figures.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2008"}

The graphics are better, there are more units, and there's a bit of Civilization and Pharoh thrown in.First, the graphics, because they impress you right from the start. The graphics for the buildings, terrain and units are simply beautiful. From the rotating windmills to the reflections in the water from the sailing ships to the ways in which the units move, its really like watching a little world. You can zoom in and out with ease to get a detailed look or a strategic overview.Microsoft has been making these games for a while now and really brought together the best of many of them. Much of it is based on the Age of Empires system - build up your civilization, work through ages, build and grow. But they threw in better people-management a la Pharoh and Caesar. Instead of peasants standing around stupidly while farms wait for them, the workers actively seek out what needs to be done. They'll sign on at the lumber mill or farm where workers are needed.Set up a university, and the building is quiet. Start creating scholars to study there, and you'll see them out front, taking their classes!Of course there are opponents to deal with. You can of course build up a massive army and go wipe them out. But you can also try to set up diplomacy with them, or out-tech them.The little touches throughout the game are just amazing. Build in an arctic area and there's snow on your roofs. The music in the backround really draws you into the mood. The controls are all very intuitive and easy to use.Highly recommended - it's a game that really shows how amazing strategy gaming can be!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2003"}

The sluggish Castlevania 64 was too ambitious of a project for the Nintendo 64 hardware, and the Dreamcast version was scrapped shortly before it's release for reasons unknown. I can happily report however, that the PS2's Lament Of Innocence successfully ports the series into 3D without losing the elements that make it a great Castlevania game. Everything a Castlevania fan could want is here...fast-paced whip action, plenty of enemies, haunting musical score, beautiful backdrops, a dramatic story, and good voice acting as well. There are a couple of shortcomings though. While the graphics are beautifully detailed, many of the rooms in the game look identical and are too large and barren to be a part of an actual castle. Also, I found that having to pull up a menu to use items/switch equipment can be very tedious during encounters with enemies. Just for the sake of keeping the frustration factor low, I would have liked to have been able to just pause the game to sift through potions, serums, ect. Still, Lament Of Innocence does enough things right to make it worthy of bearing the Castlevania name. It's an excellent 3D platformer no PS2 owner should miss.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car.

The rest is pretty much horrible...1-Sonic takes Shadow's place (with Maria in Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Adventure 2, SA2B) by kissing a human girl...other than the fact that that point is being bitten off Shadow's story, it's utterly disgusting. They actually kiss...didn't think they were going to take it that far...Sonic, just stick to Amy!2-The storyline is a bad attempt at a good one. Ah, well-at least they didn't waste the whole time biting off their previous games...3-Loading times take up about half of the game, sometimes it takes so long I think my game crashed...and yet, it's not worth the wait, bringing me to my next point-4-Glitches! It's just so easy to make a list, and most of the time, they're not funny, which is weird for me, because I usually find glitches, hacks, mistakes, and bloopers highly amusing...5-Funny how they called it Sonic the Hedgehog after the artwork Sonic Team made for Genesis, while this one's garbage...yes, I'm even upset about the name.6-Again with the new character thing! Yes, Shadow and Jet were okay and Chip wasn't really that bad but ELISE and SILVER! My problem with Elise: When she kisses Sonic, he comes back to life-ew. My problem with Silver: He seems to be a futuristic Sonic, and he always seems to be Mr. Perfect (not referring to Curt Hennig). In my view, a completely useless character.7-Camera angles get more annoying by the level.

I've played this game before I tell myself only in a slightly different form.With Call of Duty: WaW, the developer, Treyarch has cemented their role as the proverbial second-stringer. They're the \"B\" squad that gets called in to play when the pro's need a break. The pro's of course being the creators of the Call of Duty franchise, Infinity Ward.The graphics, game engine, perks and game setting have all been lifted from Infinity Ward. What you're left with is essentially a World War 2 version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Sniper level? Check! Tank Battle? Check! Thompson sub machine gun, BAR, MP40...? Check, check & check! It's all been done before by previous games and if you're a gamer you've already played this game.Perhaps the most unfortunate part of World at War is that in the obsessive drive to copy CoD 4, obvious shortcuts were made in the development process. Take the difficulty level for example. On it's hardest setting, \"Veteran\", one would expect to fight against a capable enemy. One that uses cover and flanking maneuvers to try to outwit and overrun the player. No such thing. Instead Treyarch simply relies on sheer overwhelming numbers of Nazi's and most frustrating of all, grenades. Welcome to the game where an enemy solider can simultaneously snipe you behind cover and lob a 5 grenades that hit your player on the helmet.The online portion of the game took a hit too. Frequent disconnects from the host will ruin round after round. Spawn points that place enemies directly behind your character leading to some very frustrating deaths. Unimaginative level design is present too.No doubt Treyarch does have some talented staff. It's a shame that they dedicate their days chasing Infinity Ward and coping their work. I say if you can find this game in the bargain bin give it a shot. Otherwise wait until the inevitable next installment of Call of Duty made by Infinity Ward.--- EDIT ---I've had more time to play CoD: World at War and I feel compelled to edit my original post. While I believe that the basic premise of my original review holds, no doubt more credit should be given to World at War and Treyarch.I've spent much more time playing the game online and I have to admit that Treyarch has done a remarkable job adding options. The online portion offers fantastic options such as online cooperative campaign, competitive campaign, and of course the traditional Call of Duty online game types. There is a lot to like about the online portion of the game and I want to be sure to get that across this time.Since I apparently cannot change the amount of stars I will post my revised score here:How much fun is this game? *** - 3 STARSHow would you rate this game overall? *** - 3 STARS","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXU3Q","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Hidden Gem","reviewText":"This fourth Sly Cooper game was seemingly dumped on the market with little attention or fanfare, which is a shame since it's a truly brilliant little game. All the stealth/platforming/shooting and whatever else you might want in traditional console fashion with great graphics, large worlds and tons of gameplay time. If you miss the old days of Sony platformers and singleplayer fun you owe it to yourself to grab this great disc.Sly's bouncing through time, after a worse thief, etc. etc. The story is cute and livens up the gameplay a bit, but in the end it's justification to go from one cool time period to the next. You'll leave your hideout and emerge in a large open area rife with collectibles, missions and some of the best cartoon style graphics I have ever seen in video gaming. We're nearing that \"Pixar quality\" threshold more and more and if you like the style Sly Cooper 4 will impress.Gameplay is classic Sly. Jump, slink, slash, spin and sneak through open environments or linear quests to reach the goal. You play as Sly most of the time but his companions and ancestors also feature, and offer nice, short reprieves from the standard gameplay. There's so much variance and things to see... mini-games, secrets, side-missions, etc... Running out of things to do in the game will take you dozens of hours, and nothing's stopping you from finishing because the challenges are all well balanced and the trophies all offline singleplayer.I'd take the risk and click the buy button if this style of game appeals to you. It's rare in today's shooter and online focused game world, and it's fun from start to finish. Even the music is jazzy fun! You just can't go wrong here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00083G5BW","description":"For the first time in 10 years, the Madden NFL Football franchise has revolutionized its passing game-giving Madden NFL 06 the most groundbreaking and innovative offensive arsenal ever created. The new QB Vision Control lets you scan the field, look off defenders, and make perfect throws within your quarterback's unique field of vision. QB Precision Placement allows you to put the ball exactly where you want it. Lead the receiver to an open area, throw it behind him so he can come back to it or throw a jump ball and let him go get it.","reviewerName":"Kevin C. Li","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"I have just played it through once.  It is awesome.  For the game itself, it is good.  It is because the control is good.  When I log to the main menu, it has the instruction of how is it different than before.  For the visuals, it is better because I can see the clear view when I play like the flag, stadium, players (ah ha, football players).  The football players are clear.  I can see them in every face and the point scale during the game is like in the real TV NFL game like The Superbowl XXXIX in the beginning of February in 2005.  Remember?  It was a great game.  Let's talk back the game.  For example, when the touchdown happens, it will use a exciting showing style of how good feel is it for a touchdown.  Don't know?  Find it out by yourself.  A great feeling of visuals of playing this game.  For the sound effect, it is better than the last one because I can hear the judges speaking during the game when there are like flags, penalty and will the team accept the penalty or not.  The judges can speak all clear.  This is a big improvement as it was unclear last year of the game.  Also, they pick some good songs in between the game.  So, overall, it is good to be 5 stars grading.  Great game without any mixed bag.  Don't miss it, guys.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2005"}

This game has 3 different kinds of DRM, none of which work very well. If you can get SUCK U ROM to verify that its actually a real DVD (which it doesnt always do) youve still got to contend with verifying 2 different codes with rockstars webpage AND sign up for rockstars steam-wannabe system AND sign up with microsoft live gaming whatever the heck that is.Thats right, you have to sign up with TWO DIFFERENT ONLINE GAMING SYSTEMS to play this SINGLE PLAYER GAME.After two days of messing with this, I never got further than the loading screen. This game is buggy as heck and it is impossible to tell if its crashing because of securom, rockstar-steam, MS live, or just poor coding in the game itself.Rockstar used to make quality games that ran good and were fun to play. GTA4 shows that this is no longer the case.Not only will i be returning GTA4... I will be avoiding rockstar games altogether after this DRM abortion.

It's pretty much a carbon copy of FO 3 with a new story (mechanics are the same and so forth), and being that FO 3 was amazing this is a very good thing. I'm cool with more of the same plus a new story. I think it goes way beyond an expansion though, I've played a lot so far and still feel I have a lot to cover, and it's been great fun throughout. I DID struggle with the score. I was tempted to give it a 4 due to some freezes and the occasional glitch, but I must say that this aspect is greatly improved over the first game. As long as you save often and (like others have emphasized) DO NOT rely on auto save the freezes adn glitches become more of an annoyance than a game breaker. And they are so much LESS frequent than in the first game that I had to cut the game some slack and rate it based on everything else, thus the 5. This game is a truely great sequel to FO 3, it's large, ambitious, wickedly fun and goes deep into exploration and character building. Absolutely worth the long wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2010"}

The game's plot, conveyed through the occasional cutscene, is definitely one of its strong points.

{"product_name":"B002I0JZIS","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Great Value for Vita Bundle","reviewText":"Rather than a redundant interview of the Vita itself and and the included games, I will review the value of this bundle so you can determine if it's a good deal for you.  This bundle, when purchased, included in addition to the Vita, two games:Call of Duty: Black Ops - Declassified,Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Rewardand a 4GB memory card.  For the price of a Vita alone, to get two games and a memory card is an unbeatable deal regardless of how people may personally feel about the games themselves.  COD has a spotty reputation.  It seems people either love it or hate it.  As an essentially \"free\" add-in, I don't have too many complaints.  However, I can certainly see the point of those who paid to purchase this game as a stand-alone.  In campaign mode the missions are very short, redundant and can be mercilessly cheap at times.  Multiplayer is okay but nowhere near the size or capability of the PS3 version and glitches sometimes make it an exercise in futility.  The game is fun at times but I wouldn't buy it as a stand-alone.  On the other hand, Zero Escape is an awesome interactive puzzle game.  If you're more a fan of adrenaline-filled button mashing shoot-'em-ups, this likely won't be your cup of tea, but if you like interactive thinking games or adventure games, then this is an excellent add-in game. Quite honestly, if this bundle offered a choice of COD or Zero Escape, I'd select the Zero Escape.  Again, I won't get into lengthy break-downs and reviews of the individual games but I doubt you'll find much bad or not to like about Zero Escape.  Unfortunately, I think the Zero Escape bonus was a limited time offer but even if you only get COD it still seems like you're getting a free game, so even if you're disappointed, you haven't wasted any additional cash.  The memory card, although the smallest of the bunch and pretty much useless if you plan to download a lot of games, is still enough to get you up and running with the Vita; Unlike buying a bare-bones Vita for the same price with no card and being unable to play until you purchase one.

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Solid","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker tells the story of a boy who is growing up on Outset Island. It turns out that today is your birthday. You learn about the legend of the \"hero of time\", which was Link from The Ocarina of Time, and how he saved the world. It is customary for boys who reach the age of the Link to wear green clothing on their birthday. After a short amount of time, a huge bird shows up carrying a young pirate girl it apparently kidnapped. After saving the girl, the massive bird grabs your sister and flies away. So you have to set off to try to get your sister back.At first, the story seems pretty much unrelated to The Ocarina of Time, but as the game progresses, it ties itself in to the storyline of The Ocarina of Time pretty well. The world of Wind Waker is comprised of a bunch of islands connected by lots and lots of water. You get a talking boat, called the King of Red Lions, pretty early on in the game to travel between the islands. There are a few main islands on your map when you first start the game, but exploring the waters and finding new islands to add to your map is a big part of the game. The game map is pretty much a grid of squares, and every square on the map has some sort of island there for you to visit. However, it is not necessary to visit a lot of the smaller islands.As for the main islands, there are a lot of things to see and do. They are all inhabited by a lot of people that you can talk to, buildings to go into, and puzzles to solve. You will find yourself constantly be traveling back and forward between them during your quests. Unfortunately, this is where the game starts to have some problems. Traveling between islands, especially early on in the game is pretty boring. It can take a whole lot of work (changing the direction of the wind) and time just to get from one place to another. The fact that there isn't much to do out on the open water pretty much means you just point your ship in the direction of the island that you want to go to and wait until you get there. This is helped somewhat when you gain the ability to teleport to various places in the world, but you will still find yourself traveling the seas for extended periods of time.In many ways, Wind Waker is almost a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time. Many of the gameplay mechanics that were present in The Ocarina of Time remain unchanged here, which is fine considering that The Ocarina of Time played very well. The targeting system remains pretty much the same as it has been. Targeting enemies locks you on to them, which allows you to easily maneuver around them during a battle. The combat and the inventory system also remain largely unchanged. You still go into the inventory menu, and assign various items to one of three buttons that you can then press to use that item. The only real significant change to the combat system is a button you can press to dodge an enemy attack and strike them in the back if timed correctly. So if you are familiar with the previous two Zelda games, you should be able to instantly pick up and play this one.The combat feels pretty good. Targeting and attacking enemies is smooth and feels natural. There is a pretty good variety of enemies that you will get introduced to throughout the game. Some are easier then others and many of them require very specific strategies to defeat. The game also likes to throw a lot of enemies at you at once, which can make for some pretty intense battles. As for the enemy design, they all look pretty good.Most of the items in the game are straight out of the previous games. You will see familiar items like the boomerang, bow, bombs and the master sword. There are a few new items as well such as a grappling hook that allows you to swing on stuff or a deku leaf that you can use as parachute when falling. The Wind Waker is basically the Ocarina of the previous game. You can use it to conduct music, which all have magical effects. For example, you will be able to change the direction of the wind, or warp around to various parts of the world.Ocarina of Time had some extremely memorable dungeons in the game such as the Water Temple. The dungeons in Wind Waker pretty much follow the Zelda formula. Unfortunately the dungeons are not as strong as those found in previous games. None of the dungeons are very difficult. The dungeons do have puzzles, but they are all pretty straight forward, so what you need to do to move on is usually obvious. However, the dungeons are still fun to go through despite not posing much of a challenge.The same can be said for the boss battles which take place at the end of the dungeons. While in the dungeon, you usually find a new item that you must use later on in some way to defeat the boss. While many of the bosses look pretty cool, none of them are particularly challenging. This is mostly due to the fact that it is pretty easy to dodge everything they throw at you, but they can still be a lot of fun to fight.The graphics in the game are surprisingly good. When the first screenshots of the game surfaced years ago, many fans were upset with the game's new cell-shaded art direction. But as it turns out, the game looks great. The artistic style just looks fantastic and maintains a high quality throughout the entire game. The characters have a lot of expression in their faces and all of the animation is pretty fluid. There are also a few cool looking effects in the game, such as the puff of smoke when enemies are killed. The game also runs at a pretty smooth frame rate.Overall, Wind Waker is a pretty good game. It sticks close to the Zelda formula, so fans of the series should know exactly what they are getting into. It follows the gameplay set back in Ocarina of Time so closely that it pretty much feels like a slightly easier and not quite as deep version of Ocarina. So if you have been dying for more of that great Ocarina of Time gameplay, Wind Waker delivers pretty nicely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2006"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"jdmWONG","summary":"Wii U","reviewText":"For me, there is enough good to outweigh the bad.  Overall I really like my Wi U.  It is great to finally see Nintendo games in HD and despite having less raw power than the upcoming next gen systems I firmly believe the graphical differences will be much less than people are being led to believe.  Playing games like Trine 2 I have really been impressed with what the Wii U can do graphically.  I think that once developers hone in on the systems strengths we will see some really impressive looking games.My two biggest hang ups about the system are the lack of a Blueray player and the very small amount of on board storage.  I almost passed on the system because of this (I am glad I didn't).  I would have been more than willing to shell out a higher price tag for a Wii U that offered these features.  32GB is really pathetic, yes I can run an external HDD but I don't want to, it's messy and really clutters up my entertainment center.  One of the things I loved about the Wii U was how compact it was but after cluttering up the entertainment center with an external HDD and the gigantic controller it really isn't very compact anymore.Ultimately I purchased the Wii U to play 1st party Nintendo games in hope of a few of the better 3rd party ports making it over too (so far that's exactly what I got); although the selection may not be huge right now there are a number of great titles on the way this fall\\winter from 1st and 3rd parties and I am sure by mid 2014 I won't be able to keep up with them all.Nintendo is a company that cares about making great games and trying to bring something new to the market with the gamepad.  No it isn't perfect but it is actually pretty cool when used correctly in a game.  I like that the online play (although limited in comparison to other consoles) will be free, Miiverse is free, You do not have to pay any monthly fees or subscriptions  just to use the full system features or unlock apps.  If you're a Nintendo fan on the fence I say pick it up, Nintendo has been taking a lot of unwarranted heat in the media and online forums, yes they have made some mistakes but not enough to justify all the hate.  Mark my words, not supporting Nintendo will ultimately be a very bad thing for the gaming industry as a whole.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FUWCRY","description":"Let's get cookin', Mama! Now you can learn how to cook on your Nintendo DS! Prepare foods, combine raw ingredients, cook the meal and present your culinary masterpiece to Mama for your final score.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Kitchen Madness","reviewText":"I won't say that Cooking Mama is the best game I've played in recent months. Surely, there's something more important than cooking - like, killing zombies on the X360, for example. However, it's certainly the most innovative, especially when you consider how much you can do on the limited dimensions of a Nintendo DS touch screen.In Cooking Mama, you're an apprentice in the fine art of cuisine management. Your master, a certain Mama, will put you through a series of saliva-inducing recipes, and will grill you through the preparation of each as if it's the only thing you live for. You can choose to practise before hand, but when you go into the actual process of making a particular food, you'll find that there's no room for error. A wrong move, and Mama will not hesitate to show you her wrath.Making a food involves several steps. Some are short, while some may take forever. For example, when preparing a pan-fried fish, you'll have to go through the coating of the fish slices, the melting of the butter, the actual pan-frying and the arranging of the plate. Each process in turn involves different ways of doing things. Coating the fish slices, for example, requires you to drag your stylus in a left-right manner while touching the fish. Melting the butter requires you to rapidly drag the butter in a circular motion when it's on a hot plate. Pan-frying involves a \"following the command on-screen\" mini-game that requires you to perform whatever Mama tells you to, and so on.The impressive thing here is that, even though you're just stroking your stylus throughout the game's 70+ recipes, you're essentially doing different things. It's a bit like Trauma Centre from last year, but instead of seeing body parts, you're looking at food. If you're more adventurous, you can even combine recipes to form new ones, which adds depth to the gameplay.For a game as quirky as this, it's understandable that it uses quirky graphics. The presentation of Cooking Mama is light-hearted, and makes the hectic process of cooking (to me, at least) much more enjoyable. The music is a little weak, even though it does have some nice variety. But seriously, graphics and audios are not what you'd buy this game for. I mean, who cares about these things when you've Fried Octopus Balls to make?For its sheer audacity in bringing the kitchen onto the DS, I'd recommend Cooking Mama to every owner of the DS. Don't expect to see your DS in a few weeks, however, if you bought this game, and have a missus in the house. Now, if only my wife can learn a few tips out of this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2006"}

FF10 & FF9 I liked. Good stories & loveable characters.  But FF7 was a drag.Then I saw all the positive reviews (\"best game ever\"), so I decided to give FF7 a second playing in 2004, to impress me.  But I still did not like it.  IMHO the major flaw is that FF7 has too many \"dry\" sections where you fight-fight-fight and almost nothing happens storywise (example - climbing the 100-floor building of your enemy -or- the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress).  In some sections, literally hours pass by with no story... it feels like a step backwards to the near-nonexistent stories of the original nintendo..Also the Battle Engine - totally unbalanced.  A good RPG will provide balance between physical & magical attacks, so they are near-equal.  A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills & weaknesses (like real people-some are fighters; others are healers). Not so FF7:- it's all magic... physical attacks are worthless (about 1/4 the damage)- and the characters are completely interchangeable. You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl.  And then the next battle, completely flip it around, so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer.  And then flip it again!  No individuality. Each character is identical.  Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting... not realistic at all..Also, the story, while good, is poorly executed.  It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planet's \"health\" - very simple concept - but the writer dances around & adds un-necessary complication.  He takes 2+2 = 4 and turns it into 1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4.  That's why so many gamers go, \"Huh?

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"jomojomo","summary":"Crysis 1 was a 2007 game; Crysis 2 belongs in 2004","reviewText":"Crysis 2 is a big budget, big name sequel released in 2011; there should be something new and interesting here to justify the $59 price tag.  There isn't.  It is merely a competent console shooter that will be forgotten in a few months.The reason PC gamers are upset is because crysis 1 was new and innovative and high end; and the CEO of crytek boasted that the Crysis 2 would have the best AI in gaming history,  and called it a \"revolutionary masterpiece\".  Customers have a right to be more than a little angry at being mislead.The gaming philosophy behind C2 is different than C1.  Linearity and caged fighting has replaced the multiple approach multiple strategy of C1.  Occasionally there is a bit of choice, but it pretty much always boils down to \"Maximum armour & shoot furiously while ducking behind the hundreds of conveniently overturned cars\" or, \"Stealth along obvious path around everyone\". The suit functions are highly automated, reducing strategic choices further.  Needless to say,  the skill needed to master this game is minimal, and the replay factor is zero.So why did Crytek make Crysis 2 on PC a mediocre console game and nothing more? The reason is the console limited amount of high speed random access memory and memory bandwidth available for the devs to work with.PS3 and Xbox360 have a max of 512 mb available for video and cpu, and the bandwidth is low by today's standards.  HD Textures (well, kinda HD cause it gonna be at 720p or less) ect can be streamed by that old tech OK, but that means gameplay is linear and restricted.  As caching is extremely limited the game has to know where you are going and what the possibilities are.  Variables, player input, etc all add size to the needed cache (ram).  And without the needed ram, there would be a loading screen every 2 minutes.So the number of variables and size of loaded environments have to be mercilessly limited. You are not part of a world that you can freely explore; rather you are an actor in a predefined script, a rat in a maze.  That's just the way it is.  Moreover, if you start adding kicking AI and realistic physics (not physX, but physics), the memory requirements go up.  Crysis 1 pretty much needed 2 gig (total video + cpu ram) as a minimum, Crysis 2 runs on 512 mb.Right now, because all pubs are chasing the maximum dollar, all games are going to be coded for 720p with an online multiplayer component with' 512 mb and 6 year old memory bandwidth limits--which means all fps gameplay will follow the same rules.  Moreover, because online play is so important in the xbox revenue model, further bandwidth restrictions are imposed on game devs.But why should that matter to a PC gamer?  Well, when a dev creates a console game PC port, all of the above restrictions will remain in place because changing them would require a near entire re-write of the code, pretty much doubling dev costs and that just aint gonna happen.  Which makes PC port fps as  derivative and predictable as their console progenitors.  And that is fine, just don't tell the world that your game is revolutionary and has the best of anything.I hope this console generation ends soon, so devs can bring some new ideas to games that only more powerful hardware can allow.  Unfortunately, it looks like that won't be until 2015, and even then I don't think any of those future consoles will be cutting edge in anyway.  Everyone learned from Sony's including expensive tech in the PS3 in 06.Edit: there was an interview with Tiago Sousa  one of the lead programmers for crytek yesterday which you can google.  He said \"\"My finger-pointing at Microsoft/Sony would really be on the memory side.  It's way too low, and the biggest crippling factor from a visual perspective. I would really like to see next-gen console platforms with a minimum of 8GB.\"","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}

Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing.

The game features numerous cut scenes taken directly out of the film, in widescreen dvd quality. This should be enough to make any Star Wars fan race to buy this game as the dvd isnt out until November 1st. However! Revenge of the Sith is a very solid third person action game. It combines the hack and slash action of Jedi Power Battles with the minor RPG style upgrading found in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. With this being said, Revenge of the Sith works extremely well. It's fast and furious combat only gets better as you earn experience to upgrade your skills as you see fit. You can upgrade your force abilities (push, heal, saber through, etc.) and your combat skills (critical hits, area attacks, etc.) This makes every level's action more and more intense with seemingly hundreds of moves at your disposal. In Revenge of the Sith you alternate between Obi-Wan and Anakin, playing throughout every action scene featured in the film, as well as some never before seen engagments that expand on the film. For example, more action sequences aboard Grevious's ship, and a lengthy duel between Anakin and Mace Windu. Along your quest through the final stages of the Clone Wars, you'll encounter various enemies, from buzz droids to crab droids, from droidikas to the simple battle droids. Then ofcourse with the execution of Order 66, as Obi-Wan, your advisaries change. You'll fight through Clone Troopers and finally your fallen aprentice Anakin, now Lord Vader. After you complete the single player campaign (featuring an alternate ending) you can head off to the bonus missions which provide hours of even more fun. One mission even allows you to play as Yoda. After completing the campaign you will also have earned access to all the video clips from the film, to watch as much as you desire. Concept art is also avilable for viewing, some of these stills are scenes cut from the theatrical release of the movie, this is a nice addition and worthy of unlocking for sure. Two player co-op and duel modes are avalible for playing with many areas to fight in, as Anakin, Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, Count Dooku, Grevious, Darth Vader, Ben Kenobi of Epidsode 4, and several others. Graphics wise, ROTS is solid but nothing mind blowing. The gameplay is very tight and doesnt ever let up. Skywalker Sound makes it's contribution with sounds directly from the movies and a genuine Star Wars soundtrack, as to be expected. I found ROTS to be a very entertaining game that exceeded my expectations, as movie to game adaptations arent always that great. It is certainly one of the best Star Wars games to come along in recent years and I highly recommend it for your Xbox. Thanks for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"Chevy","summary":"Max Payne 3 - A Must Play Game","reviewText":"We fought our way through the bar and made it outside.  Beside a blue dumpster, it wasn't much to look at, just some broken beer bottles, empty wine bottles, some broken steel-frame chairs, cardboard boxes and wood pallets.  The aged brick wall had multiple shoddy concrete patch repairs on it.  The foundation had chunks of concrete chipped out of it, all dully lit by a faint street light.Normally this wouldn't be cause for a second glance, but when you've been gaming as long as I have, seeing how graphic detail has advanced since the beginning of video games, I couldn't help but stop and stare at all the detail placed in this one spot.  I appreciated it not because it held any real significance, but because it was just a small passer-by area in the environment that held its own story.This was a part of town that didn't care so they just threw trash out on the ground even if there were dumpsters right there.  People here didn't bother with lifting a dumpster lid to throw trash away.  This one little spot held an ambience all its own and seeing the level of detail put into it, knowing the amount of work involved to create just this spot made me appreciate it for what it was, a pile of trash in a gritty action novel, only in this novel I'm the main character.  I'm the alcoholic, pain-pill-popping bad-ass wallowing in my own self misery looking for answers in the bottom of a bottle.  I have guns and I know how to use 'em and I'm gonna make sure those rat bastards pay with their lives.There is immense detail throughout this entire game.  Everything looks great from the characters down to the grit on tile floors.  The brutal graphic violence is a highlight of Max Payne 3.  Entry and exit wounds are vividly displayed in bloody detail.  Max sees a lot of action and even the sweat stains on his shirt are realistic.  When Max gets injured it shows.  He'll get cuts, scrapes, bruises and shot, and he bleeds like anyone else.The animations of the characters are realistic as they move naturally in the world.  People react to their wounds given the chance.  When you spray bullets into an enemy their body reacts to every impact.The A.I. holds some of the best in gaming.  Enemies will bob and weave if they see you have them in your sights and they have no nearby cover.  They will seek out cover and will duck, run and dive to get to it.  They don't want to be shot.  Max is usually outnumbered and enemies will move from cover to cover to advance on him while others stay back to cover them.  They will try to flank Max from multiple sides and some will blitz, running straight toward Max.Health does not regenerate so Max takes pain-killers to reduce damage he accumulates.  A full-body silouette on the HUD shows Max's damage in red.  It rises like a thermometer as he takes damage.  The weapon wheel is quickly accessed with the touch of a button and changing weapons is easy and fast.  While aiming at the hip or down sights you have the option of right or left over-the-shoulder views.Bullet-time and shoot-dodge are two ways to  enter slow-motion mode and both greatly increase your chances of survival.  Bullet-time is very useful to take out multiple enemies or just an irritating enemy that keeps ducking to cover every time you aim his way.  Shoot-dodge allows Max to jump/dive in all four directions.  If you shoot-dodge from a high location and fall to lower ground Max can take damage or even die.The weapons look and sound realistic.  They all have their own recoil and this is visible when Max shoots them.The music sets the mood for each part of the story.  The story starts off simple, but as it progresses its depth grows and the webs of intrigue multiply.  This is a solid story from beginning to end.  There are no load screens.  The game loads in the background while the story cinematics play.  The trade-off here is that you cannot skip the cinematics.  I like this style because it keeps the flow of the game moving.  For example, the cut scene may have narrative and show Max preparing for what he is about to do, then when you regain control you are in the action.Most of the game takes place in Brazil, but there are flash-back levels that take place in New Jerysey during winter.  All levels look fantastic.I haven't run across flaws with this game engine after two play-throughs.  Even the typical graphic tearing flaw present in most games of a body sunk halfway into the floor or a wall, did not happen here.  It kept a steady frame-rate and had solid performance throughout.Max Payne 3 is a solid game all around.  It offers a great story, fun gameplay and awesome graphics.  This is another masterpiece by Rockstar and deserves to be experienced.  It has high replay value and I highly recommend it.PARENTAL WARNING: Max Payne 3 depicts realistic graphic violence.I recommend viewing some youtube videos of gameplay prior to buying this game for children.  There are four excellent Developer Diary videos that showcase the features and violence of Max Payne 3.  Just enter the words \"Max Payne 3 Developer Diary\" or \"Max Payne 3 Dev Diary\" and they should be available.Max Payne 3PS3Max Payne 3XBOX 360","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"The best Sandbox title ever!","reviewText":"This is a great game from beginning to end. Its a sandbox game that works will with a western theme without the constraints of space in many other games that have you zig zag around buildings to get to point A to point B. As you travel you always stumble across people that might need your help. They are random events that show up which is a nice touch on your travels. Your always able to use stage couches to make your travels faster.Now with that said, The guy you are John Mariston is a cool character that is trying to redeem himself for his past deeds. He doesn't really have a choice in the matter if he wants to see his family. He helps the federal government out to round up people in his old posse. It sounds simple enough but the story is pretty good and it does have its highs and lows. The voice acting is extremely well done and even the Mexicans speak spanish in many cases without you knowing what they are saying.The gameplay is really great and the missions are varied. You don't have to do a lot of same type of missions during your main objectives and you can always go back to them to get a better score. These are the main missions. Besides that you have the stranger missions which are helping some random mission but then you have actual random missions that will pop out of nowhere. That could be helping some guy getting chased by a couple of coyotes or helping a lady who got her wagon stolen. These missions just help your honor and give you a little money. Honor is something you can get or lose depending on if you do good or bad things. If you do many bad things than your honor will lower giving out Grand Theft Auto chases for you.The controls are well done. Shooting is done with automatic targeting put it is always on certain mass so getting headshots usually take a bit more work unless enemies are hiding behind things. You can also hide behind things with its own cover system that works rather well. Beyond this the world is really big and there is a lot to do. The game is gorgeous to look at and it comes to life with many kinds of animals from skunks, armadillos, deer, snakes, coyotes, bobcats, wolves, bears, and so many more. Its amazing how much they put into it. You would think that as a western that it would all look the same but you have different types of environments spread throughout the world that you explore.There is a lot of replay in this game with multiplayer that allows you to form posses up to 8 people. There is varied modes you can play or you can play in an open world being the whole single player map to goof of in with others. Its a whole lot of fun and although there has been bugs. None of it distracts by how good this game is and the patch should be out shortly as well as a free downloadable co-op content as well. I highly recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

{"product_name":"B008AU4YEA","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Packed With Platforming Goodness!!","reviewText":"I never played any of the original Rayman games, so this review will be from the perspective of someone new to the series. This game is a next gen platforming experience through and through. It takes place in Dream Land and apparently nightmares have been running rampant. The story is really just to provide the thread that binds the whole game together. What it really boils down to is fun and addictive gameplay.This game is HUGE. There are a multitude of worlds and each world has a number of levels. During each level you will collect currency and rescue the world's inhabitants. Unlocking future levels and worlds is dependent on how much currency you have collected. The currency carries over to your main hub where you select levels and heroes. You'll want to play each level multiple times to rescue all the inhabitants and collect enough currency in a single run to achieve a gold trophy rating on the level. You may also receive a lucky ticket that you scratch off using the stylus on the game pad to unlock gallery items. The game really amounts to collecting and unlocking.Gameplay itself, as I stated previously is a platforming hack and slash (well punch and kick in this case). The controls are simple and easy to pick up quickly. It's pretty standard jump attacks, grounded attacks and ground pound attacks. Enemies seem to be more to throw off your platforming rhythm than to require strategy to defeat, which is typical of the genre. Exploration and attention to what's going on in the background is rewarding and required to find all the inhabitants to rescue and enough currency to achieve the gold trophy.Graphically, the game is beautiful. It has a painterly, sort of concept art feel to it and it works on every level. Character design is goofy and tongue-in-cheek and overall everything fits together beautifully in terms of design. Nothing feels out of place in the world. Ubisoft really focused on creating atmosphere in a 2d, side scrolling, environment. Backgrounds are full of life even if you are unable to interact with them directly. It creates and ambiance that really makes the world feel alive.Sound is great, the music is high quality and you can tell it was a focus. The themes compliment the worlds and are relatively complex.The utilization of the gamepad is interesting and effective. From the main hub you can access several menu options or fast travel to specific level selection areas. During gameplay you can control the environments using the touch screen. It makes platforming much more involved and the obstacles were more rewarding to complete as well. You can pick up enemies and hold them while the protagonist punches them, or just chuck them into a pit. You can move platforms, cut ropes, rotate objects (by rotating the gamepad itself) and many other things. It makes the game much more immersive than you would expect.Overall, there is just a ton of content here. Between hundreds of levels and different worlds and scenarios, assorted challenges and mini-games, collecting all the playable characters (there's like 30), collecting all the creatures and collecting all the artwork, you could log some serious time into this outing. There's fifty bucks worth of game here and then some, and then some more and then... well you get it.I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because at the end of the day, it is a 2D platformer with a paper thin story. Just because there is a boat load of content doesn't mean it will hold your interest until the very last item is collected and boss defeated. If you're looking for the definitive platforming of this console generation, however, this is it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}

When I put the game into my 360, I knew exactly what I was expecting:  tight gameplay, awesome horde mode, awesome graphics, and a lame story.  Well, everything came to be true, except the part about the lame story.  Gears of War 3 provides the most cohesive and  emotional story in the Gears franchise.The story this time around was written by Karen Traviss, an author who has written several gears novels among other video-game book novels including halo.  You can definitely tell the story has gotten a good shot in the arm this time around.The music is awesome as ever, the multiplayer is just insanely polished and one of the finest tps experiences I've had the pleasure to have experienced.  I really see no cons to this game other than the fact that epic could have done more with beast mode.  But horde 2.0 is just insane and the amount of work the developers put into it, they could have easily made horde 2.0 into an entirely separate game.  That's how deep and polished it is.I will be playing Gears of War 3 for a very long time, due to dedicated servers support, 4-player co-op, insanely polished gameplay, awesome and LONG campaign (took me around 13-15 hours to beat on NORMAL).  This is one of the best games out there for the Xbox 360 and I highly suggest anyone who has an Xbox 360 pick it up ASAP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2011"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Chris A.

This is a family friendly racing game that anyone can pick up and play, and enjoy.When you first start the game, you are subject to a trial run to make sure you know how to handle your ATV in competition.  This short tutorial teaches you all that you need to know about the game and how to complete tricks, before you jump in and start racing.The heart of the game is in the World Tour mode.  There is also a Single Race mode, Time Trial, and Online play (there is no local multiplayer mode).  In World Tour, riders begin their career at Stage 1 and must compete in a variety of race styles (race, sprint, freestyle) to unlock points.  When you have enough points, you advance to (unlock) Stage 2, and so on, until you eventually progress through the game's 10 stages.  The good news here is that you do not have to win (or place in the top 3) in order to earn these points.  Even placing 10th will net you a couple points towards your goal.  Of course, the better you place, the more points you earn, but races are repeatable until you acquire the right number to unlock the next stage.Right from Stage 1, you have a variety of tracks, so you are not racing repeatedly around the same terrain.  These tracks are gorgeous to look at, and a heck of a lot of fun to careen around at top speed.  As others have noted, the tricks are amazing, the air is huge, and the scenery is simply breathtaking--if you have time to admire it.  More likely, you will be looking to land your trick, or ahead to the next jump.Your ATV is the 'main character' in the game, allowing you to build and customize it any way you like.  Winning races and unlocking stages will award you with special performance parts and items to equip, and even if you are not mechanically minded, it's a lot of fun tweaking your ATV the way you want it, be that simply a new paint job and some decals.  However, you will quickly learn the value of adding performance parts to help with your next race.  At the beginning of the game, you only have two ATV garage spots, but as you progress, more become available, so you will soon have an entire garage of ATVs at your disposal.  Some races require a certain engine qualification etc to enter, so having several ATVs of different specs is a plus.You choose a rider for your ATV, and can change riders at any time between races.  Riders don't increase your skills as such, but each one has a unique Special Trick to add to your repertoire, so trying them all is fun.  Additional riders can also be unlocked.  One of the neat little touches I like is that your rider starts a race with clean clothes, but ends it splattered from head to toe with mud.Overall, this is a very accessible racer for everyone who enjoys, or has even a passing interest in, the racing genre.  Good clean (or in this case, muddy!) fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2008"}

I have other good XBOX 360 games, but have collected 1\" of dust since the first second I slid Oblivian's disk into the XBOX 360. Just from a RPG perspective, this title completely embarrasses every Japanese turn-based RPG out there. I just finished FF XXII on the PS2 and it was a quality epic production in it's own right, but pales in comparison. The concepts in the game aren't new if you played Elder Scrolls III, but ED IV-Oblivion builds on the ES III engine with massive improvements in most game attributes.Pros: Gorgeous next-gen graphics. One of the best looking titles on XBOX 360 and easily the best looking RPG on any console system. Amazing musical score, environmental & ambient sounds. Second-to-none voice acting and an unprecedented amount of it. HUGE environments dwarfing Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas Unprecedented complex and deep character development and leveling Hundred and hundreds of missions, and we are talking quality here, not just quantity. Each mission is complex with multiple optional solutions, takes time to complete with multilevel/multi-step involvement. It is deeply satisfying when you have completed any mission. SAVE THE GAME AT ANY TIME IN ANY PLACE - even during combat!Cons (Unfortunatelty, there a few and they are worth mentioning: Load times are tragically long - something that has not improved over ES III. There are times when the game will permanently freeze the XBOX 360 system requiring a reboot - another issue that was not fixed from ES III. I am not sure you can call this a con, but the official strategy guide and online help is necessary to understand and enjoy all of the complexities of the game. Though mission assistance is not required, understanding all functionalities, as well as environmental and character attributes is amplified with reference material.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

Looking upon the 50 foot statues of kings long dead adorning the wall of a castle, and travelling into the depths of the castle and finding NPC's which offer me assistance, and are realistic in the way that they approach helping you - given the limitations of programming involved.I don't feel like I have to worry about character breaking bugs as I've encountered in other MMOs.  I don't feel like I have to worry about lack of content... because the amount of scenery and architecture and design in this world leaves me feeling as though it'd take me a year to see everything.Combat is very straightforward, and makes a lot of sense.  Levelling up your character is straightforward, although the Talent system seems a bit confusing at first I think I understand it more.I'm a fairly new player to this MMO - but it is a great thing to be able to chat with friends through Ventrilo or Teamspeak and be able to work together to solve quests.  I feel almost overwhelmed at the world as I follow my friends along a myriad of paths in the forest, hoping they don't leave me behind as it'd be hard to find my way back I'm sure.  But after going through an area a few times - I learn it and it isn't so much of an issue.I haven't seen 1/10 of the content available by all accounts... but what I've seen so far gives me a link to my character, and a feeling of accomplishment when I log off each night having stepped a little farther along in his progression.I'm not a power gamer by any means - so the experience I have as a casual player is fulfilling in itself as I don't feel rushed into fighting Mr. UBER player in the PVP battlefields.I didn't know what to think at first... but after trying it out for a few days it grew on me.  After accomplishing the first few dozen quests out of what I hear are thousands available I know that I have a lot to look forward to in the upcoming levels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2005"}

Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"Not as great as Burnout but a good arcade racer nonetheless","reviewText":"Sega's Full Auto for the Xbox 360 is a racer that will never be mistaken for a Gran Turismo simulator-clone. Full Auto has more in common with Criterion's Burnout racing series. What Full Auto does to distinguish itself from Burnout is the fact that each vehicle is armed to the teeth with all sorts of weaponry. I see this Sega arcade racer as the offspring of a marriage between Burnout and the Twisted Metal series.The game is easy to pick up and play and get into. In fact, this is one of its advantages over other racers in that the racing physics involve in forgiving. The goal of Full Auto is not to show how well the game can simulate racing on the console, but to immerse the player in road rage-inducing mayhem. Everything about Full Auto is gearing towards a more arcade-type game. The driving controls are very simple. The game makes very good use of all the face buttons, bumpers and triggers on the 360 controller.The gameplay is all about full auto destruction and the developers really spent alot of time making sure that everything on the screen is destructible. Whatever you can see and aim at can be destroyed either by running over and into it or by using your vehicle's choice of weaponry. One thing I've had alot of fun pulling off is jumping off the crest of a downslope on a track and at the same time launching off a few missiles at the top floors of a building at the bottom of said downslope. By the time my car lands from its jump the building I shot my missiles at are crumbling down to its foundation and taking out any rival racers that were ahead of me.The one new innovation in gameplay that Full Auto has is the ability to rewind time back a few seconds if one gets totalled or makes the wrong turn. This going back in time part of the gameplay is helpful but not always available. Only by causing destruction on everything around you can you fill the gauge meter enough to make the option available. But with Full Auto that is easy enough to accomplish. It's a nifty trick and when used properly can help the player learn just how to make a certain sharp turn on the course without losing too much speed or learn which side track and ramps are best in overtaking a lead car.The graphics in Full Auto is not as photorealistic as the ones in the 360's Project Gotham Racing 3, but what it lacks in breathtaking beauty it has in the amount of destructive particles and items that fill up the screen. The processing power of the 360 seemed to have been utilized in making the game's environment fully destructible while doing just enough to make the car models just slighty better than the previous generation of racers. The sound effects are great when heard through a surround sound system. Every roar and rumble of the cars' engines are distinct, but its in the weapons fire and explosions that surround sound really shines.If I have any complaints about Full Auto its that the game on multiplayer doesn't allow for the use of the time-rewind option. This makes multiplayer a more conservative side of the game's fun. There's less reckless abandonment type of racing in multiplayer than there is when playing the single-player mode. The game also doesn't add anything else to the racing genre that Twisted Metal and Burnout hasn't already brought to fore. Full Auto did marry the those two games' best features together and pulls it off well enough. For those on a budget I would recommend this fun arcade-racer only as a rental. Rent it out and give it a spin to see if its to their liking. Those who want another racer for their 360 and can afford it then I recommend this game as a buy. It's a fun, no-nonsense game that is just a few things short of being great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2006"}

Some of the touch screen elements are utilized well and make for fun gameplay even if they do get repetitive.

The controls are familiar to Uncharted veterans, and the touch/motion controls add a welcome alternative to the climbing and balancing controls (I never understood why they took out the six-azis balance controls on Uncharted 2 & 3).I'm not too far into the story yet, but it seems as if it will shape up to be at least as good as Uncharted 1. If my opinion changes about the story, good or bad, I will post and edit.Like I said I am not too far into the game (I just got my Vita today 2/28/2012), but so far I don't see how anybody could be disappointed by this entry into the Nathan Drake saga. The voice acting, as always, is top notch. So far no sign of Sully or any other familiar faces from the PS3 trilogy, but the new characters introduced so far are interesting, well voiced, and honestly a welcome change.My only complaint so far (and it's more a matter of taste in women) is that the [what I assume to be] love interest in the game, Marisa Chase, is... Let's just say not-AS-hot as Elena & Chloe. Don't get me wrong, she is attractive enough, and certainly seems like she will be an interesting character, but they set the bar pretty high with a smoking hot feisty blonde, and an even hotter, feistier, British brunette.All-in-all this is THE game to get to show off your shiny new PS Vita's power, and fits right at home with the PS3 trilogy.

You don't ever get a sense that the forces of Morder or her allies are coming for you.  You don't feel as if the fate of the free peoples of middle earth hang in the balance because, of course, they don't.  It is still, at its core, just another unchanging MMO where the enemies wander around but never attack and in the end you're basically just an axe murderer going around hacking up creatures that would have been perfectly content to stand there and mind their own business if you hadn't trod into their lair.  You can hang out in town and be perfectly safe forever, which is definiately not the sense that should have been conveyed in a LOTR game.I realize that a truely dynamic wargame is a lot to ask for, but comeon, LOTRO isn't offering us anything new.  It's World of Warcraft with less content, but in a LOTR setting.I rate it as 3 stars because although you'd probably be happy if you tried it out and you'd probably get a couple good months play out of it, this game is just so much less than it could have been or should have been.  It's very uninspired and if not for the strength of the LOTR license, it probably wouldn't have sold at all.  You'll notice that the people who talk this game up are talking up the LOTR license aspects -- the depictions of Bree and so forth.  Nobody is talking up the day-to-day gameplay or combat mechanics, because those just aren't that good.  It's pretty, but it's not that fun.\"Monster play\", on the other hand, is fairly ingenious.  This is the one place in the game where the War of the Ring comes to life, as groups of players fight against the forces of Mordor (also controlled by players).  The problem, again, is simply lack of content to the Monster Play section.  Monster Play is relegated to a very small section of the world.  It's clearly an afterthought when it probably should have been the entire focus of the game.I would suggest the LOTRO is going to hold lasting appeal to a small section of the audience that simply wants to play a hobbit or elf and hang out in Middle Earth and occasionally kill some stuff.  It's going to fall short of expectations for anyone who was hoping to fight the War of the Ring and really get entrenched in the Battle for Middle Earth, because that battle simply isn't going on in this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2007"}

It is such a MADDENING game, that I would shove it down the throats of those who released it on the market if I ever met them!It's a shame that so many people put so many man-hours into the development of this much-hyped game for it to come up short, primarily because of faulty controls...It's the ONE thing you'd think they'd get RIGHT on an FPS after years of development. Not so. In fact, SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE FIRED at Guerilla Games! I've never screamed so many 4-letter words at an inanimate object before in my life...But now my HDTV has skid marks on it from all of the expletives I've yelled at it during this half-baked game!  First, the GOOD:1) This game has a good intro movie to clue everyone in who missed KZ1 (including me).2) The voice acting is crisp and clear, although it's hard to say who was screaming more profanities per hour: me or the characters. Seriously...I'm an adult and I know this is a \"war\", but the frequency of profanities is so overdone you'll probably just MUTE the sound during cut scenes. On the lighter side, there's a bizarre mix of \"Earthling\" accents spoken by various characters...Including a Helghast informing Radec near the end of the game that \"Security identified a breach at the main gate\" with the thickest British accent you're likely to hear outside of Liverpool. The fact that you're supposed to be in an extrasolar location (Alpha Centauri system) has to elicit a chuckle.3) Visually, it's a stunning game...But I can say that about pretty much every game we've played on our PS3 in the 3 months we've had it. Outstanding graphics are more of the NORM now and don't make a 5-star game all by itself.I really do try to get into a game, but now for some things that make you go, \"Huh?\"1) The setting is \"hundreds of years in the future\", OK? So the bad guy steals \"a nuclear weapon\" and needs the launch codes to explode it...LOL. Are you kidding me?? It's hard enough believing that pistols, machine guns and grenades are still being used as primary weapons on the battlefield this far ahead...But the most sinister future weapon Guerilla can come up with is 20th century nuclear weapons technology? Furthermore, you have a major boss battle in a building that should've been completely leveled after one of these weapons is detonated. Again, LOL...2) The chief military villain has the ability to \"teleport\" himself at will. Apparently, he's the only one with this technology. Did he discover it all by himself or wouldn't the scientists who developed it also be teleporting around? Wouldn't a mutinous underling kill him in his sleep to steal the mysterious cloaking ability and rule the world? And why isn't this man ruling the world now...I mean, he still WORKS FOR SOMEONE ELSE! You'll just shake your head and wonder HOW something like this even found its way into the game.3) You can ONLY carry ONE weapon at a time (sorry, pistol/knife don't count)...WHY? In Half-Life 2, one of the pure enjoyments is being able to instantly select from a plethora of enemy-busting weapons! Realistic? No...But KZ2's weaponry is far from realistic and being confined to just one of them at a time significantly reduces the fun factor. Add to that the extreme frustration you repeatedly feel when you're in the heat of battle and you need (or want) to change weapons. Once you find a new one, which normally isn't a problem, you have to approach the weapon and hold the \"square\" button. Pretty easy, except when you're taking heavy fire or have an enemy rushing you...Hold the button a little too long and you pick up the new weapon, then drop it and pick up the old weapon again. Don't hold the button for long enough and you don't even pick up the new weapon before running for cover. Who came up with THIS moronic design?4) While we're on the subject of weapons, this game has the most AWFUL weaponry of any game I've ever played, even those not on the PS3. The grenade launcher is pretty much useless. How realistic is THAT? Most of the enemy's machine guns are near worthless, unless they're shooting them AT YOU! Shoot any machine gun for more than 1 sec and you're soon shooting over the enemy's head...So you have to constantly stop firing while they never stop firing!?! However, walk around in the EXO scene and you're pretty much in god mode, virtually indestructible. Then in the cruiser scene, you can barely draw a bead on an enemy because for 30 full minutes, the ship is violently shaking every few seconds like it just split in two. It's like different teams developed different scenes and then patched them together in the final hour of development...5) The field of view and turning around speed are ridiculous! For example, fighting the ATAC alone. It's like Sev's field of view is 90 deg (45 deg right, 45 deg left). For much of the time you can't even see the boss shooting at you, and by the time you turn halfway around to target him, you're shot dead. If anyone truly took 3 sec to turn around on a battlefield, they'd be the first casualty.6) Finally, the end boss battle is just a JOKE. Use grenades, SMGs, shotties, sniper rifles, even missle launchers with little immediate effect. Get touched by a knife and you're dead. GEE, what fun! Plus you have a \"helper\" who is basically there for the enemy's target practice, not to help you out. And after you \"win\", your character hardly feels like a hero. Perhaps that's some political commentary on war itself...But it's not the kind of feeling I want after plunking down $60 and putting several hours into gameplay. If I wanted to feel like a loser, I'd watch the nightly news every night instead of playing a video game as a temporary escape from reality! Get it, Guerilla?I'll qualify my review saying it was the \"pre-patch\" version, since a patch was released just 7 DAYS after the game's freakin release date...Supposedly to address, in large part, controller issues. Remember what I said earlier about how someone needs to be fired at Guerilla Games? I realize this may seem weird and inconsistent, but with all of its many shortcomings, I still give KZ2 3 out of 5 stars. There's enough to really get wrapped up in so you can overlook the frustrations that appear in certain phases of the game.But I tell you, there are times that will have you nearly throwing your controller at the screen or your PS3 out the window! For a game developer, that should not be misinterpreted as a success...I'm not holding my breath for Killzone 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2009"}

Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"I spoiled myself.","reviewText":"I ruined the expectations of the 3DS by diving headfirst into one of the greatest titles on the platform. A game that utilizes 3D almost every which-way, leaving other titles sorely lacking. Does that mean those other titles are bad? Heck no; as we all know, the 3DS is arguably the best handheld on the market. But that does make me wish those other titles utilize 3D as superbly as in Super Mario 3D Land.After making some agreements, my wife allowed me to splurge and get the much-coveted 3DS XL Zelda edition. I borrowed some games from the library, and this was one of `em, along with Mario Kart. I interchanged the two since I'm very familiar with Mario games. I never grew up with them, but, once I graduated undergrad and had some time after work, I bought a Wii and caught up on most of the Super Mario library. I'm a big fan of Nintendo now, and look forward to every Super Mario release, this game being no exception.SM3L is sort of a mixture of the smaller worlds in Super Mario Galaxy/ 2, with some Mario 64 thrown in. Each level is more linear in structure, with some a little more open for exploiting secrets. Not too tortuous, though.All in all, this is a game worthy of purchase. I got to the end and thought to myself, \"Boy, that was kind of easy.\" And it sort of is...except it's not over yet. I won't give too much away, but you won't find this game particularly easy once you've reached 100%. It's not on the same plane as the older 2D Marios, or the harder Galaxy levels, but it's darn near close sometimes.The thing I most HATED (ie, loved) is the little galaxy Mario from SMG. If you've played SMG, you'll know who I'm talking about.The 3D is superb, though I turned it down when using the gyroscope. Besides that, I couldn't imagine playing it without it. Only in the more intense levels, where I was constantly threatening to toss the 3DS, is when the 3D effect got to me.A fantastic game that really utilizes the 3D effect well. It's not anything new besides that, except for maybe the resurrection of the tanooki suit, but it's a great portable Mario that's reminiscent of the larger console versions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

We've owned it for a week, and our entire household has had an absolute blast with it. Our kids love it, and it actually provides real challenges for them that get progressively harder with each level. Some of the challenges can be real frustrating to master, and even us parents have had to try a few spots at least a dozen times before beating them. The nice thing is, if things get too frustrating you can take a break, go goof around in the Toy Box area for a while, and have at it again later on with a fresh start.Graphically, Toy Story 3 looks wonderful in 1080p HD. The colors are bright and vivid in pretty much every environment, and the depth is amazing, rivaling some of the best I've seen of any game. The frame rate is smooth with very few if any small glitches, and the visuals themselves are just \"cartoony\" enough to stay true to the childhood endearment of the movie itself.Most of the levels after the first are a bit too tough for our youngest daughter to play, but she gets enjoyment from exploring the different environments and experimenting, and oftentimes gets rewarded with hidden items or a random trophy for her efforts. It's not very often I can say that about a game on the PS3. This is truly an enjoyable experience for everyone, ages 3 - 83 and beyond. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2010"}

The graphics from the get-go are obviously pretty good, but the controls were very awkward for me.  I have never really played a game from this top-down 3D perspective before.  And then there are the famous rings...  All you have to do is two things.  One: as quickly as you can when you get control of your ship is to quickly transfer full power to the engines to acquire maximum speed from the starting point.  At the same time you need to be accelerating and steering the ship towards the first ring.  Two: you can not, I mean can not, miss any of the rings.  You have to stay accelerating the whole time.  If you stop or have to turn around to go through a ring you missed, chances are you will fail the mission and have to restart the rings over again.  In order to successfully accomplish those two points, you have to be used to the control scheme for steering and changing altitude on the fly (watch those little blue lines to see whether you need to raise or lower your altitude in order to pass through each ring successfully).  It only took me a handful of times to figure this out thank goodness.  But shortly after you get past the rings, you start fighting other enemy ships and let me tell you it's a blast!  The game went from kind-of boring and slightly frustrating to immediately fun to play! For the price I paid for this game, it looks well worth it.  I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it and I only recommend it for Star Trek fans.  It is a budget title after all and it shows.  It's not a real dramatic and intense game as far as music and cinematics go.  But the ship-to-ship battles are quite fun.  Keep in mind though that I have only just beaten the first mission in the Enterprise era.  I am only beginning but am looking forward to more missions.  I do agree with one of the reviews on here to take this game is small doses in order to not become overly frustrated.  Put it in, beat a mission, turn it off and change games.  Later on, rinse and repeat.  Also, others are right about ol' Shatner and his lack of enthusiasm when he read his lines.  He should have read his lines like he did in the original series when he played Captain Kirk.  It would have definitely made it more interesting to say the least. =)  Or as one suggested, have all the captains voice their own series.

You're a third person controlling Chris Redfield. The graphics look stellar and the sound is as realistic as it gets.UnlikeResident Evil 4where Leon was simply followed around by The President's Daughter after she joined him, in RE5 Sheva fights along side of Chris. She could use an AI tune-up with her targeting abilities; she hinders you by wasting ammo, but she will usually help you more than she hinders you. In co-op mode--online or offline--Sheva is controlled by your live partner. It's a lot more fun to play co-op with a friend than with the AI. And, depending on your friend's gaming abilities, Sheva will of course play a lot smarter. However, I'd recommend that you play your first playthrough with someone that isn't farther along in the game than you are (to prevent spoilers).Similar to RE4's Ganados, the first enemies that you encounter are crazed locals that seem to be zombified in some way. If you're new to the RE video game franchise, based on the movies (and earliest versions of the games from what I hear) you expect zombies. But what you get is worse; you get madmen that will viciously kill you unless either you do them in first or safely make your way past. Zombies might be a welcome adversary versus this enemy that the developers at Capcom have brilliantly programmed with AI.But don't worry; if you're looking for more than just crazed locals, you get them. Be careful what you wish for, because unless you know what you're doing, the boss-battles are difficult (especially if your playing in the normal game mode which I'd recommend as opposed to the amateur mode). The bosses often take a good plan to take down. Running away was always paramount among my plans! But as the old saying goes, you can run but you can't hide.A map is provided for you to follow to your chapter destinations. Typewriters to save that were common in RE4 are out and autosaves are in. There are some long spats between save points, so be careful with this game; a checkpoint is not necessarily a save point! I quit the game after a checkpoint once, and when I restarted it brought me back to the last SAVE point. I know. Color me stupid.As you make your way to the target destinations, you are introduced to a variety of enemies that will try to stop you at every turn. As you are successful in doing so you are rewarded with the opportunity to explore areas that have a barrage of items that will be (very) useful for you to take. A word to the wise, however...clear any area of enemies (if possible) before exploring!You are provided with only a few weapons at first to defeat the enemies in your way, and you really don't need a lot. Most are found free throughout the game, but all (I think?) are available from the store at the end of each chapter (like the save-typewriters from RE4, The Merchant is out in RE5). There's a plethora of money and items you find along your way that you can trade for weapon upgrades and other \"stuff\". Like I said earlier, use a cleared area to explore and you'll be rewarded. Haste makes waste as I found out by having to buy weapons after running through an area without first searching it for perhaps what might have been there for free.Aside from my small gripe about Sheva's AI wasting ammo my other negatives would be that, like RE4, you can't move & shoot in RE5...which is especially annoying after playing recent action/horror games likeDead SpaceorResistance: Fall Of Man. Figuring out the controls was easier for me than what I'm hearing from some others. Although, it is more of a pain in the neck when you also have to figure out and remember how to tell Sheva to do something or give you something when Sheva is controlled by the AI instead of a live partner. Finally,  apparently Capcom wants you to pay for DownLoadable Content that will enable the game for an online multiplayer mode. I hear it's a small fee, but this is certainly a trend that I hope doesn't take off with game companies!Bottom line: RE5 isn't the best game that I've ever played, but it's great fun.

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Chris Z.

Yes, I actually paid money (downloaded from the PSN) for this version as well.  Why?  Well FFIV is still one of my favorite games of all time.  I love the characters, the story, the game play and the music.  Even though I'm only a few hours into this version, I can tell that they did a great job with it.  The graphics are nice and polished (I like it better than the DS version, actually) and everything feels \"streamlined.\"  Load times are virtually non-existent and the combat flows very nicely.The reason why I'm posting this review so early, is because many people out there have probably played other versions of the game, and might be wondering if it's worth spending money on yet another title.  In short, a long-time fan is very impressed with what he's seen so far, and I think any fan who's willing to give it another play-through will be thoroughly impressed.  It'll be some time before I get into the Interlude and the After Years portion of the game, but I plan on making thorough updates to this post as I move on.  I think this'll stand to be the best version of the title yet!Edit:  8/11/2011As many people know, you are able to switch characters toward the end of the game.  Cid, Palom, Parom, Yang and Edward are all available.  There's a bonus dungeon which has the \"ultimate weapons\" and \"ultimate armor\" for each of the characters listed above.  Monsters in this dungeon are either from or on par with what you'd find in the caves from the underworld.  Boss fights needed for the ultimate weapons pose a bit more of a threat, actually.  You might even recognize some of them from previous Final Fantasy titles!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}

It took me a while to get the PS2, but when I finally got the system one of the first games I bought was Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.  I popped the game in my PS2 and was blown away by the graphics.  While games like Final Fantasy X and Kingdom Hearts may be more visually pleasing with vibrant colors, Metal Gear Solid 2 goes for realism.  The characters, Solid Snake or one of the enemy soldiers, look and move realistically.  There is no difference between the graphics in a cut scene as compared to when you are controlling Snake yourself.  Everything looks beautiful, even if it is in a dark, gloomy atmosphere.  The controls in this game are tight and even better than Metal Gear Solid (PSX).  If the first game had the controls of this one, it might have been the best game ever (as it stands, it is one of the best games I have ever played).As fun as the Metal Gear games are to play, everything is driven by the story (and this is what makes the games so interesting to play, finding out what happens next).  While the story of the first Metal Gear Solid was fairly complex and far reaching, everything was presented in such a plausible way that I didn't really question the possibility what was going on.  I just accepted it as the story.  In this sequel, some things just weren't very plausible, even for the MGS world.  I won't spoil the story, if there is anybody reading this review that has not yet played the game.On other thing is notable about this game.  The game is broken up into two chapters.  The first chapter is called the \"Tanker\" chapter and you play as Solid Snake (the hero of the previous three Metal Gear games).  The second chapter takes up most of the game play and is the \"Shell\" chapter.  In this second chapter, you play as Raiden, a rookie to the Foxhound unit (the unit which Solid Snake was a rookie in the very first Metal Gear for the NES).  Raiden is experience in VR Training, but has never actually been on a mission.  At first, I was very unhappy with this change from using Solid Snake (as a long time player of the series, I have come to associate Snake with Metal Gear) as a playable character to this kid.  As the game went on, it made more sense in the story to be using Raiden.  I would still have preferred to use Solid Snake, but the inclusion of Raiden is not as offensive as it once was.Overall, this was an excellent game.  I have to knock the game down one star because of the convoluted story (and a little bit because of Raiden).  Without question Metal Gear Solid 2 is near the top of the class for the great games of the Playstation 2.  It is a lot of fun, worth playing, and worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2003"}

This game has superb graphics made with the excellent hardware the Playstation2 has. The gameplay is  very good. I like the style of gameplay. The third-person view makes the game more realistic than some other some other first-person shooters on Playstation2 like \"James Bond: Agent Under Fire\" and \"Time Crisis 2\". The game runs at a nice, crisp 60 frames per second (fps). The game is violent in some ways, because you have to kill people with guns. The game has a very good story, with makes it more realistic, and the superb graphics tie it all together. I think that Hideo Kojima meant to make this game into a mini-movie in a way. There is many excellent FMV's (movies) which look very good. Some times in the game, there is too many movies, and to many Codec (communicator) calls. That gets in the way, and starts to get on your nerves. But it's okay. Some times the Codec calls last like 10 minutes, and that is annoying.But even though they have minor problems, there should be no hesitation of picking this title of the shelves or off the online cart. If you don't have a Playstation2, get one, or if you have any Xbox,(which you shouldn't) Konami is being a good sport and is producing Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance for Xbox and Playstation2.

It's true, the controls and combat are (still) clunky, and the first part of the game, before you get to Silent Hill, can be a bit dull and tedious.  However, once I got to the cursed city, any doubts I had about this game being quality or scary washed away.  There isn't as much combat, but there's always that tension.  The puzzles are pretty much par for the course.  The faces and voice acting are definitely above average.  It had been so long since I played any survival horror game (for lack of options!)I'd forgotten how truly unnerving they can get.  Sr. Maria's Orphanage made a believer out of me- again.

Sure, it looks very childish, even my mom and sister made fun of me when i got it. Well, I don't care what they think because this is one hell of a fun game. I don't know where to start. Well, i guess i'll start by saying that there are the 3 ' first ' trilogies. Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith. I just got this game today, and I've beaten the first 'movie'. Well, it wasn't all that easy... there ARE times when you have to use you're head... It kind of reminded me at times of more a puzzle game than an adventure game. Next, there are a ton of unlockables. You buy these unlockables by using ' Studs ' i believe they're called. You can purchase things such as: ( discontinue reading if you do not want to know. ) Purple light sabers, invincibility, large blasters, mustaches, and other things. You can also play as over 30 characters from the original 3 movies, all with different abilities. And if you've played the game or seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. Just about every character you've seen and more you can play as in this game. Darth Maul.. Yoda.. C3-PO.. R2-D2.. Darth Vader. The only thing I don't care for about this game, is that I don't think it will last long. I got it today and I have already beaten a third of the game. I can almost guarantee I will go back into levels i've played for more unlockables, but this game probably won't last too long after that. But there is one thing that may keep me around this game: CO-OP MODE... yeah you can play with a friend at any time on this game.

Given my families love of the 360 I would consider myself biased as I lean hard toward Microsoft. What makes this product worth the purchase? The major difference with this Bundle is the built in wireless connection..You get the 250gb Xbox slim (very cool looking and more quiet than any other model I've owned)I've had the original 40gb model, the elite 120 gb and now this one. At present I have the Elite and this bundle working in seperate rooms.Having bought all of the attachments and additions in the prior models I thought this might show the value you get here as this is easily the best choice BY FAR!!!A huge hard drive on a newer model that runs more quietly... Oh yeah, you get kinect as well. So Kinect 150.00, internal wireless connection 50-90.00,  the 250 gb system (say 300.00 retail) You save over 100 bucks going this direction. Also it's really nice having the Wireless connection permanently housed in the system (no attachment). The kinect requires less wires with this model as well so that is also a nice bonus (the kinect will attach in the back of the system and not in the front). (more ability to add attachments) Also, and not really a major bonus but... You get a free month on Live as well as opportunities to pay at a large discount for more months on live (though you get this with any system) The games are awesome... Kinect is revolutionary and awesome. Online community is wonderful if you discount the 10 year olds that clearly need parental supervision of some kind.Negatives...-have to pay for xbox live monthly (find the cheapest route on this (it's out there))-need another controller for mutliplayer-not enough time to game as we all have lives we have to live..!  That's the only major problem with so many great options out there.For the record I own a PS3, Wii and 2- 360 systems.  Xbox is my choice after years on all of them. I like the games better and primarily use the PS3 as a blue ray player or for exclusive titles. Just my preference but this system is a great way to buy all you need in one box! I also believe that Kinect games are more family friendly and make it a more family oriented experience (given the 360's more adult game selection than that of say the WII...In short..

It is over 20 years old, yet it got me into Nintendo. This was 2009, not 1991. I saw it in a magazine, and I don't know why, but I tried it on a computer and loved it. I had to have the original copy. The bad news was, my parents would not buy me a Nintendo Entertainment System. I guess it  does sounds kind of strange for a 10 year old boy to ask for a console that had been discontinued 2 decades ago. The good news was that my parents had fought to get a Wii back when Wiis were a must-have. I quickly downloaded it and started playing. I played it almost every day (Along with Super Mario 64, the same way I played Mario 3). Then I bought almost every old Mario game and played it on the Wii. Super Mario Bros. 3 was still the best. When I got my own laptop I was very intersted in what was hidden in Mario 3 (beta content Nintendo did not remove). I found over 10 levels that I could not even access without hacking, and spent part of that summer entering codes that allowed me to play those levels. After a while I discovered other franchises like Sonic and Zelda. In those franchises were games that were just as impressive as Mario 3. My parents decided to buy me a Nintendo Entertainment System, so I had even more games to play. I forgot about Mario 3's thrills and fun. Then my uncle came to visit my family in 2012. He saw Mario Bros. 3 on the Wii Menu and asked if he could play it with me. We started a new game and played it all day. Then we played it the next day. That is where the game started to defy time.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover.

I have played all the console assassin creed games and done research on the portable versions. Assassins Creed(1) had a great storyline and a good concept. The missions, however, were incredibly linear and boring. I struggled getting myself to finish the game because it just became boring. But I did finish it. Then Assassins Creed 2 came out, and it was awesome compared to the first one. You could tell that Ubisoft listened and changed things up. Brotherhood was also amazing. I loved to keep following Ezio's story, and it wasn't boring at all.Then came Assassins Creed Revelations. While it had a good storyline, the game was incredibly familiar. It was like Ubisoft got too lazy and failed to add anything of value to the game. They simply added new weapons and a couple more mini type games. For this game, I also struggled to finish it. Not as bad as the first one, but it was definitely too familiar. They didn't add anything of value to the game. The fighting style was very similar, and the whole idea of viewpoints was still the same. It made me sad because Ezio's storyline deserved better.When AC3 was announced, I really hoped that Ubisoft would once again listen and add more cool things like they did between 1 and 2. Of course, that was a flop as well. But that's another story. I'm starting to think maybe Ubisoft should retire the Assassins Creed series for a while and really invest some time on it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

Great characters, a richly detailed world that's full of color, beautiful music, fun adventure gameplay with great variety from the elemental creature abilities, fantastic graphics, etc. Kameo's a beautiful game that deserved much more love.Even all these years later, Kameo still holds up and feels just like when I played it back at the Xbox 360 launch in 2005. Actually, an interesting tidbit, Kameo was the first game that you could buy for the Xbox 360, releasing a full week ahead of the actual console itself, so I was stuck staring at the box and manual for a week until I could actually play it. Luckily, it delivered and didn't disappoint one bit.It may be 2012, but seriously, pop Kameo in your Xbox 360 to remember a time when Microsoft Game Studios actually tried to release new and interesting games that aren't just shooters, and if you have a high-definition television, bask in the rich and colorful world full of vibrant and lush environments waiting to be explored.

As far as games go Starfox Adventures good qualities really stand out. But the bad also stands out in this too.The graphics are awesome! Quite possibly some of the best the Gamecube has.  The fur on Fox looks real and the environments are really decorated.  Best of all, there is nothing that slows the action and gameplay down.The music in this game is a nice treat, though not as good as the N64 version.  The music definitely gives you the feel of exploration but the truth is, it just isn't pleasing to the ear.  The voice acting is outstanding!  The voice acting and the dino language are great! You'll be impressed at the different moods and tones the voice actors can give off.  Sound effects are also some of the best I've ever heard.The gameplay has a very different sort of feel.  Starfox is usually a sort of &quot;Space-shooter&quot; game. Adventures is just that, an adventure. So you'll be on foot.  That's not to say you won't fly. You'll still fly, but there isn't that much of it.  Before each Arwing mission you'll need a certain amount of Fuel Cells which are scattered throughout the overworld.Battling in the game is quite fun.  Fox can pick up a staff and excecute several combos, and he can use elements such as fire and ice with the staff.  The controls take a moment to get used to at first but there's a control pad in the upper right hand corner of the screen to help you out.You also have a pet dinosaur named Tricky who is going to help you save Dinosaur Planet from the trecherous General Scales.  You actually do have to be a parent to your pet.  For example, in order for him to perform some of the task that he does you'll have to make sure you feed him.What brings the gameplay down is the replay value.  Some mini-games and puzzles are real mindbenders.  It's fun to play through the first time but some of the frustration in other mini-games and puzzles isn't worth it.  The puzzle don't present THAT big of a challenge.  They're usually pretty easy to figure out, but there are too many puzzles.  Nearly every room you step in has a puzzle and it takes away from the whole fun of the game and while you'll enjoy some puzzles you'll abhor others.So while you don't fly around much, the game isn't really bad.  It deserves a four for it's effort.  The game is fun but somewhere along the line it losses it's replay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2003"}

This review will be solely about the single player portion.The graphics, graphic effects, environments, models, skins, sounds, all of it are done with amazing quality.  The game is often just stunning to look at.  The shooter-play is somewhat like Gears of War, but not quite as refined or smooth.  I will admit that the cover system has a few quirks, but the check point system is forgiving.  The gun variety is immense, the battlefields feel very three dimensional, and there is just a hint of tactical shooter -- but nothing overwhelming for those who aren't into that.  The variety in shooting galleries, combat scenarios, and high stress situations is enough to keep most of the game play fresh without being too wishy-washy.The real gem of this game, the real strength, the real depth is in the story.  The progression of the characters, and the story are incredible.  There are many points through out the game where you will -- wittingly and unwittingly -- make choices that affect the rest of the game.  Things are not always what they seem, and you never really know where the line between good and evil lays at any one time.  The game play is good, but the story being told is fantastic.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Graham Swearingen \"Graham1138\"","summary":"The best sequel ever made","reviewText":"I am currently replaying this game as my sense of nostalgia peaks for it during this time of year. It originally came out in October of 2009 and after three years this game amazingly still is one of the best looking video games ever made, and still one of the most fun. I thought after the release of Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception just last Autumn, that this game wouldn't look as good. To my surprise, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is still very beautiful, rich in textures, vibrant with colors and realistic in graphics. Having played through this game three times previously, I thought I might find it boring, but I don't.This game plays out like a Hollywood blockbuster, only way better. Seeing as how we get to play this as opposed to watching it, it makes the experience that much more rich and memorable. The platforming mechanics are intuitive and an improvement over Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. The shooting is less sluggish and more accurate than its predecessor as well. The story has just the right amount of realism and magic to make it larger than life without seeming stupid or predictable. Nolan North as Nathan Drake and Claudia Black as Chloe Frazer get a lot of screen time together and their chemistry sings to the same tune as the likes of James Bond and his best Bond girls or Indiana Jones and his conquests of love. These two are entertaining to watch and make it  easier to come to terms with watching way more cut scenes than the first Uncharted and do an even better job of being entertaining with it's cut scenes. The cut scenes also aren't the only format for the great writers of this game to move the story along, a lot of the story plays out in actual game play which is executed brilliantly.This game is more than a game, it's an experience that begs to be played time and time again like the best movies of modern day cinema. This is easily one of the, if not, the best game I have ever played. It does everything it's supposed to and does it flawlessly. There are no frame rate issues, no pop up, controls are fluid, nothing too repetitive is forced on the player, it's got a great multiplayer on line feature and does everything that Uncharted: Drakes Fortune did, but better. This is a perfect game. If you don't have this game already, you need to get it. This game, I give the highest recommendation for.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

Thinking back to the first time I saw the first Splinter Cell on the original Xbox, the game has come a long way from those good ol days. I still remember the Metal Gear vs Splinter Cell wars and how Splinter Cell and Sam Fisher basically one-upped Solid Snake and Metal Gear (albeit it was more powerful hardware on Xbox vs PS2). It was an awesome game that took walking in shadows and stealth to the next level. Many other Splinter Cell games have come out and added some new cool features (co-op) and added some new story. Now, here we are with the newest Tom Clancy Splinter Cell game..... And I LOVE IT! First off, make sure to install the Texure Pack HD on Disk 2. It will make the game POP more with better fidelity. The gameplay and story so far (I am half-way through so this is not a final game review, I will update) has been phenomenal. I think they changed to a new voice actor for Sam's voice though, so that stinks and takes a half point away. Also, the controls are somewhat goofy at times, so that is another half point. I also dig the customization feature where you can upgrade your gear to cooler stuff. Overall, a great Sam Fisher experience that everyone will enjoy. I would wait for a $39 price to really take advantage of this game though. GET IT!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

A couple years ago  Call of Duty Finest Hour was released for current systems and it wasn't very good. In 2005 the follow up to Finest Hour was released, Big Red One. This game sports somewhat impressive graphics and manages to assemble a solid atmosphere. But the game really is nothing more than that. It is a fps and the gameplay is pretty standard and the nazis are generally none too intelligent. The game is still pretty solid fun that has it's moments but never really exceeds expectations as a standard WW2 fps shooter. Call of duty 3 is being released on current gen systems and so far it looks like some good improvements are being made but I would question how much effort is going to be put into the PS2 and X-box versian.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Danny Yu","summary":"Wii still love this console!","reviewText":"The Wii came out, with a refreshing new design and innovative idea: incorporating motion into gaming. Still, after 5+ years, the Wii  still stands as a friendly-to-all type of a console. Family, friends, everyone can enjoy playing Wii games together. In the past, and still presently, the emphasis was on the individual gamer and the online experience. The Wii has many games that bond family and friends together, as well as provide an online experience.What you should know:- Many games on the Wii (at least produced after the Wii's release), are motion based. However, be wary that some games are not fully motion based. Generally, the motion detection is good, with some awkward hiccups here and there.- You can play older Gamecube games on the Wii. I love this feature! I've found myself browsing in my local Gamestop for games I've already wanted to try, but didn't get a chance to. You can also connect the gamecube controller to the Wii, as well as use the Wii's new gamepad or other companies' Wii-compatiable gamepads.- The graphics are bad. I can't put it any differently. I can tell you that it's okay that the graphics are nowhere near modern day technology/standard, but it's not. It's one of the only flaws of this machine. You'd think that by 2006, Nintendo would know how to incorporate better graphics and fun gaming experience together. However, I'd give Nintendo a break because they spent A LOT of money on research for bringing motion gaming to the general public.- The internet browsing, picture viewer, among other Wii menu apps, are very nice. I enjoy watching videos on the Wii browser.My experience:- I love playing games on the Wii that are of multiplayer nature. Everyone has such a blast. The bad graphics actually make the experience enjoyable, funny, hilarious, light-hearted, ironically. There are games that are Nintendo exclusive likeSuper Smash Bros. BrawlandNew Super Mario Bros. Wii. Mario Kart is also a blast. It's unlike any other gaming experience. These games are instant classics, although it's only been just a few years.- Get your butts off the couch! Gone are just sitting down and exercising your eyes, thumbs, and fingers. You can now get up and do simple but addictive sport games likeWii Sports, exercise withWii Fit Plus - Software Onlyand even dance withZumba Fitness. XBOX and PS3 just started catching on, but the Wii remains the most ahead of the curve right now.- I like the interface of the menu, the little intricacies like the sounds, loading icon, etc. etc. Everything feels so happy, delightful, and soft. It's hard to put in words, but the Wii feels friendly to interact with.Bottom Line:- The Wii is the first to introduce the motion style of gaming, and still is the best at doing so. With updates of theWii Remote Plus - Blackand the addition of theWii Fit with Balance Boardshows that the Wii is willing to make updates to continue to improve the gaming experience.- There are much more of a variety of games since the introduction of the Wii. You'll see shooting games, Movie-themed games, sports games, children's games, etc. etc.- 2-4 Multiplayer at its best. Whichever games you decide to play with your friends and loves ones, you'll be sure to have an enjoyable time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

If you're a redneck, then you're pretty much screwed.All joking aside, the mini-games are still fairly fun. In Solo Mode, you are pitted against one opponent, so you don't have to wait three turns when you're friends aren't around.

{"product_name":"B00F6YD2AK","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Death Won't Do Us Apart","reviewText":"Ahhh... finally. Checked the date of my order: Dec 9, 2012 but the wait is over. And, after three days of playing Dark Souls 2, the verdict is in: DS2 is, in fact HARDER than the original Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. And it appears to be more fun too. But, again, harder doesn't not mean 'impossible' or 'unplayable'. It only means that planning, preparation and some practice involving a lot of dying is going to be part of your gaming experience. I will add some notes at the bottom of this review for anyone thinking to try DS2 but afraid of its impossible difficulty and for anyone who started to play the game and then abandoned it in frustration.GAME SO FARTo say that I'm impressed it would be an understatement. This third Souls title was not dumbed down or simplified in any significant way it seems. My first few hours were as good an experience as my first few hours of the first Dark Souls. Play is challenging and interesting in ways that got us to love Demon's Souls and Dark Souls in the first place. It's so... Dark Souls to experience the relief and joy of finally mastering the moves and tactics to beat your first significant enemy only...  to see yourself confronted by THREE of them around the next corner. In a few words, I love it.Getting a little into details and still under first impressions, the game plays in many ways like its predecessors. Most controls will get your toon to do what you'd expect it but there are changes, some subtle, some more obvious. So, here's what I've noticed so far:- Improved graphics: it's the first thing I noticed. Everything looks sharper, the color palette is a lot richer and... a couple NPCs actually move their lips while talking but that's only on cut scenes- No frame rate issues yet but let's see how this holds true throughout the rest of the game- New menus: everything appears to be better organized. But it's different from what we were used to so it will take a while- New items, some quite interesting. One of the starting gifts would allow you to raise the difficulty level of a specific bone fire area with the corresponding increase in rewards.- Non-boss enemies stop respawning after a while so you can't farm the same ones forever- Fast travel from the beginning: can teleport to any bonfire once it's discovered or this was the case with the couple I've got to so far.- More lore revealed explicitly but not a lot more at the very start of the game.- Loose central hub concept: not quite the Demon's Souls Nexus but,so far, there's only one place to level up so it's a hub- Hybrid healing: there is one Estus in the beginning but there are other healing items that heal in different ways. I expect to find some healing miracles as well at some point.- Classes: wanderer, hunter, pyromancer and thief are gone. DS2 classes are warrior, knight, swordsman (dual wielding), bandit, cleric, sorcerer, explorer, and deprived- Attributes: resistance is gone and won't be missed. Current attribute are adaptability, vigor, endurance, vitality, attunement, strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith- Max health: decreases as you keep dying and is fully restored as you regain humanity. One of the gifts is a ring that will increase your max health points when worn, not unlike the Demon's Souls Cling ring- Humanity: you no longer need to be at a fire to regain your humanity, not unlike old Demon's Souls.I can't say much about invasions, covenants and co-op play yet because I didn't go through these yet but I will update my review once I do. I suppose everyone is busy with early progress in the game so there's not much time for messing up with other people's games yet but I'm sure this is going to change soon, probably within hours. I also have no comments on the bonus pack because I decided that I will not take advantage of it because I am after the full game experience, as hard as it may turn out to be.IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DARK SOULSFirst of all, don't worry about it. You do NOT need any Dark Souls experience in order to play Dark Souls 2 so... enjoy. However, if you get a hold of the old Dark Souls, give it a try because it's worth it. Try Demon's Souls too. It's a PS3 exclusive and can be had almost literally for pennies these days.Also, do not believe anyone who claims that the Souls games are impossibly hard. They are not. I mean, they are difficult but not 'impossibly' so. Yes, they are different and to me they are unlike any other games but what that means is that patience, persistence and the willingness to learn from past mistakes will take you through the game because the game will make you get better every day while, true, quickly punishing you for your mistake or for getting too self-confident.The Souls games are some of the most innovative releases in a long, long time. I don't remember being so wow'ed ever since playing Ultima II as a kid, back in the 80's (yes, I'm THAT old). My first time playing Demon's Souls after a long gaming hiatus triggered one 'aha' moment that hasn't left me as I completed it, then played it again then moved to Dark Souls when it was released and it's still there as I just started DS2 and I was still playing the old Dark Souls last night. There's so much to say about the Souls games but let me just mention some of the more innovative aspects:- You are never alone, unless you play offline. You can see shadows or outlines of random other players as they progress through their world- The 'blood stains' of players who died can hint at how they died as you can watch their last few seconds and  that can hint at how to deal with dangers ahead- You have the ability to leave messages to no one in particular that will pop up in other players worlds and it's up to you whether they are going to be helpful or misleading or just cries of frustration- Other players can come into your world uninvited and try to kill you- You can summon other willing players to help defend against invaders or beat a boss- Things that happen to you or things that you do in your world have consequences in other players' worlds and vice-versa- You can join any of several covenants which grants you some benefits and may strengthen bonds with fellow covenant members- Most lore is to be discovered through various hints during gameplay - you talk to NPCs, read weapons and armor descriptions- 'Beating' the game is only the beginning or your journey. As soon are you 'finished' the NG+ (new game plus) starts which sets you back at the the beginning but with the benefits of acquired skills and capabilities and weapons and with much tougher enemies to confront. And then there's NG++ and so forth.Add to the above a most excellent combat system that from what I see has gotten even better in DS2, the freedom to grow your character almost any way you choose, regardless of your initial class, the most impressive and detailed art displayed on landscapes, architecture, armor, weapons. And that's not all. It's not only other players coming into your game world or you visiting or invading theirs. It's also the game invading our day to day reality through the several Wiki sites and us, real world players taking organized expeditions to fight in organized tournaments or join in some predetermined role playing scenario. The possibilities are limitless and it explains why I've been playing these games for so many years already.Enjoy. And don't let the inevitable setbacks discourage you.THE BLACK ARMOR WEAPONS PACK AND THE SOUNDTRACK DISCSo far, I resisted using it because every single item in the pack should be found somewhere in the game and I'd rather find them myself. It's Okay to have this as an option but it's probably better to use it only if everything else fails, just my thoughts. I am still concerned about the pack's effect on invasions. Hopefully the early players who didn't order the Black Armor Edition or opted not to use the pack won't be at an impossible to overcome disadvantage when attacked by those equipped with the bonus items. Somehow, I thing it's going to be alright.I will add my thoughts on the soundtrack disc once I get a chance to listen to it, and it may take a while because we've been busy playing the game now :)RATINGI'm not going to go pro-reviewer style and assign scores to graphics, replay value and what not. Playing Dark Souls 2 is pure joy to me thus far and that translates into \"I love it\" which means '5 stars' and that's that._______________________________________________NOTES ON PLAYING DS2Yes, there is no 'easy mode' in DS2 but there are ways to survive even if your reflexes are not lightning fast. You will need some time and patience. So, here's what may help flattening the learning curve a little.- Your initial class matters... initially. True, you can turn into whatever you want eventually, regardless of your starting class and there is one item that helps you rearrange your stats but if you started as a Warrior or Knight and can't make any progress, try a class that can do range attacks. Sorcerer is probably the best and you can develop your required sword-wielding stats as you level up and find some decent weapons too.- Level up a little. The cost of leveling up is not that great in the beginning so if you identify some area where you can successfully deal with the enemies, clear it several times and use the souls gained to level up your favorite attribute such is INT if you go with Sorcerer.- Bookmark the Wikis. There are several very good Wiki sites dedicated to the Souls games. They will eventually map the entire game, strategies, shortcuts and all. At this time you can learn a lot by lurking at the forums and don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people there are happy to help if they can.- Get yourself the officialDark Souls II Collector's Edition Strategy Guide. It's been written by some of the better Dark Souls Youtube contributors and it's very detailed.- Search Youtube for Dark Souls II videos that show you how to develop your character, where to go and what to do. EpicNameBro, ManufacturedOpinion, Lobos Jr, A German Spy are some of my favorite stars there and they all love Dark Souls.You will find that, once you go past a sometime painful and frustrating beginning the games opens up and, while still frustrating and painful you will also begin to experience joy and pride in your accomplishments.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization.

But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

I love Lightning so much; she is my favorite FF character of all time. That being said, FF13 is not the best Final Fantasy series out there, but it is the game that gave me Lightning and Hope, so it's definitely in my top 5 Final Fantasies.Lightning Returns is super fun and the battle system is amazingly fast paced and engaging. I thought it would irritate me that the only way to level is by helping people but after I thought about it, it actually makes a lot of sense. I mean, COME ON! She's the friggin Savior, her entire GOAL is to help people and save their souls.I really respect that the director went a non-traditional route with this game and it shows in almost every aspect. LR is so unlike other Final Fantasy games that it stands out uniquely on it's own. For reference, I played all three games in the series and I'm really happy with this one! I didn't like 13-2 at all, so everything that LR does is an improvement for me! Also, the game has a level of difficulty that I've only truly seen in FF Tactics. If you have no patience or a bad temper, I would recommend playing on Easy. Otherwise, you'll be using LOTS of curse words, haha.Also, the social aspect was kind of bizarre in the demo, but I'm actually enjoying it immensely.

There is more selection for items, characters, and places to live. There are also new or better events, and the addition of aspiration points, life goals, and fears. But, overall, this game has the same gameplay and goals as in the Sims. I got bored of Sims 2 within days. So, if you have never played a Sims game or only played a little and liked it, or if you're a die-hard Sims fan, this is a good game to buy. But if you've played the Sims before and got bored of playing it, and you're looking forward to something new in simulation, don't get this, especially at a price of $49.99. You will probably get bored with this pretty quickly, too. In mine, there was also a minor glitch where my toilet froze up and it couldn't be used, cleaned, moved, or sold. It was just taking up space.About the game:In the game, you pick a family of one or more characters, and you can choose how they look (Including clothes, age range, makeup, hair, and other aspects) and what their personality is like. Then you choose a plot of land and either choose a pre-made house or build one yourself, by choosing wallpaper, flooring, windows, build a porch, etc. Then you choose items, such as furniture and sources of entertainment. Or you can choose a family with house, furniture, and characters all made for you. Either way, each member has goals and fears. Some characters may be looking for romance, and want to make out with or marry another character. Then they have their fears, of being refused a dance by someone or having cockroaches in their house, for example. You have to act accordingly to make them happy or upset, whichever you like. If you choose to make them happy, you get aspiration points to buy special items that include a money tree or a vaccuum to suck up talent from another Sim. The aspiration points are a new feature, and it is very cool and gives you more to work for. Anyway, you get the Sim a job (more are available in the newspaper and on the computer than in the Sims) and they make money to buy items which increase various meters. To get promoted, they need to be in a good mood and have the required number of friends and amount of experience in areas like fitness and charisma. There are several fields, for example the Slacker field (where you start off as golf caddy). You can date, marry, and cheat on you partner. You can also have kids by \"Woohoo\"ing in bed, the fitting stalls in public, or in the hot tub. This is a very fun game, and it's up to you if it's worth the money. I, however, returned the game and got another instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2004"}

Oh and annoying bosses *cough* Deadpool.","reviewText":"For those who have seen the movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine, this game follows that same story with things slightly altered more to give the game more reason for action. This game is a linear progression adventure hack'n'slash sort of game. All in all it's a short fun game, but it's pretty much just button mashing.The Story:- Like I said it follows the story from the movie X-Men: Origins, but it provides more details into what made Logan leave Styker's team in Africa. It also switches between that story and Wolverine get adamantium in his body, along with him going after Stryker after the Africa Ordeal.Pros:- The gameplay is decently fun, I've played a lot of Marvel games and even though in the end it's glorified button mashing, it still has some creativity in it (dismembering people in cool ways that is.)- The game shows a more in depth look at the war of humans vs mutants- The dialogue and characters use the same actors from the movie- Very macho manly game done well.- The cutscenes look amazing, the game uses Unreal Engine so the game looks pretty much like any other game that uses that engine.- I like the Health regeneration and health system. You have a red bar which is your health and then there is a red circle with a heart in it. If the red bar goes down then it will start to drain your red circle, the red bar regenerates faster, but your red circle is quite slow. It's different but it's unique.- The feral senses are a lot like &#34;Detective Vision&#34; in Arkham Asylum, as they highlight everything of importance.Cons:- The boss battles have my biggest pet peeve of all. When you &#34;kill&#34; them once you think you've won, but no, you have to fight them again. I'd much rather prefer a giant health bar rather than to think I've killed them just to fight them again. This happens with every boss.- There isn't much variation in combos from the start to the end. You have the same combos throughout the entire game and you don't get anymore. So like I said before, it gets repetitive.- The bosses don't require anything special or change in strategy to beat them, honestly it's a very easy game.- Short game, only 5 Chapters.- I don't understand why you can't play the Hard difficulty without beating the game first, as Hard only makes your attacks do less damage, it doesn't make the AI any better. Forcing you to do 2 playthroughs at least.Other:- I got 805G on one playthrough, I did get all 1000 which isn't hard it's collecting things and grinding away at enemies to raise reflexes and skills.- Very gory game, Mortal Kombat fatality gory.- There is no Multiplayer mode, strictly just Single Player.You should buy this if:- It's under $15- You enjoy the X-Men series- Don't mind looking around every nook in every level (There's alot of collectibles)You shouldn't buy this if:- You want a fast-paced game that you can race through. You pretty much have to kill every enemy to progress.- For the achievements, even though it's an easy 700ish, you really have to grind for the rest of it which takes about twice as long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A step down from Brotherhood","reviewText":"Standing on its own merits, AC Revelations is a very good game. Held in the light of the franchise as a whole, however, it is a noticably less-polished experience than AC II and AC: Brotherhood, the two previous entries in the series.Many of the additions made to Revelations are for the detriment of the series. While I appreciate the concept of the Templars trying to retake lost territory, the \"den defense\" minigame used here was a decent idea but horrendously executed, with its biggest sin being a clunky camera that makes it incredibly frustrating to survey your surroundings.The map has been reworked to provide 3D texture, and this is a classic example of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" The new texture makes it incredibly hard to pick out many stores and landmarks, which are a translucent grey until you purchase them. The tailor shops in particular are nigh-impossible to spot.The game also has an annoying habit of taking things you paid for away from you. Take, for example, parachutes. A full load of 15 will set you back a sizeable chunk of change, equivalent to the payout you get from a story mission. Entering some areas will cause you to lose your parachutes, and they are not returned to you when you leave. You can hire a faction, but if you enter into a conversation with anyone other than a store clerk they disappear.Speaking of factions, their missions - and the entertaining side stories that accompanied them - are gone. And the Subject 16 puzzles are gone (for obvious reasons that I won't divulge here so as not to spoil anything) but in their place are 1st-person-perspective Desmond platforming sections that are dull, simple and graphically subpar (I was often reminded of the original Half-Life at best, and the ancient Dark Forces at worst).The story is weaker than prior entries, and lacks a strong villain you can really latch onto. And as complex as Ottoman history was at this time, it's only glossed over here. I felt like I was learning something when I was scooting around Italy; here in Istanbul I just feel like I'm moving from point A to point B.Revelations does make some good changes, though. The hookblade is an on-the-surface simple addition that opens up a world of gameplay changes - improved climbing and platforming, ziplines, and new melee moves. The addition of bombcrafting allows for some personalization of Ezio's arsenal and some new gameplay options, though only a few of the bomb effects are decent enough for general use. The recruiting and training of new Assassins has been fleshed out greatly in this game, although some relatively minor new annoyances - like glitchy and/or inexplicably disappearing recruitment missions or unexplained precipitous drops in one city's influence when othe cities suffer only minor drops - sour the experience.Don't get me wrong, AC Revelations is a good game. It's just not as good as what came before it. If you've played and enjoyed Brotherhood, you'll enjoy this, but find yourself wishing it was more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0047TLIBU","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Dragon Age: The Kirkwall Chronicles....","reviewText":"Bioware's 'Dragon Age: Origins' was one of my favorite games of 2009. It had a good story to tell with memorable characters and was overall a fun throwaway to the RPG days of Baldur's Gate and KOTOR. 'Dragon Age: Origins' also had bland graphics and sluggish combat controls that made it appealing only to a specific crowd. Now 'Dragon Age 2' is out and while it doesn't quite rank up there with their best titles (and borrows heavily from their other game 'Mass Effect'), it's a much more accessible experience and a solid addition to Bioware's RPG lineup!The story of 'Dragon Age 2' unfolds like a good novel: Varric, a dwarf is being interrogated by the Chantry in order to discover the location of Hawke, the \"Champion of Kirkwall\". You then choose Hawke's character class and (after a brief tutorial) character appearance, then play through the events that led up to the Chantry seeking Hawke and the reasons why. This \"framed-narrative\" structure (think 'Rashomon' or 'The Social Network') gives the plot a unique feel that is echoed throughout the game with strong characters and morally ambiguous situations. Unfortunately the overall story, involving tensions between the Mages and Templars of Kirkwall really isn't that compelling with only a few subplots that stick out (the conflicts with the Qunari and the confrontation with a certain serial-killer were the most memorable). The writing and dialogue is still very strong but we never get the sense of closure we got in 'Dragon Age Origins' or a villain as memorable as Logain (though I think Varric may be my favorite Bioware hero to date!).The visuals in 'Dragon Age 2' are a huge improvement over 'Dragon Age: Origins' as far as it's design and detail. Everything has an angular, gothic-look like it was taken from a Michael Moorcock novel and the feeling of this damaged world is reflected in characters' appearances as well as buildings and structures. The fighting animations and spells are very flashy during combat and much more varied than DA:O. I would've liked to see more variety in locations (and weather effects) as the entire game takes place in or around Kirkwall. The constant reusing of dungeons in side-quests gets really annoying after a while and is very lazy for a modern game.The sound in 'Dragon Age 2' is easily Bioware's best accomplishment! All of the characters are voice-acted to perfection (with Hawke's voice adapting to your dialogue choices as the game goes) but it's the music that really impresses. Each area of Kirkwall seems to have it's own theme (day and night) and really brings out the more downbeat tone of the game.The gameplay has changed a bit from 'Dragon Age: Origins' but not to the extent you might think. Hawke can only be a human (I miss playing an elf) and his/her background only changes somewhat depending on your character class. You use a dialogue wheel in conversations which decides Hawke's personality and can lead to some extra actions and relationships (which are MUCH easier to navigate) depending on your party members. You still collect loot off enemies and micromanage your party's weapons and items, though you can only change Hawke's armor. The combat controls are MUCH more involved and satisfying than DA:O(especially on the PS3 controller) as you have to keep pushing buttons to move around and attack. Other than that you can still pause during combat and setup tactics for your party.The one BIG difference from 'Dragon Age: Origins' to 'Dragon Age 2' is the fighting-classes: each character-class is COMPLETELY unique. Fighters are powerhouses that can engage more than one enemy at a time. Rogue's are freaking ninjas that zip around taking down enemies with arrows and daggers. Mages are effective in close-combat but can still be used to heal party members and unleash some awesome spells. The one draw-back is that each class can only use it's own specific weapons (rogue's can't use swords, fighters can't use two weapons or bows) and the skill tree encourages you to stay with one weapon set. Some skills DO change the way you fight and some of your fighting animations but for the most part you'll be using the same tactics over and over again.As a sequel 'Dragon Age 2' is a letdown with it's lack of customization, repetitive/reused environments and underwhelming story.

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"bluehobbes_7","summary":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed Review","reviewText":"The Force: Unleashed is a decent action game that will be especially enjoyable for Star Wars fans.The game takes place in the time between the events of the Episode III and IV movies. The main (player-controlled) character is Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice, and the game follows Starkiller as he does his master's bidding, with some interesting developments along the way, ultimately telling the story of the birth of the Rebel Alliance.The best elements of the game are the story and the awesome art design and set pieces. There are many views in the game that are simply breathtaking, as should be expected from a game set in the Star Wars universe. The story is well written, and fits very nicely into the Star Wars canon. I just wish the gameplay had been able to support the story better.Indeed, the gameplay is what holds the game back from greatness. This is a sloppily implemented action game as far as mechanics go. The targeting and camera systems each contribute to many frustrating moments, especially in sequences that are suppossed to feature the two. And it is totally awesome using your force powers and lightsaber to hack through hordes of stormtroopers...until it starts to get old. The thrill definitely wanes once you complete a level or two. Most of the boss battles are very easy and uninspired. There's never a really difficult challenge in the game (except for those sequences that are maddening due to the issues with the camera or targeting system). Towards the end of the game, I felt like I was simply going through the motions of hacking and slashing, with only the story motivating me to finish it out. And since I've finished the game, I have felt no urge to touch it again; there isn't really a compelling reason to come back to it.A decent game, it is. If you are a Star Wars fan, it's definitely worth a playthrough. But I probably won't be playing it again anytime soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"Caraculiambro","summary":"all eye-candy and climbing","reviewText":"Of all the video games I've played, I hated this one the most.I don't quite know how to describe how lame this game is. It's certainly the worst video game I've ever played, though the makers appear to have had quite a budget. But alas! there is no fun to be had at any point in this game, and finishing it became a tedious chore. I spent most of my time yelling at the screen.1. \"Very easy\" mode isn't. You're still expected to single-handedly defeat dozens of armed opponents without really knowing what you're doing or how things work. Your partners are useless and will never take care of things for you.2. The game provides no instructions whatsoever. There's a manual, but what I mean is that every time you enter a new area, it's like a new mini-game with rules of its own that you have to figure out -- while you're getting shot at. For example, suddenly you'll have an opponent behind a riot shield, which you've never come across before. How are you supposed to defeat him? Bullets? Punching him? A grenade? The game leaves you to figure this out, meaning that your guy will be killed and you'll have to backtrack several times before you do.3. The game constantly makes you go back and replay every scene over and over again until you can do it perfectly without getting killed. Did the gamemakers imagine this constituted fun?4. There is apparently no way to check your guy's health -- or improve it. You're left guessing how much health you have.5. The game presents a world but doesn't really let you explore it in any logical way. This is the adventure you're going to have, and you're going to get through it precisely like this. You are going down this alley, and no other ideas will be entertained. You're supposed to clamber up a street sign, for example, but are not permitted to climb up the side of a garden-variety troop transport?6. The game asks you to solve puzzles, but the solutions to them are illogical. For example, you need to make your way to a certain temple, and the streets are blocked. Uh, howabout climbing just over that barrel and continuing on our way? That's my suggestion. No, no. Here's the solution: clamber up a street sign, shimmy on over to a neighboring building on a clothesline, leap blindly to a neighboring building, climb the crumbling face of the next building, etc. It was so ridiculous. After playing the game for a while you could pretty much ferret out what to do whenever your character became stuck: look for the most preposterously inefficient means of conveyance: there's the way forward.7. The game provides no instructions on weaponry. If you're about to ditch your gun for a lesser one, the game will give you no warning or advice. Does the game seriously expect me to know whether it's better to have a FAL or an AK-47? How would I know? I guess to kids these days, such knowledge must be second-nature, but they should at least have included some advice in the manual. Nope.8. The story behind the game is way too complicated to follow. Your guidebook, certainly, is incomprehensible.9. The game's battle sequences are preposterous. A few thugs in Nepal, okay. But you're telling me the bad guys shipped in dozens and dozens of commandos into Nepal just to kill you? How did they get visas for all of them? How did they get the arms into the country? How are they getting supplies under the circumstances? Don't they realize the hundreds of thousands of dollars this must have cost is not going to be offset by selling Marco Polo's treasure (if they ever do get it), and they'll be left with a net debt?10. The game forces you to accept as \"co-adventurers\" NPCs that you'd immediately kill, if given your druthers. This was frustrating. Who's playing this game? Him or me? I say to shoot her and continue on alone!11.  You can't save wherever you want:  you must save where the game wants you to.  If you do save and later die, it will resuscitate you several monsters back.12.  The final fight between you and the Russian is confusing and unfair.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

The story is a bit involved, so I won't even try to explain it.  The graphics are amazing, though a bit dark.  The gameplay is very well done, and the story is pretty linear so you're never really wondering what to do or where to go next.  The control system works well with the game.  The puzzles are a bit challenging, but not too hard either.  Overall, this game is very well done.  Also, there is a preview of Blood Omen 2, which looks very promising.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2001"}

This game plays almost EXACTly like the first Soul Reaver, so the controls should be really firmilar.  Everything looks great, and the sound and voice-over acting is top-notch.If there was a criticism to be placed anywhere, I thought the game was really on the shorter side.

Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Brian Reaves","summary":"The monster finally treated right in a game!","reviewText":"This game has excellent graphics. The multiplayer option is nice. Just about any Godzilla movie monster you can think of is in here somewhere waiting to be played. The sounds are exactly from the movies. There are a ton of things right about this game, and only a few things wrong.The controls are a little slow. As with most Wii games, you have a little learning curve about how to shake the controller for grab, twist for throw, etc. This doesn't take a long time, but you can miss a few really needed kills in the process. Also, it seems like every single foe you fight can move faster than you. While this does make the game more challenging, it's a little bit frustrating to begin with. And it will take you a long time to be able to purchase any of the really good characters (like Jet Jaguar). And finally, not every mission is spelled out clearly enough for you to know its objective. Yes, when a giant monster is stomping about you can tell what to kill, but there are a few spots in a timed mission where you'll lose precious seconds trying to find your goals.Despite the few quirks of the game, I really enjoyed it. It's definitely more fun to play this in multiplayer mode (you don't have to fight each other the whole time...you can team up against other monsters), and it gets better as you unlock more monsters. And you can destroy EVERYTHING in your zone! Imagine crushing London, or Sydney, or Tokyo (all with recognizable landmarks). Definitely the best Godzilla game to come out in a long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2008"}

There is some thing about this one and Animal crossing that makes me turn on my 3DS every day, rain or snow or sun shine. I just want to make some progress, catch one more before going to bed.  It is a very pretty game, the over world, characters, animation is top notch. If there is one thing I could ask, then it will be 3D implementation. They are trying to make sure the game is playable with both 2DS and 3DS, but on 3DS you dont gain much by playing in full 3D.  All said and done, this is beyond addiction. Leveling up all the pokemons and transforming them and catching every thing else is so much more fun. Must buy for all 3DS owners, if you dont have a 3DS, buy one for this game alone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2014"}
