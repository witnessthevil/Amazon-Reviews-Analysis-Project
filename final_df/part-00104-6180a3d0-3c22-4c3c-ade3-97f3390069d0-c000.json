I just finished this one and it was utterly impressive. Aside from the great graphics and music, the controls are wonderful. As with most Wii games, it takes some getting used to, but after a while I think you would agree that the fluid nature with which the Wiimote allows you to gracefully guide your character where he needs to go, using his sword, bombs, bow and arrows, shield etc, is all a superior way to control a character. The maps are detailed and visually stunning, providing puzzle-like elements to an otherwise RPG-ish action game. The game is also very long, which is nice if you're like me and working all the time. This means that when you unwind to sit back and play it during your time off, you have many hours to look forward to in order to destress later.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Cartman \"Cartman\"","summary":"my favorite console","reviewText":"this is my system of all time.

More than just a cutting-edge game system, Xbox 360 also integrates high-definition video, DVD movie playback, digital music, photos, and online connectivity into one sleek, small tower, and in the process puts true Next-Gen power right at your fingertips.Xbox 360, shown with wireless controller, is a sleek, customizable gaming and entertainment systemUnder the HoodXbox 360 is much smaller than its predecessor--it measures approximately 3.3 by 12.2 by 10.2 inches and weighs 7.7 lbs. It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor loaded with 10 MB of embedded DRAM, 48-way parallel floating-point dynamically scheduled shader pipelines and Unified shader architecture. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for great looking games in standard TV definition, and even better thanks to built-in support for HDTV 1080i televisions. It also supports the widescreen 16:9 format.The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays both the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For game-save and media storage, users can choose between the detachable and upgradeable 20GB hard drive, or a separately sold 64MB flash Memory Unit. Along with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 backward-compatible with part of the existing Xbox game library.Control your GameplayXbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and Start buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox Guide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user interface. From there, they can check for friends online, access personal digital content like photos and songs, and more. The black and white buttons of the first Xbox controllers have been replaced with new shoulder buttons placed above the left and right triggers. Xbox 360 can accommodate up to four wireless controllers and has three USB 2.0 slots to use for wired controllers or for streaming your digital media from digital cameras, MP3 players, and any Windows XP-based PC.

{"product_name":"B0053BCML6","description":"","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"Animal Crossing is back!","reviewText":"The only other Animal Crossing game I enjoyed, was Animal Crossing for the GameCube. After that game, Animal Crossing just kind of fell off my radar. I read about the other titles, but none of them sounded like anything I would enjoy. Animal Crossing: New Leaf, however, is a game I've been looking forward to since the 3DS first came out!After hardly being able to put the game down for days now, I think I'm finally ready to review (my 3DS is actually in need of a charge anyway :P).In short, you are the Mayor of the town in AC: New Leaf. With that title, comes the same old responsibilities had in old AC games (making deliveries, pulling weeds, filling up the town museum, etc.), plus some new ones. Once you break in your mayoral shoes, you can enact ordinances and start construction projects. Ordinances can change town attitudes. For instance, as a night owl, I enacted a night-life ordinance so my stores stay open later. I also built a bridge over a part of the river in my town so I didn't have to keep running all the way around. Oops. Did you maybe find a better spot for that bridge you just built? No problem. Just demolish it and build it again in its new spot.Those things are just the tip of the iceberg of what's new in AC: New Leaf. Now, let me talk about what I really love about the game.The connectivity!My girlfriend also owns a 3DS, so she picked up her own copy of AC: New Leaf. Not only can we visit each others towns locally, but we can also play mini-games together (accessible after a certain point in AC: New Leaf), visit each others stores, send mail/gifts, donate to each others construction projects -- and you can even bring an NPC resident of your town to visit a friend's town! Plus, what's even more fun, is you can open your ticket gate to online friends, and then put your 3DS to sleep in its charging cradle while your friends come and go without any fear of your 3DS running out of battery life. In fact, I leave my ticket gate open when I go to work. I never know what kind of gifts, bulletin board messages, mail, I'm going to come home to. It's exciting and fun.Another cool feature is the ability to snap photos by holding L and R. These photos can then be shared on facebook/twitter/tumblr via 3DS Image Share. I won't post a link, but just Google \"3DS image share\" to find out how you can share your photos right from your 3DS. Don't worry, it's a Nintendo made tool, so you have nothing to worry about. Just look it up :)The game is a blast and accomplishes it all without sex, violence, language, drugs, and competitive natures. Don't get me wrong, I like M rated games just as much as the next adult gamer, but it's nice to play a game that has such charm and is absolutely addicting without any of the staples present in most modern day entertainment.A must-have if you own a Nintendo 3DS.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"J.

I like Star Wars games so I figured if I fail to like this game then I would know for certain that I will never like RPGs.At first it took some getting used to unlearning what I have learned from playing Jedi Outcast. The first two hours were spent figuring out the gameplay and wondering whether any of this could really be any fun. Frankly it wasn't fun because I was too engrossed with figuring out the gameplay.BUT! once I figured it out, I couldn't stop playing the game!!!! It is so incredibly addictive. I keep telling myself, &quot;I'm just going to walk down this one corridor and I'm going to quit and make dinner.&quot; -- Dinner finally got made, 4 hours later!Pros:Graphics is spectacular. Worthy of the Xbox's capabilities. The images you see on the web site is what you get in the game.There is great facial animation when your character is engaged in a dialog. They switch camera views throughout a dialog sequence. These are all typical camera techniques from TV and movies but rearly get put into RPG dialogs.When you run thru a field, the plants part and then slowly fall back into place. Not necessary but a beautiful addition.Voice talent is superb. Even when the aliens speak in alien tongue you can tell from their intonation when they are speaking positively or negatively.Very easy to learn interface, even for a non RPGer. Tutorial weaves perfectly into the game.Which brings me to the 3rd major pro- the game has a very engaging storyline and quests that seem to fold well into the overall storyline. Some quests are not required but do seem to make sense in the overall storyline. I will probably play this game from the beginning again so I can try fulfilling those quests that I missed.Gameplay is essentially turn-based but it means it frees you up to manage each of your characters during combat. This is important if you are to win against a strong opponent. The interface will let you chain a sequence of actions by using the X button. This is not in the intro tutorial but is in the manual.Cons:Seriously addictive. I have logged 9 hours and I only just got my lightsaber.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2003"}

In this particular game you're mainly the \"Rookie\", but you unravel a story where you get to play as the whole squad.  It's an interesting way to tell a story, though I'm not entirely sure how supremely enjoyable it was.  Basically your squad got separated when they dropped into New Mombassa to execute a mission.  The Squad is reminiscent of the show Firefly, and I'm sure you'll recognize one of the characters, Buck, because not only does he look like Malcolm Reynolds, he is voiced by the actor who played him, Nathan Fillion.  ODST also features other cast members of Firefly like Adam Baldwin and Alan Tudyk.  Bungie also tried to make the characters in game look like the voice actors in real life; I thought that was pretty cool.Anyway, as the Rookie, you play in a night sequence, which would normally be pretty difficult, but the ODST have a special night vision feature that is invaluable to the player.  I thought this was a really neat new feature; the only bad part is that you don't really get to enjoy the full rendering of the world and anytime a flare goes up its blinding.  Luckily the way the story plays out you do get to see things in the daylight, but I felt the night vision sequences were way overused.The way this story works is, as the Rookie wandering around the city at night trying to find your squad you come upon \"beacons\", which are just items left behind by the others.  When you find these things you automatically get transported to play as \"them\" in their story.  Their story takes place in the daylight so you get to see New Mombassa as you'd want to, rather than as just night vision.  It's a different way to engage the Halo stories, but I think it was only partially effective.  Mainly I didn't pick up that it was some sort of \"mystery\" to be solved until I got towards the end.  I was just going with the flow of the game at first.  I think if I go through the game a second time knowing it's a mystery it might actually be a little better for me.The ODST setup is basically the same as your Spartan setup.  You can jump as high as the Spartans and you have similar resistance to damage.  While your health does generally recharge, there are health packs you can get that will immediately recharge you.  I imagine settings like \"Legendary\" will be especially difficult with these kinds of requirements.  Unfortunately I feel like the HUD is a bit cluttered, which is kind of distracting and worse in split screen co-op.  ODST also has a map feature where you can bring up a map of the location and set marker points if you want.  This was a neat feature to have, though I did not use it very much.All in all it was a decent game.  It didn't totally blow me away, but I certainly didn't hate it either.  The co-op was a lot of fun to play, which is the primary reason I buy these games.  I wouldn't say it's worth the full 60 dollars, but it's worth getting after the price has come down a little.  It's a relatively short game if you play on easy, but the developer's bank on people playing through on the harder settings, which naturally increases game time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2010"}

This game's graphics aren't necessarily bad (in fact, this game came out on PS2) but they don't compare to the quality that the console can handle.  So, what is going on this time?  Claire gets locked up in Rockfort Island for trying to infiltrate the Umbrella Paris Facility.  Unfortunately, she doesn't find her brother there.In a shocking twist, the island gets attacked and the T-Virus is once again released to wreck havoc upon poor Claire.Okay, the main problem I had with this game is the sound.  Especially the voice actors (excluding Claire) who sound like they have no idea how to act.  For example, the Alfred character sounds like a total retard.  Sure he may be a little messed up, but he's also intelligent (with gadgets and locks, you should see the puzzles in this game).Another thing, they have changed nothing where the other games had something new (eg RE2 had Scenarios, RE3 had Nemesis and so on).  This game had me disappointed when I completed it.So the big question here is, 'is it worth buying?'  To that I would answer Yes to the fans of the series and to those who want to get into to it, but No to those who are tired of this mechinac and want something new.  No monsters will chase you into other rooms (like RE3) and there is nothing new put a first person shooter like mode that has little use and has to be unlocked.People who bought Code Veronica for Dreamcast might want to try this one out for the extra scenes involving a character loved and hated by many.Pros:- Has additional scenes that involve an old rival- The storyline is some what good, but a little hard to follow at times- There's an option in the battle mode to be in First Person mode.Cons:- This is just a port of RE:CVX on PS2- The graphics could have been so much more better- The controls in FP mode are very annoying- The VO's can drive you crazy (excluding Claire's)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Not all that impressed","reviewText":"Greetings Amazonites!The Saboteur had a very interesting premise: be a character aiming to cause havoc to the Nazis in WW2 France.  It held some promise of something very different from the slew of WW2 shooters out there.  Ultimately, I didn't find the game impressive at all.  It seemed bland, uninspired, and not all that different from other 3rd person shooters like GTA, Red Faction, and so on.  In short, it seemed to be waiting to impress but never quite got there.Note for parents: this game does have some nudity and very, very alluring female bodies.  The retail version came packaged with a free code to download something that made the cabaret women completely nude (no bras, nada).  There's also plenty of language in nearly every piece of dialogue.  If you're concerned about this type of stuff, then please be aware the game is not suitable for kids.ENVIRONMENTS (3 stars): Visually, the game delivered well.  Areas that are under Nazi control are black and white, with certain elements in color (Nazi flags and lights, for example).  It's a very cool effect.  Areas that are free from Nazi control become fully colorized.  It's a great visual cue, but I didn't think it added anything extra to the game.  I enjoyed the black and white with splashes of color more than the color.  All the buildings, characters, and vehicles are all top notch; one of the better visual games for the 360.Since I've seen a lot of WW2 era stuff in games, movies, and photos, I wasn't amazed by the scenery in Saboteur.  There's nothing to separate it from the pack.  Everything looked good, but there wasn't anything unique.  A lot of the elements could have been lifted from other games, and the enemies were all generic.  Nothing special.The sound and music were good.  Some parts, like the cabaret, created a great audio environment.  Other parts were lackluster.  The quality of all the audio was top-notch, but it didn't really create any WOW moments.GAMEPLAY (1 star): the controls were poorly organized.  I spent too much time trying to remember the different combination of controls required for brawling, shooting, driving, talking, opening boxes, and so forth.  There seemed to be a different button scheme required for each scenario.  You may not have any trouble with this part, so take it with a grain of salt.  I appreciate games that keep the control complexity to a minimum.  This game did not do that with any appreciable effect.Some 3rd person games are easy to navigate and orienteer--this game was not.  The camera was okay, but it seemed to move in awkward angles sometimes--like when you're climbing a building or fighting.  The focus was not where it should have been for the action.  For me, the camera really took away from the gameplay.Driving was pretty good.  Some vehicles were pretty fun to operate.  I can't say it was great, but it was better than walking everywhere!  The map did a good job of showing you the route to take, but the streets were sometimes hard to navigate.DESIGN (2 stars): the story held out a lot of promise, but it failed to materialize.  The idea was to start harassin the Nazis in France by blowing stuff up, stealing stuff, taking out targets, and so on.  The missions were all predictable and often repetitive.  If you played any games like this, then you get the idea: go blow this up, go get this thing, go kill this guy, go and meet this person, etc, etc.  There was a backstory with the main character losing a brother to the Nazis, but the boring mission setup made that revelation less impactful.I didn't feel any connection to the characters.  The voice acting was great, but the characters' motivation seemed stale and uninspiring.  I'm not sure why they were doing what they're doing, when they're doing it.  This might not matter to you, but in a game wrapped in a story like this, I expected to understand why it was happening.  The opening sequence shows a conversation in a cabaret and then you're told to meet the guy in an alley nearby; there's no where else to go and nothing else to do but go meet him.  I found that pointless and irritating.  Why not just show all of these things in a cinematic?  There's no player choice early on the game--none at all.There is a skill system in the game.  After completing missions, finding stuff, and beating enemies the main character can gain or upgrade various skills.  Some include brawling, weapons, etc; there are pre-requisites for certain skills, so you can't really customize until later on.  The early choices seemed very restrictive, as well.Nutshell: I'm not sure what Saboteur was trying to be, or how it was trying to get there.  The opening sequence seemed more about the naked woman singing than the character's motivation; there was no choice in the beginning and early parts of the game.  The controls were clunky and confusing at times.  The game looked good, but it never felt like a believable, engrossing game.  It wasn't something I WANTED to play.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

Is this a good thing? Yes sir. I never played the original Dungeon Siege but decided to try out the second installment because if they made a sequel it must be good right? *cough* I'm glad I did.I was never a fan of Diablo II. I still have it installed on my hard drive and tried at least three seperate times to get into it which I never could. Just too much point and clicking with no purpose for my tastes.Dungeon Siege II is most comparable to Diablo II, but in my mind has elements from a few other games as well like Baldur's Gate and Final Fantasy. The story is linear...true. It won't be a total open-ended expierience like Morrowind but it is definately fun. That is the key note for any game really - how much fun it is. I've found myself playing on and on where in Diablo II I would have stopped a long time ago. The character development is really nicely done. It's simple but complex enough to hold your interest in terms of how you want your little guy or girl to flesh out.The storyline and quests were great and what I gather from other reviewers is greatly improved over the original game. If you haven't tried this out yet, I'd say give it a chance. It will give you enough gameplay time to warrant the money you will spend on this game.The only downside for me personally was the \"camera\" angles. I found myself trying to get a good view of what was going on, constantly shifting the camera around. If something was behind me, the camera rotates too slow for my tastes. I also caught myself a number of times moving my head around like I was actually going to get a better view by looking at my monitor from the upward,right,left or downward position. hehe.Summary of Pros and Cons:Pros- Immersive Graphics- Good storyline- Quests are fun- Sound and voice characterization- No bugs I have encounteredCons- Camera controls can get wacky","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2005"}

This is DEFINITELY a take your time and sneak type game (obviously).  Hiding and taking out enemies is a blast, especially when a head-shot is lined up perfectly.  When that happens, a gruesome, yet satisfying cutscene reveals in slo-mo the bullet ripping through their skull.  I never got tired of that animation!  The funny thing is that whenever it happens, there is the option to skip it by pressing a button.  WHY??!!  That is the best part of the game.This is also a pretty accesible title, as there are only a few instances, where wind plays a role in your bullet moving.

{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Rayman is the King of Color! A blissful experience for all gamers","reviewText":"\"Rayman Origins\" is quite possibly the most fun I've ever had playing a video game! I play all the mainstream games (Call of Duty, Resident Evil, Gears, MGS, etc.), but this game just might best them all.What I love about it is the pure whimsy. This game is light hearted, beautifully animated, amusing, and COLORFUL. Games have been bleak and dark for so long now, this is a refreshing return to a time when games were more innocent in nature. More importantly, this is the first time for this console generation (PS3) that a platformer has taken full advantage of the system's hardware. The still pictures of this game do not do it justice in any way; you must see it in motion to become a true believer. My favorite worlds are the jungle, mountain, and underwater (which is particularly impressive). It's also worth noting that the music and \"voices\" (hilarious, nonsensical babbling) in this game are perfect... the music instills a sense of whimsy, wonder, and fun that matches the graphics and gameplay perfectly.My only (minor) grip is about the ice levels... I know they were a staple of platformers 20 years ago, but Ubisoft, if you're listening, nobody likes having the control of their character compromised by slippery surfaces! In a game with such otherwise perfect control and gameplay, Rayman deserves better.But that's a small price to pay, for the splendor that is Rayman Origins. I love this game, and I can't recommend it strongly enough - especially since it's down to only $29 on Amazon now (it's worth the full retail of $60, in my opinion). I also can't stress enough how refreshing it is to play a game that isn't violent! I had almost forgotten how much fun these platformers are, in this age of shooters, fighters, and war games. \"Rayman Origins\" is an experience no gamer should miss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

This game is no exception , from start to finish the game had me so enthralled in the story I just didn't want to stop playing..If you are one of those people that think this game is just a game of quick time events ( QTE ) you would be completely wrong.. You have to initiate the QTE .. The fighting machanics of this game can be easily compaired to the batman games , they are fast and fluid.. You will need to rely heavily on your blocking/shield , without it you will die very quickly. Once you get the block , stagger , and attack combonations down its pretty much smooth sailing from there on out.. Im not saying it's completely easy from there but everything is alot more managable after you get everything down. YOU WILL STILL DIE THROUGH OUT THE GAME !! You will run into hords of ememies that at some points seem overwhelming , but after you die a few times you will see the things you are doing wrong and correct it.The graphics are nothing but amazing in this game and simply something that could not be accomplished with the previous generation ( Xbox 360 , PS3 ) . Everything is just so detailed and beautiful to look at. I have found that after clearing an area of enemies I like to stop and just look around and appreciate the surroundings I am playing in..In my opinion this game is nearly flawless and deserves nothing less than a 5 out of 5.. Don't listen to the paid professional reviews , if you want a real honest and truthful review , just read the user reviews.. There have been so many times I have seen profesional reviews really trounce on a game and give it poor reviews but doesnt reflect the actual user reviews that are much higher.

I played it a ton with my friends and family. As I purchased and played various other games, this game was basically shelved for long time. I recently got this out to play again on the Wii (using GameCube controllers of course). It is still a blast to play and I even enjoy it more than the Wii sports golf.Gameplay: 1-4 players. There are 7 courses to choose from and 16 characters. Each course gets more challenging. A lot of items in the Mario universe are added to the courses such as warp pipes, chain chomps, thwomps, lava pits, etc. You can play traditional stroke play, match play, doubles, coin attack, ring attack and Tournament Mode where you can win trophies against the computer. During the round, your shots are affected by wind, weather, and surface conditions. If you land in the fairway, you have a bigger sweet spot but if you land in the rough, sand, or other surfaces, your sweet spot is greatly reduced making it easier to duff the shot. Hitting the ball is easy as selecting a club, starting the swing, pressing a button at the top of your swing and then at the bottom where the sweet spot zone is. The closer you get it to perfect, the better the shot will be. Hit left or right of the sweet spot and your shot could hook or slice. Once you achieve all the trophies, you can go into a mode that allows you to change the weather and wind speed.Putting: The greens are setup like grids with varying colors to determine slope. Your putter will be selected based on how far your putt is. If you are 100 ft away you need to use the putter that can go that far, but it is easier to hit the ball to far or not far enough. The shorter putts are easier to control distance.Conclusion: The graphics and sound are typical Mario fashion. The later courses can be quite challenging and the controls are easy to use. This game will appease to older kids and adults alike and from the average gamer to the more advanced. It is still worth picking up today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2012"}

It was never the most graphically powerful console on the market and yet it managed to offer the most fun to its users. Two factors contributed to this: brilliant games and the introduction of innovative controls. For years the rest of the market straggled to imitate the Wiimote. With mixed results.There are certain games however for which the combination of the Wiimote with the Nunchuk requires some training. It feels like a second nature after a while and you do not give it a second thought. If like me, however, you are over 35, you will welcome the feeling of a good old classic controller in your hands.Games such asMonado (aka Xenoblade Chronicles),The Conduit I&IIandRune Factory: Frontier, they all open up as a different experience when played with a classic controller.The controller plugs into the Wiimote and not the console so it is portable - but clearly not wireless which would had been preferable even if it meant a higher price. Nevertheless, this is a very ergonomically designed controller and it manages to combine the classic Nintendo feel with more modern expectations. It has the classic 4-directions cross on the left, the four action buttons on the right (A, B, X & Z) and the two octa-directional sticks (which are at the right distance not to hinder one another). Moreover, each side has two shoulder buttons (L, Zl, R & Zr) as well as the familiar from the Wiimote, Home, Select (-) and Start (+) buttons. Everything is within easy reach and works without a glitch.The controller feels just right. Heavy enough to register but not too heavy to be tiresome.

But not as good as it could have been.","reviewText":"\"What do you mean?\"That's likely the first thought crossing your mind, so you clicked into my review.  Don't worry, reader...I will explain in clear terms.  But first, some history, so you know I'm not full of it.Final Fantasy IV is actually the sixth Final Fantasy game, but the fourth to be released as part of the official series.  If you didn't know, the Final Fantasy games (with the exception of X and X-2) have little to do with each other and are not true sequels.  Think of them as separate books under a brand; each one tells a different story, even if they might use slight pieces concurrently (such as spells).  There were Final Fantasy games released on GameBoy, as well as \"Mystic Quest\" which didn't really count, but since it held the name, I list it here.Back in the days of Super Nintendo, Squaresoft released this game as \"Final Fantasy II\".  There were two separate versions, referred to as \"Easy Type\" and \"Hard Type\".  The SNES version was allegedly the \"Easy Type\", though I can't fathom why that was...*cough*EvilWall*cough*...Final Fantasy IV was then re-released on the Final Fantasy Chronicles game set along with Chrono Trigger, replete with new CGI cutscenes to further the gameplay.  This version was allegedly the \"Hard Type\".  As if that weren't enough, Square Enix (as they were now called) released Final Fantasy IV on the Game Boy Advance - again, allegedly the \"Hard Type\".  And now here we are.But wait - this isn't the same as either previous version.  This is a remake, not a port.  The game has been converted to full 3D.  Some of the spell and summon names have been changed.  And Square Enix has added some features to the game to make it just enough \"new\" as to make it interesting.  So I'll go down the list of good and bad, and then elaborate.*** THE GOOD ***- The difficulty is now more in line with some of its latter forefathers, especially with the Active Time Battle system.  Bosses such as the Mist Dragon (the first \"boss\" you'll encounter) are actually challenging if you don't know what you're doing.  New gamers might actually get whooped repeatedly.  Veteran gamers who understood the patterns will find challenge, but not nearly as much as new gamers.  Oh, and by the way...Dr. Lugae?  He's no longer a pushover.  That's all I got to say about that.- Certain characters who where difficult to use because they just weren't useful were given additional skills to help them contribute in battle.  One character's ability was so blatantly useless as to be laughable, yet he was one of the final characters in the game.  This has been changed to where his skills contribute almost as well as Rydia's spells.- \"Augments\" add a whole different dimension to the game.  With these, you can effectively take the natural skills of other characters and apply them to anyone you want.  SO for example, you could have Cecil set up with Counter, Kain set up with Draw Attacks, and have Cecil cover, which effectively makes Cecil a tank while Kain is free to dish damage.  That's just one example of the various combinations you can employ to go through the game.- Item limit is removed - no more relying on the Fat Chocobo to store excess Elixirs.- Summons, now referred to as Eidolons, have been powered up substantially.  In the older ports there came a time when your summon could barely do the damage of Fire 1, so by the time you got Fire 3, there was no point in using Ifrit.  (There is a negative to this though, more later)- The graphical detail of the game is top notch for the DS, especially in certain caves and dungeons.  It's clear they put some work into making the game as visually appealing as they could.- The audio has been remixed, and even improved in some areas.  FFIV's music had always been quite good, but the remixes are even better (negative here, more on that later).*** THE BAD ***Yes, there are some not-so-good things to this, I'm sorry to say.- Eidolons.  Remember how I just got done praising them for what they bring to the table now?  Well, there's a new problem.  With the exception of the Four Fiends there's really no point to using them over spells except to watch the scene.  This has more to do with how slowly it takes Rydia to call them than anything else.- Some tracks were remixed with added instruments that totally kill the spirit of the original song/atmosphere it was used in.  Troia comes to mind.- The \"sudden death\" set of notes was removed.  This is what plays the moment someone dies as part of the story, usually at a point when Cecil is yelling their name out.  I have no idea why they removed this.- Cecil's \"Darkness\" ability was nerfed.  On the SNES version, he didn't have this ability.  On the PS1 and GBA versions he did.  It sent out a wave of dark energy to hit all enemies and caused you damage when you used it, but it was quite useful.  Here, it just makes his attacks stronger and takes energy when you attack, but you can only hit one enemy.- The ability to equip weapons has been altered.  Characters who could easily equip certain weapons no longer can or the way they equip said weapons has been changed.  For example, Cecil could always equip a bow and arrow as an alternative to a longsword, which was particularly useful in one specific cavern, but now he can only equip daggers and swords, making him effectively useless when you get to that part except to Cover.  Plus, depending on how you equipped Rosa's bow/arrow combination, her power went up a bit.  This has been removed as well.- Because everything is in 3D it makes navigating caverns and towers extremely difficult.  I'm sure this was intentional, but because you can't change the camera, you can't easily tell which way you're going.  Some might actually like this as it forces you to learn the paths all over again, but I don't care for it.  The camera is almost directly in front of you, you don't get a \"top down\" view and can't tell which path leads to a dead end and which does not.  I don't mind the camera angle, as long as I can move it at will.  This also causes a minor annoyance at one castle where someone is eavesdropping on the throne room: in the older version you can clearly see the perpetrator as they jump up momentarily.  This adds suspense that is missing on this version.- A brief cutscene plays before almost every special ability.  It detracts from the fluidity of combat to have to watch Kane for two seconds before he executes the Jump command.  I really wish you could disable this.- The placement of \"Switch Rows\" has nearly cost me battles.  It should be on the left rather than right under \"Defend\".  Because I'm used to fast paced battle, I'm used to pressing right to defend and left to switch rows.  No idea why they would change this.So...do I recommend this game?  Absolutely.  My negatives are personal nitpicks based on my extensive knowledge of this game, for the most part.  I would say if you're a vet like I am who remembers the game from SNES, just don't expect the exact same experience.  Square Enix has tried hard to freshen the game in quite a bit of areas.  A lot is the same, but a lot has changed, including the names of things.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Sylo \"Sylo\"","summary":"The first true next gen racer","reviewText":"The Burnout series was never truly known for its innovative game design. First and foremost it was all about hectic, fast, arcade racing. As the series has progressed from its humble beginnings its focus on spectacular crashes had made it the racer of choice for those of us who love big loud explosions along with our racing cars. When this feature had reached its peak in Burnout Revenge the developers decided it was time to take Burnout to the next level.Its hard to believe that this is the first racer to take place in a fully realized city. One of the major foibles of the originals was a seemingly endless menu system of events that would give anyone a headache after awhile. Menu's within Menu's until you were lost and couldn't find your way back to the start menu. Of course that's an exaggeration but it certainly became annoying and the devs decided it was time to NEVER take the gamer out of the car. Everything from race events to crash events occurs at every stop light in Paradise city. You'll never have to leave the game to change your car or play an event.With over 120 events at many stop lights you don't have to drive far to find something to do. The only hiccup of course is that when you want one particular kind of event you have to drive all the way back to that particular stop light on that particular street name. You can edit the menus to show you only one kind of event so theyhave made this as tolerable as possible. The only other problem with this open city structure is that it doesn't allow you to replay a race you've just lost. Instead you have to drive all the way back to the stop light which really doesn't help when you cant remember what street it was on.It's easy to nit pick when someone is the first to innovate a genre so I'd prefer to thank the devs for taking a chance on something new. The online system is also seamless, you just click the in-game menu, and turn it on and wallah you are online with other players from around the world. Its really that simple. For every small problem the game truly does give a fresh take on a genre that is running out of ideas. Burnout Paradise is truly THE next gen arcade racer to own. So grab that new PS3 rumble controller and set your sights for paradise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Xavier 7","summary":"Its biggest sin is that it came after Uncharted 2.","reviewText":"The Uncharted series is undoubtedly one of the most welcome new IPs that the seventh generation of video games brought with it.  Each title has been exhilarating, fresh, and exciting.  They're just flat-out fun games.Uncharted 3 has come on the heels of Uncharted 2 (obviously) and while it is a solid title, it's just that - really good.  This is somewhat expected but somewhat disappointing.  Expected in that it's just hard to follow up the crescendo that is Uncharted 2.  Uncharted 2 had beautiful locales, great \"set-pieces, (for lack of a better term, because I hate this one....) and a decent sized campaign (about 10+ hours).  Disappointing in that its biggest sin is being the follow up to Uncharted 2.Uncharted 3 has about an 8 hour campaign, decent locales, and somewhat predictable, and seemingly very scripted, set pieces.  (I swear if I saw another ladder break as soon as Drake touched I was going to start laughing.)  Admittedly, the plane sequence, which seems ripped straight from the James Bond movie \"The Living Daylights\", was awesome.  However, the cruise liner flood sequence was a step too far out of reality for me.Gripes aside from the set pieces, Uncharted 3 is your standard fare in Uncharted gameplay.  Platforming elements are unchanged - you either jump where you are supposed to go to advance the plot or die - and gun fights still come frequently.  Gun mechanics were revised though; aiming was quite \"floaty\" and imprecise when the game debuted.  An update to the game fixed this issue but now it's too stiff especially when compared to back-to-back sessions with the rest of the series.  (I played them all in order prior to this review.)Graphics are on par with Uncharted 2 and its hard to fathom how Naughty Dog could have squeezed more power out of the PS3 for this game.  Uncharted 2 allegedly used 95% of the Cell processor's power.I think the music is the strongest in this entry of the series though.  It has an Arab flair that accompanies the desert and Middle Eastern settings quite appropriately.  Other orchestral tracks fit the typical Uncharted vibe of high adventure and swashbuckling.All in all, it is a great addition to the series and a nice send off for the series on the PlayStation 3 platform.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}

Nintendo's 3DS had similar problems at launch, but they quickly realized what was happening and quickly improved the 3DS. Now the 3DS is feeling like a unique blend of a mobile and gaming system. I noticed an ANDROID APP in the 3DS EShop and fainted. The retail games feel original and awesome. And what does the Vita have? The libary is terrible. Sony is just taking Playstation 3 hits and porting them to Vita. Uncharted? Little Big Planet? Assassin's Creed? Sony is not even trying. Nintendo is doing more then just porting Wii games. Kid Icarus Uprising put the 3DS to full power and brought back a franchise that has not been around for 20 years. Another flaw is the requirement of a memory card. SINCE WHEN HAVE WE USED MEMORY CARDS? After the Gamecube/Playstation 2 generation memory cards were replaced with internal storage. Internal memory is being replaced with the new \"Cloud\" storage. So why did Sony decide to go back to memory cards? The 3DS uses an SD Card to store downloadable games, but that is not bad at all. SD Cards are universal, and I probably have 5 of them lying around somewhere in my house. Plus, Nintendo packages SD Cards with every 3DS system. Sony charges 20 to 100 dollars for their \"special\" card, which is just ridiculous. And the worst part about the Vita is the little game cards. I absoultely hate game cards. They are impossible to keep up with. And every Playstation product has always used a new type of disc. Playstation 2 used DVDs, Playstation 3 used Bluray, Playstation Portable used mini-disc that hold more then a Gamecube disc. So why isn't Vita using disc? It is just not very Sony. The next Sony product I am going to save up for is a PSP, which has a decent libary and runs on a pretty awesome media. Vita could be interesting because of it's controls and graphics, but it maybe too far ahead of its time. The Sega Gamegear was just like this, having superior graphics to the Gameboy. However, the Gamegear died because of its poor libary, battery usage, and price. And what about Game.com, that overlooked system made by Tiger Electronics in (I believe) 1997? It had a touch screen just like Vita, but the libary killed it. If Sony does not get some serious original games, price drops, and hardware improvements this is going to go down with Atari Jagaur.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

I loved the idea of the game dvr which has gotten better. I have an external hd capture device but i thought this would be really convenient. The twitch streaming also seemed awesome as well even though i'm not much of a twitch streamer. I am however fascinated by the tech. Also the big seller was the vita streaming over the net! The new built in video editor works really well! Why two stars? Well i guess i was over confident about the games. So far there are some good games but most of these games can be had elsewhere. 360, ps3, pc. Very few games are actually exclusive. The only exclusive i'm looking forward to right now is drive club. Killzone sucked, I wouldn't pay $60. for infamous although i will get the dlc seeing as it's standalone, knack is meh. The PS Vita is miles better then the PS4. I had some fun with Blacklight retribution but i can get that on my pc. In fact as of this review i'm setting it up. I also have an Nvidia shield to stream it to which not only can stream all my pc games and emulators but does hdmi out to the tv. So far the hardware has had no issues. The console stays cool after long periods of gaming but mostly the system doesn't get many long periods of gaming. It collects dust and i'm gonna give it till the end of my ps+ membership before i sell it and the vita unless something major happens. Do not buy this or the Xbox one! If you really have to have next gen go with the Wii U but really last gen is much better or pc. I know the PS4 is new but the future releases also look meh. I'm not just basing this on the lack of games that are to be expected now. The PS4 looks to be continuing on with the legacy of generic fps games and any other generic genre that does not stand out from anything that came out last gen. The games are just slightly nicer looking now and can be recorded in 720p by the console as well as live streamed..","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}

Mostly Killzone Shadow Fall  and some FIFA 14. Setting it up was simple, took less than 10 minutes to hook it to the TV , downloaded a 350MB update and installed it, that took few minutes. Installing the games, in my case FIFA and Killzone took 5-10 minutes for each one. The User-Interface will take some getting used to but it is good. I love how you can access the UI without quitting the game you are playing. The Dual Shock 4 is probably the best controller I have ever used, it's way better than DS3.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Why I Ultimately Chose The PS4","reviewText":"Upon purchasing both consoles after launch, I decided I only wanted one, especially for now. But wanted to do an in depth test of both.The Xbox One while clever with it's voice activated technology, via the kinect was just getting old. And I felt myself wanting to just pick up the controller and use it. Also it felt very dated, or 2002 as I like to say, very large in design, and just an over all unrefined feel. The PS4 on the other hand seems more polished and smooth, both in it's design, interface and overall performance. That's not to say that Xbox One game perform poorly, but I can honestly say the 50% GPU boost does improve not only graphics, but the overall \"feel\" of the gameplay. Certain games on the Xbox One seems to \"struggle\" a bit even on the simplest of games. When it comes to downloads they are about the same. For instance on the PS4 I got the online gamecode for Knack since it's much cheaper, saw it was a 35gb file and downloaded it in less then two hours. It really takes advantage of my 50mb connection with boosts up to 70mb. Which also make online gaming quite a treat, along with any extensive updates.So here is the basic rundown of both systems and why I chose PS4, which was pretty obvious to me after the initial purchases about 2 weeks apart.PS4 ProsMust more refined, design, interface etc.Sharper graphics, even the home screen is much much clearer50% more power is just that, and makes a difference in gaming performance overall, not just graphicsThe small speaker feature on the controller is actually cool.Doesn't use a lot of gimmicks to get it's point across100$ cheaper, better exclusives in the future. And remember nothing beats Sony Exclusives, never have never will.Smaller, quiet, runs hot, but nothing alarming.Much faster response on the home screen, no lag, boots up much faster.Cons-Not manyThe PSN (store) seems to disappear from time to time and just give a blue screen. Nothing major, just hibernate, bring it back up, and it stays. Just a strange glitch.The controller is good, but I will admit i think the Xbox controller (even on 360) has a bigger, more controlled feel.Mixed feelings about the new Playstation Now, since I'll never get rid of my PS3, for all my multimedia. And backlog of games. Also I won't need to play old games much.No MP3 streaming or playback from a USB Flashdrive device (yet).Xbox One ProsThe Kinect when it works, but this feature is a gimmick and got/will get old with time.The controllerA few games (more) from launch and recently that are not on PS4. Nothing spectacular though.Xbox Cons-Hence why I didn't go with it.Big, bulky, the power brick, looks like a 1977 beta player. May help keep it cooler, that's about it.Games feel bogged down, even the simple ones. Some games have framerate drops, and shouldn't.Interface it ok, but feels very convoluted, messy, and needs a lot of fine tuning.Poor sales, reviews, no promotion, and overall hate for the system doesn't really make you want to keep it.I feel at this point in technologies era, everything should be full 1080p or close, and have the latest hardware. Xbox One doesn't.Having to pay for apps you're already paying for via Xbox Live is robbery, IMO. Netflix being the most popular.Not nearly as many exclusives as PS4 will have. You can do a lot more with games like Uncharted, a next gen The Last Of Us, God Of War, Motorstorm etc. Than you can with Halo and Gears of Bore.So that's basically it, I feel that IMO the PS4 is superior, and the Xbox One is inferior. And it should be a good creative balance, which to me it is not, with the Xbox lagging behind in every way. I'm a 38 year old man btw, not some fanboy, or young teen defending my product so all of my friends will think I'm the man. I have worked on computers for years, built gaming rigs, so I prefer quality, and quantity. And I know great technology when I see it. And even though there isn't a lot happening right now, the PS4 flies off shelves faster than any console I've ever seen, and this is starting from Atari back in 1978, when I was about 3. I don't hate the Xbox, but I feel it wasn't promoted, or built with the future in mind, for gamers. Only for multimedia living rooms where people can take advantage of it. Also Sony is certainly known for it's great reliability, and has been around for nearly 60 years. So as I said not really many questions left to ask as to why I chose it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

Since I have been married (~4 years), I gave up PC gaming, it felt like I was putting my wife aside to play games...it is a different feeling on the couch when you can game and converse in a living room...don't judge, it just works for us.Anyway- I look for games like Borderlands or Diablo to play with the wife since you can have coop experiences where you work together to achieve fun and exciting outcomes! - (keep it clean:))!The game is super polished, and easy to pick up.  You start off with only certain spells/abilities- as you gain levels, you unlock more and more.  Eventually you will have each button bound to a certain spell/ability.  Doing so enables those (like myself) an easy learning curve into the Diablo world.  There are 5 different classes with 2 genders each, all with their own unique sets of skills/abilities.The graphics seem great, the sharing of the same screen works out well which and reminds me of the old days of Gauntlet (haha).  It is a fresh game to play in the midst of the FPS battles btw BF3/COD/Halo/etc..I guess Diablo 3 was ruined with an AH of some sort on the PC?  Well it is of non existence with the console version and is a load of fun to play- so grab your friends, spouse, controller and kick the forces of evil out of Sanctuary!Game on!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2013"}

The only other game I played that I can compare this to is Dungion Siege 3 , now I really liked DS3 but Diablo 3 blew that game away.The graphics in the game are not the best but they are sevicable and doesn't affect the game play at all. The game play and story in this game are top notch. This really is a first class game that you can play through by yourself or with 3 other friends. Co-op is always a plus in my book , I wish more games if not all would allow this. Even though playing the game alone provides you with many of hours of enjoyment , its always better to have a friend or two to experience the story with you.This game has a drop in and drop out Co-op system and it works flawlessly. If a friend of mine is online playing all I have to do is fire the Xbox up , instert the disk , and join his game session , and boom i'm in game with him..As you progress through the game you will notice that everywhere you go is different. Different lands , different dungons , different enemies , etc ,etc ,etc... This is a very good thing , it keeps you from getting board with the game , games that constantly require you to go back to the same places you have been before to complete more quests in other places you have been before gets quite old.. This game does it right and treats you to different sights and locations all the way through the game.I know I dind't really touch on anything major because what I would have to say has been said in previous reviews , but I just wanted to add my two cents to the reviews.. If you have not gotten it I highly advise this game . Solid 5 out of 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

It's goofy as all hell, and every bit a sandbox shooter. But it offers some real fun that lasts for quite a bit longer than you tend to find in most video game purchases. Eventually some of the novelty begins to wear off (especially if you're chasing those trophies/achievements), but then you stumble across something new and shiny and you can't put it down once again. Personally, I would have purchased this game just for the soundtrack and the Professor Genki missions. Everything else is icing on the cake. Think of GTA, with tons of fun side missions, vehicles and ridiculousness and you'll have every idea of what this game has in store. While not perfect and lacking in its original appeal once the city has been taken over, Saints Row The Third is a game you'll want to own. Did I mention co-op campaign, character/vehicle customization, flying motorcycles, the ability to parachute from any location? No? Well, I meant to. Amazing game.

The levels are fun, colorful, and engaging. There are P-switch puzzles, hidden star coins to find that unlock additional levels and worlds.  New items with the mini mushroom and super mushroom are a blast. The game looks great and plays wonderfully. Its Mario doing what Mario does best (we don't want you super mario sunshine), stomping Goombas and traveling from world to world trying to free Peach.I loved the dual screen action, getting to tap on the screen to use your item in reserve, or when on the map view getting to tap a world to warp to it. Other than that you don't use the stylus but who would want to for side-scroller? There is a lot of replay value here because worlds 4 and 7 require unlocking to find. There are hidden levels in each world, ghost houses always have an alternate route to take, and each level has 3 hidden star coins you can find.The mini games are fun though I haven't spent much time with them. There's over 20 of them so there's something for everyone. They are good for killing time if you waiting somewhere or on your commute. Don't expect to sit and play them for hours though, that's what the main story is for :)Things I would improve on:1. Too much repeats from previous titles (world 2 is in the desert, just like SMB3).2. Mini mushrooms are too rare, you can only hold on to one item for reserve so you end up playing a level, seeing that there is a part that require a mini mushroom, then having to remember a previous level to go to to retrieve a mini mushroom, play all the way through that level (can't grab the item then return to map with it like in SMW) then go back to the other level to play through without getting hit (not hard though) to get to the part where you can take advantage of being mini mario. That backtracking can get old.3. Pump up the difficulty a couple notches, the bosses were a breeze and world 8 was overall way too easy especially the end castle.Overall definitely recommend this title to any DS owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2009"}

A monster of hybrid and frustrating bosses","reviewText":"Been anticipating this game since I'm a hardcore RPG player (both western and Japanese). But FF XII is a disappointment. I think it is one of the most overrated game of the year and Square-Enix failed to deliver a product to please old and new audience while trying hard to do so. The unnecessary way of prolonging gameplay for a game with a short story is just frustrating, disappointing and irritating. Square-Enix could lose a lot of support with this ill-fated overrated attempt of cross breeding western and Japanese RPGs cos it created a mutated monster that only live under the franchise name without the franchise substance.Battle SystemI must say the battle system is disappointing for a long term FF supporter like me. I became a hybrid of Baulder's Gate and Final Fantasy so it doesn't look like anything - not that it's bad to be unique but it destroys the fun of both aspects of western and Japanese RPGs. Also they immitate the Tales of Symphonia type of AI control but then at the same time doesn't have the depth of the Tales of Symphonia systems. You basically buy gambits for the AI controls but then that's it. It affects their performance by priority but e.g. if you set steal as the first priority - which you need to because enemies don't drop gil anymore so you need to sell your loot to buy extremely expensive gears to stay alive in battles - it will keep on stealing even there is nothing to steal and eventually get killed. But in Tales of Symphonia, the AI develop different skills depends on how you want them to behave in the battle, so it has higher replay value because if you want to see all the skills and different chain patterns, then you have to replay it. FF XII doesn't have that at all. Once your characters levelled up to a certain level, you can set everyone on gambit and run around just to let them kill. Not interactive at all. Some of the optional bosses and marks are ridiculously difficult and have things like immune to all attacks when near death just really put you off. Just imagine a boss with like 500,000 HP. You worked hard to wear down to say 2500 HP, then it is immune to everything and can only be attacked for 3 seconds when the immunity is down but at the same time cast instant death magic to all your characters. That is what we call frustrations not fun. I think Square Enix had gone too far on this. In terms of battles and bosses, I think this is so far the worst of the crop.In terms of magic, they change the magic system into a way that veteran FF fans can't find their magic anymore. White and Black are still there. But then Blue is gone and replaced by Time and Green. White and Black magic are basically the same but in the past with Esuna, you can cure all status but now you have a subdivision of Blinda, Stona etc. to cure individual status. But most important certain status can't be cured by magic. What the? Green magic dumped all the status magic together (in the past they are white magic) so you have to run through a unfamiliar list for things you used to know. Time magic is ok cos it does tell what's happening. But Green magic man...so random and unnecessaryDungeonsThe worst thing is the introduciton of traps. You can have it in Vagrant Story or other games, but traps that completely block your path and can cause instant death in a FF game? What is Square-Enix thinking about? That is so unnecessary and waste of time and increase of frustration. Especially you got ambused already by enemies and then one of your AI characters stepped on a trap - start from the last game save mate. And you have enemies who plant traps? Square-Enix is completely lost on that I reckon. Going through dungeons with hordes of enemies (some so deadly) without enough save points is already intense. Got killed by traps right in front of a save point? Anyone find it challenging? Save points that are actually monsters you have to defeat them to save when you thought you finally can have a rest after 2 hours of dungeon crawling? Anyone find it fun?Character DevelopmentYou use license board. OK like sphere grid but you need to open them up with license point. Everyone starts at the same point, ok like the expert grid in FF X. But then in FF X you open up that skills as long as you have the step points.  For FF XII, you open that up YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM FROM SHOPS TOO before you can use them. So it doubles up your effort and since enemies no longer drop gils, it forces you to do a lot of battles again and again to hopefull get something you can sell at a good price to build up the cash flow for them. I mean for gears and weapons, I can understand. But for magic and techniques? Why is it not once you open up you can use it? You still need a lot of LP to open up high level magic, but at the same time you need to use a fortune to buy them after opening them up? What the heck? Also they have attributes that you can open up but you can use that often e.g. Ether Lore (increase MP recovery with Ether) is great but then ether are not available in shops so you have to hope that they show up in chests, which usually give you 2 gils instead of anything useful. That's what we call crap gaming design. Especially if the chest is guarded by a super uber hard enemy. You killed it finally and find out that there are only 2 gils in it? You just want to throw the controller across your lounge room. For weapon skills, if you think you can save LP to open up your selected weapon group e.g. guns for your designated character, you are wrong. This is because the next level of gun that you can use could be 100 miles away on the board, so you have to open up staff, spear, bows, crossbows etc etc and then found out you don't have enough LP to open up the license for the gun you just bought for 100,000 gils.StoryThe story is great I must say but it is very short. Considering that I can only play on weekends cos I need to work during the week, 4 weeks into it, I am near the end - and that's include I spent time on character development and quite a bit of optional boss fighting. So the story is very short but very gripping (at least for me) It is completely different from other FF games in terms of style, more on a political thriller side with some fantasy themes but it is great. That's the only thing that keeps me going with the game. The voice acting is superb. They have British actors to do voice acting this time and there tons of different accents in the game to represent different tribes and social class in the world of Ivalice. I think that is very clever. Also no more cheerful cutesy and annoying little girl character bouncing and jumping around. That is a huge improvement.Music and VisualIt is not as good as other FF games. It's not that they are bad but just not memorable. The style change failed to make players remember a particular piece of music for particular areas e.g. you remember the HoneyB Mansion in FF VII, the opening theme in FF VIII and the Zanarkand Theme in FF X. But you can't remember anything in this game. It sounds familiar when they recyle the same music in the same area, but that's all. You can relate anything to the game by just listening to the music. Visual wise, I must say it is the most beautiful and detail game in FF history. Some of the areas you just want to look around because they are so well done and detailed that it's just a pleasure to look at it. However, because of all the details and sharp images, my eyes get really tired after a while, which is not common for me at all cos that doesn't exist in any other games that I've played since I started gaming. My other friend, who is another hard core gamer has the same problem too. So that is something to take into consideration.OverallIt is a decent game, just not a memorable game. Personally I think it is a bit overrated and I do think that Square-Enix has lost the plot for the FF games. It's disappointing that it tried to create something to please global audience but then it failed to look like anything in the end. In terms of quality, other FF games are far superb except for FF X2 which is a complete mistake to even have that one. If someone wants to play action RPGs they can play Zelda or Champions of Norrath etc. FF games as a stake holder in the RPG genre is because FF games own unique style and system, but FF XII lost it all. The story is a huge advance for Square-Enix but that's all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2006"}

There's a puzzle challenge for about everything. To open a door, reach a switch, Treasure, get rid of obstacles.  This is where it can get frustrated because to open one door sometimes you have to do a lot of climbing and exploring and figuring out what to do.I am happy that I was able to beat the game without a strategy guide or going online.  I completed the game in 27 hours. with some side mission completed.  it is longer if you decide to complete all side mission and find all collectibles.The best way to figure out how to complete the puzzle challenges is to observe your environment and look around.  Also when you are giving abilities think about how you can use it to solve the puzzles which is a must.The game has good graphics but after awhile everything seems to look the same.The controls are easy, Smooth and Responsive.The loading times in this game are fast.  This is a big plus.The cut-scenes didn't seem that interesting.  its similar to other RPG games,  Characters face each other and start talking.My only con is that they should of added an ability to run faster, The Character is already running but doesn't run fast enough.The Character does not block.  only has evading abilities which I don't mind but I don't think its perfect.  facing one enemy your able to evade the attacks if timed properly but once there's more than one its difficult to start evading because the direction you want to evade does not seem to go that way or it feels inverted at times.I don't see the point of having a lot of money if almost every item for sale doesn't seem useful or is less powerful than what you already have,  Finding items or weapons is better then the items on sale.

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

Don't get me wrong, the game wasn't bad or anything, it was just really short.Boasting some new gameplay as opposed to the usual platformer fare, the puzzles in Luigi's Mansion, as well as bosses, were fun while they lasted.  A fairly simple game, Luigi's Mansion is not something that an experienced gamer should probably buy, unless they'd just like it in a collection for some reason.For the family game, this doesn't do too badly, although the fifty dollar price tag isn't justifiable.  A good game for teaching parents and small children to play a game, I'd recommend Pikmin as a puzzle game over this, and Mario Sunshine as a Mario game above this.Three stars justifies the good quality, as well as super short playtime.

Besides Master Chief's adventures, the game also has a parallel story that begins with a cut-scene on the Covenant homeworld.  A Covenant Elite Supreme Commander is disgraced, beaten, and punished because of his failure to capture Master Chief and is selected by the High Prophets to be the Arbiter and atone for his sins.  The Prophets believe that the Arbiter will soon be killed in action as all Arbiters were before him, but this Arbiter is different and isn't killed in action.  Instead, he fulfills his first few missions, uncovers a secret about the High Prophets, and joins forces with Master Chief.Story-wise, HALO 2 is a bit of a let down than HALO.  The original game had a great story that was well contained and stands upon its own.  Apparently the makers of HALO 2 decided to take a cue from bad Hollywood franchises and HALO 2 isn't self-contained.  The game is just as fun to play as the original, but without having played the first game, some of the plot elements are lost on newbies.  Of course, then there's the whole \"cliffhanger\" (aka dumb) ending for the game that isn't an ending at all.A new improvement to the game is that characters can choose to fight with two weapons (of only certain types) at the same time.The game has a great deal of replay value because of the great co-op features.Overall, even though I was disappointed by some of the points of the story and the abrupt ending, I enjoyed playing HALO 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"vicki","summary":"console","reviewText":"Great buy.

{"product_name":"B0007TS24U","description":"Take2 Games Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories 23696 PC Games","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Grand Theft Handheld","reviewText":"This is the PSP game we've all been waiting for.Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories lived up to the hype and even surpassed it, and it stands out as one of the biggest and best handheld games I've ever played. What makes it so great?Liberty City Stories is an all-new game in the terms of its story, but that's about it. In fact, one would better describe it as a Grand Theft Auto III.5, as it borrows some gameplay features of GTA: Vice City while taking place in GTAIII's Liberty City. The plot revolves around Tony Cipriani, as some may remember as the owner of St. Mark's Bistro in Liberty City. He's returning to Liberty City after some jail time and his fellow Mafia family wants him to run around LC keeping the Mafia on top of things. Of course, any GTA fan knows that this means driving people around, killing enemies, or both.GTA:LCS does a great job with its story, providing humourous (and fully voice-acted) cut-scenes between each and every mission. There's no doubt that you'll be laughing about some of the events at some point. Unfortunately, the mission design leaves a little to be desired. Like I said, this game is a lot more like GTAIII than, say, GTA: San Andreas. Therefore, San Andy's complex mission structure is left alone to return to a simple, quick approach. This isn't necessarily bad, as some of the missions can be especially difficult on the PSP's 4.3-inch screen.At least the trademark action returns. The simple controls are accompanyed by Vice City's improved targeting system, making the game run smoothly when the action gets hot. Shooting and driving are still the main idea, and they're simple enough to do. The targeting system is done with a trigger button, and eliminating the poor sap is as simple as pressing or holding the circle button. It's as easy as that. Driving feels almost exactly the same as it does on the console, but I did notice that motorcycles are a little tougher to control. The brakes don't seem to be very responsive. Drive-bys are also a little too difficult, as they require the player to hold the camera button, left or right on the analog nub, and the shoot button. By the time you fumble around with this control scheme, you might have already driven past your intended target.Of course, the missions and the story are optional in the mainstream gamer's eyes, and GTA: LCS caters to this. If you were a fan of rampaging around the town, the PSP version delivers. There are more \"Past Time\" missions like Taxi Driver, Vigilante, and Pizza/Noodle Delivery. These attention-deprived missions are quick and fun, and serve as something extra to do between missions. There are more guns this time around, including most of the ones that were in GTA: Vice City. Having this additional arsenal makes GTA: LCS much more interesting than GTAIII ever was.The graphics sure speak words of their own. I can't believe Rockstar Leeds was able to pull off such a feat as including all of Liberty City in one UMD with space to boot. The load time that starts up the game isn't even a minute long, meaning that LCS is quickly and easily accessible. There is a slight delay inbetween cut-scenes and the start of every mission, but I'm only talking about a ten second load at most. The radio stations return as well. I never really listened to the actual music stations because they feature some really horrible, generic music...but the entertaining precursor to GTAIII's Chatterbox FM, this time called LCFR (Liberty City Free Radio), is endlessly entertaining. The voice acting is spot-on and the sound effects are recycled from other GTA games, making for a well-rounded technical package.Overall, there's no reason why GTA fans or PSP owners should go without this game. I'll let you know that it's pushing the lines on its Mature rating, which is something Rockstar is notoriously comfortable doing. There aren't any Hot Coffee sex scenes, but the crude humor alongside the ridiculously dirty dialogue is enough to keep this game from being something that a child should play. Anyone else...pick this up. You won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2005"}

After about a half an hour I found the game repetitive having to pop in batteries every time a group of taken attacked me. The Majority of the game is taken in the forest in the dark which doesn't show off to many landscapes or art. I got tired of being attacked having to focus my flash light for about 5 seconds on each taken and than unload 3 shots into him. You can only run in the dark flashing a flashlight around. The battery and reload time took to long to be able to take them out without having to run back to find more behind me. I know you get a flare gun and flashes later on which I'm sure help a lot more but you have a limited amount. I give this game a 7 for emotionally linking the player to the game and the graphics but the repetiveness of it lowers that and is only worth a rent from your video store.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2010"}

Think of it as an intelligent person's action adventure stealth exploration video game, something like Halo for Mensans.There's no other game quite like the Assassin's Creed series.There's a reason this game gets so many good reviews. For starters, it has a great plot. Add to that some superb graphics, a huge explorable open game world, and three-dimensional characters that are well-designed, and AC2 becomes an extraordinarily good game. The voice acting is distinctly brilliant, and while everyone in the all-star cast shines, Roger Craig Smith (Ezio) and Kirsten Bell (Lucy Stillman) are eminently believable.So what's not to like? At time the controls are a little imprecise and jittery (especially when trying to get up on to buildings or navigate around wall corners) , but it's an improvement in comparison to the original Assassin's Creed.

True Crime was different in that you actually play a cop, but the same free roaming city was on offer, and you can also frequently break the law.  Like all the copycat GTA games though, Activision completely missed the point with this, and it turns out to be a pretty average game.The missions are fairly interesting, rather like GTA they vary from very good to boring, however whereas in GTA, the missions are almost a side show to everything else you can do, on True Crime that is practically all you can do.  Other than missions you can arrest criminals and stuff like that, but it's repetitive and quickly becomes tiresome.  The main problem is the city itself, though it is massive on a similar scale to San Andreas, there is nothing to do in it.  It may well be an accurate model of LA, but unlike San Andreas, it doesn't feel like a living breathing city.  In Grand Theft Auto games you can play for months and still find new stuff, here there is no interaction with people, and no buildings to go in, plus all the areas look similar for miles on end.The plot is standard fare, you play a slightly maverick cop, who isn't afraid to bend the rules to get results, he also has revenge on his mind, so far so cliched.  It continues like this until a ridiculous turn in the plot later on, involving the supernatural, I won't spoil it, but it is a bit stupid.  Despite the criticism i've given so far, True Crime is a decent game, you could happily pass a few days playing this, just don't expect anything on a GTA level.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2005"}

The missions are WAY to REPETITIVE- you are either destroying an outpost, smuggling something, protecting somebody, or kidnapping somebody.  These four scenarios happen again, and again, and again, oh and again..2. The graohics could be better-After seeing the WAY better graphics on other games, this one does'nt seem up to par.3. The Enviroment immersion is pretty lame- When compared to GTA IV, the enviroment in this game just seems pretty weak.  The people merely yell something at you as you pass by.  I guess for lack of better words, it does'nt seem as alive as past sandbox games.The coolest part of this game was blowing stuff up, but even that gets old after awhile-(I know, I can't believe I just said that).I thought that playing with a buddy was going to be so much cooler than it actually was.  After an hour of playing co-op with my friend, it became quite boring.Verdict: Rent on the Weekend-If you don't have any other plans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2008"}

It's still a playable and enjoyable game.GRAPHICS: The detail of the Premium Cars look fantastic, one of the best graphics you'll see in a racing game. The night time driving looks really good as well. But the Standard Cars details are obsolete. It would of been awesome if all 1000+ cars in this game had the interior pan. Because the Standard Cars don't look that good, the graphics are pushed back to an 8.GAMEPLAY: Lots of races and other fun modes will keep you busy. B-Spec mode would of been better if they brought back the option to speed it up 3x. Overall, an 8.SOUND: The cars sound realistic, but the music is terrible, but it does allow you to bring your own custom tracks into the game, so I won't subtract any points. 10CONTROLS: Same as most racing games, X to accelerate, square to break, analog stick to steer, select to change camera angle. This is the controls everyone is familiar with it. 10.CAMERA: Various camera angle, and even an interior view of 300 cars in the game. 10.ONLINE: Mediocre at best, and you can only trade and receive one car per day. 6.GLITCHES: I can't say I've noticed any annoying glitches or error. 10.PERFORMANCE: It takes a long time to make the installation, but it runs pretty well overall. 9.DIFFICULTY: Let's see, try doing races for 24 hours straight without turning your PS3 off.

{"product_name":"B00DE2W5XG","description":"","reviewerName":"Troy Lyons \"troythegeek\"","summary":"PS4 impressions after first weekend","reviewText":"UPS delivered my PS4 bright and early on Friday and then I had to wait an interminable 7 hours before actually getting to hook the thing up.  I knew that there was a day one update that was mandantory before I could really do anything and that is where I ran into my first problem.  I went through the initial set-up and put in my wifi password and it started downloading the update.  It got to within 30mb of being completed and gave me an error.  It started downloading again, got to about the same spot and stopped again.  After the third attempt at downloading I started searching and found that Sony had the file available on the Playstation site so I downloaded it from there, followed their install instructions and it worked.  Too bad I wasted 45 minutes of failed downloads before trying it.Things went pretty smooth after the install.  I logged in using my Playstation Network ID and it ported over everything related to that.  I messed around with the navigation bar and it felt new, but also familiar.  I certainly didn't feel lost and new exactly what I needed to do.  That's a good sign.  I put in my first game, Assasin's Creed IV, and it immediately started installing the game.  This is where things got interesting.  With the PS4, Sony is requiring the game to be installed to the console.  You can't play it without the disc, but it is basically like an unlock key.  This allows for some pretty neat things that PS3 owners should love.  AC4 came with many codes for costumes and weapons so I started inputting those.  On the PS3, you would have to quit the game and input codes and then go back to the game.  With the PS4, it basically pauses the game, allows you to do whatever you need, then you can just continue.  It is seamless, quick and works like a charm.  I was very impressed.  However, this is also when I ran into my second problem.  Sony's servers were going down, which is why I couldn't download the update, and it was also causing problems connecting to the Playstation Network.  I managed to get a few codes entered, but that was it.  I started getting error after error.  I finally gave up and just started playing the game.  I was never able to access the PSN for the rest of that first night.  Even into Saturday, I continued to see the message that the PSN was down for maintenance.As far as playing the games, the biggest change I've encountered is with the DUALSHOCK 4.  They keep pretty much everything that we love, but there are some significant changes.  Gone are the select and start buttons.  That may not sound like a big deal, but it gets confusing when playing a game you are familiar with.  My thumbs kept going to a start button that wasn't there to pause the game, or to the missing select button to pull up a map.  Sony has moved those functions to the touchpad located on top of the controller.  Then there are the new &#34;share&#34; and &#34;options&#34; buttons.  The &#34;share&#34; button allows you to take a photo of your screen or a 15 minute video.  You can also broadcast your gameplay.  I've done the photo upload and it worked great, but have yet to try the other share features.  The options button was used various times throughout menus and the game.  It seems to be a catch all type of thing for many different maintenance functions.  You will also notice  a light on the front of the controller that lights up blue by default.  It is supposed to be used with the Playstation 4 camera to track movement, but can also change colors depending on what is happening in the game.  I don't have a Playstation Camera right now so haven't seen how it interacts with that, but I can tell you the light is distracting in the dark.  I could see it reflected in my screen and it was annoying.  The last big change to the controller is battery life.  With the PS3, charging my controller was an afterthought.  The battery would last somewhere around 30 hours.  With the DUALSHOCK 4, it's more like 6 hours.  That is a HUGE change that I bet most people don't know about.  I was shocked to see that I had to charge my controller on Sunday after a weekend of playing for a couple of hours each day.  The good news is that you can charge the controller at night by plugging it into the PS4 while it is powered down, something you couldn't do with the PS3.  Also, the DUALSHOCK 4 uses a micro USB instead of a Mini USB so your DUALSHOCK 3 cables will not work.  I've already found several cheap cables here on Amazon that I am going to try that are 10 feet in length.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

Set 2,000 years prior to the self-titled first game in theSacredseries,Fallen Angelis prequel to the events and quests of earlier RPG hit, that drops players in the midst of an epic struggle for control of elemental power on the grandest of scale.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Sacred 2: Fallen AngelPlayers:Offline 1-4; Online 1-4Other:Co-op multiplayer; HDTV 480p, 720p, 1080i; 16:9 widescreen; In-game Dolby Digital sound.6 stunning character classes.View larger.Battle using brute force &amp; steel.View larger.A massive weapons inventory.View larger.Master the lore of the ancients.View larger.Classic RPG character leveling.View larger.The StoryT-Energy has been flowing through Ancaria since time immemorial. This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow.

Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy.

Perfect in nearly every way, this game is absolutely unbridled fun and should NOT be missed. So let's get to it :PRAISES : Pretty much everything. It's really difficult to find fault with this game being as fun as it is. The scale, the graphics, the playability (and re-playability!) the new items and weapons, the combat system, the fact that every boss is a Greek God, and the array of creatures to smash to a pulp make this a pretty tough game to top. If you're reading this review, you've likely read others, so I won't rehash what everyone (myself included) loves so much about this game. There's a LOT of it and it could fill pages, so suffice it to say, this is quite possibly one of the best video games ever created and unquestionably one of the top 3-5 EVER for any Playstation platform. But rarely is anything perfect, so....CRITICISMS: My complaints (though minor and few) are as follows.... As much as I love the combat system, what with the upgrades to the items and how they're used (no longer tied to your magic), the combat grapple and the new weapons themselves, it could still stand a little improvement in that, it still doesn't allow you to dodge if you're in the middle of a combo move. In this regard, Kratos could take a hint from Bayonetta, which is easily the best & smoothest combat system I've played in a game of this style. Additionally, the camera isn't as intuitive as it needs to be at times since it doesn't rotate to always give you an unobstructed view of what you're fighting. Sometimes you'll be fighting things off screen and sometimes the screen will be so filled with attackers, you'll be pinned behind them flailing away and can't even see what you're doing. This doesn't happen a lot, but enough that it bears mentioning. Also, something to note about GOD OF WAR 3 though, is it's difficulty compared to the other GOW games. On normal setting, it's noticeably easier than the previous releases. Not horribly so, but it's definitely a tad easier. Titan mode (Hard) is definitely harder and a little closer to what you might expect a GOD OF WAR title to be, although, there are a few spots that are INSANELY tough to get by. I can't imagine what it'd be like on Chaos mode (Very Hard)....The only other complaint I had was with the ending of the story. Sure, it's a Greek tragedy, but after the relentless slaughter, brutality & mayhem through 3 PS3 games, 1 PSP game and a mobile game, you'd think the ending wouldn't be so........flat. Granted, it's a fairly minor complaint as you play video games for the action, not for the great writing and literary value, but still. When you see it, you'll know what I mean. Although, there is a short cut scene after the end of the credits that helps but a LITTLE air back in the tires so to speak. So, make of it what you will.THE VERDICT: It should be pretty obvious by now, but I absolutely LOVE this game (despite my few criticisms) and can't reccommend it enough. While it's not perfect, it's pretty close and what flaws it has aren't enough to damage the 'fun' factor of this title. Do yourself a favor and pick this up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

I am a huge fan of the god of war series, so there's no question that I was going to love this game before I even played it. That being said, instead of praising the game higher then I already do, I mention a few things I did not like so much about GOW 3....The graphics were good, but to be honest, I really expected them to be beyond awesome. Besides the more cinematic gaming parts where you have to press the correct buttons displayed on screen, the graphics of this game were not to far that of GOW 1 or 2 in my opinion. There were even plenty of parts where I seen a huge amount of very noticeable pixels. I think this is the first game I played on the PS3 so far that I even seen pixelation. 1 part that sticks out the most was the part where Helios is battling the Titan in the background. If you look at the clouds in the sky u will see pixelated clouds. I know it sounds super picky, but this was one of the highest budgeted games ever made and it was a little surprising to see it.Also, the puzzles were not hard at all. Especially when comparing to GOW 1 or 2. This game is mostly about the action. I don't believe I spent long at all figuring out any puzzles nor did I have to go online for help like I had to do with the previous GOW's.This game was almost a little too easy actually. I played GOW 1 and 2 on normal setting and it was sort of difficult for me. I played GOW 3 on normal as well basing it of the prior 2 games difficulty, but I believe playing GOW 3 on HARD level would have suited me better. I barely died and before I knew it I was at the end of the game. I found all gorgon eyes, phoenix feathers, and horns with ease and before the end of the game I upgraded all weapons with an over abundance of red orbs left over to spare.The notable highlights of the game was definitely the story line. Awesome storyline, great soundtrack, and of course...rockin god of war hack n slash game play.Also, I really enjoyed beating the challenges after finishing the game. The challenges were hard enough to be frustrating, but that's what god of war was all about. Play the game, get frustrated on more than one occasion, beat the frustrating part, and feel accomplished when finally moving on in the game. The challenges part of GOW 3 fulfilled the void that was left after beating this game so easily in comparison to GOW 1 & 2.That all being said....my 5 star rating is based on the game itself. Not the comparison between previous GOWs.GOD OF WAR 3 ROCKS!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"Loads of fun, original for a FPS these days","reviewText":"*Single player campaign review only*I think this is a game where it's best to just list the pros and cons, rather than a summary.Pros:1. Great set of weapons.  Very few weapons overall, but considering a great deal of the game is strategy in how to effectively take out the enemies, it works well and each weapon is unique to the others and seems to have it's own type of \"personality\".  The thing I liked a lot was the incorporation of \"skillshots\" - points for different methods of dispatching the enemy.  The more unique, the more skill points you'd get, and thus the more you could upgrade your weapons.  This made it interesting and unique in terms of how much it felt useful to conserve ammo.  It was rarely that there wasn't enough ammo, it was much more that you wanted to conserve to try and do interesting moves.  Segueing into,2. apart from your weapons you have some unique skills.  The traditional \"melee\" is now more of a \"kick\" feature, where you kick a guy and it slows down time so you can continue to dispatch him however you want.  You also have a \"leash\" which is perhaps the heart and soul of this game.  You can pull things to you, activate things, pull enemies to you, and eventually use it as a weapon.  Finally related to the melee is the ability to \"slide\" - it's basically a slide tackle move where again it slows down time but also can be used to attack enemies from a distance to quickly get up close.3. I was expecting a brainless shooter with a lot of interesting ways to kill guys, but I actually was kept very much in the game with the overall storyline.  It is a bit cliche, perhaps, but still enjoyable, and the plot does develop the characters and story much better than you think it will.  The story kept moving and never slowed which was nice.4. I was quite impressed with the graphics.  Seemed really well done.  At one point you're battling a city-sized beast and the scope is amazing.5. Considering the recent slew of EXTREMELY short games I've purchased (Medal of Honor, Homefront, COD Black Ops) this one was more like Kill Zone 3 in terms of a better length.  Certainly felt long enough for me to be happy.Cons:1. Game was very very linear.  It was something you could look past since there was always something going on, but besides the occasional little area you could hunt around for ammo boxes, it was completely a straight path.2. The enemies were quite repetitive.  I don't know how to emphasize this more, but while a few different types emerged at later points in the game, you did feel at times like it was the same thing over and over and over and over.  I mean this is an iffy critique for any FPS, since I don't know what they're supposed to do to combat this type of thing, but it definitely felt like you were basically facing few different enemies total.3. You have to choose three weapons out of your entire stash to be able to carry at a time.  This was frustrating because I ended up basically just using three different weapons (machine gun, pistol, & sniper rifle) since I didn't know what the other weapons could do exactly and never seemed to have a moment where I'd be able to get them down before using them.  Bulletstorm has a quick-cycle thing to choose your weapon, but I have played other games where you can cycle through all of them at any time and the gameplay stops while you're doing so.  Of course many games these days only allow you to carry a light and heavy weapon period.Random thoughts:1. Sniper rifle \"bullet time:\" basically you pull the trigger, the bullet heads towards the enemy, then it switches to a slowed down bullet time where you can direct the bullet.  This was both cool and frustrating.  The effect was cool, but I found until I was able to upgrade the weapon it was very hard to actually hit guys - they'd always jump out of the way of the bullet a little too intelligently.  The sniper rifle later becomes much more useful to me when you can make additions to the type of ammo.2. Your computer teammates are pretty much indifferent to your quest, which I think is good after playing games where they are too important and thus can screw up your own methodology to FPS.  They help sometimes but never get in the way, which is nice enough.3. In response to the amount of cussing people mentioned in other comments, it is no worse then half the other games out there.  Yes there is an ample amount, but never so much you're distracted by it.  Some of it is even amusing.  If it's distracting when you hear bad words then don't buy mature rated games.  The cussing works with the dialogue.Bottom-line:  I would say this is worth the cost resoundingly if you're a fan of just fun first person shooters, regardless of how realistic it is or if it's part of a series.  But if you don't like alien-shooting games maybe you wouldn't be happy with it.  I felt like it is well worth the money - I bought it on an Amazon sale at I think $39.99, and I am very happy with my purchase.  It is an original game, with original components, and I think in terms of it being FUN you will be happy with your purchase.  It does get repetitive at times, which was why I rated it four stars instead of five overall.  But it was a nice pick-me-up after having dropped $60 on the disappointing Homefront game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"A Near-Complete Starter Pack","reviewText":"The Starter Bundle makes it quick and easy for those who already have a PS3 to get an idea of what Move is about. Depending on what you already have on your PS3 and of what/how you are planning to play, all you may need could be just the Move controller and nothing else or you may want to order some additional controllers instead of this bundle.If you don't have a PS3, then thePlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation Move Bundleshould be the way to go.WHAT YOU GET, WHAT ELSE YOU MAY NEED/WANTBriefly, this is what you get in with this bundle and I will make it very short because there's a lot of info. at the Amazon page:* Move controller, of course* PlayStation Eye camera (must have for the Move to work)* Sports Champions (Ping Pong is simply awesome, some of the games play much better with a second controller)* A disc with Demos which should be available at the PSN store as wellDepending on how you are planning to play your games, this is what you don't get but may end up buying eventually:- One more additional Move Controller (some games will either require two controllers or will play better with two)- Navigation Controller(s) (you can use the DualShock in your left hand but it feels weird)- One or more extra USB wires if you don't have enough already to charge your new controller(s) OR- Dedicated charger, especially if you have more than one Move controller and/or Navigation controller(s)GO FOR THE STARTER BUNDLE OR NOT?The Motion Controller and the PS Eye are the minimum needed to bring 'Move' to a any PS3 console. No exceptions. If you already have a PS Eye then the controller alone is the only purchase necessary. On the other hand, to fully enjoy certain games, you may want TWO Move Controllers. This starter bundle makes sense if you don't have the Eye already and you are into the type of games that Sports Champions has. You could still get it and then sell the Eye if you already have one. The same goes for the Sports Champions. It comes sealed so you can sell it as 'new' and recover some funds in the process.MOVE'S MOTION CONTROLLERThe Wikipedia has a very thorough review of the technology inside the controller - impressive. It's probably worth going there to get an idea of what's under the hood.From a user's point of view, the Move could be viewed as approximately the right side of the DualShock 3 where the motion tracking function is the R3 analog stick, R1 is the MOVE button and the R2 becomes the Move's T(rigger). You also get the 4 Square/Circle/X/Triangle, in a square (not 'diamond') formation, the PS button as well as the START and SELECT. So far, the most used buttons during gameplay were the MOVE and the T(rigger).In addition, you get a wrist strap. At the opposite end of the microphone-shaped Move there's a USB Mini-B port for charging and another port that seems to be proprietary - must investigate.The controller is quite substantial as far as both size and weight - I like that and liked its being shaped in a way that makes it easy to grab and hold. Very much like a microphone or a very thick magic wand; NOT a remote control.Based on my experience so far, Move's ability to track your motions far surpasses anything that I'm aware of in the gaming universe. Every single movement, up/down, left/right, toward/away and wrist rotation are accurately captured and almost instantly reflected on the screen and so is acceleration that would usually translates as 'force' in games such as sword fights or ping pong. In addition, there is haptic (tactile/rumble) feedback, a little too weak in the games I played so far, making the gaming experience that much more realistic.I am not writing a lot about the Eye camera because... it's just there and it's not the subject of this review. For as long as it can see you, it simply does its part so that you may enjoy your game.THE GAMESports Champions consists of 6 separate events where you play through one of the available characters either against the other characters provided by the game or against another player - will need a second Move controller for that. As expected, there are levels of difficulties, medals and various bonuses.PING PONG shows Move's nothing short of amazing ability to track its controllers position in 3D space and, better, even detect moves such as wrist rotation and to track acceleration as 'force' and do it in real time. Playing Ping Pong is challenging, fun, frustrating and addictive. My entire arm, from wrist all the way up to the neck hurts already and I'm not even done with the Bronze Medal challenge yet (almost there).ARCHERY is probably second most popular, at least in our household. We like it because, unlike PING PONG, we don't sweat a lot while playing it. ARCHERY is also one of the 3 included games that make it quite clear that you will be much better off with TWO Motion Controllers. Some of the challenges look quite cheesy - shooting at floating money bags but we've spent some time playing it and it's likely that we are going to play some more in the future.The GLADIATOR SWORD FIGHT game, even more than ARCHERY would benefit from TWO Motion Controllers - one for the sword/axe and a second for a shield. With one controller only, you must pull the trigger to raise and use your shield or use the sword otherwise. Yes, Sony gave us BUTTONS but the game is ten times more realistic when you actually push your shield forward the way you would actually do it in real life rather than pull the trigger to raise the shield and, at the same time push the Move button while making a 'push' motion.BOCCE... ever played it? I have a couple of times. Plays well with one controller but it can be a little boring. Good simulation.FRISBEE GOLF is not bad. Actually played it in real life on the course we have at the nearby state park. It's a little slow but it's good relaxation after you sweat yourself out on PING PONG or GLADIATOR.VOLLEYBALL, again, can be so much better with two Motion Controllers. Also, be careful if you play in a room with low ceilings or anything that hangs from the ceiling like a ceiling fan or a priceless crystal candelabrum.Considering that Sports Champions is an early game, my expectations were not that high but, surprisingly, Ping Pong exceeded my expectations. I've been playing real Ping Pong ever since I was 11 or 12 so I probably know what I'm talking about and the Move version of Ping Pong is GOOD. As for the others... sword fight, not so good. Archery was okay, Bocce was so-so, Frisbee Golf not too bad.For the games I've played so far, this is NOT a couch experience. On the Sports events I was sweating after a few minutes and my Move arm is now hurting from the wrist all the way up to the neck.MY RATINGIt's 5 stars for the technical merit, ease of setup and for the overall experience. Hopefully, lots of good games will be coming quickly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

The designs and plot are grounded in reality while still retaining fantastic elements, so period-appropriate Renaissance designs exist alongside elves and monsters. The player takes the role of Geralt, a semi-amnesiac white-haired monster hunter known as a \"Witcher\", who in this game's plot must contend with a globe-spanning plot involving one of his fellow Witchers. The game's writing is compelling, though it varies by character, so for some it may be enough to simply follow the story.The Witcher 2's gameplay is more action-oriented than The Witcher's gameplay was. While the first game's combat was mostly rhythm-based, The Witcher 2 uses a more conventional light/heavy attack system combined with its existing spell-casting system. This is meant to make it seem more like an action game than the Witcher 1, and while it's certainly a more involved system, it's still not exactly good. The relative lack of responsiveness means that battles are in essence flailing messes; you can get a general idea of what's working, but the animation quality and general \"feel\" of combat leave a lot to be desired. It's not really tactical enough to be good RPG combat, and it's not reflexive enough to be good action combat.The \"RPG\" elements of the Witcher are more of a background element, as befits an action-RPG. There are skill trees with different upgradable statistics and abilities, but it's not as involved as in a traditional RPG. Rather, the RPG concepts are more about affecting the combat gameplay, which ends up in a lacking experience because the combat gameplay isn't that good. It's possible to take ingredients from nature or fallen monsters in order to brew potions and oils, but really the application of that mechanic isn't too different from traditional crafting gameplay in other RPGs.The game's aesthetics are probably its biggest draw. The game's setting is a Renaissance-level European-style fantasy, and accurate real-life armor and clothing is depicted in the game. However, this doesn't really have a huge impact on gameplay; swords easily pierce through plate armor, and the technology of the period never really matters, meaning that it's a standard fantasy game wrapped up in a nice-looking package at most. The game's graphics are well-executed, but models tend to clip into each other and animations can be somewhat stuttered unless your system is good enough to run it totally smoothly.Overall, though, I didn't care for The Witcher 2. Its combat is average, its graphics are good, and its story is acceptable. It's not really worth praising per se, but it's not terrible, either. It's just sort of a hard game to get into because it follows the standard RPG formula of semi-linear story padded out with fetch quests. If you're into that, it's a good game; if you're not a fan of RPGs, Witcher 2 probably won't change your mind.We purchased this game with our own funds for the purpose of doing this review.Rating: 7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

Both consoles are excellent portable gaming devices.  From a consumer point of view, the question is not which of the console is \"better\" hardware.  The question one should ask, in my humble opinion, is which console would best meet one's needs.The Nintendo DS Lite fit my gaming needs better. If I can only have one handheld, the DS Lite would be my choice.  You're probably thinking, \"but Citan, the PSP can do a whole lot more!\".  True enough.  However, for someone like me, who is simply looking for a handheld console to play casual games away from home, the DS Lite is a better fit.  And it has nothing to do with the hardware.  The DS Lite simply has a wider variety of games available, compared to the PSP.  And to me, the selection of games is the most important factor.  So then you say, \"Citan, I want to know which is best for me, not for you\"  Ok, fair enough.  Please, read on.The Sony PSP platform is home to games like the Grand Theft Auto and Metal Gear Solid series.  The more popular games for the Sony platform seem to be the types that are complicated, elaborate, and not the \"pickup-and-play\" variety.  In other words, if you are looking for a gaming experience that is as close as you can get out of your PS2, then the PSP is for you.  The popular games available for it tend to be more \"grand\" in scale than the ones for the Nintendo.  And yes, the graphics are better.  Also, if you want multimedia capability, then seriously consider the PSP.  The PSP library does not have as much variety.  But then again, if you do not want variety in your gaming, then that should not matter.If you are looking to play games during those random moments that we sometimes get, then seriously consider the DS Lite.  An example of random free time is arriving to work fifteen minutes early and spending that time playing a short casual game in your car, at the parking lot.  There are many games in the DS library that would be perfectly suited for such a situation.  Somehow, I don't think Metal Gear Solid would be a good choice to be playing while waiting at the doctor's office!  For that, you would want a game that you can start and stop very quickly.  If this is what you have in mind, then the DS Lite (at least for now) would be a better choice.  There is a shortage of casual games for the PSP right now.  Although that could change in the future.Basically, it would really depend on how you want to use your gaming device.  Some games are better for those random gaming time than others.  And it just so happens that there are more such games in the DS library.Which console would be better for your child?  I would say that depends on the age of the child.  For a younger child, say under 12, I would give the DS Lite the edge.  Again, more variety of games available.  The DS Lite has plenty of light-hearted games that are very suitable for younger children.  An older child might prefer the PSP to play the more mature games, such as the GTA series.Another factor to consider is the cost of ownership.  The PSP will have a higher cost of ownership due to the fact that you will need to buy a memory stick.  Also, a replacement battery for the Sony is twice as expensive as the one for the DS.  That's an important consideration if you're buying for a child.Do you own a PS3?  If so, the PSP might be a better choice for you since they are designed to work together.  Game developers might decide to take advantage of this interoperability and make use of it in future games.  For this reason, I will keep my PSP.  I cannot comment as to the interoperability between the DS Lite and the Wii, since I do not own a Wii.At the moment, I am playing Elite Beat Agents on the DS Lite.  The graphics and the presentation are certainly not up to the standards of the likes of the latest GTA or MGS for the PSP.  But is the game any less entertaining?  Definitely not.  And the DS touch screen really make video gaming accessible even to people who have never tried them in the past.My advice is to consider your needs carefully before making a purchase.  The same advice holds true if you are deciding between the PS3, XBox360, and the Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2007"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Deal Stealer \"GPS Nav\"","summary":"Great game!

The story, audio, gameplay, and more are the epitome of the Strategy RPG genre. I find the game extremely satisfying, and it's the type of game that you can play through several times.I recently purchased the PSP version, which is somewhat of a remake, and have had some good and bad experiences. For one, the added cutscenes bring some great new flavor to the title, and make the story much more tangible. I haven't played with the new classes, but they're a great addition from what I hear, and the multiplayer adds plenty of play value to an already jam-packed game.The only gripe I have is that when an ability is used during gameplay, the game speed and framerate drop noticeably while the audio plays normally. This issue doesn't make much sense because the original FFT plays perfectly fine on the PSP. For whatever reason, Square Enix dropped the ball during coding (they've been screwing up for a decade now).With that said, this is in my opinion one of the best games of all-time, and one that you won't soon forget. It works extremely well as a portable title, and will bring you plenty of enjoyment for years to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2011"}

This time, you learn moves through weapons and armor. Let's say you equip a weapon that teaches you Fira. You can use Fira now. But if you un-equip the weapon, you lose Fira. But if you get a certain  amount of AP, Fira stays with you FOREVER. So you can upgrade to a better weapon without losing Fira. The Trance system is like the limit break, but you cannot use it when you want to.Chocobos have a role too. You can play minigames with them to seek out treasure, and upgrade your chocobo. Very neat. Not as good as then FF7 chcobo system, but awesome.Moogles play their biggest role since FF3/6 [when you actually had one on your party.] You use moogles to save, some to shop, and send mail.There is much more to this game, but I will let you see for yourself.GRAPHICS: Very good for the time. The FMV's look splendid.\\Music/Sound: I love the music! \"Not Alone\" is a good piece, so is the Trance Kuja fight music.STORY: The bread-and-butter of FF. The story is great, but I won't spoil anything. So I'll just tell the characters.ZIDANE: The main hero of the story. He has a tail. He has a spunky attitude, and loves chicks. A great fighter, with a powerful Trance. Can steal items from enimies.GARNET/DAGGER: 3 words: Cleavage on holiday. She is the 16 year old princess who gets \"kidnapped\" by Zidane. A bunch of chemistry here. A great healer, and a great summoner.STEINER: A knight who's sworn duty is to protect Garnet. Hates Zidane. He can use sword moves, and cobine magic with Vivi.VIVI: A Black Mage. He doesn't know about himself, and his self-esteem is low. His magic packs a punch.FREYA: Some kind of rat creature. She can jump on enimies. I don't use her.QUINA: A rather stupid character who wants to eat everything. Can eat monsters and learn their powers. I don't know if Quina's a boy or a girl.EIKO: A 6-year old who lives with moogles. Her moves are simalar to Dagger's.AMARENT:Kind of a loner. He can throw weapons, and is a decent fighter,KUJA: The main villan. As Arnold says, \"GIRL-Y MAN!!!\" He wears a thong.

Only physical and mental agility can keep you alive, though they are by no means a guarantor of life.

It's heavy on narrative, character development, and atmosphere.  It is a huge game that can take you anywhere between 40-80 hours to complete, yet those hours fly by because you are so involved in the world.  Based on the best selling novels by  Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher introduces gamers to Geralt, a witcher (aka mutated monster hunter) who has recently lost his memory, gets caught up in a web of deceit, political intrigue, and war in a world where it is very difficult to determine what is right and wrong.  This is what sets The Witcher apart from other RPGs on any platform.The Witcher's core gameplay mechanics are well thought out and work wonderfully.  The combat, which requires timely clicking of the left mouse button, is simple to learn yet always keeps the player on his/her toes due to the need to constantly shift both weapons and combat styles in mid-battle.  Geralt eventually gains access to a set of magic spells that augment the extremely cool-looking swordplay in a very satisfying way.  All your spells and combat styles, as well as the RPG standards for character growth (dexerity, intelligence, strength, etc..) are all upgradable in varied, easy-to-use skill trees.  An alchemy system, which seems daunting at first, is actually very useful and can make passing previously unpassable sections of the game a breeze.  And the game world itself, while not as large as that in other games, is incredibly detailed and fascinating.  The ravages of war and disease seep from every corner of the cities and swamps, and corrupt soldiers, politicians, and rebels seek to exploit everyone and everything they can to gain their advantage in this conflict.  This setting, and the stories that arise from it, are what sets The Witcher apart from other games in the genre, and raise the game into something truly special.Direct gamer interaction with the story is front and center in The Witcher, and it's the seemingly endless amounts of morally ambiguous choices that you will have to make in this ravaged world that will shape your experience in this game into something unforgettable and unique.  Never before in a video game have I been so conflicted with choices I had to make. From the huge, world-shaping decisions you will have to make, to the smallest, most personal ones that will allow you to rebuild your life after losing your memory...all of them seem epic and will be sure to cause even the most hardened gamer pause.  Impressively, you will see the repercussions of nearly all your decisions during your playthrough, sometimes much later in the story, and sometimes coming to fruition in ways that were significantly larger than you realized at the time.  All of this comes together with the great gameplay and well-functioning interface to make a mature game that immerses you in way that few others do.  It's a shame that The Witcher is only available on the PC, because this is a truly wonderful, masterful RPG that should be played by as many people as possible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B008CP6RUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Jessie Scott","summary":"Like a Hollywood Blockbuster","reviewText":"The first Uncharted blew me away (even if the story got really weird near the end - though I still liked it).  When Uncharted 2 came out I dove right in.  The story was bigger with the set piece moments even more grand and thrilling.  Uncharted 3 continues our story of Nathan Drake and company traveling through London, Cartegena, Syria, and into the vast desert of the middle east.  The story is compelling and exciting, but the gameplay feels very familiar.Story: 4/5 - Naughty Dog never fails to deliver a compelling narrative.  I enjoyed learning more about Drake and Sully's background.  The treasure hunter story is fairly routine, but is still exciting.  Discovering each clue led more insight into Sir Drake's expedition and was fascinating to see everything unfold.  The story often had big set piece moments as well delivering extremely exciting moments (aboard the plane is one of my favorites and certainly stands out).  However, I did get tired of the recycled trope of \"the bad guys are always one step ahead of us!\".  While it drives the narrative forward, it did feel a bit too much like Deus Ex Machina in this instance.  There were several instances where it didn't even make sense for the enemies to be there before Drake and Co.  Yet, they were still able to find it before them.  It made me wonder, at times, why Drake was even needed at all.  Like any Hollywood Summer Blockbuster, you'll need to suspend disbelief at times.  I was happy to see the Drake/Elena make a return as well - as it's one of my favorite pieces of the Uncharted story.  It helps keep Drake believable and human.Gameplay: 4/5 The gameplay was overall very solid with a few minor gripes.  Moving was easy, though at times turning or trying to shoot an enemy would result it firing right past them or the wrong way, causing frustration.  It was fairly easy to run, jump, roll and find cover.  Hitting the right angle of cover was problematic though, especially when trying to do so at a corner or with a pillar.  I'd often find myself running out the wrong way or butting up next to the side of the wall facing the enemy, meaning I got gunned down quickly.  Luckily, for every cheap death, the game thrusts you back in close to where you die.  Most of the time it wasn't a problem, though sometimes it was far enough back that I was irritated having to play the same difficult map out again (I had my difficulty at normal by the way).The actual story follows a very linear path with real room for change.  A little alcove or corner here and there yields a treasure, but this is mainly a walk here, run here, jump here exercise.  This greatly reduces the replayability of the single player as there is nothing else to experience other than harder/tougher enemies.  Picking up new weapons is easy and each class handles differently but also as expected (handgun vs shotgun vs assault rifle etc).Enemies have a few different varieties, with some being heavy weapons experts with high armor, heavily armored shotgun wielders, thugs who wield rifles, handguns or rocket launchers, and the ever annoying big hand to hand guys.  Most of the time I used a similar strategy against all of them, but when the hand to hand guys get thrust in, they take time and quick reactions to counter and kill.  Even though some are wearing trousers and a t-shirt, it's like they have thick body armor on - sometimes requiring multiple shotgun shells being pumped into them before finally dying and that's also after I stunned them several times.  I appreciated the variety in the beginning, but the enemies stayed the same throughout the entire game so it felt stale by the end.  Hand to hand combat worked pretty well though, and I found myself using it (even at inopportune times like in the middle of gun fight) quite often.  I had little problem navigating the environment or climbing/jumping to where I needed to go.  There were a few chase scenes where I got turned around due to the camera angles, but was able to navigate the correct path the second or third times.Audio: 5/5 - The cast is top notch, with Nolan North bringing his fantastic chops to bring Nathan to life.  The sound was done very well and the music fit the theme perfectly as well.  Not much to complain about here.Visuals: 5/5 - While there were a few muddy textures, overall the characters, locations, guns, and other textures looked fantastic.  This certainly is one of the better looking games on the PS3, definitely in my top 10.  I have no gripes and experienced no glitches or texture popping or frame rate slow down.Online: I haven't tried the online, personally.  I've heard good things, but I am not much of a competitive multiplayer person.  It's there and there is also a co-op option as well.  I may check this out later.Overall: 4/5 - Despite some minor gripes, this is a great addition to the Uncharted franchise.  With big set piece moments and a tried and true formula, it's definitely a thrilling experience.  The linear story and exploration means there isn't much reason to revisit the single player campaign (except for trophies).  Despite annoying enemies, the combat is fluid and fun.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has has enjoyed the first two Uncharted entries.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Karl Grosvenor","summary":"Incredibly poor","reviewText":"I downloaded the Demo of this game on Xbox live and was so looking forward to it as I enjoyed the previous game so much,but this game is seriously lacking in many ways,the guns seam weaker than before with even fewer Ammunition and the Enemies are tough, then to make matters worse the controls are incredibly bad and are  the worst ever even Resident evil one beats it on this count,it's like having both hands tied behind your back and your shoe laces tied together,what another wasted potential,avoid this at all costs unless you like getting really wound up.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Great Game....","reviewText":"COD World At War is a great game, I personally think it is a good follow up to Modern Warfare, however i still think going back to WWII is a bad move for the \"Call of Duty\" franchise. But again the COD isn't in any danger with this new installment. Infinity Ward (the ones dat made modern warfare) didn't do this one, Treyarch (da ones dat did COD 3) created this one but still has the same feel as Modern Warfare.The campaign is great but not as great as Modern Warfare. There are missions that vary from running and gunning to mobile tanks, or shooting a gunnary from and airship, all in all the campaign is good and definetly beats Call of Duty 3's campaign by miles. After you beat the game there is a NAZI ZOMBIES mode where your in a house with killing all the zombies that you can before you die. This mode a fun added extra to the game and is definetly fun w/ co-cp. The multiplayer is basically da same as COD4 with barracks, challenges, class customizations, level-up rankings w/ prestige, perks etc. The only real difference is the addition of mobile vehicles such as tanks.GAMEPLAY - the gameplay is the same, but dats not a bad thing. The controls are perfect, the enemies are pretty smart, your comrads however are not, but overall gameplay is good. 9/10GRAPHICS - World At War uses the same graphics engine as COD4, and the lushious vegetation, smoke effects and character models are beautiful. In full HD, you can't help but appreciate the beauty of this game. The explosions are epic and the gory blood when people are killedare juicy and gruesome. haha I LOVE IT!!! 10/10SOUND - one word...INCREDIBLE. It feels like your really at the battles of WWII. The voice actors are believable and the overall atmoshpere is great. 10/10MULTIPLAYER - Awesome!!! if you love the multiplayer from COD4 den you'll love this. 10/10Bascially world at war isn't a new game, but more of an expansion of some sorts from COD4, but i still think the game is great. I recommend you buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

Huge, gorgeous scenery, atmospheric and fast - there was nothing like it for many years. When UNREAL II: THE AWAKENING came out I could not wait to get my hands on it - only to be hugely disappointed. The new game had been graphically improved yet the UNREAL character was replaced by a bland and generic FPS feeling.The DIABLO series enjoyed a similar, well deserved, success. HELLGATE: LONDON was released by the creators of DIABLO - leaving a similar unsatisfied aftertaste I am afraid.Don't get me wrong, this is a good game. However, a slight disappointment is inevitable for a game that tries to do everything: provide a 40-hour single-player FPS; double as an action-cRPG; and serve as a subscription-MMORPG (with at least two pay-grade classes: First & Standard) at the same time. Trying to please everybody, well, ends up falling short. They did put in a solid effort; however, in the end, both FPS and action-RPG fans will find the game wanting.FPS-wise HELLGATE:LONDON is slow (by the way, the perspective is adjustable from FP to TP and back) and the character movement feels forced. The weapons are inventive and impressive. Monsters and demons appear all over (popping from places that surprise you) and are dynamically-generated - as are the maps, every time a new game is started (adding to the game's replayability). Yet the rhythms are nowhere near those of a true FPS. There are tight moments but no high-speed tension.I guess that is the price of creating a single player game and aiming at the MMORPG market at the same time (trying to avoid lag-time).As a cRPG, HELLGATE: LONDON fares somewhat better. It is not the first time, of course, to come upon a First Person cRPG (the classic ULTIMA series introduced this). Nevertheless, HELLGATE: LONDON manages to convey the DIABLO feeling from the FP perspective beautifully! The multitude of sold or looted items alone is staggering! Everything seems to be customizable and appears on the character. A nice touch is that unwanted items can be broken down to their raw materials - which can then be used in either crafting new items or enhancing existing items at a vendor. Thus, an item well beyond the one you are currently using can yield material capable of enhancing it. Similar to TITAN QUEST, creating unique items using a mold is also possible.There are three factions: Templars (aka: Knights), Cabalists (aka: Mages) & Hunters (aka: Rogues), with numerous subclasses, all capped at level 50.Graphically the game is crisp and clear but not cutting edge. The graphics are comparable to HL2 and QUAKE4 (3 year old games). The surfaces, the textures, the reflections and the weather effects are beautiful, and they are designed for BOTH DX9 and DX10! I cannot comment on DX10 (as I am running WinXP) however, for DX9 I have no complains - I encountered only some stuttering and the system demands are reasonable.What is concerning is EA/FLAGSHIP's emerging intentions to charge for this game piece-meal. Since this is a heavily OnLine-oriented game, having the latest \"installment\" will be a necessity in order to survive and compete effectively.The multiplayer offers a number of choices: free (with limited gameplay capabilities, such as leading a guild), Standard monthly fee (for additional content such as new areas, more classes, weapons,quests, and game modes) and First Class monthly fee (premium content). It may seem a good decision on boardroom papers, however, I doubt that this...cast system will sit good with the MMORPG crowd. Imagine building a character exactly as you want him for, say, six months, only to have him wiped by a rich n00by with premium weapons...Yeah, that will work miracles in building your fan-base...So, for someone buying the game mostly for its multiplayer, be warned: $[...] is NOT all you will have to pay (yes, even if you opt not to subscribe for the unrestricted gameplay).All in all, A GOOD GAME, a solid effort to mix-and-match different genre that falls just short of its raised expectations.PS:There is a major storyline objection: presenting Templar Knights and Freemasons as the saviors of humanity is as absurd as describing Nazis as \"cosmetic products manufacturers\". Some things cannot be spinned I am afraid. Now, I did not take this into account in rating this game since no one is taught history by video games...is he?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2007"}

Screen tearing and a lot of terrible textures. It's almost as if they had a good start and then were forced to rush during the polish process.  The controls were also clunky and loose.  That could've also had something to do with playing it on the PS3. (I've always hated the playstation controllers but hoped for some better graphics on the PS3. Easy PS fanboys, I'll stick to the review now.)  Anyway, this is def a game to own and play through due to the story alone.  But with the clunky controls and sloppy textures, it's not worth even a $50 price tag. At most this is a $25 game.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"DJ Hero Hits All the Right Notes","reviewText":"== Inro ==Rhythm games have come a long way since the excellent Parappa the Rapper and Samba de Amigo.  The genre saw further advancement with Amplitude and Elite Beat Agents, but it wasn't until Guitar Hero that rhythm games really took off.  Unlike previous games, Guitar Hero successfully emulated real musical performance.  While Samba de Amigo and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat had simulated simple pieces of percussion, Guitar Hero let players feel that they were not only part of the performance, but almost playing real music - music they had grown up listening or were playing regularly on their iPod.  Now that both Harmonix's Rock Band and Activision's Guitar Hero have fleshed out the full rock group experience, Activision has ventured into new territory with their franchise, looking to further expand this exploding market.The difference between performing music and merely playing along is a major distinction.  Thanks to its sleek and solid turntable, DJ Hero lands on the right side of the line.  Playing DJ Hero feels more like an art than a button-pressing frenzy.  The exceptional selection of songs* and quality of mixes is what really opens up this game.  When you are playing on Hard or Expert level, you'll feel rewarded for your efforts by your score as much as the music blasting from your (hopefully 2.1 or higher) sound systemm.  If you aren't familiar with mixing or DJing, you'll certainly gain an unfound appreciation for it.== Presentation ==Based on the Demo Kit*, DJ Hero features a polished interface on par with other Guitar Hero games.  Character models look great and the rendered crowds and performers help bring the game to life.  Only one venue was available in the demo release.  Activision nailed the most important part of presentation - what would be the Note Highway in Guitar Hero.  In DJ Hero, it should probably be called the Effect Highway.  The effects are bright and colorful, coming in either green, red or blue along similarly colored paths and corresponding to the same colored buttons on your turntable peripheral.  They are clear and easy to follow even when in a heated frenzy, which is comes often on the harder settings thanks to the many types of effects you'll have to pull-off.  The demo kit was missing any system settings, which I assume will include compensation for input lag in the retail version.== Gameplay ==DJ Hero is immediately a fun and unique experience.  There is a short tutorial that will get you up to speed very fast.  In fact, you might find yourself breezing by easy and onto medium within a couple sets.  Those quick to learn and already skilled at other rhythm games might even find Hard to be the right level of challlenge after just a few days moving up the learning curve.  Yet it should take even the best players a while to move on to Expert.Some intelligent choices were made to prevent frustration with the turntable at any difficulty setting.  Scratch moves, done while holding a button down and rotating the turntable, are easy to get the hang of.  For most scratching, you are able to rotate the table at any speed, rate and direction.  This is especially welcome if you want to add a little style to your spinning - for example, on a long scratch, you can easily pull a 360 on the turn table.  You can also turn the table at will when its not when required.  Another potentially frustrating mechanic is the crossover fader.  It has only three positions (Left, Right and Center) with a notch in the middle so you'll learn quickly to finesse the crossfader instead of blowing by the center position accidentally.  Unfortunately the overdrive button - \"euphoria\" (at least they didn't call it ecstasy), responsible for activating a 2x score multiplier, is located just far enough from the crossfader to make it a pain to get used to.The amount of freedom of expression is as limited as in Guitar Hero.  Any mistake will interfere with the music causing annoying buzzing or other grating effects.  It would have been amazing to have the freedom to \"mess up\" on what you're supposed to be doing but have the game mix the music in realtime according to your incorrect inputs.  As it is, you're limited to choosing between a handful of sound fx for when you are scratching with the red button.  It's similar to your choice of overdrive effect in rock band.In addition to the main gameplay mode and the expected turntable vs. turntable  2 player mode, DJ hero throws in turntable vs. guitar mode.  The tracks for this mode are seperate from the main set list and feature a guitar track on top of the mix.  Although this means you won't have acess to a wide library of selections to play in this mode, it ends up making this mode much more than a gimmick.  Difficulty can be selected seperately for guitar and turntable with the guitar playing just like in the Guitar Hero games.  In the Demo, the settings were forced to no fail, so expect to at least see that as an option.  This is a great solution for two kids fighting to play Guitar Hero and DJ Hero on one system.== Conclusion ==While rhythm games have yet to offer players a genuinely creative and expressive experience, DJ Hero succeeds by following Guitar Hero's lead of basing a game entirely off of real-world performers.  Anyone with an appreciation for spinning and mixing or a new twist on the rhythm genre should seriously check out DJ Hero.  While it may be a significant investment due to the peripheral, you are getting a highly polished and unique game.  It manages to justify a bundle price tag thanks to its excellent perhipheral and library of 100* songs (mixed into 80 tracks), none of which has been featured in a prior Guitar Hero game.*This review was based on the DJ Hero Demo Kit, which may have omitted some features and most of the songs available in the full retail version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

I haven't even played Uncharted yet because I've had so much fun playing this game. The game takes place in 1944 LA and the graphics are so real looking that it is amazing. I remember the first video games my Dad hooked up, Pong - I can't believe that video games look like this now.L.A. Noire is a very fun game to play and there is so much to do in the game. I love the option of skipping a section if you can't manage to pass it. With some of the shooting sequences or driving, I have a little trouble and I either have to give the controller over to my teenage daughter, or I can actually skip the hard parts if I can't pass them. I have played so many games with sections that I can't pass that I stop playing and I really like this option. You also can drive all kinds of old cars - being the police, you can take over any car on the street and drive all over old time LA. The driving does take a little getting used to - you take out a lot of lamp post and fences at first. I enjoy driving around L.A. and visiting crime scenes and gathering clues. There are side crimes to solve as well as big cases and you get promoted if you do a great job. Each case earns you trophies and promotions and maybe even a new suit! Sometimes the interrogations are a little tricky and the right answers seem obscure, but that is my only complaint. The action is good, the story is great and the game playing is really fun and unique. Especially if you like noire.All in all, I love this game and totally get lost in it when I play.

{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Great game bad reputation","reviewText":"It's hard discussing homecoming. It is a game that has come with its' fair share of controversy. The reviewers who supported the game said \"If you are a SH fan you should enjoy homecoming\". How premature and short sighted that  statement actually was. Sadly many of the most \"hardcore\" thus \"jaded\" Silent-Hill-Heads didn't like Homecoming. You could say many of them decided to hate it even before the game came out. However I'm a bit proud to say while I love SH I never took the franchise too seriously. I enjoyed every title for different reasons and I own every game but the very first one. (I even have the port of origins for the PS2)Moving on I'm going to address the main complaints people had with the game and debunk them one by one.Complaint # 1 The game burrowed too much from the movie.Homecoming burrowed aesthetics from the SH film. However before the whining crested to the highest wave of angst many people actually said the film was one of the best game to movie adaptations + the costume designs and creature models were actually very faithful to the games. In lu of that the same can be said of homecoming....the creatures capture the spooky haunted atmosphere of SH perfectly. In truth the only few nods to the film are the shift to the otherworld, nurses, order cultists, and Pyramid Head. The rest of the creatures are 100% original and the story line has nothing to do with Alessa's alternate self Sharon or any of the main protagonists and antagonists from the film. If you are expecting to see Rose and Cybil Bennet running around you are in for a shocker because they are NOT in Homecoming.The plot concerns itself with Alex Shepherd and his desperate search for his younger brother Josh. On the surface this may seem like a repeat of the Cheryl/Harry dynamic but  as we've grown to expect the story takes a turn for the weird later on. In many ways  the revelations are more akin to SH 2 than SH 1. While The Order is present the big chunk of the story centers around Alex's troubled home-life and the mystery of what is going on with his younger sibling.  It is hinted Alex was the \"black sheep\" of Shepherd's Glen and both of his parents always put Josh first. There is a disturbing and sickening reason behind all that but I'm not going to spoil it for you here.The supporting cast are all original characters. (Except a cameo appearance from Travis Grady) Judge Holloway is the mother of Alex's child hood friend Elle and she's eerily  calm despite everything going on. Deputy Wheeler worked with Alex's father who was the sheriff and is a bit suspicious of Alex's motifs. Alex's mother is in a dream like state and sways in her rocking chair while mumbling about being left all alone. There is also the Mayor and the repair man Curtis who are abrasive and paranoid to say the least. Of all the faces Alex encounters Elle seems the most helpful. She is putting up posters in the town about disappearances  but is a little wistful Alex left Shepherd's Glen without telling her. Homecoming finally addressed adding more people to interact with and furthermore how you respond to them has a direct impact on the game. While it can be argued this has been done before in other mediums of digital entertainment it is a welcome change and very befitting of a SH experience.From all this it's easy to debunk SH homecoming is a complete rip off of the movie. It tells its' own tale.Complaint #2 Alex is too combat capable!Fans have argued being a helpless average person is the big appeal of a Silent Hill game. However in truth none of the protagonists have been powerless. In each game there were weapons to find. Heather's trade marks are the uzi and katana and event scrawny James got his mits on a chainsaw. SH 4 the room introduced a way to charge attacks so they did more damage per swing and Travis could throw televisions and toasters at oncoming beasties.Alex is not far removed from his past cohorts. He can roll or dodge out of harms way and much like Henry Townsend he has fast yet weak attacks and strong yet slow attacks. Alex can get guns but as is tradition with SH his first few tools of pain are a simple combat knife and a lead pipe. Beyond that I have not seen anything super-human about Alex. In the beginning he takes out weak enemies easily but later on as more disturbing, grotesque, and lethal monstrosities are encountered  he has to struggle to gain the advantage and as has always been the case sometimes it is better to run than it is to fight.One nice nuance is every weapon has a use to aid Alex is exploring. An axe can cut down boards, the knife can slash apart paintings or other obstructions, and the pipe can pry things open.Homecoming suggests Alex has military training but even that aspect of his past is a little questionable. Bottom line is Alex is no Chris Redfield. Verdict? Complaint debunked.Complaint # 3 Homecoming Americanized Silent Hill!Considering Team Silent was motivated by Lost Highway, Jacob's ladder, and even The shining there was a western influence to the series from the very beginning. It is true there were Japanese themes that slipped in. For example Alessa's story is about reincarnation. However beyond that even the deities in silent hill have similarities to western spirituality. Valtiel is based on the angel Valet. James' wife is hauntingly similar to the virgin Mary. Alessa is metaphorical of being akin to a female Christ. The Order sect had rites which were a cross between Native American shamanism and Catholicism.Fans have often argued SH favored symbolism over gore. But honestly SH has always been about symbolism through the use of gore. Heather rejected God by coughing up a dead bloody baby fetus. Pyramid Head raped mannequins and slaughtered Maria many times over. Walter Sullivan murdered people to enact rites to bring his mother back to him. Vincent suggested the \"things\" Heather was beating to death were actually people. Silent Hill was always a twisted, maddening, sick, graphic, and disgusting carnival of flesh and blood. This did not begin with Homecoming though the latest installment is guilty of continuing to flaunt unsettling imagery.My only critique is Homecoming's blatant use of dead corpses. There are some places you find bodies where it is unnecessary and their presence does not do much to make the game scarier.Overall despite the occasional poorly executed shock tactic Homecoming still has many layers of depth.  There is less of a difference between western horror and eastern horror than the elitists care to acknowledge. Both parts of the world have their deep and profound scary movies and their shallow bloody titillation torture flicks. Occasionally a chilling endeavor will have a little of both of those aspects woven together but because no one really gets hurt I don't see what the big deal is. \"Fear\" is universal to us all and no place on the earth capitalizes on \"doing it better\" than everyone else.End Verdict? If you think all western horror is like Saw or Hostel I strongly suggest seeing stir of echoes, Stephen King's It, 6th sense, or any David Lynch offerings. It was the meaningful western horror Team Silent was inspired by. Double Helix is an American group but they continued team silent's proud tradition. Homecoming is not all Boo scares or slasher stupidity.  It's merits should be considered as much as its' fleeting flaws.Complaint # 4: The creatures play on kinky innuendo or are plain meaninglessPyramid Head does have a meaning in homecoming. It actually ties a bit into the \"executioners of the past\" story line but he is referred to as the boogie man. Certain SH buffs were angry over this description though his title as \"red pyramid thing\" wasn't much more eloquent. This was a fan service everyone clamored for after SH 2 but they seemed pretty damned disappointed once they finally received it. As the proverb says \"careful what you wish for...you just might get it!\". Frankly this version of Pyramid head is not as deeply metaphorical as the one that was James' personal tormentor. Yet if you pay attention to much of silent hill's lore that is open  to interpretation there is no denying \"creatures\" or \"men\" whom looked like Pyramid Head did exist before James' variation of him came into being. Because PH was also present in the SH arcade shooter it is doubtful he was meant to be a one hit wonder.The second huge beef of the bestiary are the nurses. Yes, they are the movie variants. However those versions were in fact inspired by SH2. End result? We get SH 2 nurses with bigger breasts. Yet for those  protesting too much \"sexy nurse monsters\" were in SH 3 too. SH 1 featured red clad barely legal nurse intern Lisa Garland. Lest we forget The Room even had a kinky nurse costume un-lockable for Eileen. \"Nurses\" have constantly been a symbol of sexual tension and hidden murderous intent for the series so blaming double helix for exploiting them is ludicrous. SH 2 was entirely about James hidden naughty fantasies and denial issues.  Eroticism always snuck into Silent Hill through the back door so we should come to terms with it already!Luckily there are many \"original\" monsters too.  The lurkers have worm like lower bodies, human torsos, and clawed fingers. Smogs writhe in agony as their organs glow menacingly while they attack by spewing toxic fog. There are also \"dog beasts\" referred to cryptically as \"Eddie's legacy\". The biggest complaint people have brought up is the monsters do not spawn from Alex's own psyche. This is an instant comparison of SH 2 but  the creatures in other games were not the result of the protagonist either. In SH 1 the creatures were from Alessa's imagination instead of Harry's thoughts. In SH 3 Heather was fighting monsters who were either twisted members of the order or manifestations of her other self whom wanted to prevent the god from being reborn. In SH 4 the denizens reflected victims of the cult as well as the people murdered by Walter Sullivan.  The only other game that spawned terrors from the mind of the hero was \"Origins\" but some of them were Alessa's too.By comparison the creatures in Homecoming represent the twisted mythos of silent hill in general and many of them are the legacies left over by other characters in the past who found themselves trapped in the town. That's right. There is reason to the rhyme.Why do other people see the monsters?One complaint was because every main character in SH can see the monsters it is not as personal of a journey to the main protagonist. However I think fans have forgotten more than one individual saw the monsters in other games too. Dr. Kaufman saw the monsters in SH 1 and was even dragged off by Lisa who was becoming a type of \"damned denizen\" herself. In SH 2 James finds a bloodied letter on the ground of a victim's diary chronicling the sightings of monstrosities.  Douglas mentions seeing creatures in SH 3 when talking to Heather. In SH4 the room Henry had to lead Eileen around by the hand and protect her from the things lurching towards them. Bottom line is it's a weak argument to claim Silent Hill can only effect one person  in any given story arch. The opposite is actually proven to be the case.The game is too hard!There is some logic behind this argument. SH homecoming is not a forgiving survival horror game. Both the bosses and standard creatures are tough and you will die many times even on the normal setting. Every monster has patterns and weak spots but exploiting them takes practice.Do not fret! With perseverance you will get further into the game. The good thing about this game's difficulty is it is not hard because the odds are unfair.....rather it is hard because it demands you think hard about your combat strategies. Going into a fight haphazardly swinging is not the way to survive. Every monster is strong and weak versus different weapons and their movement patterns have to be observed meticulously if you want to hit them in the proverbial soft spot or weave around their attacks.I actually agree with other gamers on this one. Homecoming is very frustrating on certain occasions even though thankfully it is not impossible. Personally for me this challenge is what makes it a more genuine survival horror experience.The characters don't act in accordance with what is going onIt is true some of the characters in homecoming act odd. Judge Holloway carries on normal routines as if nothing is out of place. Curtis sits in his shop idly fixing things. However as the story rolls on we learn this menagerie of \"Cool faades\" are gradually cracking and by the time Alex gets to the Mayor the man has completely lost it. Even in psychology studies show people occasionally handle shock and trauma by either ignoring their circumstances or continuing tasks which make them comfortable. These are all adults living in a nightmare who were forced to give up something very precious to them. Why would they want to admit their beloved town has become the maw of hell itself? I thought Deputy Wheeler and Alex's mother acted very genuine to the situation right from the start. Wheeler opts to find answers and survive while Alex's mother is so messed up she is practically comatose. Homecoming expresses everyone copes with circumstances in their own special way and that is very accurate to real life.Do not forget what they said about SH 2 back in the day...you will be shocked !Instead of the brain-bending adventure with scares and gore that I had so desperately hoped for, it turned out to be a sloppy, monotonous bore that nearly put me to sleep.\" -- ~Game Informer\"Silent Hill 2's gameplay mechanics are no different than those of any other game ever slapped with the 'survival-horror' tag. You'll whack legions of the same four or so enemy types, using the same familiar array of blunt objects, pistols, and shotguns; get Medallions A, B, and C; put them in Statue D, which opens Door E; walk through Door E; repeat until numb. You'll fight awkward camera angles as much as freaky bad things... fans of the original will be disappointed that not much is new.\" -- GamePro\"The action, though, is simply repetitive, as even the most common creatures must be bludgeoned repeatedly to 'kill' them (and there are a lot of creatures).\" -- Next Generation\"The pacing can be a little languid at times, and the combat and movement controls could use some tweaking. Also, this game feels a little linear and lacking in extras when compared to the original.\" -- GameCritics\"Flawed, frustrating and contrived, but as an experience it's one of the most emotionally engaging games in existence.\" -- GamesRadar UK\"Silent Hill 2 doesn't break any molds or revolutionize the survival-horror genre in any particular way...\" -- IGN\"Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less-compelling game than the original... The game's storyline makes more sense in the end of this sequel than it did in the original, but unlike in that game, it never creates the pressing need to understand it in the first place.\" -- GameSpotMy point? You can pick apart even a master piece if you want to be over critical but why do that when it is more fun to actually enjoy a game despite its faults?Overall impression/ judgment: Normally I list pros and cons but I've taken up a lot of text already. The bottom line Homecoming IS Silent Hill worthy. Akira is still doing awesome music scores. The locales are still spooky and brimming with small details and obscure references to other games. The monsters are still terrifying. The story is solid. The voice acting is great. The game mechanics are improved.  To put it bluntly if double helix lied and said team-silent made the game I bet more than half of the people slamming it would have sung of its' praises instead.Overall grade: 5 out of 5 stars or a solid ACriticisms (and they are trite): My only complaints are too many random corpses and the faces were expressive yet at the same time a bit animatronic. (Aka the eye movements and lip animations  seemed stiff at times)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}

In fact it really started with a horrible version of Donkey Kong which I used to play on the Atari Video Computer System (aka VCS or 2600.)  I am almost embarassed to admit how much I enjoyed playing Nintendo's (and designer Shigeru Miyamoto's) newest game \"Super Mario Sunshine.\"  The game is not as revolutionary as \"Super Mario 64\" was.  Then again, it couldn't possibly be.  Mario is a platform run and jump game and should always be.  SM 64 broke the bonds of 2D side scrolling, to deliver us a new fangled 3D plumber that could move in any direction.  \"Super Mario Sunshine\" is to \"Super Mario 64,\" as \"Super Mario World\" on the Super NES was to all the previous NES versions of Super Mario Games (namely Super Mario Bros., SMB 2, and SMB 3).  That is to say that it improves upon the already established mechanics of its predecesors.  O.K. already... onto the game.  Mario looks great, and for the most part, his environments do too.  Sporting some fantastic environmental water effects, and other effects such as the graphic in the distance experiencing some distortion due to heat, Mario has never looked better.  I have noticed that a common gripe about the game, is that the camera angles for viewing can be troublesome.  The camera is now a dynamic part of the control scheme, where as in SM 64, the camera could be adjusted manually, but was automatic.  YOU NEED TO CONTROL THE CAMERA IN SM SUNSHINE MANUALLY!!!  Get good at it too, because it will help you.  I really enjoyed this new aspect, as I felt even more in control of the little plumber than ever before.  Now the bad stuff.  There are very few criticisms I have of this game.  One is that there is a really lame level in the game called Sirena Beach.  This level simply doesn't belong in the game.  The \"world\" is very small compared to the other ones and is not very fun.  For some reason there is a sunset here all the time.  The environmental graphics are the least impressive in all of the game, and I found myself wanting to rush through, just so I wouldn't have to play it any more.  Now set that aside, and the rest of the levels (\"worlds\") are very impressive.  My favorite level graphically was Noki Bay wich simply has to be seen.  All of the levels (except 1 ;-)) were fun in their own right.  Sound in the game is super, with island themed tunes keeping the mood very well.  I have to mention the water pack, FLUDD.  It is an awesome new feature.  It is fun and the attatchements for it make the game more enjoyable.  Mario is more mobile than ever.  The best compliment I can pay this game is that it is a worthy new game in the Mario lineage. Here's to hoping that we don't have to wait such a long while for our favorite plumber to return.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2002"}

Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"It's-a not me!","reviewText":"Mario has, since the days of the N64, taken a nosedive in regards to general game quality, and Super Mario Sunshine is perhaps the best example of this.  Though the graphics and sound are far superior to the ones seen in the old days (despite the strange shading,) the game itself has suffered.First off, the game is marginally insulting if taken allegorically.  The people of Isle Delphino seem like nothing more than a spoof on Americans.  Loud, annoying, overweight, coming in a variety of &quot;strange&quot; colors and completely unable to solve their own problems.  Just the kind of things a Japanese man would mock about America, especially since Isle Delphino bears a more than passing resemblance to Hawaii.But more importantly, the game's summary reads like your laundry list of afternoon chores.  Mario's gameplay used to revolve around &quot;Get the Fireball Power, Kill the Bad Guy, Invade the Castle, Save the Princess, etc...&quot;  Now, it's &quot;Water the Plant, Save the Animal, Clean the Wall, etc...&quot;This is, by and large, a problem that ALL recent Nintendo games (except Metroid Prime, of course,) have suffered from.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect.

At first, I felt frustrated, trying to find various items and even the temples.  I would just wander around, never finding anything.  Once I got the hang of it, I started to have a lot of fun.Part of the game is played above ground and part is played underground in temples.  I actually find myself liking the above ground parts better than the temple parts.  There are a multitude of characters to talk to and run errands for, with often funny outcomes.  For instance, one mission is to give someone a \"spa.\"Some of the side quests are time limited, in that they have to be completed before you complete a temple.  I recommend looking at a walk through just so you don't miss the side missions.  I didn't realize just how much I was missing until I checked a walk through.In both the temples and the above ground world, there are enemies to defeat.  As you play, you have opportunities to upgrade your swords. You can also get new swords, some of which are funny and unique.As you go through the game, you have to collect certain items, such as arrow, candles, or bombs to make it through the temple sections.  The temple enemies tend to be more difficult than the above ground enemies and I found myself dying over and over in the same difficult rooms.  This can be frustrating, since you have to start over at the beginning of the temple after each death.  On the other hand, the temples aren't too difficult over all.Another aspect of the game I like a lot is the mini-games.

Recently, though, I've wanted to get back in to the Halo series and see how Mass Effect plays, and so I bought an Xbox 360.  I sub sequentially bought around 6 Xbox 360 exclusive games and installed them all, playing briefly for about a half hour to get a feel for them.  To my amazement the only one that immediately stood out and caught my interest was Fable 2.  Fable 2 fast became my new favorite game and ranks up there with my other favorites in Assassin's Creed 2, Uncharted and Fallout 3.Right away you get a feel for the medieval look and the vibrant colors that bring the game to life.  The opening prologue, you as a child with your sister, draws you in and quickly makes you want to keep playing.  Soon enough you embark on your quest to be a hero.  As you traverse from village to village you run in to the highway men and the ruffians, giving you a chance to practice your skills and decide whether you prefer to use magic, melee or range weapon, or a combination of all three.  This was one of the aspects that I liked about this game, the ease that you can use your various attack modes.  As you gain experience you begin to decide where your hero's strengths lie, or whether you are a good hero or a bad one.The pros.  The vibrant colors bring this game to life and make you feel a part of something unique.  The villages and towns are alive as you interact with the villagers.  I personally like being able to purchase buildings and gain an income, and to have them continue to gain an income, though at a slower rate, while you are not playing.  Your dog is another great addition to the game.  He/she flows so smoothly through trails and on roads that he seems more real than a fake computer dog.  After a while I loved running around and having the dog yapping away to tell me where a treasure is or growling when enemies are near by.  The storyline is unique and the expressions are fun to use in the towns to get a response from the villagers.The cons.  There aren't too many in my eyes.  The \"open\" landscape isn't really open, with oftentimes very limiting factors that make some parts of the world very linear.  The map system is very clunky and almost useless.  There seems to be no point in ever using the map.  Your inventory is a little cumbersome to get through and use, especially since you have to keep going back in to your inventory after you use an item and start all over.Overall I found this to be one of my all time favorite games.  I was drawn in immediately and couldn't help waiting to play some more.  All in all I got about 30 hours of play time in, although there seemed to be plenty of stuff to do after I beat the game.  One disappointing aspect of the game is that you can't enter Fairfax Castle till you beat the game and can come up with the $1 million to purchase the building.  I found that the castle was one of the more interesting aspects of the game and wished that this could have played more of a central role with my character.  In fact the castle seems like an after thought as it isn't furnished too well and there isn't much going on with it, but it was still fun to run around.A definite recommend.5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2010"}

The nice thing is that this game provides a lot of backdrop compared to older installments of Zelda, and the graphics were really nice for that time, and still are today.There are a couple of parts of this game that are frustrating, but overall this game is really solid, and I've enjoyed it.

However with a guitar controller and cool rock songs.These are very innovative games as well as fun. It seems pricey at first but its so worth the 89 bucks I paid for it just for what you get outta it.

I can't wait to see other titles that will becoming along.  I had the choice to get this or the Aerosmith one with the guitar. I chose this I like to have a variety to chose from that way. I may down the road also pick up the Aerosmith one as well as I tend to be a bit of a collector and horder when it comes to things .I like the design of the guitar controller,the stickers they give you. The ability if you want to customize the guitar by ordering other faceplates.The songs they have on the game are ones I am famliar with both metal and hard rock some are kind of new to me I haven't heard. Its a good game for developing good cordination as well. Its just a rockin game and you'd have to pick it up don't shun  at the price believe me while its up there and to us having to pay almost 5 bucks a gallon for gas it can be pricey but I guess if you invest in this game you won't be sorry you did its so worth it being able to play a guitar in  your own living room and rock out to the songs you grew up with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2008"}

Your only means of protection are hiding, running and using your wits!Do you have what it takes to survive?","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A very unique and extremely scary experience","reviewText":"The Good: Frightening atmosphere, haunting ambiance, clever puzzles, great storyThe Bad: Puzzles can be obscure a lot of the times, no combat means action fans may turn away, some object hunting problemsThe survival horror genre is probably the fastest dying of them all, but it's games like Amnesia that really get the spotlight when they hit it home on the scare factor. Amnesia stays true to the genre, and this is due to the fact that there's no combat what-so-ever. Zero, zilch, nada you can't fight. If you see a creature you have to hide or run, and this is what adds to the tension. If you can fight you can just kill it, but if you can't then you have to really think about what to do, and can make you not want to continue.Amnesia may be a first person adventure game, but you're only weapon is light, and against your own insanity not creatures. Staying in the light is key, and oil for your lantern is as precious as 9mm ammo in Silent Hill. It's scarce, and you try to savor every drop or just use tinderboxes as an alternative. You can light candles, lamps, or any source of light to guide your way to preserve oil or if you run out. Daniel can see in the dark somewhat, but it's hard to solve puzzles like this.As your sanity slowly drains you will hallucinate, walk slower, the screen will distort, and creatures will hear you. Seeing traumatic scenes, can do this too, and also looking at creatures for too long. You will also lose sanity if you don't progress or solve puzzles so it keeps you on your toes, but don't worry I only encountered a couple of times where Daniel went totally insane and lost it. You'll more likely go insane from fright before he ever will.And that's the thing about Amnesia it frightens you with atmosphere, pacing, and tension from the environment instead of zombies popping out. The music and ambiance are haunting and it makes you paranoid through out the whole game. One scene had me in a room where I was picking up a letter and suddenly something started bashing down the door. I literally jumped and tried to find a place to hide. A wardrobe! I grabbed each door and swung them open and hid, and as I peeked through the crack Daniel started freaking out so I had to not look. I heard the creature breathing, moaning, and moving around and I was afraid it would start bashing down the wardrobe! It soon turned away and I could continue hunting for puzzle solutions, but was I ever so scared!The haunting story doesn't help either with you just waking up in a castle not knowing who you are. You read letters along the way trying to discover some orb, and trying to stop The Shadow from consuming you. I can't go into more detail because it will spoil the story, but it's very creepy and disturbing, and was well put together.The second part of the game are the puzzles. These vary from object hunting, physics, and pathfinding. I have to admit that Frictional has always been known for obscure puzzles, and some of the time I didn't know what to do and was completely clueless. You rarely get hints and this can lead to frustrating backtracking and pixel hunting so a FAQ needs to be handy. Other than that the puzzles were clever and really stuck to the story, and they all felt necessary.Amnesia is a horror classic and is even better than Frictional's Penumbra series. This game will scare the pants off of you, and even clocks in at a nice 6-8 hours, and has three different endings to see. I really hope for a sequel or another game similar because Frictional found the survival horror sweet spot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"S. Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"visually great, but awkward controls","reviewText":"This is the best looking game that I have seen on the 360.  It has highly detailed textures that barely beat out Ghost Recon.  However, those textures make it hard to see loose ammo/grenades unless they are in those large crates.  The framerates are smooth and the action is relentless.  I have only a couple of complaints.  First, the controls are different than any other shooter I've played on the 360.  The A button is used for almost every action and is context sensitive.  For example, A is used to run and when near a wall is used to hide behind it or jump over it etc.  In most shooters you push down on the analog sticks to use the rifle scope and crouch, but in this game you pull the left trigger to aim and there is no crouching unless you're near a wall.  Also, you have to use the D-pad to change to grenades and the aiming of them is cumbersome and slow.  I like the more standard approach of just pulling the left trigger to throw a grenade.  Gears uses a new reloading method that reminds me of swinging a golf club in Hot Shots for example.  You pull the right shoulder button to begin to reload and a progress bar starts to swing.  You then pull the button again when the bar is in the sweet spot to reload very fast.  If you miss the sweet spot you reload slower and if you really miss then the gun jams and it takes even longer to reload.  Its a nice detail that I hope other games will use.  Finally, this game is all avout action.  There is no stealth-its a run and gun shooter.  I prefer more subtle games like Ghost Recon, FEAR, and Call of Duty 2/3.  But everyone who owns a 360 must give this a try for the graphics alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2006"}

I did not have the pleasure of having played the original so I cannot compare it to that. I have however played GTA4, GTA3 through San Andreas, and many other open boxes like it, so I can compare it to those.Graphics: The graphics are not top notch, but I have no real complaint here. They are adequate and don't detract from the game experience. I can tell that things are what they are, there are no creepy disfigured heads like you might see in a bethesda game, so it is good enough for me.Gameplay: The gameplay is very similar to what you might face in San Andreas. The \"scope\" of the game has certainly been peeled back substantially. The only vehicles that you can use are bicycles, skateboards, and mopeds. The handling isn't great, but you won't be thrown off at every turn with half of your life gone like the GTAs. The university combines with several little towns to make the map you can travel around on, and in Traditional GTA fashion, the map gets unlocked 1/3 at a time as you play. They add emoticons allowing you to interact with people in your environment. This is quite nice, allowing you to grab and bully people, harass them, approve, or threaten them. It's reminiscent of the Fable series in that respect and does very well.Story: This is a major faltering for me. The story is essentially about a troubled boy sent off to a \"boarding school\" of sorts while his mom goes on a honeymoon with his new step dad. He possesses a lot of angst as a result of his rough upbringing. Through the help of a boy named gary, he ends up getting involved in clique wars. All of this is interesting and fine. What isn't is the cohesion in this story. Hint, it has none. Pretty much every mission in the game involves you being called to someones office, an event that happens completely off camera with no beepers/cellphones/text messages to tell you why you are going to this spot and starting this mission, or they occur as a result of you randomly walking by and getting pulled into something.In GTA games, it's usually a natural progression of things. Missions you do for this guy causes you to meet the next guy who in turn introduces you to the next guy. And when a friend you haven't quested for in a while wants to meet up, they send you a text, beep, ect... and say something. In this game, you just wonder to each other checkpoints, often based on time. All and all, the complete lack of cohesion really hurts and otherwise great story.Timing: This is a major gripe with the game, the day/night cycles. The first thing that is frustrating is that many many missions are timed based, so you can seriously be stuck for 4-5 hours (game time) waiting for a mission to repop up so you can do it. During the day you are required to attend classes, doing so prompts great bonuses and not doing so gets people searching for you for being truant. Then, you have a few hours and then you are up passed curfew and violating that. But wait, there is more. Assuming you are fine having to constantly dodge the teachers and cops, you will simply pass out unconscious if you stay up any later than 2ish. Prompting you to have to race back to a bed less you collapse in the street. Which is fine if sleeping in a bed saved the game as it should, but it doesn't. So to recap, about 3/4 of the day you are \"breaking the rules\" and will be chased down by anyone who sees you, and you pretty much HAVE to go to the bed every night for no reason other than cause you have to. The ONLY way to save is by logging it in a book near the bed, so no autosaves after missions.Glitches: I don't really care about visual glitches, and so far my game has never frozen completely, but even now, on the newest xbox system, on a hard drive installed version of the game, with all of the patches they have done over the years, the game still has significant slow down issues. This is especially frustrating during the dozens of minigames the game offers, I've had it happen during rhythm based games and completely lost as a result.Minigames: Loads and loads of them. It's one of the main things that GTA4 lost and I am glad this place kept. There are tons and tons of minigames, from \"mowing the grass\" to arcade games to dodge ball. They are all simplistic and I can't say any of them are as time consuming or engaging as Blitzball from FFX, but they are all mildly amusing and I don't think I was sick of any of them by the time the game was over.Other Annoyances: The other annoyances is that most of the other weapons you can get don't really do much. You'll be finding yourself always using the slingshot with it's infinite ammo, as the eggs are limited, the itching powder and stink bombs are practically useless, the firecrackers can occasionally help on a surprise, but once an enemy is running after you it is basically pointless, you will never get enough distance from them to really make use of it. So all and all the many options you can wield only come to play when filling specific mission criteria. Another annoyance is the shear number of people that run up to you demanding that you \"help\" them. A few is fine, but it's almost as annoying as the cellphone from GTA4, and you'll quickly find yourself ignoring them and their constant pleas for help, especially with a day so limited in time, where doing what they ask means missing out on your class/mission.The final \"annoyance\" comes down to the lack of replayability. In the GTAs, it used to be fun going crazy and ending up with 6 stars while you outrun/avoid swat trucks, tanks, and the army; or trying to make crazy leaps, or jumping out of an airplay and going sky diving. You get none of that here. You are just a single guy with fists, and if you warrant stars you either run and hide or face the consequences. Very little options in the ways of mayham here, and very little worth doing other than to acquire the 100% achievements.Overall: So overall it's a good game. It gets 3 stars for the complaints I have with it, but it still has a good story, fun gameplay, and some unique things. The social aspects and the capacity to bully people is really fun, and a feature I wish they'd add to GTA. The story and play is very unique and with the number of minigames it has it is well worth a try. I would definitely consider it if you can get it for cheap, but I wouldn't spend more than $10 on it at this point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2013"}

In fact, we have been a daddy-daughter team ever since she first played with me on Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2.  We have also played Super Mario Bros. Wii and others as well.When I first picked up Rayman Origins (which precedes this title), I knew very little about Rayman in general.  I picked up Rayman Origins for $19.99 as a Xmas present.  Little did I know what a hit it would be with BOTH of us.Rayman Legends follows in the same vein as our main, limbless protagonist, Rayman, is once again awakened to rescue the lumas and teensies from the denizens of a multitude of evil characters.  Rayman will need to jump, sprint, \"float\" (his ears will whip around like a helicopter), and punch his way to victory.  What makes the game even more fun is the ability to have up to 4 people play co-op at the same time, albeit only on the same console.  It's still sad that online support is inexplicably absent and it would have certainly encouraged other family members in other cities to purchase it and join in on the fun.  However, it's still an absolute blast.If you loved Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends will stagger you.  The sheer volume of unlockable content that is available will ensure the longevity of this title, especially for completionists like me.  However, like Origins, if you're into it just to beat the \"main storyline\", so to speak, the game does cater to that level of satisfaction for those of use who don't have the cat-like alacrity to nail every jump perfectly.  It's a game that can be enjoyed from both beginners to experts alike, and comical for all.Special mention should be made to the art direction and music.  Rayman Origins had beautiful visuals and Legends (despite being released almost on the heels of Origins) does not fail to disappoint either; I'd almost say that it exceeds Origins if it were possible.  I love how level design has moved away from an almost Mario-like stage progression map to a gallery of artwork that your character(s) hop into to get to the levels that you'll play.  The music fits the level designs perfectly and the cartoon-like artwork in each level is extremely fluid with no discernible framerate hiccups.  It's flawless as a platformer could possibly get and I can't spot a single element in this game that didn't appear to have a great deal of love and attention.  The same goes for the level design - everything that can be unlocked in the game is achievable without a single item feeling like a \"cheat\".  Truthfully, some areas require a significant amount of skill, but it's skill nonetheless--not poor level design--that will be your only hindrance for getting EVERYTHING.Rayman Legends is one of the few platformers out there that are worthy of the full MSRP release value.  While the online component is still sadly missing, there is still plenty of side-splitting, couch-sharing fun to be had here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Decently entertaining, but repetitive and overrated","reviewText":"Originally released at the end of 2007, BioShock is a first-person shooter which borrows some minor elements from roleplaying games. Created by some of the same team-members behind the popular and successful System Shock 2, BioShock was marketed as a 'spiritual successor' to that game. It achieved some critical acclaim after release, garnering extremely high scores from games review magazines.The game is set in 1960. A passenger aircraft crossing the Atlantic Ocean crashes in the sea 200 miles from Iceland. The sole survivor, a man named Jack, finds a lighthouse standing on an isolated island nearby. To his surprise, the lighthouse is the surface entry to a vast underwater city called Rapture. Built by wealthy industrialist Andrew Ryan a decade and a half earlier, Rapture was designed to be a city independent from any government or religion outside. After arriving in the city, Jack is contacted by a man named Atlas who tells him the city's society has fallen apart, and most of the inhabitants have gone mad and become genetically-mutated 'Splicers' who hunger only for 'ADAM', a material which can grant great powers to the wielders. Atlas convinces Jack to help him rescue his wife and daughter from captivity. Jack is also contacted by a woman named Tenenbaum, who explains that ADAM is produced by genetically-modified young girls named 'Little Sisters', and Jack can absorb ADAM from any Little Sisters he comes across. Tenenbaum urges Jack to spare the Little Sisters and set them free from the ADAM influence, whilst Atlas suggests that Jack kill them to gain a lot more and become more powerful. Jack's decision will determine the course of the rest of the game.BioShock plays pretty much as a standard first-person shooter. Jack can wield a large number of weapons, many of them with different types of ammunition for different circumstances. He can also use EVE (a weaponized form of ADAM) to power 'plasmids', which give him certain powers, such as the ability to hurl fireballs, shoot lightning out of his hand or levitate objects with his mind. Combat can be greatly enhanced by switching between plasmids and traditional weapons for different circumstances. The game dips its tools in the RPG category by giving out different quests and adopting a 'mission hub' structure for its levels, but without an active inventory system and an inability to talk to people (not to mention that every single person you randomly encounter in the game wants to kill you, with important NPCs only appearing behind bullet-proof windows or screens) this is not pursued much.BioShock has an interesting storyline and a philosophical streak to it, which asks questions about free will and determination. Whilst intriguing, it's explored in a considerably less compelling fashion than Planescape: Torment, and to anyone who's played that older game BioShock feels a bit lightweight (not to mention predictable: some plot twists are very close to those of that older game and some others as well). Of course, most modern gamers haven't, so kudos to 2K Games for trying something a bit more interesting than just the standard run 'n' gun action. Unfortunately, that action is somewhat lacking. Your character feels very 'heavy' for lack of a better word, and combat is sluggish and unresponsive as a result. For most opponents it isn't a problem, but for the Big Daddies (whom you have to kill to get to the Little Sisters) it can turn into a total nightmare as they can kill you with maybe three hits. It isn't until very late in the game that you get weapons powerful enough to make the task less frustrating. Also, and this is utterly enraging at the start of the game, if you die you have to wait whilst a brief unskippable sequence plays (where your character is revived at a re-lifing chamber, often located inconveniently distant from the place where you died) before you can hit re-load.BioShock has an offbeat and unusual story, and the art design of the game is different and often gorgeous, channelling the 'Americanapunk' vibe of the earlier Fallout games (and the more recent Fallout 3). The graphics are impressive throughout, with particularly good water and lighting effects. The more colourful palette of the game is also nice change from a lot of other modern 'gritty' FPS, and it's certainly admirable to encounter a game which actually has a purpose or theme to its plot beyond mindless violence. However, the game is nowhere near as revolutionary as it seems to think it is, combat is leaden and somewhat unsatisfying, the save/load system is frustratingly slow, the end-game boss is preposterously easy to defeat and the 'good' ending is corny.BioShock (***) is an entertaining game that passes the time, but all the magazine writers that gave it 95% were clearly smoking some very strong substances indeed. A sequel, BioShock 2: Sea of Dreams, will follow at the end of this year or the start of next.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2009"}

You get to choose from a variety of characters to represent yourself, then choose a costume. Each character has his or her own voice and movements. The moderator has unique sayings he makes about each character, too. You even get to choose what type of \"sound\" your buzzer makes.On to gameplay. There are a series of rounds, each different. Sometimes you just need to answer correctly and it doesn't matter if you take a long time. Sometimes your speed does make a difference. There are photo questions, reading questions, questions about science, modern movies, oldies songs, and everything else in between. Each round one of the players chooses the topic area so you can tailor the game to match your interests.The tracking on the controller is rather impressive. There are numerous times that one of us was in the range of 0.06 seconds behind the other and the system knew that. It really was a lot of fun to play. Sure, some of the character activities are \"silly\" - but that's typical in games like this.All in all, a great party game, and it certainly would be fun if you're a trivia buff and just want to play on your own.

Having read several positive reviews online I was hopeful.  Having spent 16 hours straight after getting this game, I was hooked.There really isn't much variety in units and buildings, but that's a good thing.  Following in the veins of WCIII, you don't get to choose which civilization you can take on the Single Players campaign.  You play through the boots of Arkantos (there are 3 missions where he is absent, though), a greek hero, but you spend around 10 missions each on Egypt and the Norse region, with the different gods and units of each.  Each mission you play is different then the ones you've already played, keeping the game fresh til the very end.  The difficulty level, however, is very daunting.  Never played easy mode, but the difficult mode is hardly fair.Although the God powers seem awesome, I played through the game using them only once in a while.

It's a first person adventure that has you running and sometimes gunning. Mostly, however, you'll be sliding and jumping. At first glance, Mirror's Edge should be an awesome experience. It can be, but there are a couple of things that keep it from reaching excellence.The story is told mostly through cutscenes in the game's unique art style. While the story itself is interesting, it probably isn't the reason you've really come to Mirror's Edge. The highlight is the gameplay, mainly because it's so unique.It can take a while to get used to gameplay mechanics used here. For the most part you'll be ducking, sliding and jumping all over the place. There's a bit of gunplay thrown in there, but it's quite clear that it isn't important (and being an expert on first person shooters won't give you an edge). You can also disarm your enemies and perform melee combat moves on them. It take a moment to get the timing of disarming right, but the game works with the player very well. You can slow things down, but most important, you want to go for disarming someone when their weapon flashes red.It may seem that with such open environments and worlds that Mirror's Edge would be difficult to know where you're supposed to go. Despite what it seems, Mirror's Edge is actually quite linear. More often than not it's pretty easy to see where you need to go. This is because the game often paints a red picture for you. If you need to scale a pipe or kick open a door, it's usually red. Getting through levels can be a test in trial and error, however. Momentum and speed is important in Mirror's Edge but so is timing and precision. You might find yourself missing several ledges because you were a little off in your timing or your angle. Some jumps can be difficult. Make no mistake about it, you'll probably die. When you get a good stride going, though, Mirror's Edge becomes immensely fun.In the long run, Mirror's Edge is actually a simpler game than you might expect. The first person perspective adds something to it as well. You'll find that when you need to run from your adversaries or even just disarming them, there's a thrill that the first person perspective adds that you wouldn't get were it in third person. This is also due to the movement of the camera and the fast pacing of the action. It's easy to feel a rush while playing.Without a doubt, the biggest strength of Mirror's Edge is easily its visual presentation. It's very unique, fluid and detailed. It fits the game perfectly. Even better may be the soundtrack. Nothing feels better than getting into a good stride while the game's music plays. It fits each and every situation really well.The only real problem is that the fun just doesn't last long enough. Mirror's Edge is an incredibly short game. The campaign is over in a flash. Luckily, there are some extras and you may even find yourself playing through the main campaign again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

The larger screen, when compared to the regular DS, is a welcome change. The controls feel good in my adult hands. I love that there is a little slot for a stylus. Having a choice of colors is great. I prefer the bronze color, as it allows the DS fit well among my other hardware (tablet and phone).It has an SD card slot, which is great for downloading software. Most DS titles are relatively cheap. However, this unit cannot play older Gameboy Advanced games as the original DS can.I only have two concerns. First, if the 3DS library grows to the point where I start to see titles there that I really want, I might have to sell this and upgrade. Second, the way the unit accesses the internet and user accounts is not as slick as what we find on the PS3 or Xbox 360. This is a problem with Nintendo's online services overall and not necessarily a knock against the DS, but it is something that I feel Nintendo should address.As is, I am having an absolute blast with this system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}

BO2 Rocks","reviewText":"Please disregard the CoD haters who bombarded this great game with 1 star.The thing I HATE about Amazon reviews is that people will rate a product/game/book 1-star JUST because they think the item is overrated.  If they were honest they'd admit that there's no way Black Ops 2 is a 1-star game.  Giving a product 1 star (the lowest possible rating) is basically saying \"This is the WORST product in this category\".  No honest person who owns Black Ops 2 believes that.  They may believe it's overrated.  They may believe another FPS (Far Cry 3, Battlefield 3, Dishonored, etc) is superior, but they don't honestly believe BO2 is one of the worst FPS games of the year.They don't.But because BO2 is incredibly popular they want to go against the grain.  They want to be different.  They basically troll.I can point to any amazing product and find 1 star ratings.  The Lord of the Rings?  War and Peace?  1 star ratings.  Some of the greatest literary and cinematic experiences of the 20th and 21st centuries receive 1-star ratings.  Again, 1-star means of the worst POSSIBLE quality.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't believe we're getting an honest opinion.  Instead of saying \"This isn't my cup of tea\" and simply giving the product 2 or 3 stars, they have to go full-on troll and give it 1 star.Anyway...Black Ops 2 is an amazing game.  I have barely touched campaign.  Most of my time is spent in multiplayer.  I'm not even a great player (K/D ratio 1.22), but I have a blast playing.  There IS a lot of strategy involved.  The people who don't think strategy is involved are the same people going 3-20.  When I first started playing my K/D was about 0.6.  It wasn't until I went into local multiplayer and spent a full 10 minutes running around each individual map that it started to improve.  There are serial campers but those people tend to 5-2, which isn't much fun.  In a match with decent players campers will be demolished because once I'm killed by a camper, I'm coming back to get the drop on him so he better find another camping point.  The people who are successful are successful because they use their head.  The ones who dismiss BO2 as twitch-happy spray & pray trash are almost certainly the people with sub 1.0 K/Ds.If I was getting demolished every single game I'd be mad enough to write a bad review too.That isn't to say that ONLY bad players don't like this game.  Of course not.  I'm sure there are decent players who simply don't care for BO2.  But anyone who calls BO2 shallow or a spray & pray game is NOT a decent player because you aren't going to have many good matches without learning the maps, outsmarting your opponents, and overall using your head.I'm not a great shot.  I'd say I lose more gunfights than I win.  I have a positive K/D (which is improving daily) because I learn the safest routes on my maps, I learn enemy tendencies, and I get the drop on people running around wrecklessly.Anyway, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Just don't base your opinion on the fact that you don't know what you're doing out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2013"}

Ego maniacs and know nothings wanting to prove they could do a review first I guess.Basically, this is the same game you have come to love - COD but with new missions. Nothing is really mind blowing or must have about this expansion pack.I bought this game on the 9/17/2004 at COMPUSA, installed it at 11PM on the 18th and within 4 hours on the 19th, I have finished the expansion pack.I really feel ripped off. $30 down the tubes almost.The missions are almost the same as before, infantry, blowing things up, driving a tank but some of the new battles are VERY fierce and challenging. You also get to play as a bomber gunner. There are some new weapons but nothing amazing. The flame thrower is cool but you really never get enough ammo or get the chance to use it under the right circumstances -  like flushing out a bunker!!The AI is the same. The graphics are the same. The mood/atmosphere is the same.The missions are still VERY scripted. Your men will not move forward until you do, they get in the way and will not move and block your shots still! The tanks won't go forward until you take heavy machine guns out...even though the tanks should provide infantry with firepower!!!Is this worth playing? YES. Is it worth $30.....barely.I would have paid $50 if they had made it longer and more in depth. Why not? The engine is already developed, the bulk of the work is done, now all you have to do is build the levels. I mean...I was done in 4 hours, on the Veteran difficulty setting!!! If I had to choose between spending my money on DOOM 3 or this, I would choose COD:UO. DOOM 3 is scary and edgy...and that is all. After the first level or so, scary gets old and you start looking for a good gameplay. COD:UO might be short but atleast it was thrilling.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2004"}

Journey as the prince in an expansive quest uncovering the mysteries surrounding the Sun Rune, the civil unrest and the dark intent of an unknown power in the greatest Suikoden saga yet!","reviewerName":"A. Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"Suikoden V brings the series back to great form","reviewText":"Konami's Suikoden series has been a fixture in the Playstation console systems since the PS1. While not as graphically beautiful as Square-Enix's Final Fantasy series of role-playing games, Konami's own Suikoden rpgs more than held its own in complexity of character development and storylines. These two factors have become something the Final Fantasy rpgs have really lacked since Final Fantasy VII. I would even say the Final Fantasy series hit its high-point in Final Fantasy VI and has been downhill since. Not so with the Suikoden series. From the beginning the series has beautifully combined characters and storylines to create a game that still uses the basic stats and experience mechanics of most Japanese RPGs but with a unique brand of npc recruiting and a wholly realized complex world which grows and reveals itself with each successive game in the series.In 2006, Konami released Suikoden V in North America and there were some trepidations on how well the game would turn out. The previous game in the series, Suikoden IV, was abit underwhelming in its execution. A rarity in the Suikoden series in that the game was just ok; with some fans calling it awful. But even Suikoden IV still played better and its story less cliche than most rpgs coming out of Japan. Suikoden fans needn't have worried about this latest entry in the series. Suikoden V doesn't bring anything new or innovating in terms of graphics to the genre (but then Suikoden games never has in the past) but what it did was bring back the series to the high-standard of character development and storyline the series was very well-known and critically-acclaimed for.Set six years before the events which played out in Suikoden I, Suikoden V takes places in the Queendom of Falena whose current Queen has in her possession the Sun Rune. The Sun Rune is one of the 27 True Runes which makes the backbone of what makes the critical events of the Suikoden Universe so unique to the role-playing genre. Queen Arshtat rules Falena with the Sun Rune but events prior to the beginning of the game (told in flashback) has set into motion a dangerous game of political machinations and powergrabbing between two powerful groups in the Houses of Barows and Godwins with the Sun Rune in the middle of it all.The player is given control of Queen Arshtat's only son to figure out just what sort of secret plans either Houses has in store for the Royals. Accompanying the player are Arshtat's sister Sialeeds, his bodyguard and lifelong friend Lyon, and Georg (a familiar face for those who have played the previous games in the series). As the game's story unfolds the complexity of the power struggle between Barows and Godwins and those of the Falenan Royal Family becomes more than a struggle for the realm of Falena but for its ultimate survival as something powerful and beyond human comprehension has slowly influenced those in close proximity. There's moments of extreme sadness and ultimate sacrifices and love. Machiavellian plots and counterplots from both the protagonists and antagonists keep the player guessing as to how the story will play out. There's also betrayals and genocidal actions which gives this entry to the series the dark edge the previous fourth Suikoden lacked.Unlike most JRPG's (Japanese RPGs), Suikoden V doesn't have an end-of-the-world storyline but one which stays regional, but makes the plot no less epic and actually gives the game more freedom in how the story unfolds. Suikoden V's story has to rank up there with Suikoden II's as one of the best rpg storylines ever and only lags behind the second game due to that game's having a brilliant and memorable villain in one Luca Blight. The main characters and most of the 108 Stars of Destiny characters were well-written with their own distinct personalities and motivations for joining the fight. The dialogue during the game is mostly done through text with each character show in anime-style profiles. The cutscenes on the other hand uses voice acting which for a rpg was done pretty well with voice actors who actually gave each character voiced a distinct personality. It would've been nice if Konami had included the Japanese voice-acting in addition to the English translation. It's a minor gripe, but nothing that takes away from making Suikoden V such a great game.The gameplay mechanics returns back to the 6-party formation from the first three games in the series. There's still the usual co-operative attacks when certain combinations of characters are put in the battle party. The co-op attacks could involve just two characters all the way up to six characters combining to create devastating non-runic attacks. There's also co-op attacks between characters using runes. These combined runic attacks are some of the most damaging attacks in the game and allows the player a reason to actually bring a balanced party of 6 characters that's made up of fighter strong in physical attacks and those adept in runes. The newest change in the battle mechanics occur in the war battles. Gone is the turn-based system that's worked well in the first four games. Suikoden V's war battles now takes place in real-time which makes for much more hectic battles. The player must constantly know where each of his units are and how they're stacked up against the opposing forces. This change in the system was a good one and here's hoping that in the next Suikoden game for the upcoming nextgen systems, Konami builds on this real-time war battle.Suikoden V is a great game and also brings the Suikoden series back to great form after an interesting but lackluster attempt at innovation with Suikoden IV. This fifth entry did everything right in what made the series great. It had a great and compelling storyline with complex and distinct characters. Suikoden V misses surpassing the great Suikoden II in greatness just due to that game having certain classic and memorable characters. This is an unfair comparison but something that still puts the second game ahead of V, but just barely. That shows just how great this game really is. Already announced by Suikoden's creators that V will be the last Suikoden game for this current generation of Playstation console system. The next installment will have nextgen hardware at its disposal and I, for one, can't wait to see what the next one will turn out to be. Until then I shall continue to play and enjoy Suikoden V the second time around with its New Game + option that unlocks after a player finishes the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2006"}

I'm not a fan of first person shooters. I prefer 3rd person action games like Jedi Outcast for the pc. But FP shooters seem to be the only thing being made these days so I gave in and gave this a try.I'm sure everything's been said already about this game as far as graphics go so I'll just agree that they're awesome. Game play is smooth also. Frame rate is superb, no slow down. I'm only about half way through my first time through the game and it's very addictive. Lots of weapons and enemies to unload them on. I'll agree with one reviewer that some of the enemies will creep you out. For me it's those Grey Jacks and the  Leapers (think face huggers from Aliens), ugh I hate those things. There may be worse in store for me but for now they can't die fast enough.I read an article that there will be a Resistance 2. In the off chance the developers read these reviews I'll list my only gripe which is more blood and guts. I want heads and limbs blown off with \"Kill Bill\" style blood squirts. If I run up on an enemy and give him both barrels of a shotgun I want the beast to do more than just keel over, I want a huge sucking chest wound with entrails everywhere. OK I'll pull my horns back in now but I know I'm not the only video game gore hound out there.Even without the extreme gore the game is still lots of fun and I've already started replaying certain favorite levels.

I have played the Mass Effect series since the first game came out,and I am absolutely glad that I did. The whole trilogy created a wonderful experience. You get to meet great characters, find out more about a huge storyline, and even create meaningful relationships within the game. Moreover, the game has many action RPG and shooter based concepts. I love it. I am not particularly a fan of turn based rpg though I have played many. Mass Effect really changed that. In the third installment, you can even customize further. For example, if you do not want to worry about being able to aim and shoot, you can play the \"story\" mode which focuses more on you and the story and the choices that you must make. If you like more of a shooter, choose the action mode. If you would like the whole rpg experience, choose the mass effect rpg mode. They did an outstanding job at keeping it genuine for fans that have played the series while making it easy for new gamers to get into the actionThe galaxy exploration was greatly improved. You do not have to suffer with all the mako hard terrain experiences or the endless planet probing. Moreover, you are free to make paragon and renegade choices and still manage to improve your reputation. You are no longer tied to being an extreme paragon or extreme renegade. I have played both a full renegade and paragon in Mass Effect 1 and 2, and sometimes, it felt like you were forced to either be too good or be too bad. In Mass Effect 3, you can mix it up. DO WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE DOING.The action/shooter elements are great while keeping true to rpg elements as well. There is a lot of customization, and do not forget the awesome interactive narrative story. It feels awesome to be able to choose how you want to react and to see how people react to you.A lot of people seem to be upset because of the endings. Yes, the endings may leave people with many questions left unanswered, but you can still manage to get important characters to live, and the game leaves the story left for lots of interpretation. While I do agree that it could have been better executed, the endings should not undermine everything else that made the game great.You will learn to love, care, enjoy the experience. You forge relationships that are important since the first game. They have done a great job at expanding those relationships/friendships, and despite what people say, your choices will still matter. Will you betray a friend in order to gain military support for your dying people? Will you kill an entire civilization to prevent your own extinction? There's a lot to think about, and if you really have put time to discover the experience within all the games, all choices will matter. Mass Effect 3 has done a great job at putting together a huge story that no other game has ever done. The fact that you can carry your original character and choices is by itself something that not all games can say they have done.*********SPOILER*************Do not be swayed to give up on this game simply because the endings were not completely executed properly or because some people failed to make your hero and friends survive. Shepard and the crew are able to live. He/she does not die in all the endings.In Summer 2012, there will be an extended cut to the ending. Friends who went to PAX east said that it seems that it will be more than just cutscenes. It is going to allow the gamer to expand further based on their choices.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"B.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"switched to the 360 version","reviewText":"Sold the ps3 version as it was boring.

Come late 2004, The Nintendo DS was born. Like its true successor the 3DS, the DS got off to a pretty slow start. Games like Super Mario 64 DS and Metroid Prime: Hunters were generally well-received by fans but the former was just a port that I, as well as others, just weren't interested in experiencing again. Other games to grace to system from the start were Madden, the quirky Feel The Magic: XY/XX, Sprung and racing games like Asphalt Urban GT and Ridge Racer DS. Overall, it seemed like a bit of a better launch than the 3DS' since it had a Mario game but it still wasn't much to holler about. However, down the road more and more games came out for it. We started seeing more and more action, adventure, RPG and puzzle games that would get us all excited in the pants! LOL.Hardware-wise, the DS Phat was and still is a great system. I've never used a DS Lite system extensively and I don't really plan on it. The Phat (although some say it's overlarge) is a perfect handheld system that was much more than just a simple upgrade from the light-less GBA. It had true possibilities to play games online through Wi-Fi (without accessories), it had Pictochat which was extremely fun for many months and it was customizable down to your favorite color, your birthday which would be announced every year without fail and you could even put your name in it to make things official. Out of the above options, although there is really no one around here to use it with, Pictochat is by far my favorite feature on the DS. ^_^ I just remember playing with my brother and cousin on it and sending messages and pictures back and forth. It was pretty innovative for a handheld at the time.All in all, a delightful gaming system. I don't regret for a minute having gotten one of these for Christmas. I will continue to enjoy some of the games on it long after I officially get a 3DS too.Long live the DS! ********Final score ------> 4.75 stars.This review can also be found at gamespot . com under the name darksongbird.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2007"}

There is no real skill requirement or learning curve worth mentioning.Yes I know there has to be the handholding and stupid-easy settings to prevent ragequiting. But it seems that some newer games are removing all the difficulty from their games, even on the hardest setting. I have a theory that this is because people who see themselves as hardcore gamerz always put their games on the hardest setting; and if that setting actually is hard, then they ragequit and start badmouthing the game.For instance, Bioshock: Infinite's lead dev said when he was asked why B:I's hardest setting was going to be completely hidden from users and only available to those who know how to access it through a secret button press combination.Even though I powergamed through the main quest only thereby avoiding becoming even more powerful through sidequestting, the exp and loot came so fast I never needed tactical or finesse play, and I never felt any tension or satisfaction from finishing a quest or even the last boss fight.So if you like a combat system that takes 45 minutes to master and gameplay that feels like you've turned on god mode, then Amalur's your game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2012"}

As long as your child is 12 years old or older, he or she is basically ready to play a game like this or should be mature enough for this game. Yes, it is a game of violence, but violence has beena sequence in many different PG-13 movies and sometimes even PG. The worst violence in this game is a gun and blood with gore. But in diverse movies like Lord of the Rings blood and gore has been exposed, so if you would let your child watch a violent movie this game would be okay. Also note that the violence will occur in the game if they want it to, they can attack pedestrians only if they want to so it also depends on their maturity. If they can't be mature about the homicides, then this game might not be ready for them.Yes, this game also has major language. Constantly the F word will be used, more often than any of the other curse words. Howvever, nowadays many people on the streets and even at schools started using these words. If you don't want your child to start using these words, this game might not be right for them yet but you can supervise the game as he or she is playing it and notifiy them of the language.The sexuality in the game is basically not a big deal at all; there is no real nudity in the game. There are nightclubs and prostitutes, but PG-13 movies have this kind o content and it is not very bad.There is mild drug content in this game, but if your child ahs gone through a program like D.A.R.E. then he or she should be mature about this content.So if your child is 12 years or older, then he or she should be about mature and ready to play a game like this.  The previous two games in this series, GTAIII and Vice City, are both on the Greatest Hits list for PS2, and my opinion is that most copies were sold to children, not adults.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

They change so much that the old Sim City 2000, and 3000 seem more like distant cousins rather than ancestors.  I wasn't sure I liked it.  I played the old Sim City 2000 and 3000 a lot while growing up.The second one is, this version has much more depth... without getting complicated.As EA tends to do, they made the game much more playable by the masses by making it easier, but as you work into the game you find there are more things you can do, and there are unlock-able buildings you can try for so each city you build will have a different flavor depending on what you're trying to unlock.I decided to get it and I'm glad I did.  There's enough depth and variance in the game that it's fun still, and it is balanced so it's almost impossible to build a perfect city.  You fix something and something else becomes a problem so you can spend as long as you like tweaking your cities to do their job.The downside to this game is there are a few exploitable bugs that make it too easy to play.

I was so wrong. lego Marvel Super Heroes is as fantastic as Batman 2. It has every imaginable Marvel super hero. Ever since I've watched The Avengers, I've been wanting a game where all the Super Heroes unite and TT Games provides me with that in the form of mini Lego super heroes!I'm a few hours into the game, and so far my six-year-old nephew and I are loving it! Normally, he hates playing any game by himself and nags me to play with him. For the first time, he played it without me. I honestly gawked at him and told him to wait for me, since I also wanted to play it. He didn't wait.The graphics look absolutely gorgeous and this game has all the charm and personality like the other Lego titles. It's very child-friendly and has mild, cartoonish violence. You play a plethora of super heroes all in one game. My inner-child is over the moon! You start off with the Hulk and Iron Man and then you're later joined by Spidey. I thoroughly enjoyed making the ground shake with my massive thumps and throwing cars and massive objects into the air while playing as The Hulk. It was also fun transforming into Bruce Banner and then transforming into the Hulk (whenever you wish) while pressing the Triangle Button. My nephew had a blast flying through the air as Iron Man and checking out his powers.You're introduced to a new set of super heroes with each upcoming mission. Each Super Hero has a unique power, so even though there is button mashing, you get to explore and use that power. Captain America can put out and walk through fire, while Mister Fantastic Four could glide and turn into objects (much like The Green Lantern in Batman 2) and the Black Widow could turn invisible. My nephew kept on hogging Spidey because his abilities are and I quote, \"awesome.\" Each Super Hero works with another in order to perform puzzles and bypass certain obstacles. Each mission ends with a boss fight( a villainous, iconic character - which was fun). The variety of super heroes with their unique powers will keep even the most restless person engaged. I haven't even gotten around to collecting the bricks yet, and I'm already having a blast!  Like Gotham City, the New York hub looks beautiful and massive. There is a lot of detail put into it. You get a mini-map with a holographic guide (which can also be enlarged).Unfortunately, just like every other Lego title I've played, there are some glitches in this game where you can get stuck and have to quit the game and start over. (So far it's only happened to me just once.) But other than that, if you have enjoyed previous Lego titles, then buy this! This is among the best Lego games I've ever played (and I've played every single title)!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}

The game was Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and we were all shocked how great the game was. Now later on I had wondered why haven't these classics been re-released for the Playstation 3? Someone had heard the prayers of Metal Gear fans worldwide as they have released the Metal Gear Solid Collection for the Playstation 3. But are some of these classics worth revisiting or should you look forward to the future Metal Gear titles?The first thing I want to remark on this game is that it is massive. This game is released on two blu ray discs and covers eight games and has two videos included as well. The games go as far back as the original Metal gear and Metal gear 2 (which was oriinally dgeveloped for the MSX and ported to consoles worldwide). But it also includes all of the Metal Gear Solid games from the original all the way up to Metal Gear Solid 4. This is a deal in and of itself because if you were to purchase all these games separately it would cost you over $200 if not more.There are also two videos that are included which are motion comic adaptations of the Metal Gear graphic novels. These are pretty awesome in and of itself but the crowning achievement of this legacy collection has to be the booklet that is included with this game. This 100 page booklet has tons of promotional items and brochures that are related to the MGS franchise.  Is this a complete set of all the games that were released by Konami? No. But it is pretty close as it is only missing two games (twin snakes and portable ops). And these game are all remastered for HD so they will look absolutely gorgeous on your television.If you're a fan of the MGS Series you need to pick this up as you will now have almost every MGS game on the PS3.

But, I did appreciate that they added a lot more, cooler killstreaks. Black Ops was ok, but I liked the more modern stuff.So, for Black Ops 2, I liked the fact that the storyline is actually replayable. It is still short, but at least, it changes based on your choices.The multiplayer is a lot of fun, but I still dislike the token system. I actually appreciate the scorestreaks in that you can do many other things besides killing people in order to gain scorestreaks. Overall, it is a lot of fun.

It was a fun serious sam type arcade shooter...after playing through the campaign and various echos missions I started to get bored... enter crysis 2. Being from NY i was impressed with the graphic presentation of a NYC under seige...The game is beautiful...the lighting is amazing...and as said by others the game comes across almost photo realistic. It starts off slowly which in my case was a good thing because unlike Bulletstorm there is deffinently a bit of a learning curve. I have no prior call of duty experience so any similarities between control schemes I was pretty niave to. The game has great depth, but unlike Borderlands the slow start didn't turn me off. I just couldn't get into Borderlands at all. There are a lot of little bugs here and there with enemy AI but further into the campaign it gets less noticable. The game starts to pick up and get really exciting and fun! I'm really enjoying this game...As one reviewer stated you feel like Robocop. I agree! Once you get the controls and abilities down the game is completely exhilerating! I love switching between infrared and cloaking abilities, it makes you feel so bad@$$! The cool part is you do feel very powerful in the game without totally dominating your enemies like in Bulletstorm. I'm only a few hours in and the pace picks up dramatically...it went from a cool game to an awesome game! Also, its cool that as you get used to your abilities the games pace picks up...The only negative I can say is the begining is slow and there are bugs...also I wish there were a little more variety with the enemies. You're in NY under marshal law and there are mp's everywhere but no dogs? Other than the lack of variety in enemies and occasional graphical hick ups along with questionable AI at times the game is solid. You'll love jumping 8' in the air and pouncing on your foes or kicking a car into an unsuspecting grunt....You do feel like you're on roids at times lol...the value seems tremendous for this game... Any one hating on this game is really spoiled. I hope this game does well so that the developers will continue producing console games because this my friends is a doosey. It'll be hard to top this one. This review was based on the Veteran difficulty setting. Buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2011"}

I'm sick of hearing how all those anti-Microsoft whiners complain about how big and heavy the controller is.  Yes, admittedly it is large and heavy, but it feels absolutely perfect in my hands for those long NFL FEVER and HALO gaming sessions!  And yes, the button layout is different at first and the black/white buttons can be difficult to reach when you first start using it, but trust me, after about 2 days of use, you get used to it and then you begin to wonder why all gamepads aren't like this one!  It's almost as if Microsoft took the best of the stock Dreamcast pad and molded it to the hands of real gamers!  You'll find no such uncomfortable edges/angles to cramp your hands and no cheap components to frustrate you!  This pad is heavy and tough!  It will definitely withstand the rigors of normal use and the vibration function is not a cheap buzzer effect, but one that actually enhances games like HALO where you get to fire loads of cool automatic weapons!What else is cool about this pad?  The nine foot cord.  The break-away cables that detach to prevent the console from falling if someone should trip over it.  This has to be the first game pad where they got the analog features down PERFECTLY.  I'm not kidding either...read my review of the Nuon's Logitech controller to see that I am no advocate of analog control.  Every analog control from the two thumbsticks to the triggers are PERFECT...just the right amount of resistance and play to allow for ultra-precise movements and adjustments.  Am I the only one who thought the Dreamcast pad had an analog stick that was too loose?  This is NOT the case with the XBOX controller!  Seems that Microsoft is out to make sure it does everything right!  The XBOX and its initial launch of games show me that the guys in Redmond are serious about giving gamers and developers exactly what we want!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2001"}

That being said, the overall package is just average.The single player is fun, but I enjoyed the previous two Max Payne's so much more.  The difficulty will seem unforgiving if you've never played a Payne game before, but once you get used to using cover and bullet time you'll get through levels fairly easily.  After one playthrough I'd had my fill of Max for a few more years, I was too bored to attempt another.The story is decent, it takes you through some twists and turns, but the payoff isn't as big as the previous games.The production values, as with most Rockstar games, are extremely high.  Character animations, graphics, and sound are all top notch.  Bullet impacts are grisly, especially with headshots.The multiplayer is okay, but I'm giving the game a pass on this because I traditionally hate Rockstar's multiplayer (with the exception of Red Dead Redemption).Overall, you should try it if you're interested, just don't go in with high expectations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2013"}

I, on the other hand, not only didn't care ifI got the MSG2 demo, I never actually bothered to play the MSG2demo. As of this writing, my MSG2 demo still has yet to see the insideof my PS2. So naturally, this review is solely for theZ.O.E. game.I was nervous about purchasing Z.O.E. since I had heardabout the complex controls of the game and in the past, any game thathad overly complex controls generally didn't survive long in mycollection, not because the controls were complex per se but becausethe game programmers tend to forget to allow gamers full customizationof those controls. Not only were the controls of Z.O.E. a surprise,but this game has the most intuitive controls since the days of SuperMario Bros. The game splashes you right down into the controls of theOrbital Frame &quot;Jehuty&quot; (Most fans will think of it as aMech, robot, or something similar, depending on their favoriteuniverse) In the beginning, the control buttons are minimized to themost basic functions for close combat, distance fighting, andmovement. As the game progresses, the Jehuty picks up (or learns) newabilities and teaches you how to use them. Just as you grasp theconcepts and fine controls of the Jehuty, the lessons stop. Not a badthing really, since I never noticed that the lessons had stopped,since my attention was focused on fighting.For every single game Ihave ever played, I was always able to spot A.I. deficiencies in thegame. Most game programmers never could get the A.I. just right forthat &quot;real world&quot; feel. And yet for the first time sinceHalf-Life, Z.O.E.'s A.I. is so subtle and finessed that I never oncenoticed any A.I. faults my first time through. That, in itself, isvery impressive in my eyes. I never noticed the first time that theenemies rarely &quot;gang&quot; up on you in close range. If you'refighting one machine in close combat then the other machines tend toattack you with long range weapons, as opposed to also attacking inclose range. This makes the game that much more fun. Never once did Iexperience frustration due to being overwhelmed by too manybaddies. And when I wasn't worried about the baddies, I sure as heckwas taking in the scenery.The detail in each scene and thenumerous small details make this game a pleasant jot through a gameworld. Things explode, burn and interact just like a real worldshould. Usually it's safe to use a building as cover, however be awarethat the enemies will either go around the building or blow thesuckers up to get at you.And yet for all the destruction, detailand awesome control, the game seriously lacks one key thing. Length. Ispent quite a bit of time flying around since I never could quiteremember what I was supposed to do next. But even with the extra timewasted doing nothing, I estimate that the actual game time to bewithin hours. I wish game designers would guarantee at least a fortyhour game the first time through. My first time through just barelyreached half that, my second time cut those hours to less than halfthe time of my first game. The ending comes as a shock really, Oneminute I was wondering how I was going to control Jehuty's possiblenew powers and how the next mission was going to resolve itself, whenthe credits started to roll. Just when the game story really starts tobecome interesting. What a disappointment! The game's abrupt endingwas such a shock that I played through a second time to obtain aperfect score, thinking that maybe that doing so would unlock the restof the game. I even waited until all of the credits passed by. Zip,nothing, nada. The game has no &quot;secret&quot; that I couldfind.In essence I wish that Z.O.E. didn't come with the MSG2 demoand instead came with a second CD for the rest of the game. Oh well,Perhaps with the release of MSG2 that it might come with a demo forZ.O.E. 2? The game is really sweet but the high ... (as of thiswriting) makes admission a little tough to swallow. It really makes nosense to purchase this game just to play the MSG2 demo. If gamersliked the original Metal Gear solid enough, I am positive that mostgamers will buy MSG2 regardless of the demo. If you like the conceptof giant Mech warriors beating the tar out of each other, then by allmeans, purchase this game. On the other hand if you just want to buythis game for the MSG2 demo, then you must either be a collector orhave a lot of cash to burn...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2001"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Still spectacular, a must own","reviewText":"Back in 2006, Capcom and now defunct developer Clover quietly released a game for the PS2 that ended up being one of the most original, inventive, and addicting masterpieces that ever graced the system.  That game was Okami, and now it is here on the Wii, and it is certainly a match made in heaven.  For those unfamiliar with Okami, you play as the goddess Amaterasu, who has been reincarnated in the body of a mystical white wolf.  Armed with a celestial paint brush that is used to progress through the game and take out enemies, Okami never ceases to amaze even to this day.  Though the story and quest elements borrow heavily from Legend of Zelda, Okami features an engaging narrative and interesting and charming characters to come across.  The game is still a gorgeous sight to behold, and the quest itself is quite lengthy with plenty of side quests and collectibles to be found as well.  On the Wii, Okami makes solid use of the motion controls when using the paint brush, and it works pretty well.  If there are any downsides to Okami, it is the same single flaw that the game featured when it was originally released: the combat may be found to be too easy for some.  That aside, Okami is still a masterpiece of modern gaming, and now that it has hit the Wii, a whole new audience of gamers can discover just how wonderful this game really is.  If you missed out before and you own a Wii, don't miss out on Okami again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2008"}

While I didn't finish Dragon Quest VIII I did enjoy its story and art immensely.Ni no Kuni is all about magic. A boy named Oliver's mother dies after saving him from drowning. A fairy named Mr. Drippy comes to visit him and he's off to another world. It turns out that an evil witch wants to destroy the world. Sounds pretty simple, but there a lot of plot twists and the ending will have you going, \"No way!\" during each cut scene. The game holds a lot of secrets and the characters are engaging and you will get very attached. However, story is only half of what makes a good JRPG.The combat is in real time, not turn based. It's all about reaction time and strategy. All three of your characters run around the battlefield. The enemy can strike at any time, but so can you. Each character can cast spells and send out one of three familiars to cast various other spells and do physical damage. There are dozens of them throughout the game that you can capture and train. Oliver is the most powerful as the mage and by the end of the game you will be casting room clearing magic. The biggest issue with this is that the game is solely focused on magic. Physical damage, no matter how high of a level you are, never does the same amount of damage as magic. You will be guzzling MP potions like crazy, always make sure you have a ton stocked up. Enemies will some times cast spells themselves or charge physical attacks. You can order your team to defend or attack and then you have to attack yourself. This requires quick thinking and timing, actual gaming skills. It's also important to exploit the elemental weakness of each enemy, if there is one. During battle, enemies will drop HP and MP glims to help you out and rarely the gold glim with will super charge you or your familiar for an ultra powerful attack or defensive move.Boss battles are the toughest in the game, and towards the end they will come with 2 and 3 different phases. This game gets extremely tough after the first few chapters, so tough that it will require a lot of level grinding during the last half. I actually played the last half on easy and still died quite often, this game is extremely hard, be warned. There are other things you can do outside of battles like side quests. Oliver can go around collecting pieces of heart from people and giving to other people who need it. He can cast spells to help advance his way through the world like make bridges, talk to ghosts, animals, rejuvenate broken objects etc. There are 150 side quests and you get gold and items for them as well as stamps. 10 stamps gets you a card and these cards can be redeemed for permanent effects like extra XP during battle, enemies drop more loot, and even giving Oliver 100 extra max HP and MP. These side quests, including bounty hunts, can be fun and can add 15-20 hours of gameplay themselves.After so long you will be able to sail and fly around the entire world allowing you to avoid overworld battles. The game has no random battles, but some enemies are so hard to avoid that they might as well be. If you get to a high enough level enemies will run away and you won't have to deal with them. The game is also full of dangerous dungeons full of chests of loot. Now what about these familiars? Think of them as Pokemon. You can feed them treats to advance various attributes and then feed them gemstones to advance them to their third and most powerful stage. As they level up they acquire new spells and techniques. You can swap out different familiars and can hold up to 500 in your familiar retreat.The game's art is fantastic and gorgeous along with the music. Studio Ghibli created the animated cut scenes, but there aren't many of them. There's less than 10 minutes of animation through the whole game and that's very disappointing. I felt they shouldn't have bothered at that point. There's also a lot of unspoken dialogue and it just seems random when it happens. Towards the end there's hardly any cut scenes and it drove me nuts. Why waste the great voice acting and animation only to spread it randomly and unevenly throughout the game? Other than that colors pop on a 1080p HDTV with bright vibrant colors thanks to Studio Ghibli's art style that everyone has grown to love and appreciate.In the end, Ni no Kuni has a very engaging story that will keep you hooked for dozens of hours, the combat tries to change things from the typical JRPG format, but there are a few flaws in it. Your spells can be interrupted often and when you defend it some times won't register or you don't get enough time before an enemy attacks. You get about a second before the enemy attacks. In that time you need to order your team to defend and defend yourself. It can be tough during boss fights. I also hated the focus on magic and the game was overly difficult during the last 3/4. Other than that the combat was fine. The game suffers from tedium towards the end, and the side quests start feeling the same and you just want the game to end. There is some post-end content, but most people might skip this. Ni no Kuni is a perfect game for JRPG fans, but non-fans won't find enough here to change their minds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

'brotherhood' was a great follow and every bit II's equal.'revelations,' i have to say, has lost a bit of the wonder it's predecessor's possessed.  i can only imagine this is because this is the 3rd release in the franchise in as many years (and another has been confirmed for next year).  as i said, it's still a great game compared to most other games on the market.  i guess you could say it's a victim of it's own success.there's plenty to love in 'revelations.'  italy has been traded for constantinople and it's truly a beautiful place.  the soft blues and pinks of florence and venice have been replaced by rich and vibrant oranges and yellows.  and there's not a game out there that can match 'revelations' skies.  perched atop the hagia sophia while the sun sets is an awe-inspring sight to behold.  the combat is essetially the same, though ezio's finishing moves are, well, delightfully bloody and glorious.  on more than a few occassions i said, 'holy COW!' and laughed after watching ezio gruesomly carve up some guy's cranium.most of the other elements are familiar - animus data fragments replace feathers; book shops replace art dealers; you still recruit assassin's and send them out on missions; and 'revelations' incorporates 'brotherhood's' mission completion sync percentage.  the specified challenges within a mission aren't mandatory, but you won't get a 100% sync if you fail to complete them.  the only real new aspects are bomb crafting (which can be fun to experiment with) and den defense.  as others have said, 'den defense' isn't particularly fun, but it does change things up a bit.i do own a 3D TV and 'revelations' 3D compares favorably to other games. (i think 'arkham city' has the best 3D, at least in my opinion). although i did my head my head aching a bit after about 20 minutes of playing in 3D.all in all, yes, 'revelations' is familiar.  but the assassin's creed universe is such wonderful, vibrant, awe-inducing place that you don't mind one bit spending a bit more there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Almost a classic","reviewText":"I was really harsh on this game when I first played it, and wrote a scathing review which I later retracted. Due to huge frustration with the infuriating bosses (more about this later), I was forced to revert to an old save game. It was at that point I learnt that once you learn how the game works, Deus Ex: HR is almost as good as the original Deus Ex from 2000. That being; the second play through becomes far more enjoyable than the first.It restores my faith in today's games, with developers making (for the most part), logical, informed decisions, to create a brilliant product which is one of the best games in its genre for possibly five years.HR feels like Deus Ex. Two things; the music is the same style, the sound effects are replicated - Human Revolution adds plenty more new features as well as brings things back which were absent from Invisible War. Whilst not quite as huge or complex as the original, it's every bit as fun to play with the one exception; the boss battles ruin the game. They are contradictory of what precedes, that is; your character may be based on stealth but in cut-scenes your character acts like a bad-ass, like 90% of the other third/first person titles. This contrast looks ridiculous.Exploration rewards the player with extra \"Praxis\" points, these enable you to upgrade your character with augmentations. They range from silent running, to being able to see through walls and become cloaked. Naturally, the longer you spend exploring, the greater you become. Credits are given out for finding hidden vents, hacking, and taking out enemies silently. This enables you to buy more equipment. Shops are available in certain areas but you will be unable to visit them for long durations of the campaign. This keeps you on the edge of your seat, forcing you to think ahead on the strategy you want to carry out when you do need to fork out cash. All this creates a very involving, and ultimately rewarding experience.Some of the augs are useless, some are fun, some give unfair advantage. Thanks to these, it will be worth playing through again with the augs I didn't bother with first time. There's a bunch of achievements to gain also, which reward the player for a full playthrough with no kills, or completing on the hardest difficulty. I'm ready to go again!The more hours you put in, the more you get out of Human Revolution. You can rush through this game in just over ten hours, but invest more time in the side-quests and use stealth and it could last well over twenty. The world is huge and has pain-staking detail added. The game came to an abrupt end well before I expected it though with (wait for it) a boss!Overall, Deux Ex: Human Revolution is so much better than Invisible War, but in the same vein also a great prequel to the original game in every way. Only die-hard elitists will condemn Human Revolution - it uses minimal \"dumbing down\" trends of modern games and those it does use push the series further. As mentioned, the boss fights really let it down, and it's up to the gamer whether to choose to let this blemish ruin their experience or not.8.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}

JAGELLA","summary":"A  Successor to Unreal Tournament, But a Worthy One?","reviewText":"When I purchased a computer system in November 2000 to upgrade my aging PC, a game title I had in mind was Unreal Tournament (UT).  After spending just a short while with UT, I realized it was a winner.  This game defined the clich&eacute; &quot;thrill of victory and agony of defeat.&quot;  I was almost afraid to play it because I hated to lose, but was it great to win!  Playing Unreal Tournament set the stage for Unreal Tournament 2003 (UT2003), but progress does not always fulfill one's hopes.UT2003 is a good shooter.  It is a very good looking game with realistic effects like fire, swirling clouds, and rounded surfaces.  It's rendering of shiny metal objects is perhaps the best I've seen in any game.  The bots work well in single player, and the AI has been improved so much over UT that it's almost impossible to beat the bots in the tougher difficulty settings (at least I couldn't).  The sound and music are good too.The drawbacks of UT2003 include fairly high system requirements.  I could run it on my Pentium III system, but the frame rates noticeably dropped when a lot of bots were on screen.  Even on my 3 GHz Pentium IV system the game will sometimes slow down noticeably.  Also, I thought that the weapons weren't as good as in UT.  The sniper rifle, one of the best weapons I've seen in any game, was replaced by a &quot;lightning gun.&quot;  I hate this weapon!  You've got to wait several seconds for it to recharge, and we all know what waiting results in when we are being attacked by bots or players intent on killing us.UT2003 and Unreal II, just aren't what they could be, and they are a step down from their predecessors.  I would love to see the developers of these Unreal games return to their roots.  Give us the original greats like Unreal and Unreal Tournament with updated sound and graphics, and you'll have a lot of happy players.

Though even then, Sonic was no stranger to racing games.. both on foot and on the road. This game is a mascot racer featuring Sonic and most of his friends, as well as many other characters from different Sega games. Unlike the predecessor however, this new game's gimmick is that all characters have a transforming vehicle that will change accordingly to a flying vehicle, a motorboat or a kart. These transformations are not triggered on demand though, they happen as you go around the track and reach the corresponding morphing point. Part of what helps this mechanic is that the tracks themselves are also changing over the time, so your first lap and your third lap on the same track might end up being entirely different experiences. Besides that you also have your typical Mario-Kart-ish items to help you speed boost, attack your opponents, or defend yourself.I must say, Sumo Digital and Sega did a great job at representing the Sega world with this game, even better than the first game. My big complain and turn off about the first game was that the racing tracks were too repetitive as far as where they drew their inspiration from. In this game however you will see a great variety of tracks, based on different games like Samba de Amigo, Sonic the Hedgehog, Golden Axe, Shinobi, House of the Dead, Nights, and many more. And they did so with great detail, all stages are such a beauty to look at. Too bad one has to focus on the race.The racing mechanics themselves... I have mixed feelings about them. And not because they are bad. Oh no, they are great actually. You see, people like to compare this game with Mario Kart and I can understand why. But I wouldn't really go there. This game feels much more skill based than it is item based, and we all know Mario Kart is the total oposite. Sonic Transformed actualy requires you to pay attention to what you are doing and to put effort to do your best, because items will help you but never in a cheap/unfair way. So this will be great for experienced players, but more casual gamers (which are the ones usually drawn to mascot racers) may have abit thougher time adjusting. And to top that off, the changing tracks and handling the boat and plane mechanics are going to make this even harder. Seriously, for what seems like a friendly game, there's some challenge here. It is not as straightforward as other kart racers.But obviously it is nothing too hard either, one just has to get used to the whole thing and hope for the best. For the few people saying that they copied Mario Kart 7 with the flying and water stuff, this is so not true at all. I would compare it more with Diddy Kong Racing where you did have to drive with actual plane and boat physics. But here you have a morphing vehicle and morphing tracks, so it is much more unpredictible.So yeah, that's my review. This is a fun game, with great graphics, several game modes including online play, lots of Sega fan service, Gamepad functionality, and a great amount of challenge. It might not be as inviting or entertaining as a Mario Kart session with friends, but if you are looking to get a little more serious and chaotic in Sonic's world, this will do.Note: The Wii U version does not have online voice chat, unlike the other versions. If you ask me, that's a good thing. I don't need to hear strangers talking trash on a game like this. But if that's important to you, then be warned. But the Wii U version does feature the (slightly) better graphics, and a few exclusive mini games. Also, it has off TV gameplay and Five player local multiplayer. So yeah.

Anyone can see that I have bought several collections and remasteries in my purchasing history, and I have enjoyed each of them for what they are and because I no longer own each of those games for my PS2 (that and trophy support = plus!). Never the less, most of them feel like they just took a Blu-ray disc, plugged three games onto it, gave them an HD boost in graphics and sound (which isn't a ton of a boost but still), and release the game for gamers like me who might not own the games or never played them. Don't get me wrong, I am glad they do it most times, but some companies overdo it (Konami, in my opinion) or do a shoddy job (Silent Hill collection). Which is why I was worried with this &#34;collection&#34;; I loved FFX, it is my personal favorite FF besides 8 and 9 (7 is a given really anymore). I was scared that Square Enix would just take the PS2 versions of each, make them HD'ed, and sell the games as they were. But to my surprise, they did so much more, and that is why this is not just a collection, but a full blown remastery of the two games. Square Enix went back in time almost, and not only made the games look new, fresh, and overall better, but they remade the music, added new themes or revamped them, new textures, ect. ect. In short = they rebuilt both games from the original blueprints, and made them look, feel, and sound fresh and great once more. The cinematics still look great, so there was no need to make them new again really (and they didn't). Really the one downside to the remastery in terms of looks is the lip sync to the dialogue; somehow, they neglected to rework the dialogue to the mouth movements, for they still look awkward at times. Overall, the graphics, sound, and presentation, as well as cinematics all are fantastic and great. Gameplay wise, it remains the same as before with some upgrades in terms of the presentation of the battles and whatnot, but in general the game plays and operates in the same outline as the original PS2 version did. For those who didn't play the original, the battles operate in a turn based system, with attacks, abilities, items, magic, and so on available to be used, and even the ability to switch characters in and out with a couple button presses (which is vital at times, and can also be extremely helpful when wanting to get the entire party some experience). It is a simple battle system, but it's deeper than it seems, and is a system that you learn new things with harder and harder battles (appropriate uses and importance of Yuna, when Auron is vital versus Titus versus Wakka, and so on). This game is rewarding, encourages grinding with nudges at times, and is a game that is focused and linear in many ways, yet has much to do on the side as well (which is what FF-13 lacked). If you loved RPG's, especially turn based RPG's, then get this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2014"}

The addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when, though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement. And on the subject of puzzles, the only flaw this game has is the \"water puzzle\" near the end of the game. Only because it is totally random. Meaning you can get lucky and solve it in 20 seconds, or it could take about 30 minutes to beat. But other than that, this is a great game that any Resident Evil fan should have in their collection.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5JW","description":"","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"Buy it for Anniversary, Legend and Underworld are a mere bonus.","reviewText":"While we wait for the next official installment of Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics has compiled its first three Tomb Raider games in one convenient package. The result is a compilation that is 1/3 amazing, 1/3 good, and 1/3 mediocre.Legend is the oldest of the three and it really shows its age on the PS3 version. The upscaling on the PS3 looks really weird thus making it the ugliest of the three. The game is also criminally short with 7 main stages that take mere minutes to finish once you get the flow. It's the most diverse of the three featuring bike riding (yuck), turret shooting, and lots of action sequences. Variety may be the spice of life but Legend is not what Tomb Raider fans necessarily want in a Tomb Raider game, Anniversary explains it why.Released in 2007, Tomb Raider Anniversary is a remake of the original 1996 classic Tomb Raider. The crown jewel of this collection, Anniversary is clearly the game with the most polish of the three. The game boils down essentially what a Tomb Raider game should be, lots of platforming and death defying stunts, little to no human-on-human violence, and an excellent sense of being alone in a desolate place. Of the three it sits in the middle for best looking, it is upscaled much better than Legend with a much cleaner look. While nostalgia freaks of the original scoff at Anniversary's trimmings of the original, the end result faithfully recreates the original while brining it in to the modern age. With less long stretches and non memorable areas removed.Tomb Raider Underworld is the native HD game of the three and story-wise is a continuation of Legend's tale. While it is the best looking, Underworld sets itself as the worst of the three games for various reasons. Lara has more animations in this game but none of them feel right. The controls are iffy at best and glitches are everywhere. You would think that the developers  would have fixed Underworld's numerous flaws by now but that's not the case. Falling 15 feet seems to mean doom for Lara in this game and there are times where you'll even be stuck in mid-air for no reason. Again this is to be blamed by adding a bunch of animations that did not need to be done. They were going for a more organic, realistic game but this is not the case. On the Xbox 360, Tomb Raider Underworld got two extra levels as DLC, none of them appear on this PS3 re-release which really makes the game and package half-assed. Add to the glitches and bugs, Underworld does not have even a third of bonus content that Legend and Anniversary posses. No Time Trials, no Croft Manor puzzle stage, no unlockable costumes.The compilation is priced right and you'll get some fine adventuring here to last for a while. Legend and Anniversary will keep you replaying stages (especially Anniversary's Time Attack on its later stages) and extra content while you'll probably just fly through Underworld and never touch it again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

Speaking of Apps here is two apps that seem kind of dumb in two different cases: one is being the Blu-ray Player app and reason why its dumb is because I thought sense it does play Blu-ray discs I thought that was something  that should've been pre-installed and not appear as an app! The second dumbest app is not on Xbox One but that controls the Xbox One and that is Xbox One SmartGlass and the reason why its dumb is because I would've thought they update the Xbox 360 SmartGlass where you can choose to switch between Xbox 360 or Xbox One rather then having them as two separate apps wasting space on app selections!There is another thing that is dumb about Xbox One and that is media achievements! I just read that all they don't affect your gamerscore at all so can't they have a mediascore!One thing I am impressed is the Kinect sense it doesn't move like the Xbox 360's Kinect and it provides of entering QR codes that makes easier to enter codes rather then typing them in however in case of any accident of the QR code typing them in would be your second option!  Xbox One also supports 4K like the PS4 but the difference is it's games will have 4K graphics and PS4 won't and that grands my gears because I thought that one of the main reasons for PS4 and Xbox One was 4K support in every level!The Day One Achievement you get for gloating and proving people that you got Xbox One on Day One I thought would've  gloat and prove more by adding to your gamerscore but apparently not! Makes no difference to me whatsoever!

What more is there to say? Well for the uninitiated the GOW games are about as good as action games come. Supposing you've been living under a rock and never played them on the PS2 and are looking for a lot of action for a low price this collection includes two games that are every bit as entertaining as anything currently on PS3 and with the revamped HD graphics every bit as sharp looking too. The only complaint I have is that the cutscenes weren't remastered too. I remember when the cutscenes looked better than the game and now it's reversed. I really think if that had been done this collection would have been really perfect but oh well no one really buys games for the cutscenes, at least I don't, I buy them for the gameplay and these games deliver no matter what system they're on.These are the original games, nothing is added except HD graphics, every control is the same and the games are generally unmolested except for the trophy system which is cool but for some reason it makes the game act as though it's about to freeze or crash but its never actually done either. The voucher for the GOW3 demo is useless since the demo is up for free now and GOW 3 is also out, I can not recommend that game enough.If you haven't played them then this is two 10+ hour games in one package for $30 and I consider that to be a pretty fair deal, it would have been nice of them to go the extra mile and port the PSP game 'Chains Of Olympus' to complete the collection but I can understand that game is still on a current system and still pretty easy to find but it would have been nice to play it on a big screen. Oh well, no biggie.The games follow the saga of Kratos, a champion of the God's who gets mad cause something or other happens which makes him even madder so he decides to kill the God Of War. Kratos as a character seems unstoppable or even invincible as no matter what gets thrown at him; hordes of sword wielding zombies, minotaurs, centaurs, cerberus', gods, titans, it never even seems to slow him down as far as the story is concerned. He's a very seething and angry guy with the most massive chip on his shoulder you will see in a character in any form of media. Honestly, at times, he seems more like a baddie than a goodie but I suppose that's a good thing, it offers a feeling of darkness when stepping into this guys shoes and sure the video game genre is no stranger to anti-heroes but this guy just doesn't stop. He never eats or sleeps or drinks or anything throughout the course of two games he is just on a quest for bloody revenge leaving a very long and bloody trail of bodies in his wake.I highly recommend this game to anyone who can stomach gratuitous violence, gore and nudity in a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"MJM - The Franchise of the VGF","summary":"Great game...........just play the original first!","reviewText":"The original Dead Space was a great game and in my opinion really helped put the survival-horror genre on the map. If you haven't already played it I would highly recommend you do, for two reasons. The first of course being like I stated above and second, if you plan on playing the sequel playing the first would make that experience so much better. However, not having played the first isn't necessarily a deal breaker; there is an option to watch a short video clip that sums things up from what happened the first time around.Dead Space 2 hits the ground running, from the moment you have control of Isaac you're fighting to survive and of course jumping from fright. This game starts off right where the first left off in regard to the story, plot wise three years after the first ended to be exact. The story is interesting and adds to the Dead Space timeline seamlessly. The story draws you in, keeps you engaged and then scares the poop out of you.The controls pretty much mirror the first, with a few added modifications. This is another area where playing the first would be beneficial, because there's not really much of a tutorial, there's a few prompts giving direction as you progress through the game. Also the in game features like the workbench, store, save stations and weapons are all introduced to you as with the assumption you're already familiar with them.Graphically the game is gorgeous, the environments, the creatures and the settings are all beautiful. My only complaint with the graphics would be the human characters; some of them look like last gen.Where Dead Space shines the most, is in the special effects and music area. This is what set the tune (pardon the pun) for the first and yet again they succeeded in doing the same for the sequel.This time around they have added multiplayer to the mix, which is a unique experience to say the least but not the reason to buy this game. It's a nice addition but honestly I don't know if it would pull me away from the many other online games I'm currently playing.Over all great game, however just as the title reads, play the original first.MichaelPSN-Xbox Live gamer tag MikeJMele","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

Given that the LEDs are the main selling point I would have liked to have a brightness selection option to maybe tone them down just a little and it was something I wished for on my older one. Of course if it was too dim then I'd be complaining about that as well. You do have the option to switch off the lights or only have them on when the device rumbles so really it's down to personal preference.My only other gripe was the movement of the thumb sticks; there was a small delay in moving the sticks before it acknowledged that you had moved them. I don't mean lag, just a point at the center where no movement was being registered. In the older model I just got used to it, but I'm happy to report that the throw seems to have been reduced or indeed removed making this the best wired controller I own.And wired controllers are the way to go for the hardcore gamer. Any wireless controller would have some minuscule lag it's just the nature of the beast and if you want near 100% reactions to your actions then you need to be jacked in.The location of the buttons and the triggers are all similar to MS' stock stick although the smooth feel of the plastic here is silky and feels so good.A great controller priced right with insanely bright lighting.

You already had a big hard drive so here's a tiny 4g you won't want anyway. You are going to use the old one anyway.....  I'm not a fan boy of any system. I own and love them all. I am just not too happy going thru 2 myself. They rushed out the older models to get a jump on Sony. Hey, what is it 6 years or so later and they got it right! So if you need to replace a trashed old console, this is the one to get. New to 360 don't waste your money, get a bigger hard drive. 4gig is crap, especially now a days with so much dlc out there. At least this time you SHOULD have the confidence this is a reliable system. 360 is a great system and has great games, the best online option of any console(even of you have to pay for it) and has great exclusives too. Aside from the black eye of RROD, this sytsem is going down as one of the best ever. DO NOT BUY A USED 360!!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2012"}

The campaign story and character are forgettable but the levels are awesome especially the 'COMRADE' level it really shows off the destructibility. Now i know people complain  that the levels are too linear and are too much like call of duty's campaigns but that a good thing there are VERY cool moments in the campaign. But there are also a couple of glitches too the real problem m though is the AI now your friendly AI is moderate it holds it own but doesn't really support you much it mostly helps itself now for the enemies AI this is a weird one now they can be as dumb as a brick sometimes just standing there  or you can just walk around them and shoot em in the back without them doing anything or they can be BRUTAL as hell and can kill you easy problem is you can never know when they will do it (which kinda makes it dynamic but also kinda broken too) now for the campaign. I give it a 8.5 a a forgettable story and characters and a little bit of a direction problems and somewhat stupid/very smart AI but its great fun and remarkable scenes too.CO-OP: now the CO-OP is fun and i mean very fun better then the campaign but also has some small issues mostly with the AI just like the campaign its pretty much the same problem as the campaign AI they can be as smart as ever or as stupid as a chicken but it in the end its awesome and i give it a 9.0 a -10 for the AI problems and very little levels (only 5) but im sure DICE can fix it in a patch. you can also unlock guns for multiplayer playing the CO-OP which is cool do it.now for the thing you've all mostly been waiting forMULTIPLAYER: now its mostly the same battlefield experience you are used to except it has a good couple problems too now im on the ps3 and it seems to have some sprinting problems it glitches up on the ground when you walk some times you glitch through a wall also ive also experienced a scope problem a pink/black screen problem whenever i aimed down the sights of the acog sight after i died it went away and i haven't it only happened once to me had it since and crosshair problems when you have the m26 shotgun when you you switch to you primary gun it still has the shotgun crosshair on your primary gun that's a problem but that's about all i haven't had any major glitches/problems either. it its very fun  and has alot of new stuff the rankings are bigger then ever to rank up now (compared to the beta) its very good im at rank 15 and ive been playing for 12 hours and the rankings go to 125!! so you wont unlock everything in 2 days but has some sprint issues and lag problems (give dice and EA a while to fix it)in the end i give it a 9.5 if they fix the problem i give it a 10.MISC STUFF:GRAPHICS: by far its the second best version next to the PC compared to the 360 version it has better graphics it has bloom and has better shadows and lighting compared to the xbox 360.FRAMERATE: compared the beta it seems not to have any framerate issues that i have encountered.AMAZON BONUSES: i got the limited edition (cause i preordered it) it also came with a 20$ credit too.CLOSING THOUGHTS: im very happy with my purchase and im sure you will be too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"David G. Harpstrite","summary":"Better than Origins on the console at least","reviewText":"Well, I just finished Dragon Age II for the Xbox 360. Let me start by saying that this game does a lot right, but also misses the mark in a few places. Is it an improvement? Yes, on the console at least, I cannot vouch for the PC version. The combat is faster, the graphics are passable and the story, while contained, is solid, if not a little all over the place. So lets get started shall we?First off, how is DAII when it comes to Gameplay? Well, it's vastly improved in the combat department as I stated before when I played the demo. It's fast, visceral, and a blast. It's no longer sluggish and boring like in DAO. I always looked forward to combat in this game, the opposite was true for the first game. Also, the skills feel like they are more powerful and can actually be upgraded this time around. Speaking of skill tress, not much really changed with those outside of being more like actual skill trees. Pretty much all the same skills for a lot of the classes are the same with a few exceptions. Speech and lock picking have and things of that sort have been removed. In fact, I didn't know until mid way though the game that your cunning skills dictate weather you can unlock chests or doors. This was not made clear to me while playing. This was one of the things I did not like, the new skill sets and aspects of leveling are not properly explained. They are major changes that Bioware did not shine any light on. It's a minor problem but can seriously trip up a player. Inventory is pretty much the same, except that you don't have to give armor to every character, they wear their own stuff, but you still have to give them new weapons and things of that sort. You can upgrade their armor though, and usually their appearances change because of it.The conversation system on the other hand a nice addition as it is the same one from Mass Effect except that in the center of the wheel, the speech option you choose displays the motive with a symbol. I liked this because it made it very clear what the intent of your character was. So in that way it's a little better than the Mass Effect wheel. There isn't much to say other than it's not as black and white as ME's wheel. up doesn't always mean good and down doesn't always mean bad. Plus with no morality level your choices aren't as black and white, and it's more about how your companions and other characters feel about you than anything else.This was one thing I liked, everything in Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age II is a shade of gray rather than a clearly defined good and evil. Mass Effect sort of does that, but not to the extent that Dragon Age does.One thing that bothered me is that you don't get to explore an entire country in this game. You are only able to explore the main city of Kirkwall, nowhere else. This disappointed me because for all the scope Kirkwall has, it's still not the same as going all across Ferelden and seeing everything that country has to offer. You often revisit the same places and after a while it began to wear on me. It all looks good, but there just isn't enough distinction between every area. It is for story purposes I realize, but I don't understand why they couldn't go elsewhere in the game. Romancing characters is a much longer and more interesting process. It takes years for the characters to fall in love with you. You will likely sleep with them before you actually get them to fall for you. For me, it started as infatuation and turned into more. This was a good thing to me. I liked that it took more than 10 minutes and a loyalty quest to get the love of a romancable. One thing I did enjoy about the whole Kirkwall setup is that all the characters are not in one place. They all live or stay in one place or another. like real people they have homes or regular hangouts, which is where you have to go and talk to them.Moving on to Graphics and sound. The Graphics for Dragon Age, while not amazing, are certainly good. They work well and the new art style really helps add to the look of the game. It looks similar enough to be recognizable, but different enough to still stay fresh. Textures and facial animations are much better, hair moves and mostly doesn't look like plastic, and the effects work pretty well. I stress again that the game could look better, but compared to the sorry excuse for graphics that Dragon Age Origins had, I'll take this as is. Animations for characters in this game are also better. It's still stiff and there is a clear limitation there, but like the graphics, I'll take what I can get. The game's sound is good over all, though cut scenes are too quite and Battles are too loud, much like the first game I was constantly adjusting the volume.Story and Voice acting. Yes, this is the most important thing about Bioware games to me. The narrative. You import your save from DAO and the events from that game greatly effect how things play in in this game, the only difference between this and ME2 is that you don't carry your character over. So what can I say about Dragon Age II's story. It's got a good story, but the problem is that it's kind of all over the place and fairly linear. You play as Hawke, kind of a Commander Shepard equivalent for Dragon Age. Fully voiced and everything. You start out as a refugee from Lothering fleeing the blight. You voyage to Kirkwall because you have an estate there and try to build a new life for yourself and gradually become the Champion of the city. A living legend. The game has three primary sections that are all loosely connected. But the problem I had with it was there was no real cohesive plot. Just a series of events that led Hawke to become champion and perform an act that will change the world forever. It's more told like the story of a legend, which I guess fits, and it's at least less generic and over used than DAO's plot. There is clearly a much bigger event going on, but you don't get to see what that is since the game has a major and slightly rushed cliff hanger ending. It's clear they have big plans for Dragon Age III, but I wish there was more of a resolution to the plot. So while it's good, I feel like it could have been much more expansive rather than so self contained. On the bright side, a lot of characters from DAO and Awakening show up and it's great when you see some of the bigger characters arrive. The New characters and companions are mostly memorable, not as majorly memorable as ME2's but still good. Some I didn't take to and others I absolutely adored, like Varric and Isabela.Overall a good cast all with great voice acting and deep personalities. A lot of them have conflicting opinions like real people, and getting to know them all was great. The voice acting is pretty great as expected from a Bioware game. There is some really great dialogue too, especially between characters who break into conversation while following you. You will hear a lot of really funny and interesting stuff.So over all, I really liked Dragon Age II. For me it was a major improvement over the first game, even if it's more action packed and streamlined I still found it to be superior to DAO in every way. The story could have been better, but at least I didn't know what was going to happen next, it wasn't generic like the last game and there were some major twists and surprises that I honestly couldn't have called. Your choices majorly effect the way things turn out. If you take one character with you they may avoid a terrible fate or if you do a task for another, it could end very badly and you probably would have been better off not doing it. There are so many things I didn't get to do and I honestly can't wait to tackle this game again and make some different choices. Over all DAII is a solid RPG and a worthy sequel to DAO. I greatly anticipate DAIII and highly recommend this game to anybody who loves a good 30 to 40 hour long RPG with good characters and story.9 out of 10.Pros-Better graphics and animations-streamlined combat that is fast and brutal-Improved conversation wheel-Fully voiced character-Longer more interesting character relationships-great voice acting and dialogue with memorable characters-Better skill trees-morally ambiguous choices that will chart certain aspects of the story in another direction-Story is good...cons-...but not very organized and lacks a satisfying resolution-You are confined to once city.-Doesn't properly explain new changes to the system","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2011"}

There are better looking games and more revolutionary games, but for sheer fun, especially multiplayer fun, this is definitely worth having, or at least renting.By now you know the concept: Gauntlet type melee set in the White Wolf universe.  Hunter is non-stop action and is one of the first gmaes in a long time that allows you to pull out those extra controllers and play with friends.  The multiplayer elements is highly addictive and requires a lot of team work and communication.  Since it's not a first person-shooter, the action isn't divided into tiny screens and while it can get crowded on screen, especially with dozens of zombies chasing after you, it's still easy to see what's going on.The graphics are excellent, the sound, and music are well done and the characters are really cool, I just wish there were more of them.  Some of the later levels are extremely difficult and require a lot more tactics than you might be used to.  The early levels are just hack and slash goodness.  There's something to be said for both.Those of you who actually play with friends or family should give this one a gander.  There seems to be a flood of good sinle-player games on the market but very few multi-player.

Be it Far Cry for PC, GTA:San Andreas for PS2, or Ninja Gaiden for XBOX. However if you see the bulk of quality games hitting out in the market on a consistent basis, then probably XBOX scores a few more points. And the variety of titles you have are enormous. Still one game stands out amongst all others coz' it has a different approach to telling a story and it generally does not fall into any particular genre like racing, adventure etc. And that is Chronicles of Riddick:Escape from Butcher Bay. At the end of the day, what you experience is one of the best shooter-adventure-role-playing game to have come out since classics like Halo, Half-Life and NOLF.Story , Gameplay, Graphics and Sound ;You are Riddick, the dreaded , awesome anti-hero and you are deported to the most violent penitentiary of the galaxy: Butcher Bay. The moment you step into the world of Butcher Bay, your senses drive you into finding a way to escape and the entire game concentrates on your efforts to do so. But what adds to this simple premise is an astonishing blend of character interaction and sub-plots that could help you figure your way out of the prison.The characters in the game are unique and you can expect some response or the other from all of them.  You will hear quite a few expletives throughout the game. Trust me, they add a lot realism coz' you get a sense of the environment that is totally believable.As for the graphics....it doesn't get any better. For this sort of game, no other look would do justice. The game features the groundbreaking 'Normal Mapping' that adds greater details to shading without using extra polygons. What you get in COR is a world that is extremely gritty and frightening. It is a world that is bordering on chaos and misery :bleak, unforgiving and ruthless. The atmosphere is simply amazing. If Alien vs Predator gave you the frights out of nowhere by some jumping face-hugger , COR gives you the chill by just putting you in the environment. There are some levels in the game that force you to move underground and face some strange dwellers, that had my spine tingling.On top of that, the in-game cut scenes are superb, to say the least. And the NPC's are very well detailed. Riddick himself looks and sounds like Vin Diesel, with his deadpan style that is endearing. Ultimately, the game looks gorgeous.Weapons, there aren't many though. But it is offset by the punch they pack. To this day, I haven't heard weapons in any other game sound better. The really pack some serious punch. And the rag-doll physics is implemented here perfectly.  Also, COR hosts the first believable hand-to-hand combat seen in any game and the punches sound awesome. Riddick can also quietly come up to an NPC and break his neck in two ways. Another brilliant feature is that you don't have a stealth meter, but the screen turns blue, indicating you are well hidden.  All in all, COR has some truly innovative gameplay that will leave you wondering why it was never implemented in some of the more recognizable games in the market.COR doesn't have great replay value coz' the game offers pretty much the entire thing the first time through, but you can relive the experience in more difficult modes and that can be really challenging.All in all, Chronicles of Riddick:Escape from Butcher Bay is a masterpiece. This game is destined to become a classic. Though it doesn't have mulitplayer  ( of which I'm not bothered ) and has a short play (this hurts) , COR is rivetting with what it offers, to say the least. It is the closest to any sci-fi horror movie to date and has a style that is unmatched. It delivers a sense of perpetual doom that no other FPS has managed to date. Don't rent. Buy it !. It is worth every penny.At the end of the day, you'd realise this game is worth making space in your crowded cupboard of classic collections. Enjoy the game !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2004"}

I just didn't get Portal the first time. With all the hype surrounding the sequel I borrowed from a friend the Orange Box again and played through Portal 1 this time giving it a real chance. All I'm going to say is thank God Portal 2 was coming out two days later, because I was so hooked on Portal 1, and because it was so short (about 2 1/2 hours first play through), I couldn't wait a couple of years to play the sequel.Portal 2 takes it up to a whole new level.BOTTOM LINE THIS IS WHY PORTAL 2 IS THE GAME OF THE YEAR.1. Wide Audience appeal. My wife loves this game (and she hates video games). My kids love to watch me play this game (6 and 4), and its friendly for the family.2. The puzzles never feel repetitive.3. Graphics are fantastic. The Source Engine is 7 years old now and looks as good as anything out there.4. Fantastic voice acting and writing. My wife and I were laughing the whole way through the game.5. Awesome co-op game. Again, my wife hates games and we had a ball playing through the co-op game.Bottom line this will be the 2011 Game of the Year. It accomplishes what summer blockbuster movies does, and that is bring in multiple audiences.At this point I only hope that we can get a Portal 3 before 2018 Valve time. :D","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

Are you hero enough?","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"A truly fabulous game that gets just about everything right","reviewText":"Wow!  What a great game!  Freedom Force is a squad-based tactical combat game with a corny comic book superheroes theme.  Gameplay is non-stop fun, and this game is loaded with great features.  The only drawback is the not-so-long game length.  But, the game is so much fun, you will get a lot of replayability out of it.This game reminds somewhat of Baldurs Gate, or other role-playing games.  You start off with one character (Minuteman), who is sort of the main character, and then you meet others along the way.  Freedom Force can have more than 10 heroes, but you only get to choose 4 for each mission.  They each have special attack and defense abilities, as well as a voice and unique personality.  In fact, the richness of the characters in the game is one of the things that makes it so great.  There is a good superhero generation system in the game, which you can use to build your own superheroes.  I didn&#65533;t use it much, since the built-in superheroes are more fun to use, but when I replay the game, I might use it.One of the highlights of the game is the outstanding physics and combat engine.  You have a mostly overhead 3-D view, but you can pan the camera, as well as zoom in or out (but not rotate).  The graphics are not stunning, but every area is full of objects that you can interact with, destroy, bash, pick up, throw, you name it.  You can pick up a taxicab and throw it at a couple of  bad guys.  Or, you can pick up a telephone booth.  Or, you can rip a light post out of the ground and use it like a gigantic baseball bat.  Every object &#65533; buildings, cars, mailboxes, is destructible.  Stray bullets can damage buildings, and sometimes, even innocent pedestrians.I love the way that Irrational Games did the good guys vs. bad guys Comic Book theme.  It&#65533;s perfect.  Literally.  Everything is in there, even bratty child sidekicks.  Remember the big fistfight at the end of every &#65533;Batman&#65533; show?  That&#65533;s what a lot of the fights in &#65533;Freedom Force&#65533; are like &#65533; full of &#65533;Bonk!&#65533; and &#65533;Splat!&#65533; word bubbles.  The good guys are brave and naively good, and the bad guys are overconfident and diabolical.  The narration is done coming book style.  The voice acting is terrific.

This is perhaps due to the fact that it is pretty easy.  I got through about half of the missions on my first try &#65533; if you are an experienced tactical combat gamer, then you will probably find it to be the same.  The game has promising role-playing aspects that never quite come to fruition , because there aren&#65533;t enough missions for a lot of level-ups.  Still, the character creation system and the superhero recruiting system give this game a lot of replayability.  Plus, the price is pretty low for  PC game.&#65533;Freedom Force&#65533; could have been a decent game, just with the superheroes theme.  But, it is an excellent game, because of so many other things.  There is still a lot of unlocked potential here too.  An expansion pack, or a sequel, would be nice.  Buying this game is an easy recommendation to make.  At least find the demo somewhere.  That&#65533;s a no-brainer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2002"}

I rented it from Gamefly to try it out and I will have to say it surprised me.  I read a lot of previews before the game came out and I didn't expect to enjoy the gameplay as much as I did but I couldn't put it down.  The one reason I didn't buy is its not the type of game I would own since I don't see its staying power as far as me going back to it and playing over and over.  If I were to buy games based upon what I thought would be the great PS3 games than this would go in there.  I did notice there were a lot of parallels to Indigo Prophecy but I am glad there was nothing of a supernatural essence in it.  First off I will say make sure you stay with it since it does start off kind of slow but even with the slow beginning I could not stop trying to change the outcome of the mall scene.  Me being a father it kind of made me think about my own kids and how if something like that happened I would replay it in my mind constantly.  I even looked over at my wife while the scene took place and could tell it was shaking her up.  I will have to say they pulled the beginning off for me and kind of set the tone of the game.  I knew that since the beginning pulled me in like that than I might be in for a treat.  The overall story moves slow and I think I would of like two characters over the four but wow they pulled it off for me and now I am glad they made it that way.As far as music goes I absolutely loved it especially when something tense is going on to make the mood more intense.  The animation is kind of stiff since they kind of walk like robots and the kissing and making out looks kind of funny but I was more engrossed in the story to really care that much.  The controls are pretty good and I found that though it took a while to get use to I still enjoyed the game.  My wife is not a gamer and I think its simple enough she could play it and thats not necessarily a bad thing.  I found by the end I was thinking about all my decisions I had made and how things might of turned out differently so I really think what the creators were going for did its job.  I will need to say this but my friend at work told me that his favorite game of all time is COD MW 2 and I don't think he would like this type of game as much.  This is a game that I hope is the future of story telling for games and interaction as well.  Though MW2 may be a good game I am a big fan of almost any genre so I found it a welcome change.  Just do yourself a favor and don't expect guns blazing.  I found this a game I could set down with my wife and play and be completely engrossed in a way that I have not been in this generation of games.  Believe me I am close to twenty eight as of this review and have been gaming for about twenty four of that and I would have to say this is one I will remember for years to come.  Your whole life comes down to little and big decisions and the game pulled it off in the time that I was in that world.The game left me wanting more and I found myself with questions to unanswered parts of the game but now I find out there is dlc planned so that makes it o.k. with me. There are already plenty of reviews for this game so I won't go into mentioning what others have so I would say at least rent it and you might be surprised like I was.  An exclusive on PS3 that I am happy I invested the time in.  The PS3 doesn't have many exclusives but this one is a very welcome one nonetheless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2010"}

And I don't just mean because it's raining constantly.  The storyline is about drowned kids and the hunt for a serial killer.  Cheery. Toss in terrible parenting skills, flawed characters, crappy homes, a bunch of weirdos and horribly gruesome death scenes, you've got yourself a video game.You play as four different characters, which are all seriously flawed.  Ethan Mars, the rather whiney father that managed to lose not one but two of his kids. I doubt I would hire him as a babysitter. Norman Jayden (pronounced Nahman) the FBI agent that manages to irritate just about everyone with his Boston accent and crazy sunglasses that he sports in the dark and yet, no one ever mentions it. He also happens to have a drug problem. Madison Paige, the motorcycle-riding journalist that just happens to have a thing for Ethan and struts around like a stripper. She also has unexplained nightmares of masked men breaking into her home to murder her.  Charming, truly.  Scott Shelby, the aging, paunchy private eye that is the most likable character of them all.  Well, for a while at least.  Now, you do meet a few other characters, mostly stereotypical and mostly annoying.  Mad Jack, Paco and Blake come to mind but mostly Lauren I am looking at you.  These flaws make the main characters more realistic and if you do something that leads to their death, and believe me you can, you actually feel bad. Case in point, I got distracted by chip dip which led to the unfortunate demise of Madison at the hands of the sadistic doctor.  It was truly gruesome and horrible. Once I snapped my jaw shut, I replayed the chapter because well, I kind of missed her.Now, don't get me wrong, Heavy Rain has it's fair share of flaws.  The first couple of hours of the game are slow to say the least and the prologue is so boring it's actually painful. It gets much better as you move along but certain chapters still drag down the momentum.  Load times for a game of this nature are slow and while admiring the facial capture program may be interesting the first few times, it gets old quickly. Voice acting is hit or miss.  Hearing Ethan's deadpan \"JASON!\" while trekking through the mall, will leave your thumb off the X button permanently.  While the graphics look very good, the movement of the characters can appear wooden and switching camera angles often leaves your character walking around in choppy little circles or staring at walls. The characters still suffer from blocky, meaty looking hands and weird facial expressions or lack thereof.  There are also a few incidents when the rain effects continue even when you are inside.  Yes, despite the fact that Madison is sitting on a couch in a living room, there are still raindrops bouncing off her jacket. I knew that girl had a dark cloud hanging over her.  Also, as good as the backdrops are, you are limited to what you can interact with.  We don't want you getting off storyline now do we?This is not an action game so for those ripping the game to shreds due to game play, you should have done some research first.  The game play is comprised of tons of cut scenes. There is no hacking and slashing to be found.  Personally, I didn't mind it at all but there was this little game called Indigo Prophesy a few years back that made me discover the joy of NOT hacking and slashing everything and this is the natural and much improved progression of the genre.  Still, the QTE does leave a bit to be desired at times.  The fighting scenes are not fluid no matter how quickly you hit the buttons and for the love of God, can we please allow the option of RUNNING?  Oddly, there seems to be no real hurry in Heavy Rain, despite the desperate search for Shaun Mars who is up to his chin in rainwater.The game relies on player choices.  Your decisions directly effect the outcome and while there are 7 basic endings, there are over twenty variations.  Each play through is likely to change the outcome based on your ability to collect information, solve simple puzzles and ask the right questions.  If you don't find or complete something, the game remembers it and you'll just have to do without.  There are a few plot holes and characters that just pop up to offer exposition at just the right moment but overall they don't detract from the story.  The game also misleads you to the point of blatant lies that are not so convincingly explained away during a flashback sequence yet still we somehow overlook it in the name of gaming.The story is mostly solid and will keep you engaged (after that dreadful prologue and first few chapters) right up to the end.  You get attached to the characters and want them to succeed. When they die it's usually a gruesome and horribly violent death that will probably leave your jaw hanging.  Once dead, they are gone for good, there is no convenient respawing area or magical spell that will revive them.  The chapters are quite manageable and you can replay them at any time though back tracking can change the outcome. There are trophies to be had for completing certain quests though some seem tossed in there for no real reason...I get a trophy for watching the opening credits?  Really?  The difficulty level is rather easy and changing it to a harder setting doesn't really do much except give you a shorter window to respond in most cases.Bottom line, if you only like hack and slash, action or FPS games this is probably not for you.  If you like RPG games, you still may not like this as there is no level up system and try as you might, you will never learn a magical spell or become a member of the Thieving Elven Moose Clan.  If you like story driven games, where decisions matter this one plays like an interactive movie and you'll want to see the end, whichever end that may be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

It's a game, well more like a 20 hour interactive movie really, that takes place in a city where you get to see four different characters on their journey to solve a series of murders by who is known as the Origami Killer.I brought it home on a Friday night, and I didn't stop playing it until I beat the game Sunday afternoon. Granted there were large breaks in between to eat, sleep, and socialize, but when I was home I couldn't stop playing this game. It immerses you like nothing other. It was like reading a book that you just can't put down. No matter the flaws that I found with this game, the story line of this game totally involves you like a gritty TV series that keeps you tuning into the next episode.Granted the controls and movement are a bit clunky, but you get used to it after a while. The install and update is annoying as well, but it shows you how to do some origami while you're waiting. So you're not staring at an install screen for a half hour or however long it was. The beginning of the game is also a bit slow, but it's necessary to get you used to the control scheme of Heavy Rain. I also noticed some folks saying the video is choppy. I didn't see that, but I own one of the original PS3s, so maybe that had something to do with it. I'm also a lot more tolerant of frame rates than others, too. So I didn't see anything that would warrant a complaint as far as jerkiness in the frame rates would go. So those were my only complaints.I don't care what the negative reviewers say. I thought the acting in this game was phenomenal. The script was fantastic. I thought I had the whole thing figured out about half way through the story, and the end through me for a loop. The great thing about this game is that the movie can have a feel good ending to it if you want to(it did for me), or everything can go horribly wrong in the end. It truly is up to you how the events unfold throughout the game. I cared about all the characters, and even my wife towards the end of the game kept coming into the room to see what happened next.It's a gritty crime/mystery/thriller. Granted this is no action game. However, there are certainly parts that will get your heart racing. Overall, this is a game/movie that's supposed to make you think. Also, it's probably one of the easiest \"games\" you'll ever play, but you play this more for the story than you do for the gameplay. I also will admit that paying 60 bucks for this game may be a bit much. However, I also will say that if you own a PS3 that this a game you certainly should pop in and at least check it out. Give it a few hours of play, and if you're into the whole Crime/Thriller genre, you should love this game.On a side note, I should also mention that if you ever played the game Indigo Prophecy you'll find Heavy Rain to be very similar in how the game flows and plays. So depending on what you thought of that game, it may dictate what you think of Heavy Rain.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Gears of War + BioShock","reviewText":"When I played this it reminds me a lot of the following games:Gears of WarBioShockDead SpaceDark SectorThe game it reminds me the most is BioShock due to the art style not to mention the hand in front of you to use your abilities but the monsters remind me more of Dark Sector. Dead Space because sometimes it has that feeling like you're in space and the environment not to mention the very few (even even fewer done successfully) sudden scare tactics where something pops out. So while playing the game I wrote down a few things that went through my head. The game has mad potential but again the keyword is \"potential\". With a bigger budget and several key elements fixed, I would imagine this game to rival even those games listed (except dark sector because it was alright like this game).Some issues that I notice, but not all will be listed, are:1. Interaction with too many objects, especially at the beginning but throughout the game as well. Examples are abilities to open tons of desks which mostly have nothing. You just open it in hopes of maybe finding items. But that's like 1/10 desks? It's either you find nothing or you find items, I wish they made something pop out of it as well or something interesting to look at, things that kids keep? Same for opening lockers, nothing pops out to scare you or anything. Like \"oh here's another desk...X\" Reverting objects like boards with diagrams is another example since most diagrams are useless to you.2. One big failed key element that they could have used which BioShock did very successfully was lighting and sound. Got in front of a projector and you don't cast a shadow. In BioShock 2, seeing my shadow as I run by sometimes gave me a spook not to mention of course the enemies'.3. Scare Element. There's no 'panic moments' in this game because it's relatively easy and predictable. You can run around sharp corners without really fearing if there's something going to pop out or opening objects without the fear of something inside it or will be behind you afterwards. There's no real moment when you feel like you're rushed or there's tons of things out to get you if you don't watch out. You don't have to look behind you because pretty much every single time, the enemy is presented right in front of you. You finish them up, that's the end and you proceed to your next destination.4. Dead Lock is overpowered. Once you level it up, the game becomes even more of a cakewalk. Dead Lock is an ability that freezes time inside a sphere. Enemies inside are frozen while you go around and take your time aiming. Shotgun at point blank range most definitely means death with one shot. I know you can just fix this by NOT getting the ability but then you're being forced to not use a function of the game.5. Lame Weapons. The game can easily be beaten with the assault rifle and shotgun, not to mention they couldn't have thought up of cooler weapons to use...there really is no unique weapons in this game really. MiniGun, grenade launcher, bazooka, etc.....6. A lacking variety of enemies and methods in which you kill them. It's either you're fighting your typical soldiers with their typical weapons OR zombie like creatures. You take them all out pretty much the same way. Aim your weapon, shoot, dead. No huge strategy or variety of kill methods. No tactics. Mutant like creatures called Reverts who can only hear you and there's a hint that you can sneak around them. Why waste your time sneaking around them when you can one or two shot them with your shotty? Why try to sneak around and run the risk of making noise later and having all of them gang up on you? No tactics. You see enemy, you kill.7. I wish I could duck behind objects and shoot from the side like in Gears of War. The best you can do is crouch behind objects with your head sticking out.8. The level design that keeps you going forward makes it a bit annoying to me. Sometimes I like going around looking for secret passages, but end up going the right way and having the door shut behind me. Whenever you move forward and the game wants you to continue doing so, it'll just shut the door behind you. I would turn around and be like \"okay what the heck who shut that door?\". Not my fav. There's also a few times when the door shuts behind me and enemies come pouring in and I can't go back and am force to stand there shooting with no way out.9. The game should better explain why certain objects can have time shifts while other's can't. Like sometimes you use your TMD to revert time around to decay or recreate items such as bridges, etc, but why not that other bridge over there or that item over here? I know it's meant to steer you into the right direction, but as a player it makes me curious as to why not?10. On the 5th Section of the game, as you go across they let you kill tons of enemies like Radions and soldiers on the bridge below with your bazooka. But the thing is, you didn't need to. You could've just sat around and let them kill themselves down there and conserve your ammo. I don't fully understand the purpose of that part.11. Commonly found glitch of people floating up in the air. This happens a lot when you shoot someone and they don't die, do a rolling dodge move to their left or right and end up on top of an object or side of an object obviously not meant to be stood on.12. There's tons of notes throughout this game for you to find and read, but since they don't seem to help you in any real way, I skip them altogether.13. Upgrades look boring. Like when you upgrade your guns or TMD, it's not cooler or anything. You don't actually see any physical change.The trailer for this game made the game look a LOT better than it really is. It has huge potential, but it really seems like the game was cut way short and too many corners cut. The TMD element for time shifting looked great in the trailers, but in the game, it's not used to it's full potential. There's no real strategy in the use of it. Throughout the game all you really use the ability for is to rebuild or collapse stuff like bridges and locks. You can use it on enemies but why when a few bullets can take them out faster and easier. The TMD ability's potential use from a scale of 1-10, 10 being that the developers carefully and thoroughly incorporated into the game to maximize the gaming experience not to mention time shifting was the key selling point of the game....I'd give it a 3 or 4. It's used, but not to an impressive, revolutionary, game changing level.This game could have been AWESOME. Unfortunately, I'm doubting whether to ever play it again, maybe selling it back. Replay-ability is fairly low. Nothing unlocked after beating game nor can you keep stuff after beating it.Boss fights were alright but very rare and fairly weak. The ending left me feel empty. The supposedly suspenseful moments in the game just left me with a sarcastic grin at most. Such a shame. Thank god I got it used for 7 bucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2011"}

He spent time making his own levels and areas on games like World of Goo, Portal 2, and Minecraft more than he spent playing the core parts of the game. That was why I was pretty confident he was going to love this when I set it up so he could play.As expected, once he realized he could make his own tracks he pretty much lost interest in story mode and went wild with the creation tools. He picked up on how to make things very quickly and he loves the fact that other players from over the Internet can jump in and race on the tracks that he made and published.We've played it with both the standard PS3 controllers and with Move + steering wheel. Either way the controls are solid and work well.If you're planning to just play the races, I'd probably hold off and let this game age so that you can pick it up at a lower price and play through it. If you have someone who'll be playing who really adores building their own levels and tracks and all, the tools here are very good. In hours of play we've had absolutely no problems with crashes, so I assume they've patched the early issues out of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004W4QJ","description":"Three years ago, gamers were introduced to Aya as she resigned from the  New York Police Department and enlisted as a NMC (neo-mitochondrion creature)  hunter for the shadowy government organization M.I.S.T., a secret agency of  monster slayers somewhere betweenGhostbustersandMen in Black.  Wherever there was a neo-mitochondrion outbreak, Aya and her team were on the  scene to put the boots to the mutants. From the outset, it's evident that  SquareSoft revamped the entire game to give gamers a better looking, sounding,  and (most importantly) playing experience.The game starts with Aya training in the agency's shooting gallery in Los  Angeles. Just as she begins to get in a groove, she is asked to look into some  strange happenings at the Akropolis Tower. When she arrives on the scene, an  explosive, full-motion video flashes across the screen and showcases the death  and carnage as Aya surveys the scene. Her entry into the Tower is where this RPG  begins.SquareSoft has kept some of the excellent elements of the weapons systems from  the firstParasite Evetitle, but went for an entirely new battle system.  Combat is delivered in real time and allows players to run, hide, and open fire.  Aya can tap into her parasitic powers and can unleash elemental, magic-based  attacks on the many foes she encounters. Ammunition is plentiful in the game and  there are plenty of entertaining weapons to choose from. Auto targeting and  involving puzzles are back, though the arrow-pointing interface for solving  these puzzles is really hard to operate.The cinematic mix of story and action is very well done, and the numerous  cutscenes do an excellent job of moving the pace along in a believable way.Even though the originalParasite Evehad its problems, SquareSoft has  pieced together an excellent sequel that will satisfy fans of the first game and  help create many new ones.--Todd MowattPros:New, real-time battle system is an improvement over firstParasite  EveGreat weapons and plentiful ammunitionGreat mix of story and actionCons:Clunky interface for solving puzzles","reviewerName":"Tom D.H.","summary":"Great game.","reviewText":"This game symbolizes an era gone for me.

To be able to charge it through your console you have the buy the $25 play and charge kit which seems really unfair to me.

The game isn't marketed very well; it looks kiddish and cute.  And, to an extent, it is \"cute.\"  But if you can shrug off the fact that you are playing a female fairy, you will find this game to be an utter blast for the whole family.Kameo is a graphical powerhouse for Xbox 360.  It looks stunning.  There are times when I started playing and would just stare at the environment in wonder.  The opening level is absolutely stunning.  Hundreds of red dragons arc through the sky, trolls are climbing up huge castle parapets, fire explodes everywhere, and here you are climbing up a frozen ledge.  This level teaches you the basics of changing into your forms.  And this is what the game is all about.  There are 10 elemental warriors you can morph into.  In fact, you will hardly ever play as \"Kameo\" but you spend most of your time as the other huge creatures you can transform into with the push of a button.This transforming takes up the majority of the gameplay.  There are puzzles and enemies that will require one or more of your warriors to solve/beat.  As an example, in the first level you have access to an armadillo-type creature that can roll and a yeti-type creature that can climb surfaces.  One puzzle involved turning into the armadillo, speeding up off a ramp, transforming to the yeti in mid-air and then climbing up a wall with him.  That is a rather simple puzzle but is a good example of the type of gameplay found within.Enemies will sometimes require a specific character(s) to beat as well.  An early instance of this are trolls who have shield in front of them.  You can use Rubble's lob ability to toss a rock behind the enemy and as the rock rolls back to you, it will hit the enemy from behind and allow you to pummel him.I've already touched on the graphics, but I want to again reiterate that they are terrific.  They easily show what the 360 can do, sometimes with 100s of trolls, elves, dragons and \"tanks\" on the screen at one time, real time, with Kameo charging through the midst on horseback.  Stunning.  And not even a hint of lag.The sound is well done, as well.  The voices are decent, the sound effects are great and the music in the background is stunningly beautiful.Kameo is about a 10 or so hour game, give or take.  But it is incredibly fun and can be enjoyed by almost any gamer, regardless of age.  I would definitely recommend picking this one up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47TE","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Another Masterpiece by Kojima","reviewText":"I was very hesitant to buy this game as I did not like the previous Metal Gear games on PSP that much, but then Hideo Kojima said he was deeply involved in this project and the reviewers gave it pretty good scores so I recently decided to give it a shot. After playing it and finishing it once with most of the extra missions (25+ hrs and still playing), here is what I thought.****************PROS.****************AN ACTUAL MGS TYPE OF GAMEPLAY ON PSP: The best thing about Metal Gear Solid games is its gameplay. Unlike most games where run and gun gameplay is promoted, in metal gear games sneaking gameplay is highly encouraged, but if you are not big on sneaking then you can always run and gun. I am so happy to see that Peace Walker carries on this legacy and allows player to choose how they want to play.SMARTLY DESIGNED CONTROLS: So how do you play third person shooter on PSP which only has one analogue stick? Well this game has very smartly designed shooter controls that make use of (O, X, Square, Triange) buttons as second analogue stick and still delivers shooter type of experience. At first you may find it difficult to use, but once you get used to them, you will love them. If not, there are two other control formats, so chances are at least one of them will work for you.VARIETY IN MISSIONS AND SCENARY: The story of this game progresses through you completing different missions. I have to say these missions are very nicely designed. While completing the game you will go through jungles, villages, factories and more (don't want to spoil). While going through these areas you will encounter variety of enemies and will be forced to do many different tasks to progress through the story. I have to say there hasn't been a single time I felt why I am doing this or that mission. For most part they were quite fun.PLENTY OF SIDE MISSIONS: In additions to main missions, you will be encouraged to do plenty of side missions. Completing these side missions will reward you with variety of things. See the below section for more detail.LOADS AND LOADS OF EXTRA GAMEPLAY: So throughout the games doing missions and side missions you are expected recruit people and create your own army. The major characters will get recruited in your army automatically as you progress through the game. As for the rest of them, you have to knock out enemy soldiers and prisoners and send them using helium balloon. I know it sounds corny, but it is quite humorous when you play it. And then you can use these recruits to complete different missions, develop different weapons, wage wars etc. etc. There is just so much to do. This game will truly surprise and please you.ENJOYABLE BOSS FIGHTS: Bosses in this game are simply spectacular. They will range from military vehicles such as tanks and choppers to devastating Metal Gears. Simply put boss fights are strategic in nature and defeating them is quite rewarding. And when I say rewarding it is just not as entertainment value, but depending on how you defeat these bosses you can make use out of them. For example, if you defeat military vehicles the right way you can salvage them, add them to your army and deploy them in extra missions. Same with defeating Metal Gear, depending on how you defeat them you can salvage their parts and use them to make your own Metal Gear. Awesome right?WEAPONS AND GADGETS: To complete these different missions and side missions, you will have access to variety of weapons and gadgets. Some of these include but are not limited to tranquilizer gun, sniper rifle, various machine guns and heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, radar, sound indicator and the list goes on. Not all of them are available in the beginning. You will have to unlock them of course by growing your army.UPGRADES: All of these weapons as well as your staff can be upgraded. This adds an RPG element to the game and really encourages you to replay your missions, do better on them and grow your staff. This adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay.GREAT STORY, DECENT VOICE ACTING AND COMIC BOOK STYLE CUTSCENES: If you have played other MGS games than you know all the Hideo Kojima games have amazing stories. They won't always make sense, but as you go through them you sure as hell enjoy them. In this game such story is accompanied by decent voice acting and portrayed mainly through comic-book style depiction. I personally loved it and found it quite artistic.REPLAY ANYTHING YOU WANT: To me this is an awesome addition. You can replay any mission or any cutscene over again. So if you missed something or if you didn't perform well in a cutscene you can relive those moments and collect anything you have missed without having to play whole game again. Marvelous just marvelous!ONLINE CO-OP GAMEPLAY: I am not much into online play, but if you have a buddy with PS3, you can co-op play a lot of the missions, trade your soldiers and do a whole lot of things.KOJIMA HUMOR: This can be hit or miss. There are many moments in the game where you will encounter weird humor. I would describe it to you, but truly don't want to ruin it for you guys. I personally found it funny, but I can't say for sure for you.**************CONS.*******************MEANT TO BE MUCH BIGGER (OUTER OPS): Don't get me wrong this game is amazing and you will love it. But while playing it you will get the feeling that this game was meant to be much bigger than it is. It could have been meant for PS3 with a lot more stuff added to it. For example, in outer ops section you simply deploy your troops/mechs/metal gear and do nothing else. Knowing Kojima he probably planned something better for it (i.e. deploy it and then strategically use them to beat enemies). It is hard to describe, but if you are a Kojima fan, you will see what I am saying.****************CONCLUSION********************Simply put, I have enjoyed Peace Walker as much if not more as any other MGS. It is a must buy for MGS fans and if you are not a fan you should still give it a shot. Chances are it will sweep you off your feet. Contrary to the con I described, I give it 10/10. Giving it anything less just seems very unfair. Bravo Kojima Bravo.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}

It is regarded as one of the best video games ever and still holds up after all these years. In 2002, Nintendo continues their \"Super Mario Advance\" series by releasing a port of the classic SNES title under the name, Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2. It's a spot on port with some updates such as an intro not included in the original title, the inclusion of the Mario Bros game from the first Advance title, Luigi as a playable character and some unlockable settings after you meet certain conditions.The PROS: It's exactly like the classic SNES game so the graphics, sounds, music and controls are just like you remembered. The updates add more spark to the game overall and it makes the fact that you can take it on the go even better.The CONS: The Mario Bros game that comes with this title is exactly like the one from the first Super Mario Advance title so you're not missing anything. It would have been nice if they added more game play function but they didn't and it's better to play it with some of your friends than by yourself. A minor gripe but I had to speak upon it.If you missed your chance the first time getting this game for the GBA, then you'll have to search for it. Unfortunately, there is some serious price gouging for this particular title so unless the price is not high, get a used copy instead. Alternatively, you can get the original off of the Virtual Console service for $8, which is a fair price. Either way, Nintendo fans own this for one reason only: because it's fun to play and if you missed out, this port is worth hunting down. I highly recommend it so get your copy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

What kind of mario game uses vegetables to attack enemies? Yeah its true, Mario gets vegetable from the ground to throw them to his enemies. The only good thing about this game is the choosing of characters, you can choose from 4 different characters.Two months later i saw a T.V. AD on a new mario game called Super Mario World.

Conker is cute and fun to play. I could not wait for its release and was not disappointed.I did'nt play the original version so this xbox version is new to me.  My only complaint about the game is that it's near impossible to get through most levels without some type of online walk through or the strat guide.  The game developers came up with some rediculious puzzles to complete.  Who would ever think you would have to bounce up and down off a sunflowers huge (and I do mean gigantic) knockers to reach an unseen cave from ground level.Once you know what to do or where to go the game play is fairly easy.

Orr","summary":"This Generation's Best Game","reviewText":"With relatively few decent PlayStation 3 exclusives, the arrival of the sequel to 2007's \"Uncharted\" comes as a welcome boost to not only the Sony console but to any gamers wanting a highly accomplished action adventure game.\"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves\" is simply one of the best current generation games available, and at its best moments is worthy of comparison to the finest moments in any game from videogame history. Superbly paced, with masterful attention to detail, characterisation and presentation, \"Uncharted 2\" is an object lesson in how to create a highly immersive, cinematic experience.Fundamentally, the game takes the screwball elements of classic Hollywood, blends it with the inspired nonsense of Indiana Jones and lumps in a riveting gameplay experience. The silly plot is by the way, but the crackling, knowing dialogue between rough diamond Nathan Drake and both his romantic companions and his enemies is possibly the sharpest in any videogame. Of course, the lively interplay would mean nothing if the action wasn't compelling, but developer Naughty Dog have managed to create a game that is intensely varied, exciting and brilliantly paced: the swinging, jumping, shooting and running pace never drops for the entirety of its twenty-sex chapters.In terms of graphics- \"Uncharted 2\" is the best-looking console game ever released. Textures, colour and details are astonishing: from the wrecked houses of Kathmandu to parakeets in the rainforests , from hidden gilded temples to jungle ruins, it is apparent that Naughty Dog have carried out their research to a painstaking degree. Cutscenes and character rendering are generally fantastic (except Drake's oddly goggle-eyed blonde love interest), and really push the plot along quickly (take note, Hideo Kojima). Music is lushly orchestral but usually unobtrusive, and creates a pulsing, dynamic intensity to gameplay.In terms of gameplay, Drake moves elegantly. Climbing, jumping and running are neatly handled, with most moves being easy to perform successfully: for example, if Drake is standing on a ledge with a platform nearby, chances are the jump is fully possible, even if it does not appear so at first. AI enemies are not the smartest, but they are not the usual dumb fare found in these types of games. Your AI partners generally stay out of the line of fire and carry out their tasks admirably.\"Uncharted 2\" is probably the best game of this generation, insofar as it delivers a brilliantly polished package comprising action, adventure and brilliant story-telling, all capped with astounding visuals and a stirring score. It is the first PlayStation 3 exclusive which requires anyone who doesn't own the console but loves games to buy it immediately -along with a copy of this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2009"}

Everything about it is great.  The graphics.  The cut scenes.  The weapons.  The setting.  The story.  But ten minutes into it I got to the first boss battle and it was brutal.  Could not for the life of me figure it out to proceed to the next level.  And I even had the silly thing on the easiest difficulty level.  So I went to some online walk through guides.  But those were very sparse.  Then I pulled up Youtube for a visual assist.  There is only one video so I clicked on it; sat through 12min only to see that guy also die repeatedly then fail.  Nobody else really is playing this game.  Sega barely sold many copies.  And the worst part is they put this out as a demo first.  They should have listened to the feedback and dialed down the difficulty level.  I'll admit I'm not that good at games.  But I don't pay $30 to find out how terrible I am.  I play so I can put it on easy, blow through the enemies and see the whole game.  That's how I get my fun.

Tthis game is nothing like the other resident evils there are way too many quick time events, explosions and cut scenes. I can't understand how the developers let this game go down this path soo far from what made the residents evil series from Zero all the way to four so great including code veronica which was my favorite. The storyline made no sense to me even when I played the other characters to see their point of view. The controls had my character moving all over the place plus the cover system and dodge were awful. Did I mention how many annoying quick times events there are in this game? The game follows this pattern the entire time &#34;Cut scene - Explosion - Qte - Cut scene - explosions - Qte&#34; rinse and repeat over and over again.

I will maintain that those of you familiar with SSX3 will feel right at home; it's essentially the same gameplay as SSX3 and with the same control features, but with better graphics.  Keep in mind that this is a ONE Player-per-Console game (Multi-player is through online network only); apparently, the days of actually being able to play split-screen with a friend in the same room are fading out.  It bears repeating, as other commenters have pointed out, that about half of the slopes are insanely difficult; instead of tearing through the mountain having fun racing and flipping tricks, you will quickly become aggravated by just staying on narrow courses without falling into a bottomless pit on either side and \"dying\".  For that reason, I've dropped this game down to 3 stars (if I can only enjoy half the game, then the game gets half the rating).Other minor negatives that should be addressed: for one, the in-game music sucks.  For those of us who are aging, old-school, video game nerds the trendy music will drive you up the wall; HOWEVER, EA did install a feature allowing you to play music from your Xbox harddrive playlist to substitute the teenybopper music they integrated into the game. :).  If you are online and connected to \"RiderNet\" (EA's game network) expect long load times even if you have broadband.  The NPC interjecting found in SSX3 is also gone, leaving the characters feeling a little shallow, stale, and \"cold\".  But, if you're in it just for the ride and you don't mind a challenge then SSX is a fantastic pick worth plenty of hours of gameplay!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Can't live without them","reviewText":"A memory card is a memory card is a memory card. Right?Well... not when it comes to Sony's PS Vita because it only likes Sony's own, proprietary kind. I can understand why bootlegging concerns compelled Sony to desgin Vita with a proprietary interface but I'm not happy with Sony taking advantage of us captive customers, charging us significantly more than the 'free market' of equivalent standard cards.These being said, the card performs well in our brand new game machine wonder. It was recognized instantly and it was easy to dump some content (music) and our first game saves on it. Taking the super-tiny square (0.5\" x 0.5\") out of the oversized packaging was no easy feat because the card is so thin and fragile but this 16GB storage extender made into the Vita safely and we're happy now.As for whether a memory card is needed or not, see my review title. You can't fully experience the Vita without a memory card because there seems to be very little internal storage. You can probably get away with a 4GB/8GB if you expect to buy most games on physical media and won't be using the Vita for taking pictures or storing hundreds of songs. If you expect to buy lots of games online, I'd go with the 16GB/32GB so I wouldn't worry about managing my storage, at least for a while.The memory card is great and it works flawlessly but I'm going to rate it as a 3-star (It's Okay) and not a 5-star mainly because it's so overpriced plus one additional slight demerit for it being relatively difficult to take out of the packaging._______________________________NOTETo help decide what size you need, these are Sony's estimates of what you can hold on a 16GB card:* 4-8 full games* 12 movies* 4,568 songs* 3,200 photos","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2012"}

After starting it up and trying to play for a bit I kinda found it to be kinda boring in a way. Not only did it take a while for me to get used to the controls but the story didn't really do it for me. I played for a while but it just wasn't much fun. Idk what it was. Maybe the fact the weapons only seemed to be good for 20-30 seconds before having to get new ones or that there wasn't much of a story. Or maybe something else. I tried to get into this game but I ended up shelving it after an hour or two. Maybe I will come back to it later on and find it more fun but it just didn't do it for me this time and when you have other games that look more fun ready to be played you kinda don't want to force yourself to play a game that isn't much fun.It kinda made me want a new Vigilante 8 for this generation or something (but not that x-box live arcade version that looked like garbage). The old ones on the N64 are still fun with interesting plots and great 70's music. So far Blur (which the company went under while trying to make a sequel which blows cause the first game was awesome and second ones videos looked amazing), and split second are so far the only 2 racing type games that are close to this type of genre which are kinda fun. Blur being the better of the two so I suggest checking those out and telling your friends cause those games need the support.Well that's it from me I might update this review in the future if I play it again anytime soon but until then that's it.

Rhodes","summary":"Poor Characterization Plague What Might've Otherwise Been an Interesting Story","reviewText":"When Metroid Other M was originally announced it made quite a stir.  It was a curious being.  Mainly because no one really knew much about it at the time.  The only thing we knew right up front was that Samus was going to be given a voice.  This was something made us all curious but, for the most part we sat back and waited.  In the end, Metroid Other M didn't work out quite as well as I had hoped.  It isn't that Samus has a voice that's the problem.  It is primarily what that voice is used to do and how Samus is characterized.  And we'll get to that momentarily.  Metroid Other M isn't an all around terrible game.  There are some aspects that are quite good.  Gameplay wise, that is.  It's the story and presentation of that story which suffer.Metroid is primarily known as a video game which provides a lot of narrative through gameplay.  Those who played Super Metroid previously understand this.  The game carries a tale and even has one of the most heartwarming moments in video games.  It's delivered without extensive cutsceenes and drowning us out in talk.  Metroid Other M dispatches with that and provides a story told primarily through cutscenes.  Yeah, much of the narrative is still there and I actually rather liked that Metroid would take a slightly cinematic approach.  The problem with said approach, however, is that much of the story is told through the voice of a monotone Samus who, for the most part... just isn't that vibrant to listen to.  And through the story we fail to learn much of anything about the other characters in it.  Many of Samus's cutscenes involve long drawn out monologues that explain things to us that the game could be showing us... or better yet, letting us actually play and experience.  What compounds this more is that you can't skip any of the cutscenes.  If you get into a battle and lose you'll have to sit through the preceding cutscene once again.What also compounds this is that the game limits itself primarily to Samus without really exploring the other characters.  It's hard to care about the other characters when something happens to them when we've learned nothing about them.  But even Samus's relationship with Adam isn't fully fleshed out.  This is a man that is supposed to be the most important man in Samus's life but this particular relationship is hardly reinforced through the game.  When we see Adam it's mostly him barking orders.  But there's hardly a moment where we see the two connect.  We have Samus explain to us how much she admires Adam but we never really see this come forth... except through Samus giving a thumbs down as a sign of respect.The last aspect of the story that takes a backseat through all this is Samus herself.  This is one of the hardest characters to really provide a lot of personality for because this a character who has earned her entire development and reputation through gameplay mostly.  When it comes to Metroid Other M, Samus is portrayed as quite a different character than many of us who have played previous games (and read the comics) have come to understand.  Samus expressing the kind of doubt in herself that she does seems distinctly out of character given how many times she's put herself in danger for the sake of the galaxy.  Some may argue that Samus wasn't much of a character before, but I have to wonder how much time they invested in Metroid to come to this conclusion.  Just because Samus didn't have a voice didn't mean she wasn't actually a character.  As I said, Metroid did a lot of its narrative through gameplay.  We learned things about her through the tasks we have come to perform through the series.  Samus wasn't a perfect character by any stretch.  In Super Metroid we watched her take on a very powerful Mother Brain she wasn't fit to destroy all by herself.  In Metroid Fusion we see how Samus must avoid the SA-X because she isn't strong enough (and the game reinforces this any time you fight her by showing that she can destroy you easily).  Metroid Fusion even gives us a glimpse into Samus's mind by showing us that Samus actually prefers to work alone.  It's part of the reason she's a bounty hunter.  Because she's able to work for herself.  And I also have a hard time believing that a character such as Samus would express doubt in herself when confronting the Space Pirates when she has already done this numerous times before.But in Metroid Other M we see her doing things like... refusing to use LIFE SAVING procedures just because Adam hasn't authorized that she could.  This contradicts the Samus we've come to know.  The one who has been shown to us through gameplay, and through some of the narrative that the series has presented thus far.  At least in previous Metroid games Samus had the abilities but lost them and had to regain them... or simply didn't have them at all.  But here it's that she has all these abilities... Adam just restricts her from using them.  Meaning that even in moments where Samus's life is on the line she refuses to save herself because Adam won't authorize it.  Even for players who are okay with how Samus is portrayed in Metroid Other M, this is something that even on a design level makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.That's not to say Metroid Other M is absolutely terrible.  It's only to say that the execution of what it does is not that great.  From the outset if someone just told you what the game was about you might actually find it interesting or even worth looking into.  It is the portrayal of Samus and the way the story presents itself that's hard to swallow.  Metroid Other M, as a result, is a game we can say has \"potential,\" but doesn't own up to it.Gameplay wise, Metroid Other M plays quite different.  It's a lot of fast paced action that's easy to sink into.  There are moments where it's actually a lot of fun, but even here you can see a few flaws that might not have had to happen.  You'll hold your Wii Remote like a gamepad.  You'll run through several corridors blasting away at the enemies while exploring your environments.  It's here that Metroid Other M begins to feel like Metroid.  At least to some degree.  The game is pretty linear.  You'll always know where to go and be kept on task.  And while enemies are crawling all over they're definitely not hard to dispatch at all.  Metroid Other M is a surprisingly easy game for the most part.  The boss fights might have some complexity but Metroid Other M is not going to really test your mettle.  You even have the ability to refill some of your health when you're really low.  This is inviting to those who haven't experienced Metroid, but series veterans might not have a lot of trouble getting through the game at all.You can also go into first person to blast away some of the bad guys and look around.  You can do this simply by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen.  Metroid Prime this is not, though.  You can't move around in first person.  You can only shoot.  It seems kind of odd that we can't do a little running around or at least dodging attacks while in this mode.Metroid: Other M is a simple game to play overall.  And at points the gameplay is even a lot of fun to behold.  It is the execution of its story and the treatment of its characters (not just Samus) that really hurt Metroid: Other M.  You'll more than likely be able to play through it just fine, but it's hard to absorb the story it's trying to tell.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

Basically free-roaming super-powered questing and hidden item collecting in NY City and suburbs... sadly though the original Prototype fell into serious repetition quickly and, whilst it was fun for a while, there was only so much entertainment gleaned from blowing up water towers and fighting the same old infected bad guys in enclosed buildings.Thankfully P2 removes a lot of the tedium of the first and has learned a lot from the prequel's mistakes. Gone, for the most part, are identically infested government buildings, instead replaced by quite varied missions often played out outside in the free expanse of the city. There's still a few missions where you have to go inside but again this is where P2 improves on P1 in so much as the covert way you can slide in and out completely unseen rather than go in guns blazing. The 'hunt' feature where you can track down your quarry where ever they may be along with the ability to see who is observing you makes for some fun Splinter Cell type missions where bonuses can be had for not alerting anyone during the mission. Happily the designers won't punish you for getting caught by ending the mission and no quest, aside from the box collecting, is timed so you're allowed a chance to breath and plan your attack at your leisure. I really enjoyed almost all of the many missions the three islands had to offer and the upgrades that your protagonist Heller can earn added so much to the fun factor too. There's something awesome about jumping off the tallest building in the city and gliding and 'air dashing' from almost one side of Manhattan to the other!Graphically things have had a major overhaul with Chinatown and Times Square et al looking quite peachy. The water reflective effects and weather is a nice addition and the architecture has been given a much needed boost in the polygon department.The storyline progresses predictably and is told via scores of epileptic-inducing pre-rendered (and sometimes live action) slash-cut scenes but doesn't really pull you in. Also gone are the challenges found in the first such as the base-jumping and rooftop races. There is a one time use code to open 'Radnet' which apparently offers some weekly challenges but judging by the messages, that option could end in July so I'm not sure how much that adds to the game at this point.I also was disappointed with the last boss battle in how restrictive it was - you can't even use your awesome special moves that you spent a lot of time earning... shame really but not a sufficient reason not to enjoy the rest of the game for what it is.If you liked the first one then ultimately you won't be disappointed with Prototype 2 at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2012"}
