Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"4.5 stars - Sonic 3, Part 2: Special lock on-cart edition!","reviewText":"Sonic & Knuckles(1994). The fourth Sonic game on the Genesis (or 2nd half of the third, if you prefer to call it that).Once upon a time, Sega became a worthy 16-bit contender in the early 90s thanks to the release of a fast-paced adventure starring everyone's favorite blue hedgehog, Sonic. Then the series really took off in 1992 with the release and success of its sequel. The Sega CD harbored Sonic CD, a worthy cult classic, though for some reason it became forgotten over time. This brings us to \"Hedgehog Day\" of 1994, when Sonic 3 was unleashed on the public. Originally, the game was slated to be one massive adventure, but in order to meet deadlines, Sega decided to cut it in half, give the fans the first part of the game early on, and save the rest of it for a later date in the year. In the meantime, Sega also thought about incorporating a special \"lock-on\" feature to this second half of the 3rd Sonic game which allowed one to stick Sonic 2 and 3 on top of it, and it would change the game to a certain degree. Of course, lock on technology was nothing new (*cough* Game Genie *cough*), but this was the first time that it was incorporated for a specific purpose, more of which I'll get into soon.So this time, Sonic must traverse the rest of Angel Island after bringing down the Death Egg (again) onto a volcano and stop Dr. Robotnik once and for all. However, Tails is gone for this round in place of being able to play as Knuckles the Echidna for the first time. He taunted and tricked you all throughout Sonic 3, but now you can rip through the stages as him, or get your revenge on him at last with Sonic. Either way, S&K; holds up as its own giant adventure, with the same size of levels, graphics engine, powerups, and other features as the previous game. I've covered the basics of the game in my Sonic 3 review, so I'll just go into the new stuff here:PROS-LOCKING ONTO THE OLDER GAMES GIVES THEM A NEW FRESH REPLAYABILITY. Stick it onto Sonic 2, and now you're traversing the Casino Nights, Hill Tops, and Wing Fortresses of old as Knuckles given the advantage of his new abilities. However, stick it onto Sonic 3 and you'll get the massive adventure that Sega wanted to release all along - in other words THE BIGGEST AND BEST SONIC GAME EVER CONCEIVED. Play as all three of the furballs going through both games and collecting 14(!) chaos emeralds to become... HYPER SONIC! On top of that, stick it onto Sonic 1 or any other Genesis game and you'll now have access to unlimited random Special Stages styled from Sonic 3.-KNUCKLES IS A NICE ALTERNATIVE TO PLAY AS FROM THE OTHERS. He doesn't fly like Tails or jump as high as Sonic, but his glide, climbing, and smashy fists enable him to reach places that the others can't get to. Plus, a lot of the areas of certain zones that you traverse are completely different from Sonic's.-COOL NEW BONUS STAGES. There are two of them now, and are far easier to access as well. One is an energy sphere magnetic place where you have to reach the top, and the other is a combination of Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2 and the Special Stages of Sonic 1.-EXCELLENT MUSIC HERE! I'd forgotten how awesome S&K;'s music actually is, and is overall a step up from Sonic 3's. None are bad here and they seem closer to Sonic 2's soundtrack, especially the Flying Battery, Sky Sanctuary, and Death Egg themes.-THE ZONES ARE VARIED FROM PREVIOUS GAMES. Yes, there is another volcano zone, but now you can explore new areas like the massive tombs of Sandopolis, the flying ruins of Sky Sanctuary, and the inner sanctums of the giant Death Egg ship. Plus now you get to take out the giant Flying Battery ship which attacked you near the beginning of Sonic 3. Strangely, this seems to be the only Sonic game without a water zone, which renders the Bubble shield useless, but oh well. In contrast, you will find more use out of the fire shield though.-PERHAPS THE BEST FINAL BOSSES OF ANY SONIC GAME. There are a bunch of them to take out near the end, and when you collect all the chaos emeralds, you can go through a special Doomsday Zone as Super Sonic. Plus, Knuckles has more difficult versions and some original bosses of his own to fight, so it never gets boring.CONS-Since this is technically the other half of Sonic 3, THERE ISN'T A WHOLE LOT OF NEW STUFF FOR SONIC'S ADVENTURE. Pretty much Sonic has all the same attacks, animations, and powerups as in Sonic 3, and now with Tails gone, his reaching abilities are hindered. His absence is fixed, however, by locking it onto Sonic 3.-THE SAVE FEATURE FROM SONIC 3 IS SORELY MISSED. With as massive as the levels are, being able to save after Sandopolis Zone Act 2 would be nice, but again, this problem is remedied after locking it onto Sonic 3.-NO CHANGE OF SPECIAL STAGES HERE. Basically, these new ones are simply styled after the Sonic 3 SS's.Don't let the 4 stars deter you at all. S&K; is certainly one of the most memorable Sonic games of all, and if you liked Sonic 3, then I see no reason for you NOT to like this one. As a whole, Sonic 3 & Knuckles deserves its full 5 stars, so whether you want to find their original carts, or just play them on PC or the new Sonic Mega Collection, find them any way you can because these are some of the best 2D games that defined an age of gaming.

Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"an above-average action-RPG for the XBox","reviewText":"Sudeki was a game that I've been waiting for over a year to buy, but after some delays and finetuning of the game it is finally out and I was finally able to play it. This game is more in the action-rpg style than the turn-based Final Fantasy type games that has been popular the last 7-8 years.The XBox is not known for having a large library of roleplaying-games like the PS2, or the PS1 for that matter. But Sudeki is an above-average addition to this very limited library. Its not a classic and nigh-perfect rpg like 2003's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic or as expansive and open-ended like Morrowind, but Sudeki still satisfies enough to make this game a good choice until Knights of the Old Republic 2 comes out.First let's get the downside out of the way.* The game is too short. It could've been even better if they used a plot and storyline that was abit more complex and detailed.* Some of secondary NPCs are used as subplot threads which doesnt seem to pan out or is just dropped altogether.Outside of those two negatives, Sudeki succeeds in delivering a satisfying game. The battle system is unique in that a player can switch from one of four characters in the group in mid-battle. This helps in making sure that characters being controlled by the AI can be switched over to player-control if they need to be micromanaged. One of the out-of-the-box changes they made to this rpg that other rpgs dont have is the fact that characters who uses long-range attacks switch to first-person perspective when player-controlled. This may be abit disconcerting for players who are not used to playing FPS-type games, but for fans of FPS shooters like HALO, Half-Life and Counter-Strike, this would be an easy transition.Sudeki's graphics has to be one of the best out there not on PC that's using a high-end system. The framerate remains constant even during heavy battles where the screen is full of combatants and spell effects. Unlike most rpgs that uses two different graphic engines to show game footage and cutscenes, Sudeki uses the same engine. Sudeki looks like one long cutscene. One only knows a cutscene is on the screen because the in-game graphics engine gets a dream-like quality to it. The look of the game also has more than a tad of Japanese anime mixed in with Western-stylings.The sound for Sudeki has 5.1 Dolby Digital capabilities. This is a good bonus for XBox owners who have their system hooked up to a 5.1 surround system. The one thing about the sound for Sudeki that impressed me wasn't for when the game got all action and hectic but during the slower and quaint scenes. This works very well on 5.1 DD.For fans of rpgs and who own an XBox, this is a good game to get. For casual rpg gamers, you may want to rent this game instead due to its somewhat short gameplay. I still recommend it for both type of gamers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2004"}

However, I gave Ace Combat 4 a try simply because it was cheap.  Frankly I just don't like these 3D 'shooter' games; I'm a hardcore 2D shooter fan-however...Wow... this game just blew me away since from early missions to the very AWESOME last mission...  I didn't expect much from this 'flight simulator'...  This game literally reminded me of Ridge Racer R4 after finishing it.  Ridge Racer R4 was a great game because they added this simple story to an already great driving game with perfect jazzy music; Namco did exactly same thing to Ace Combat 4 by adding this narrative story aspect, which seems to be the winning combination for Namco.  Game would've been a great mission-based game without the story.  However, it would take this incredible 'experience' aspect away from the game.Early missions are easy enough for anyone to engage...however, it becomes harder toward the end (I had to retry COUNTLESS times..ok, may be it's just me..) Once you get to the half way, you have to face 'updated' objective after accomplishing first objective.  And I clearly remember this one mission where you have to destroy all the solar panels.  You get updated objective after done so, which is that you have to fly below 2000ft in order to survive...(and the only way is to fly through the valley, while being chased by enemy jets) and oh my gosh- my palms were sweating and my eyes were literally glued to the screen with my utmost concentration- and let me ask you this; how many games have ever made you to give your 100% concentration these days?

{"product_name":"B0009XEC02","description":"Third installment of the popular SRPG series.  First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Great game, and incredible replay value","reviewText":"Advance Wars Dual Strike is a turn based strategy game that pits your army against varying commanding officers in a series of battles over a vast array of landscapes.  Its lighthearted nature (many of the commanding officers are quite young and speak in slang) makes it appropriate for kids, but don't let this lightheartedness mask what is an incredibly deep and very enjoyable game.The basic concept of Advance Wars is simple--you play as a CO (commanding officer) and are given control of an army during a battle.  You're up against a CO of the Black Hole Army and can win the battle either by destroying all your enemy's combat units or by taking over their headquarters.  The maps have varying terrain that adds an element of complexity to the fights (forests you can hide in, mountains from which some units can see long distances, etc) and forces you to deploy and move your units strategically, and you can take over cities and factories along the way to boost your resources and unit production capability.A new concept in Dual Strike (I believe this is the 3rd Advance Wars game, though this is the first I've played) is the dual CO battle.  Fairly early on in the campaign mode you're introduced to the concept of a tag team battle where you've got control of 2 COs and can switch them and use them for their varying abilities (Dual Strike features a whole slew of COs, each with special abilities and attributes that can aid you in battle) during the course of the fight.  This adds yet another element of depth to an already complex game.Advance Wars: Dual Strike features several single player modes of play, a multiplayer mode, and an option to create your own maps.  The gameplay really is incredibly deep as your COs improve over the course of several hours of play (and remember, there are many COs).  This is a very deep game, and should provide many hours of entertainment.PROS:-The combat system is simple, intuitive, and easy to use.  It takes very little time to get the hang of, yet the battles can and do get incredibly complex.-The maps are easy to navigate, and stylus is used very well to click on and move your units around the battlefield with incredible ease.-The many modes of gameplay, vast array of COs, and map creating options give this game a lot of staying power--this isn't one you'll play a couple times and then leave alone.-Even though its a war game the content is appropriate for people of all ages.-CO abilities add even more depth to the strategy of the game, and the dual CO option (and the ability to launch combo attacks with both of them) makes the battles even more fun.-Some of the battles can be fairly quick, meaning you can pick it up and play a battle even if you don't have much time to play.CON:-The slang some of the COs use gets tiresome quickly and the dialogue is, overall, pretty lousy.  It's annoying, but the rest of the game is so good that it's not hard to overlook.As of this writing this game is pretty difficult to find, even used.  If you see it, though, give it a shot--this is a classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2007"}

In some missions, I think controlling drone aircraft is a cheap and fast way to finish a mission. I prefer to go all rambo and kill everybody myself than to use missiles from the drone.Anyway, here are some things I wish I was able to do in this game:1) Lean or peak around corners. Seriously, who attacks an enemy with their full body exposed? You can crouch or go prone, but you are still exposed to enemy fire.2) I would like to jump over stuff. Of course, if they put this in there, you might fall off the map. lol3) Ability to take cover behind objects and shoot your gun over the object. For example, if you hide behind a car, you have to stand up or move away from the car to shoot. I prefer to stay crouch and covered behind the car and shoot while taking cover. I guess you can push the buttons to stand up to shoot and crouch to take cover again, but thats too much work.Bottom line: You are better off renting this game because it only takes less than a week to finish the campaign.

Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"A mixed bag of fun and flaws","reviewText":"I think being an rpg fan allowed me to enjoy this game despite its numerous flaws.For starters, the main storyline was unimaginative and mediocre at best. Ironically, some of the optional side quests seemed to have more thought out story lines. The animation in this game is poor and fails to keep up with the storyline, ex- you are shown wearing the same crappy armor in animations regardless of what you have acquired and are actually wearing. The endings in this game just plain suck. They are short, unsatisfying and make little sense. The voice acting and dialogue in this game is the worst I've ever seen. I cannot stress that enough. It's so bad it gets comical, although I'm sure that was not the intent. The game does not level up foes to match your character, so the game starts out really hard, where its difficult to kill even the weakest enemy. But then after leveling up enough the games gets really easy and you can kill most anything with one or two hits.Despite all this I actually enjoyed my playthrough, and the game did some things well. The game play graphics are actually pretty good and there is ample opportunity to level up and to acquire weapons and armor. This game has unique feature I liked where you could combine the same weapon or armor types to make a stronger version. There is a large map to explore and a number of quests with some choices on how you complete them. The combat style also varies somewhat depending what weapon you choose. You can also choose to ride and fight while riding one of four different steeds, some of which look pretty cool. Unfortunately, the combat while on the steeds is do difficult and cumbersome you wont want to do it. Further, you cannot take your steeds through the teleporters which quickly becomes your main way to travel.All that said, if you are an rpg fan, the game may be worth a playthrough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

I must be getting old cause back in the day cutscenes were used to move and connect major plotpoints. In this game, everything warrants a cutscene.New kid in town?(cue cutscene) Hey we need some wine (cue cutscene) Hi, I live over there (cue cutscene) Oh, Leonard! (cue cutscene) - My first playthrough was very painful because:2) Quest tracker - Oblivion, this is not. You get a giant star (if you're on the same map) for a visual, or most likely you'll have to rely on the 'next location' tab on the open world map to tell you where the story is going. So if you're like me and bypassed the 4/5 cutscenes after major fights, you'll end up with doing some additional running around to get your ground again.3) Massive Zones - with respawning mobs. Great for grinding, sucks if you're lost.Now, with that said:Pros:1) Avatar (Creation) (Sp/Mp) - So right off the bat you create your avatar, a common event in most RPGs. Customization is ULTRA detailed (Brow length, jaw width, eyebrow, eyelid shape, angle, smirks, frowns, smiles, you can wink!, height, weight - these are just an example - there are over 8 tabs of customization, each tab breaks down the category even further)or you can choose from pre-made templates. It gets better - the avatar you create plays the 'new kid/sidekick' role in the sp mode, and then gets used as your main toon on GeoNet.2) SP Campaign - Short and sweet. If you're looking for an epic saga, taking up weeks of your time to meet the last boss, this aint it. If anything, the SP reminds me of Neon Genesis Evangelion meets Super Mario (yes, she looks just like that princess). Took me all of 3 days to finish (2 if I didnt endure 90% of all the game's cutscenes. The 'ending' was weird, and because I was yet again skipping cutscenes, I didnt fully realize it was the end until the credits  starting rolling.Bah , whatever, on to GeoNet!!!GeoNet - IMO, the real game! You can play your avatar both online and offline. This was a crazy concept to wrap my head around: You're the sidekick in the SP, but in MP you're the man. It's like the Clark Kent syndrome.While you *can* play online right after the prologue, there wont be much you can do. As you progress in the game, you will come across Guild shops in each town. Each mission is specific to a certain location so you're ability to run different Guild missions relies on your own sp progress.You start off with a simple Rank1 GeoRama, certain conditions need to be met in order to improve it. As it improves your 'square footage' increases, allowing more room for additional buildings.And then things go gray (for me): As your town grows it will need residents. All throughout the (sp) game there are people you can recruit into your GeoRama. Each resident has a trade (Miner, farmer, lumberjack etc) and each trade breaks down into 3 specialties. You can also place shops (armory, general supplies, binding shops, etc) your shops will sell the items your tradesfolk create. Depending on the people you recruited, no two shops/town could possible be alike. Also, there are different levels of tradesfolk, some are highly skilled and require much higher ranks, others are simple and perfect for new towns. In your GeoRama you'll have to find a balance between real estate and available shops/houses/items. Also, nothing is bought with money (except for the ever so convenient Sony Online Store) everything is made with in-game gold and the *RESOURCES YOU GATHER*. If you're not a pack rat or have ADD, you might have a sad GeoRama :(Combat: Basically, it's weird, but it works. Basically everyone works off their own 'timer' as the timer completes a cycle you can begin a new turn. The heavier your armor, the slower your 'clock'. Once you see it in action with 3 party members, it makes sense, but yes, it's still slow.Combos: This is a blast! You can create you own string of combos (ground attacks, juggles, mid-air attacks, buffs, etc)Customze: Another Gem: Unlike the NPCs, your avatar has no restrictions on his 'class' which means you can make him into whatever you desire: Axe wielding magician? Yep.  Plate wearing, 2handed healer? Yep.There's too much to cover here but all in all, and I dont think this game is for everyone but for those who get the concept behind this hybrid, you will have a blast.All in all,(although I understand L5 has done this before) I give this game a 5 because of the originality of this concept and the hours upon hours of gameplay for the GeoNet part.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Kevin Meade","summary":"short, no voip in multi-player, special mouse required for optimal play?","reviewText":"Done in a few hard core nights.1) single player is short in terms of gameplay.  I seem to remember D2 taking forever to get through.  One week on D3 and I am done; and I stop to check every corner and pick up every dropped coin and item, and I talk to every NPC I can see.2) more story which is good but I can't say I really like the story.  I feel like the game believes it is important some how which annoys me (makes no sense to say this I know but this is the sense I came away with).3) just like with StarCraft, it feels like there is a plan to bilk more money out of people through follow up material.  This looks like the trend for this company now.  Sad.4) multi-player would be fun but it has a big flaw which way curbs the fun quota.  There is no voip.  You cannot communicate with the other players by mic, only by keyboard chat.  In short this really puts me off the multi-player.  As an IT guy I can see how they rationalized this.  Why put something in the game that will cost us money to make, when we can let people rely on some other piece of software like SKYPE to do it.  But this reasoning can go too far and Blizzard it seems to me is making that mistake.  As a project manager, I can see a manager meeting at Blizzard where they are sitting at a table discussing how much they can get away with by not putting capability and content into the game and still have it make money.  Well, it is Blizzard I guess.  They did have a good track record up until SC2 when they decided this was how they wanted to make games going forward.  That is what new management does sometimes.5) another trend I am not sure I like is the sale of \"special purpose\" mice and controlers for opening up the game.  For example, using keyboard you have access to a limited number of abilities at any given time.  But with the DIABLO 3 MOUSE, you can for example as a wizard cast any spell you have at any time.  One of my multi-player buddies has one of these mice and I can see a clear advantage to his gameplay.  He can cast all of his spells at any time and real quick.  It really changes his success.  But come on... I have to spend 80$ more to get a mouse to play the game to its full potential?  This is another annoyance for me.Though it was fun while I played it, I am really getting disappointed with the direction of the company and its games.  With so much to choose from these days, I will really be taking a hard look at if I want the next installement of their games or if I'd rather drop my cash somewhere else because I can get more content for less.  Maybe it is not a bad thing.  If Blizzard keeps to this trend, then other game makers will have a real chance to enter the market by not doing what Blizzard does, and this diversity will only mean better play for all of us in the future.If you are a Diablo fan, I guess you have to have it.  But since it is so short, maybe you should check to see if you can find a buddy who has it and who will let you play it on his/her computer, before you put down the dough for it.I am sorry.  This review turned out to be as much about my perception of Blizzard as it is the game.  Let me say, there are millions of people online playing and a lot of them really like it.  You won't want for a multi-player companion when you seek one.  Even with the occassional blip like choppy video or server shutdowns that every player is experiencing, we all keep logging back in.  This clearly means something.  Don't let my negativity deter you too much, especially if you have a pal to play with.  If you want it, get it.  Pretty much everybody else has.  Still, it is kind of a bummer that the best reason I can think to buy this game is because \"everyone else did\".Hail Flavius!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2012"}

Absolutly amazing game that actually makes you never want to put the controller down. The story sucks you in from the start throwing you into the Batman universe you don't want to leave. I think the best part of this game is the fact that every mission is a little different. Sure by the end you have fought some of the enemies hundreds of times, but it still throws in a little wrinkle to make the next step that much harder. If you haven't picked up this game, you really should. The RPG aspects of the game make you feel like you are creating your own version of batman, but by level 20 (the max) ever batman is the same. The collectables make searching every inch of the island possiable. My only concern is the replayability value because even though you can continue playing after the final cut scene all the enemies are gone and you are simply roaming Arkham Asylum looking for little things to get 100% compeletion. Hey at least you get to play after the final cutscene. The only other thing bad for replay is the fact you can't start over with all your stuff from the first run through. When you start over, you do just that, that means no collectables already done for you, its starting from scratch. All in All best game to come out this year to say the least.

E Jackson","summary":"good game... but maybe not quite a classic","reviewText":"(This review was updated on July 10th, 2006)I've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars.  I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.I still stand by what I say in the original review: \"The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself \"I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage\".  It's not like that in Super Mario World.\"I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus.So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!)Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it).Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it.Go ahead and get it.  Yes, it's a classic.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"Ready, Set... Cinematic!","reviewText":"Do you like RPGs? Does the thought of kicking alien butt using a curvaceous female android excite you? Does the thought of over 8 hours of cinematics cause you to drool? How about a heavily religiously-overtoned, philosophical, and more-twisted-than-Courtney-Love plot? Then fellas, you have found your game. Now, don't get me wrong, I do like a game that presents a challenge. However, when you realize that some of the discussions in the game make you think that you are reading a treatise by Nietzsche rather than playing a futuristic space opera-themed RPG, then you have to wonder about the sanity of the developers.StorylineI really think that the developers of Xenosaga set out to create an epic story first, then developing the gameplay after they created the arc. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however, there are several moments in the game where you actually are asked to save after watching 20-30 minutes of a cutscene, only to then proceed to another cutscene! Sometimes, you gain control of your character merely to walk into another room, then ANOTHER cutscene starts. What this really boils down to is this: if you want a short bit of gaming to fill a smidgen of dead time in your schedule, this is not the game to do it.The story is meant to detail how Shion and KOS-MOS get mixed up in the fight against the gnosis, as well as the larger plot of an anti-government organization called U-TIC. It is a good story however, it is told too frequently and through too many cutscenes. Xenosaga is a game that places you in the roles of several characters (whom you will meet throughout the story); however, your primary character is Shion. Shion is the head developer of the android, KOS-MOS. In the world of Xenosaga an alien \"ghost\" force, called the gnosis, are invading the planets of the universe and killing off all lifeforms. Recently, even an entire planet disappeared. Playing as Shion you are charged with creating the second version of KOS-MOS, a blue-haired, female android weapon used to battle the gnosis.That being said, the game starts out with you aboard the military spaceship Woeglinde. After a brief training session in a computer-generated world (which is designed to get you, the player, acquainted with battle controls and the like), the story then progresses to focus on the character development of other members aboard the Woeglinde with Shion.With all of the cinematics in the game, which should really serve to clarify the action of the gameplay, you would think that you have a great story on your hands. And, well, the story IS great, if you can put it all together. With the fictional names in the story (such as the alien menace called the Gnosis, for instance), combined with a lot of Germanic references (one spaceship is called the Rhine Maiden), your head will spin. I used to think that Final Fantasy was bad, but for some reason, since all of the names and creatures within the Final Fantasy series are completely made-up, I am less confused!Gameplay and ControlsWhen you finally do gain control of your characters, the game is really fun to play. Large, 3-D environments, which are heavily detailed, are used for each area. The game also allows you to visit previous maps through an in-game \"UMN\" service, in case you missed anything.This game controls a bit differently than most Playstation 2 games: the \"O\" is used to execute a command, and \"X\" to cycle back through a menu. This takes a bit to get used to, as in most instances, the universal Playstation execute button is the \"X\". It is a minor difference really, as you will get used to it quickly, however, it is annoying when you first encounter it.During the course of the gameplay you will sometimes control characters outside of the usual Shion. Shion is the main character of the game, and your save function will always reflect her level, regardless of whomever you may be controlling at the time of the save. The nice thing, though, is if the characters you are controlling gain a level, Shion will too. So you could be controlling Ziggy, for instance, and he could get to level 9. Shion may have been at level 5 when you saved her last, however, when you control her again she will be at level 9. This is a nice feature, and does eliminate some of the \"grinding\" other RPGs may force you to do in order to balance out your party's character levels.Once you have acquired all of the characters, you can switch them out in between battles. This is a nice feature also, as you are not necessarily restricted to a certain character. Since all of them have different attacks and abilities, this helps out tremendously in some of the boss fights.Boss fights in the game are insanely difficult. One fight is essentially entirely random. The boss will unleash a devastating attack against your entire party when a certain event occurs, which is determined at the beginning of the fight. You have no control over the event. Unless you happen to get lucky, you could literally have the boss unleash his super attack against you every round, entirely decimating your party.In other boss fights, the levels are sometimes so much higher than your own party you do not stand a chance. Their HP (hit points, or health) levels are so high, and your damage ratio is so low, that you will spend literally an hour trying to eliminate one boss. When the rest of the enemies in the area are so easy by comparison, this is very frustrating.On the upside, there are no random encounters. Enemies are clearly visible on your screen and radar, and will only run after you if they see you. While some fights are forced (as in any RPG), you can avoid others if you use the map to your advantage. This is helpful when you simply do not feel like fighting. The downside is that the enemies respawn when you leave the room and return.Controls are tight, and actions are menu-driven. This is a turn-based fighting system, and standard RPG fare, really. You are able to complete a physical attack, in addition to Ether (magic) and AGWS (mechs). There is some strategy involved, however, as you can withhold an attack to gain an additional attack the next round. Overall though, the strategy only pays off in boss fights, when the extra damage you would gain from the third attack may spell the difference between your defeat or the boss'.Graphics and SoundGraphics in this game are colorful and beautiful. The characters are animated nicely, and the 3-D environments are large and detailed. Facial animations are not really well done, though, and lip movements are horribly synched with the speaking. That being said, the voiceovers are amazing. The English translations in this game are top-notch, and each character has a distinct voice actor. Whether it be Shion or KOS-MOS, for instance, you will know immediately who is speaking without looking at your screen.The cinematics are gorgeous. If you have ever seen the movie Final Fantasy: Spirits Within, the graphics are similar, but the CGI in-game are lower-quality. The facial animation and hands are probably the best examples of this: somewhat blocky in certain instances.Sound: epic, beautiful, and not annoying. The battle music is repetitive, but not so much so that you would turn it off. Plus, if you did, you may miss a cutscene, which are so frequent that they could literally spawn in between battles.OverallThis is a fun game, and certainly has a deep, detailed, and \"heavy\" storyline. If you can deal with sitting long periods between gameplay to watch a story unfold, this is a good game. If the thought of having a 20 minutes of playtime to 40 minutes of cinematics scares the willies out of you, move on to another game. For those of you that take the time to get into this title, it is engaging and fun. Some of the attack names are quirky and the dynamics of the gameplay are frustrating, but you will want to play all the way through - if only to clarify the myriad of cutscenes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"This should have been Episodes 1, 2, & 3","reviewText":"All I can say is I hope there is a KOTOR 3.

So, in reality what you are paying for here is just the 30 day &#34;Legendary&#34; status(IE Premium subscription), which is it's self a good deal, considering the premium subscription costs $15 a month(You're saving 5 dollars off your first month basically.)The game doesn't overly appeal to me, as it just tends to be a grindfest, which is what SOE MMORPGs are known for. SWG, EQ, EQ2 all were focused on grinding, and DCUO is no different.The game seems fairly large, however is only two main adventure zones. You can play in Gotham, or Metropolis, or travel between them. Missions will take you to both cities, although I do use the term &#34;Missions&#34; lightly since there isn't really a storyline. Sure, there might be some vague story buried under the grind, but nothing that's going to reach out and grab you.You do have the option of being a good guy, or a villain, which is unique, but even as a bad guy, you still feel like a good guy, since the missions tend to revolve around stopping an alien invasion and beating up other criminals for one reason or another. You don't really do anything bad! except plant bombs on cops...i guess there's that.Also, I can't stress this enough! Make sure you are playing this with an HDTV!

Here they take a look at other open world (sandbox) games like GTA, Crackdown, and really Hulk UD and mix them up in a blender to form this tasty cocktail.The game starts off in the heat of the battle.  Crazy \"infected\" cilivains and armored military face off.  You, Alex Mercer, is in the middle.  The game's first 5 min introduces all the powers you can get while playing the game and really previews some truly specail and powerful moves.  The game then takes time to jump back in time to tell the story from the start.  It's this little \"Pulp Fiction\" take on the narritive that has you rebuilding Alex to the person you first played as.  The game's story is done well enough to never make you want to skip it, it does manage to prgress the action along nicely.The biggest complaint is the opened ended of the game.  Don't go in expecting a GTA game world...or even a Crackdown game world.  NYC in Prototype is small in comparison.  A fully upgraded Alex can go from one side of the map to the next in a few mintues.This isn't the lush playground that Rockstar created with GTA4.  Here NY seems a little plain and boring.  It is nice to see all the gory deathes and the change from the infection spreading over the NY landscape.  With that said the mission are also very linear in scope.  You will not have a dozen of missions at once on the map.  You'll get one at a time.They included a few \"events\" or minigames that you can pick from and play.  All these do though is add to your Experiance Points so you can purchase upgrades.  And this is where Prototype shines.  Destorying bases and killing bad guys for all the EP you can muster just so you can upgrade Alex is great fun, always with the goal to become that killing machine you were in the first 5 mins. of the game.In the end Activison has a soild game on their hands with Prototype.  It might not have the buzz or the flash of other sandbox games but it really is a nice change of pace from the norm and well worth a play.  Here's hoping they follow up this game with a Prototype 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2009"}

The Wii had Wii Sports, the DS has Brain Training, and the Wii U has the very beefy Nintendo Land. This is a game that features a hub that interacts with the Miiverse and has doors to mini-games. Like Mario Party this game is best played with other people. The AI is pretty dumb and unfair, and is just completely boring by yourself.There are mini-games that feature pretty much every Nintendo franchise. One is an Animal Crossing game that is very competitive and fun. One person controls two dogs on the gamepad while the other players run around using Wiimotes collecting candy. If you play with one other person they must put 15 pieces in dishes, if it's two or more other people they must collectively get candy and keep it with them. They have to work together because the more you have and slower you run. This game seems unfair at first for the gamepad player because you run slower and your tackles don't go very far. It takes practice and skill to tactically corner the Wiimote players and get them. Some of these mini-games have a facecam feature because you can't look up at the TV, it's cheating. When you look up the Wiimote players will know and can pummel you accordingly.The best mini-game is the Zelda Battle Quest. This one is the biggest and has ten full levels. The gamepad player is an archer and the Wiimote players are swordsmen. You must get through the on-rails levels without dying, but you all share a pool of health. It's really fun and the Wii Motion Plus makes Link's sword motion 1:1 so it feels responsive and fluid. Another mini-game, probably the second biggest, is the Metroid one. The gamepad player is a space ship while the Wiimote players are Samus. It's pretty much a deathmatch game and is really fun. The controls are great and it can get really intense.There are a lot of unbalanced and unfair mini-games here...too many. The Luigi's Mansion one has the gamepad player as a ghost and the Wiimote players as the catchers. The problem is that the levels are way too small. There's not enough room to run around in and can be unfair with too many people. My least favorite is the Mario Chase. The gamepad player is way too fast, it's nearly impossible to catch them, it's also really boring with uninspired and lame levels. The second most unfair is the Pikmin game. The arenas are way too small and the gamepad player has an unfair advantage by being able to throw their Pikmin at the Wiimote player, so the Wiimote player has no distance attacks.There are also some single player mini-games but one person can assist with the Wiimote making things easier. My favorite is the DK Crash Course. You look at the gamepad and have to tilt your car through an obstacle course. the Wiimote player can press A and a bubble will form around you slowing you down. Another one is the Fruit Cart game. You must draw a line on your gamepad to the fruit that appear on screen. The Wiimote player can get one fruit for you automatically.As you can see there's a lot here, but there really aren't any rewards. You get coins which are used on a Plinko type mini-game that spits out prizes, but these just clutter your theme park and are pointless. My favorite feature of all is the train. It's basically a championship mode that gives everyone a try at the gamepad and that user can challenge other Wiimote players, or the gamepad gets passed around. It's really fun and exciting and brings everyone together. I just wish these games could be played online. Why Nintendo, are you so stuck in the past? The Wii U has online capabilities, and yet their games aren't online, except for the Miiverse.The game looks really good, but overall it's lacking online play and rewards. There are too many unfair and unbalanced mini-games that just aren't any fun. For a packed-in game with the Wii U it's pretty beefy and very fun, but I wouldn't go out and throw $60 down on this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

That's either a good or bad thing, depending on who you are.  In short its pretty much the same Halo as the old one was.  But games have moved on in the time since and with choices like Portal 2 out there, FPS games like this look a bit rusty.  Reach is clearly targeted to a younger crowd and thats not a bad thing.  It sort of is the anti Gears of War.  There are no continuous barrage of F Bombs or decapitations, so its nice to see  something less explicit now and then.  The real problem lies in the simplistic gameplay - if you press jump and hold right trigger, you'll get to the end. There is also no real sense of urgency or structured pacing. I think Bungie is tired of Halo.  I've also been told how the battles are now made like a \"sandbox game.  Not really.  It isn't necessarily scripted, but on the flip side, you can just walk to the next checkpoint without firing a shot sometimes. Also, play the original Crysis - a relatively old game by now - THAT is an open world where point A to point B can be what you want it to be.Reach is not a bad game - as far as FPS goes, it is more worked out than the COD crap that gets kicked out every year,  but it just feels empty and unfinished.  The graphics aren't that great and despite the simple asthetic, there are some pretty awful frame drops and stuttering.  When you exit the base toward the end of Mission 3, the game almost comes to a standstill from slowdown - which is unforgiveable at this stage in the 360 lifespan. It reminds me of Mega Man 2 and older NES games when there was too much on the screen.  This is 2011 people.  The MP is fun, but like COD, you face serious pwnage starting at a low rank.  Firefight is fun, at least the first few times, but by design, it is repetitive.  Also, survival modes are in pretty much every FPS or third person action game on Xbox or PS3 these days - Firefight, Horde, Survival in UC2, or CoD Zombies - you name it.  The single player difficulty is pushed mostly by limited ammo drops and mega bullet resistant enemies, but everything is so wide open, you can just run away most of the time your shields get red.  The longest part of the game really is the last chunk of levels, where you are basically placed in a \"Firefight\" mode again and again for the finale that drags on and on as you are led into near endless waves of enemies until it's finally over - lazy game design.  The story is dull for 99% of the time, but the after credits ending is by far the best of any installment to date.  Not quite a full redemption, but it's good.  Noble 6 got my respect.To be more optimistic, one could say this is an apology for Halo 2 and Halo 3. Halo 2, by Bungie's own admission being rushed out the door and Halo 3 because it was a backtracking, repetitive piece of crap.  This is the game, in many ways, they should have been. The controls are sharper, the floaty jumps are toned down, there is no senseless backtracking From Halo 1 and 3 and the story actually provides a sense of closure the other games never bothered with. Even then, that is saying a bit too much. Halo had some good ideas and it created a new world to explore, but it really isn't that interesting to me.  Bungie did a simplistic space marine riff on Half-Life but never went any further. At least by HL 2, Valve \"Evolved\" their gameplay so to speak.  I really hate to down on this, but you arent missing much here by skipping Reach. I think this is a baby that was both rushed out the door and maybe even unwanted by its parents. This is not Bungie's best work. Ten years later not much has improved.  Midway through, I had flashbacks of when I first played through Halo and the same time I was playing through Metroid Prime.  The differences between the games are big - albeit different genres.  Every time I fired up my Xbox, I could never get over how you really don't do much in Halo other than press the right trigger. That's so 1993.Oh well, to each their own.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W82","description":"","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Turtle Beach finally hits the mark","reviewText":"Having tolerated the Turtle Beach X41 wireless headphones for a while, stepping-up to the XP300s has been incredibly satisfying. Turtle Beach seems to have finally provided all the functionality that I've desired (plus some I didn't expect), while improving the overall comfort and feel of the headphones. While a few things have been overlooked, my overall experience has ben positive.Comfort: I can wear these for hours. The padding on the earcups is very comfortable, and they don't make my ears (or head) warm. The over-the-head band is comfortable as well, but while the headband expands sufficiently to increase size, I still wish they were just slightly smaller. However, they don't fall off and they stay positioned while moving around.Sound: There are two things to consider regarding sound quality with wireless headphones:1) the transmission through wireless. These are considerably improved over the X41s I was using. I can't detect any hiss during non-audio segments, and haven't had any issues with interference with other wireless networks (I am running simultaneous wireless-G and wireless-N networks in my home, in addition to 5 Ghz cordless phones). The XP300s run on two bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and will automatically switch between them based upon interference. Only once in a while do I detect this transition, but it is seamless. No pops, no clicks -- perfect audio always.2) sound output. While these are improved over the X41s, they still don't exactly hit the mark when it comes to the bass response. Overall, however, the sound quality is relatively balanced, with very good midrange (for voices) and decent, if not exceptional bass response. Treble/highs are perfect, from my perspective. The headphones offer the ability to adjust the \"tone\", so you can boost the bass (or bass and treble, as an option). While there is also an option to increase the stereo field (like an artifical surround sound), I think it stretches the sound too thin.Connection: I am using this with an Xbox 360. Unlike the X41s, however, there is no optical input on the control device. You have to use any available analog audio output (either on your 360 or on the back of your TV) and connect it directly to the control device. This could make connections challenging in some situations, and the lack of an optical input provides a less-than-ideal audio response. Fortunately, the control device/transmitter is small, and it does provide an auxilary-in jack, so you can also connect an MP3 player or any other device to it. The control unit/transmitter is powered by USB, so you will need a free USB jack in order to power the transmitter.Power: the headphones have built-in, non-replaceable rechargeable batteries. They are charged via a proprietary USB cable (you'll need another USB port for this). Fortunately, they can be charged while in-use, so a \"low battery\" warning doesn't mean you need to switch to something else. Unfortunately, once the low battery warning starts to beep, you have no idea how much additional time you have available. Fortunately, I've been getting 15-20 hours from them.Wireless Chat: These XP300's solve the one problem I've had with the X41s and other similar headphones -- they now provide true wireless chat with the 360. The package includes a small bluetooth transmitter that plugs into your 360's controller. It then syncs with the headphones, and transmits audio via bluetooth. From my perspective, incoming chat is perfect, and nobody has complained about the quality of my voice. The benefit here is that I can finally put my controller down, and get up and walk around the room (or out of the room, within about 30 feet), without having to carry a semi-wired controller around with me. I can still hear things and talk to others without being tied to the controller. NOTE: if you are using the 360's \"Chatpad\", you can't use the included controller transmitter. You will either need to remove your Chatpad from the controller or use the included cable to hardwire your headphones to your controller (which is how the X41s work).Bluetooth: In addition to wireless chat, the headphones will also sync to a cellphone via bluetooth...and it can handle booth wireless chat and a cellphone connection simultaneously. This means that you can take calls from your phone while gaming -- this is incredible functionality that is extremely helpful -- no more missed calls, and no more taking a headset off in order to take a phone call.What keeps these from being perfect? The documentation isn't entirely clear. I spent the better part of 20 minutes just trying to get the headset to sync to its transmitter, because the documentation wasn't clear (just hold the power button down beyond the initial tones). From my perspective, the documentation also seemed to be \"backwards\" regarding the wireless chat \"sync indicator\". Like a normal bluetooth headset, if it's flashing infrequently, it is synchronized. I had to experiment using a second 360 over LIVE just to figure this all out. However, once you get everything synchronized, things seem to work quite well thereafter without further intervention required.I also haven't had much luck with balancing the mix of chat and game audio. No matter what settings I choose in the 360's dashboard settings in conjunction with various volume levels/controls on the headphones, I can't find a mix that works best for me. I typically end-up turning down game audio to compensate.Overall, I'm pleased with the XP300s. However, I can't overlook the lack of an optical connection, the confusing documentation and syncing processes and indicators, and the chat/game-audio mix issues. They still aren't \"perfect\", but they hit enough of the mark for me that they are my new favorite gaming headphones.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}

He looks and sounds just like the Solid Snake we know and love, but Solid Snake was a rookie in the mid 1980's during the Outer Heaven mission (\"Metal Gear\" for the NES).  This is far too early to be our Solid Snake.  But, from playing the two previous Metal Gear Solid games on the Playstation and Playstation 2 we know that our Solid Snake was a clone of a character named Big Boss (the bad guy from the Outer Heaven and Zanzibar missions).  So, doing a little logic here, it is a safe assumption that the Snake of \"Metal Gear Solid 3\" is the Big Boss of previous games.  I don't count this as much of a spoiler because a little knowledge of the Metal Gear series and where this game falls on the timeline makes the identity of this Snake a fair guess.Snake is given a mission to assist a Russian scientist defect and come to America.  Snake is dropped off in the field with no supplies (as usual) and is left to his own wits and resources to find weapons and items to help him in his mission.  This is a covert mission, as usual, and the name of the game is stealth.  If Snake is able to get by with out being spotted by the enemy, he'll have an easier time completing his mission.  What is new in \"Metal Gear Solid 3\" is that for the first time most of the game takes place outdoors.  This allows for a completely different mode of stealth and Snake must utilize the terrain and a variety of camouflage to keep him hidden.  Something else that is new is a \"Stamina\" bar besides the \"Health\" bar.  Snakes actions will take stamina as will being injured in battle.  If Snake does not restore his Stamina his aim will suffer and it will be easier for his health to drop.  To replenish Stamina, Snake must hunt for his food.  He can kill snakes, rats, frogs, fish, or any other animal he might encounter.  Keeping a full stamina bar is a must.What most players will notice is that there is no radar as we remember from the previous two Metal Gear Solid games.  This makes sense as the game is set in the 1960's and a radar system like we might have in the late 1990's would not exist back then.  There are motion detectors and similar items that serve a similar purpose, but none work nearly as good as the old radar did.  Perhaps because of the lack of a radar, I found this to be quite a challenging game on \"Normal\" difficulty, though as the game progressed it was easier to just sneak as much as possible and then snipe everyone possible.  Even if an alarm was sounded it was still easier to kill every guard then to sneak around them.  I understand that is my failing as a player and it isn't the way the game was designed, but even using the strategy guide I did not do nearly as well with the sneaking as I had hoped.The storyline in \"Metal Gear Solid 3\" is similar to that of the previous Metal Gear Solid games in that it reaches global conspiracies and fills in a bit of what we learned from the previous games as far as the background story goes.  There are double-crosses and the cinematic cut-scenes are effective and well done and not quite as intrusive or long as those from \"Metal Gear Solid 2\".  The game play is also based on the same style of fighting as the other games, only with the addition of something called CQC (Close Quarter Combat).  CQC is an extension of the ability in previous games to sneak up behind an enemy and choke him out.  With CQC there are more options: slitting the throat, interrogating the enemy, choking him out, throwing him to the ground, or using him as a human shield.  This adds a greater variety to combat and this can help out quite a bit in sneaking, but to be honest I barely used this skill (perhaps I should have).\"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\" is an excellent game which took me 24 hours to complete while using the strategy guide.  I found it to be challenging, but still quite a bit of fun to play.  Any fan of the Metal Gear series would enjoy this, as would fans of games like \"Splinter Cell\".  While this game can be defeated by using a \"run and gun\" style of gameplay (or a sit back and blast every enemy who comes on the screen), the real point of the game is stealth.  You can actually beat this entire game without killing a single enemy, including the bosses.  Everyone can be either snuck around or taken out with tranquilizer darts (even the bosses).  This, of course, is much more difficult.  I was only able to beat two bosses with the darts, and spent more time blasting away trying to stay alive. This game is likely to be hailed as one of the best games of the year, and I would tend to agree.-Joe Sherry","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2005"}

It's too cool for all that easy mode jazz.  Come to think of it, Soulcalibur 3 didn't either, whats up with that?  Anyway,  It's not actually that bad once you get some practice with fighting at a not so easy level.  Once you finally defeat the evil jello mold kasumi clone after the twentieth time you will feel so tough that you didn't wimp out and set the game to easy (because you couldn't) that it makes the whole journey that much funner.Seriously, though, do they expect the average gamer to unlock even half the achievements on this mother?  This series has always been rough but now you don't even have the option to wimp out.  I play fighting games to take out my aggression.  How am I going to take out my aggression when I'm getting my head kicked in like a special olympics equipment manager that picked a fight with Jet Li.  I'll tell you how, I aint.  At least not with Tina.  I have to play as friggin' Ein if I want to do any good in survival mode.  I didn't buy this game to play as a guy, sheesh.  Also, is it just me or does Kasumi suck now?  She used to be my go to girl but now I can barely do anything with her.  I could barely get a bronze medal in the survival mode and I about darn near broke my hand doing it.  I have a better chance of unlocking all of rumble roses achievements and that's saying something because that game is tedious.  But I digress...On the plus side there are some great graphics but that goes without saying as this is a next generation system.  There are also some interesting features like being able to take snapshots of computer controlled fighters.  It's a fun diversion from getting pounded but 90% of my pictures are as blurry as all get out.  I must not make a good video game photographer.  As with Doa 3 Aerosmith music abounds in this game.  Well, maybe not abounds per se but it is in there.  If you beat the game with Helena.  The ending credits have a nice Aerosmith song.  The endings for the characters make no sense whatsoever but that's nothing new.  I like Kasumi's little mermaid esque finale.  It's so randomly silly that I liked it.Anyway, the game is a solid fighting game that gives you plenty of action.  Just don't expect it to be a cakewalk or any other sort of walk involving pastries.  Pick a fighter, spend hours learning all his moves and go forward young warrior to unlock the achievements and gain glory.  But don't expect me to be at the finish line with you.  I'll be playing oblivion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2006"}

But several other games creeped into the Fall such as games for the hardcore RPG player (Demon's Souls), hardcore action player (Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2) as well as this game which can really be played by anyone. For the most part Ratchet and Clank games have never been \"hard\" per se and that's why Crack in Time is accessible for everyone: enough action and guns to satisfy the frequent gamer without the difficulty curve to stave off casual gamers. Plus it's got great voice acting and excellent soundtrack, some top-notch visuals and it happens to be extremely funny to boot, A Crack in Time is worth the cash. I only have a couple of knocks against it but it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of the whole game. This game wants you to have fun and fun you shall have.Story: If you haven't played Tools of Destruction or the downloadable game Quest for Booty, the game does a good job at recapping the events with a neat little intro with Captain Quark. But essentially Quark has been kidnapped by the Zoni, a strange alien race with the most adorable catchphrase you're going to frequently mimic (\"Zoni!\") with Ratchet finding out that the kidnapping was orchestrated by series villain Doctor Nefarious. Ratchet will learn some secrets about his past, meet a strange new friend while Clank will also have some adventures of his own.Graphics: 2 years ago Tools of Destruction came out and everyone was quite impressed by the graphics, calling it a Pixar film in terms of quality. 2 years later and the graphics haven't gone such a huge shift so much has a significant upgrade. One thing that I noticed has been improved is the lighting which seems to make the game look a lot more sharper and detailed and makes certain scenes pop such as looking at the Grand Clock and in one scene we see a planet in the winter covered in snow whereas...something happens and now we see it in more or less a summertime with a really bright and colorful color scheme. And of course Insomniac really knows how to make their games run smoothly and with all the chaos and STUFF onscreen, there's no slowdown or framerate drops whatsoever.Sound/Music: To compliment the last game in this R&C; Future trilogy, the score is of course nice and epic with a grand score to accompany the bigger action moments. Not so much hummable as being really pleasant to hear. Ditto for the voice acting which is always excellent such as the lovable but incredibly oafish Quark to the upstanding gentleman quality of Clank and weirdly, the scene stealer for me, Doctor Nefarious. And of course gotta love hearing that \"Zoni!\" over and over again. Another cool thing is the sound effects with the weapons and enemies creating a loud and almost intense atmosphere without it sounding too chaotic (my problem with Killzone 2).Gameplay: Guns. Lots of guns. Not quite The Matrix quantity but everyone knows Ratchet and Clank is unique because of the guns. The creativity at Insomniac is easily seen in the weapons here and there's some quite cool ones here. One for example is essentially a frog with a meter that should it goes fullpower, creates a devastating blast...by burping. Another one sets up electric pylons that can damage nearby enemies but set em up in a shape and it can create a nice little trap enemies can't leave and the Sixaxis weapon this time is not a tornado but rather a big ball of electricity that you can steer. And I'll just say one other: a gun that emits the 1812 Overture. I'll leave it at that. One thing that I love is that there isn't that sort-of \"God Gun\" that becomes your main weapon but you'll find yourself just frequently switching weapons just for the fun of it (and of course to level them up which has been changed from the \"spend points to upgrade\" from Tools of Destruction to just simply \"use it lots\".Clank also takes center stage in some parts where he becomes very puzzle-centric. Using the Chronoscepter, Clank can essentially \"record\" himself doing a specific action and then you can play back that movement. It starts out easily enough: Clank clone can step on a switch which keeps a door up which you can walk through and get some bolt money (what you use to buy weapons, ammo and armor). Sure you can skip it but that's a nice bolt bonus so might as well tax your brain and solve it. In addition you can pilot your ship and do some space missions and travel to planets or asteroids which carry either weapon upgrades or Zoni which upgrades your ship. There's also the occasional space mission involving stranded ships which you have to escort to a safe zone only to get attacked so out comes the rockets and lasers. Both offer some nice changes in pacing so if you get tired of puzzle solving, in comes Ratchet and his platforming which can go into some space battles.And for collectors/completionists, well, there's a lot to do. From finding gold bolts to weapon blueprints to Zoni to purchasing every weapon to arena tournament cups to sidequests, the game's chockfilled with stuff to do which might conflict with you finishing the story since you're spending more time not actually seeing more of the story but doing other things for awhile but it never becomes tedious. Essentially with the way the game is set up, Insomniac wants you to play the game as much as possible from different difficulties to the collecting to another one of those \"amass x amount of bolts\", if you want the platinum, be prepared for a long haul.With such a stellar Fall, the Playstation 3 released some mighty titles but then again, multiplatform games got some nifty stuff too but hopefully more PS3 owners check out Crack in Time as its not only a superb action platformer but almost becoming a dying breed now.

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"buriedatlantis\"","summary":"A Fun Return to the Country","reviewText":"Those who enjoy the old Donkey Kong Country games of SNES days of yore are sure to get a kick out of the sequel for the Nintendo Wii.  This game is so full of fun that you won't know what to do with yourselves.  Basically a bunch of Tiki Monsters descend down upon Kong's island and steal all the bananas after hypnotizing all the animals to help them.  The only ones impervious to the mind control are Donkey and Diddy Kong (you have to assume they are probably too simple minded for their minds to be controlled, I guess.)  Donkey Kong won't have his bananas be yanked from his coffers again, so he's off to get them all back.What follows is a cornucopia of great level design and colorful scenery.  There is more imagination packed into the first couple of levels of this game than the entire running time of most others.  There are secrets galore to be found with the game coming up with more inventive ways for you to find missing puzzle pieces and KONG letters.  All the while, Donkey and Diddy control very well, hopping from one enemy to the next in satisfying succession.  Shaking the Wii remote in combination with the D-pad has Donkey Kong pounding the ground, blowing out fiery enemies or rolling into others like a big hairy bowling ball.For the two player section of the game, one person plays as Donkey Kong and the other as Diddy.  During challenging sections, Diddy can get on Donkey Kong's back and ride it out, all the while helping by throwing things at enemies and using Diddy's jet pack to get across difficult jumps.  It's great if you have a little kid playing with you who might be having trouble getting through some sections of the game.And let's be very clear.  This game can get hard.  It can require such precision and timing at times that it makes this game one of the most challenging games I might have ever played.  In true throwback fashion, it can be very unforgiving of mistakes.  There is one section where you are propelling yourself through the air in a rocket powered barrel while being chased by a ginormous bat that could very well end with you driving your Wii remote through your skull out of frustration.  It is akin to the last fight with Bowser in New Super Mario Bro. Wii, but it is not even halfway through this game.  That said, there is a little cheat after you fail too many times that allows the game to use Super Kong or whatever he's called to help you through the level.  I haven't used this yet, but I would never look down upon someone who had to.Just a couple of minor issues with the game, I felt the motion control to make Kong pound or roll felt a little tacked on just to have motion control.  Not that it's horrible, but sometimes I just don't wanna waggle.  I'm not very fond of the aforementioned rocket powered barrel either, it's a pain to control and these levels require pinpoint accuracy and what Jack Burton would call \"crackerjack timing\" to get through.These gripes are simply overpowered by how outright fun it is.  It recalls the original Donkey Kong Country and still manages to be its own thing.  It is very challenging, yes, but not impossible.  It just makes that moment when you succeed that much sweeter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

Out of this amount, I would guess at least 300,000 of them came from Amazon.com. That being said, 300 dead consoles is not that scary anymore is it?Now on to my experience. I received my PS4 at noon on launch day. First of all, thanks Amazon for the upgrade from 2 day to same day shipping. The packing as mentioned by some others was not the best. How does it make sense to put a ton of bubble wrap ON TOP OF THE CONSOLE. Nothing on the bottom. So if the console was dropped, all of the impact would transmit directly to the machine. That is just bad packing. I am not sure how much of the bad consoles can be attributed to this but it is a possibility.My console arrives in good shape despite the packing and has worked flawlessly. It runs really quiet and so SMOOTH. It is really difficult to go back to the clunky PS3 XMB after playing with the PS4! I LOVE Resogun! And it was FREE with PS plus!!Killzone Shadowfall is great looking game but most of the reviews were spot on. There are some TERRIBLE platforming parts, an annoying &#34;God of War&#34; copy freefall which required 6 or 7 tries to get through, and a BRUTALLY difficult section where you lose your owl and all your equipment. The difficulty spikes are the most annoying part of this game. I am not finished yet(on chapter 7) but I would not be surprised if I have to give up on this game.

{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"Best Stealth Game EVER??","reviewText":"Now -this- is a game that can give Metal Gear Solid a run for its money.  Both of Pandora Tomorrow's single or multiplayer modes are amazing by themselves, and taken together this game is one of the best -ever- in this generation, on any console.  Stop reading and buy it!SINGLE PLAYER:The cutscenes are better than Rainbow Six 3, and the missions are SOOOO cool.  Wait until you see Sam crawling under a train going 120 mph, or infiltrate a guerrilla camp in the jungle during broad daylight. There aren't any generic alleys like in the first game, ALL of the missions take place in exotic locations like Jerusalem or Indonesia. The plot has some cool twists that I won't give away, but they even managed to work the multiplayer mode into the plot. Graphics are such a huge improvement, the whole games looks like some high-budget James Bond movie.  The production values are astronomical.  Other observations:-Controls are tigher, gadgets are easier to access when you need them.-You actually have a use for Sam's cool acrobatic moves in this game.-Plenty of ways to approach any situation.  Nothing is linear, play the way you want.-Lighting is more useful, you can visual tell what places will or won't hide you.-A quick flash of the stealth meter tells you if a body is in a good hiding spot.MULTIPLAYER:One-of-a-Kind.  Four players max.  Spies vs. Mercenaries, each team has radically different strengths &amp; weaknesses that play off each other very well.  Mercs can use the inplace security systems and set their own traps, plus they are armed to the teeth, but they are blind compared to the spies;  Spies hide in the ceilings and air ducts, places the mercs can't go, and have lots of diversion gear from the single player game, but they are physically weak.  The emphasis is on stealth and outwitting your opponent, not action.  There are lots of environmental details you can use to your advantage. Some other observations:-Two-on-a-team makes for very close, intense teamwork.  Best game to make friends with.-Spies play in 3rd-person, Mercs in 1st person.  It's not a gimmick, it's an inspiration, and it works perfectly.-Huge maps give you that scary &quot;somethings out there&quot; feeling, a la &quot;Predator&quot;-Lots of variety on each map because they are so large and complex.-You need 1 game/Xbox/TV per player.  No split screen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2004"}

It was an awesomely unique game somewhat taking the idea of the Sims, but putting it in real time and making all the characters animals. Certainly unique, certainly fun, and was a blast to play each and every day, although not for a long period of time.You play as a male or female human in your own town without a house. Tom Nook makes you a house and you have to pay it off ( extremely similar to the Gamecube version ). After you pay it off, you get upgrades, but it's not TOO easy, but it's not TOO hard.Graphics: 9/10. Yummy. It looks better than the Gamecube version to me ( many many many MANY would disagree with that ) but it looks far better to me. Less blockiness, and great animations like the Gamecube version. The graphics are cartoony and very different from most games out there.Sound: 8.5/10. A bit annoying at first, I got this game at about 5 PM and the music was very annoying and just continuously played a weird beeping pattern, but it wasn't THAT bad. The town animal's quick talking high pitched ( or low depending on animal ) voice is still there, you can still make a \"town tune\", it's all good.Control: 8.5/10. Sure is easy. you basically use the D-Pad, and stylus or X,Y,A,B buttons, and it's fairly easy to get used to. I would reccomend the stylus way, though, because it just seems more convenient.Fun: 9/10. Anybody who played the Gamecube version will find Wild World similar in a lot of ways, different in a few ways. you can now make a town flag, and the best addition: WIFI. You can play near or far with your friend ( if you have a friend code ). So if you can convince your friend to get a DS and this game, you're in luck because it's just like an online 3D chat site. Not just one friend, though, there can be 4 people in one town ( including you ) so you can all buy, sell, trade in eachother's town, and you can also just sit around and talk or meet eachother's neighbors in their towns. This is certainly a great game, one of the best DS games out there, may not be the best \"hours-on-end\" title for the DS ( I personally can't think of one except for maybe Mario Kart DS ) but it is amazing if you play in 30 minute to 1 hour spurts. Pick this up, whether you play Wi-Fi or not, it's a blast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2006"}

In a technical sense, Rage is an achievement in gaming. Character animations are smooth and expressive, and enemies react with a tangible sense of speed. The game is gorgeous, and being that this is an ID game, the gameplay is perfect. When you aim at something and pull the trigger, that thing will die. The gadgets you get are a blast: sentry turrest for defense, sentry bots are handy little bodyguards, RC bombs are gory, impractical fun, and wingsticks should be a mandatory staple in every FPS from this moment on. I can pretty much promise that you will enjoy the combat in this game. It is everything else that's the problem.While the character models are gorgeous, they have no personality. Lets take the family of the man that \"saves\" you in the beginning as an example. His daughter looks bright and fun. She eagerly teaches about wingsticks, and seemes genuinely pleased when you succeed. It looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Now, try and talk to her again. No, your game isn't glitched, she really does \"test\" you every time you talk to her, despite the fact that you've already passed. That first, shallow encounter you had with her is the extent of your involvement in her busy life of standing in that one spot, waiting for you to come take her test again.That example is indicitive of every NPC in this game. Many of them will have quests attached to them, and the second those tasks are complete, you will never speak to them again. Now, you may be thinking, \"That's how is works with most games like this. Borderlands and Fallout were the same.\" Thank you for such a specific example, kind, theoretical stranger. You are absolutely right; Borderlands and Fallout 3 were very similar to Rage. The difference however is that their worlds were bursting with life, while the world in Rage is empty.After leaving the vault in Fallout 3, all you had to do was pick a direction, and start walking. Within minutes, you would come upon someone or something of interest, whether it was a pack of wild animals wanting to kill you, a thirsty stranger with a depleted laser gun, the ever alone uncle Roe, a stranger in need, or raiders who wanted you dead. The wasteland in that game was ALIVE, and it was waiting for you to discover its secrets. Borderlands world wasn't as full of life, but there was no shortage of things that wanted you dead, or places to loot for new weapons. Everyone and their mother had a mission for you, and a shiny new toy was your reward. Playing with three other people, while sometimes challenging, was almost always fun. You knew exactly where you stood in the world, and though you practically disappeared to the people you helped once you were done helping, they would probably be calling you again sometime in the future.I outlined those games to illustrate what is so sorely lacking in Rage; a tangible connection to the world around you. You can spend as much time as you want in the world of Rage; you will always be an outsider. Doors will close to you once tasks are complete and the characters behind them might as well not exist, because there is a good chance you will never see them again. None of this is to say that there isn't plenty to do in Rage. The racing side missions are somewhat enjoyable, and bash tv can be fun, but they are just as empty as the rest of the game. You only ever officially meet 1 or 2 racers in the real world and once you beat them, they won't speak to you again. Bash TV is an amusing distraction, but why does it seem like you are the only person to ever compete?The story in rage is beyond anemic. You wake up, the man who saves you hands you a gun, and tells you to solve his problem by killing bandits, and from that point you never really do anything else. For every problem someone has in this game, the solution seems to be sending you to kill people. There is an organization in the wasteland called the Authority, and you know they are evil because every single person you meet tells you so. Not that you will see them until halfway through the game, and when you do they won't even be the aggressors. You're sent there to \"rescue\" someone, and that is accomplished by slaughtering everyone who isn't you or that person in the building.I won't say that Rage isn't worth playing, because the gameplay is mechanically very entertainging. The problem is, games like Borderlands and Fallout 3 exist. Though neither are at the level, technically, that Rage is, both are far more immersive, and in my opinion,  a lot more fun. ID has proved with this that they can make a good looking shooter. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be capable of anything beyond that. If all you are looking for is a good looking, well made, single player shooter than look no further. If you want a game with story, personality, immersion, and depth however, you should definitely look else where. Fallout 3/New Vegas, Borderlands, Skyrim are all solid choices. Rage isn't a bad game;its just emptier than the better games like it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"Nightshift worshiper","summary":"killer game, with som flaws~","reviewText":"I would like to state to positive things about this title before I tell you the negitive.First of all the fighting is fluent and completely awesome. I love how you can interlink most of you combos. Death has two short scythe, and a secondary weapon: warhammers, glaives, axes. gauntlets, armblades, etc.Every weapon and armour has stats, and if you happen to find a possessed weapon, then you can sacrifice other weapons to make it level up. Every level you can choose a new attribute for your weapon. But weapons can only level up so far and its only about 4 or 5 levels. It's still fun though. Tons of moves that you buy with gold from certain people and the interlinking in those moves into combos is absolutely pristine in reaction time. Death can interlink combos with his secondary weapon and his scythes, and there is even charged button hits with warhammers, etc.evade rolls with special combo hits coming out of the evade, kicking enemies into the are and then coming down on their head with a huge axe is very thrilling. Plus death gets special abilities once you progerss in the game, like turning into his true form as the grim reaper for about so many seconds. Those abilities aren't included in the skill tree, wher you learn special attacks that refill your health a little everytime you hit someone with it, or summoning ghouls, or ravens to torment your countless enemies. The monsters are awesome with quite a few boss fights which you can gain special weapons from, personalized to that specific boss.Climbing up walls, only when they have wooden planks that you will see throughout the game. Running across walls and climbing wooden poles.The grapics are a little choppy to my taste, but the scenery is really cool, and the graphics are still really good. The monsters are brilliantly created and an actual challange to fight: including an 100 foot stone golem. But there still not hard enough to make you wanna break the game. The big plus is when I started the game in the Forge lands, and after hours of play and doing almost every quest on that map, I thought I was nearly done with the game. But come to realize when I get to what I thought was the final objective, I go through a portal and find myself in The City of the dead..A whole other map. And these maps are not small and they are very detailed. Overall, the game is a blast and it's one of those games that'll keep you up all night feeling like a zombie because you just keep dicovering new places that are very diversified from the last. Alot of suprises!Now, the cons of this game is that most the puzzle system throughout the game is finding these reproducing yellow bombs that stick to the wall and blow up automatically, or you have to shoot them to blow them up. You have to throw them at yellow stalagmites blocking the paths to treasure chest or the main way you need to go. Most the time you spend way to much trouble finding the right angle to throw the bombs, or you have trouble finding the bombs, which is all good because zi like a little stratagy, but when you aim the bomb at the floor and it flys to the ceiling, it can get a little frustrating. you aim the bomb, and they dont land where you throw them, sometimes way off course. This frustrated me so much that I had gotten so far into the game, and when you can't solve a puzzle because a glitch won't let you, it really made me frustrated enough to delete my game and stop playing it. I'm a perfectionist, so If I can't get something in a game like one specific chest in a whole big area, and that was the only chest there pretty much and the main reason to go into that tomb, and it ripped me off over a glitch. If you want to go through that then all power too you. it is really fun if your willing to leave some special items behind. And i swear that tthis is from the same makers of The Legacy of Kain series. Death is almost like soul reaver, especially when he gets the claw ability and his arm starts glowing, and it plays so much like soulreaver it's not even funny. If you like soulreaver then get this, but prepare to be frustrated.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}

It turned out to be a good enough game for $39, especially considering that Sniper Elite V3 is $49 and even Sniper Elite V2 is still $34 after more than 2 years. OTOH, this may say something about the continuing popularity of SE V2 versus Wolfenstein (&#34;WS&#34;).While I generally liked the play of SE better (mainly because it does not bog down with unnecessary talking and standing around which cannot be skipped), I liked the environments of WS better. (It's hard to beat going to the moon, even if far from believable.) I also liked being able to set mines and traps in SE, which you can't do in WS.I thought that the gun battles in WS were very repetitive. Also, if an enemy in SE sees a body you've killed and left lying around, he alerts everyone, but in WS, the enemy seems to just ignore them. (A nice feature in SE is that you can pick up a body and hide it.)Complaints aside, there's enough good & interesting about WS that I can give it 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Another pathetic \"cashing-in\" attempt...","reviewText":"The Nintendo DS and the PSP might as well be the next Virtual Boy systems. I mean, both don't really have any point, the games suck, and are ridiculously overpriced. 250 bucks? What a rip off. The movie/ sequel movie to Final Fantasy 7 called \"Advent Children\" is going to be released for PSP, and not DVD, which to me is a huge let-down. I refuse to pay 250 bucks just to watch a movie, sorry. Beside Advent Children, this thing doesn't have much of anything. All of the games here are rehashes of old Playstation games or crappy new games that don't really have any playing value. I mean, \"metal gear acid\" , what the hell? I think these days developers will go to any extent to try and cash in. These days, video game developers will seem to do almost anything to higher their profit margin. Like other people have said, the same games that are released for PS2 will be ported out to this system in watered-down versions, highering their profit. I find this ridiculous. What ever happened to sitting down and enjoying GOOD video games? These days video games are all about money and graphics, and frankly I dont care for it any more. GBA is the only worthwile portable system, having classic snes and NES games available to play anywhere you want. The problem I have with portable systems is that the games are usually not that great to begin with, and you add the fact that they cost 40 bucks and it makes it pointless. I mean, the PS2 costs 150 bucks...so why pay 100 bucks MORE than a actual PS2 for some stupid unimpressive portable system...I dont get it. People are just stupid, and Sony knows this, so they are cashing in on the stupidity. I prefer to stick to console systems, the games are better, the sound is better, the screen is bigger and it isnt as awkward to play, and in many cases even the games are cheaper. All in all, the PSP is just a ridiculous waste of money, and I would advise everyone to stay away from it. If you want to play good video games buy a regular Nintendo, SNES, or N64 and PS1, those systems have real games. I dont consider myself a gamer, and I am not some lame \"fanboy\", but I do enjoy playing video games, mainly old school stuff, though. If you are like me, you will not like this.

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Guy in Ohio \"Guy in Ohio\"","summary":"A Difficult Game To Review","reviewText":"Halo is a tricky game to review.  On one hand, it's an FPS on a console, which any gamer knows is typically a bad combination.  On the other hand, the production value of the game is very high.That said, I give the game 3 stars for \"fun\" and 4 stars \"overall\".  If it weren't for the incredible attention to detail (great cinematics, sound, story, etc), the gameplay alone would certainly not warrant 4 stars.I am a HUGE fan of FPS games.  Aside from ESPN's football series and a few other miscellaneous titles, I don't even use my Xbox much because I spend my \"game time\" on my PC.  That's not to say that PCs are better than consoles, blah blah blah... I'm saying that PCs and consoles lend themselves well to certain TYPES of games.  For instance, you'll never see me playing Madden or Tiger Woods on my computer.  Likewise, you'll RARELY see me playing an FPS game on my console.Halo almost succeeded where most have miserably failed: creating an FPS that is viable on the console.  What impresses me most about Halo is not the graphics: it's the fact that it's the first FPS game I've played on the console that is actually easy to control.  Unfortunately, \"easy to control\" doesn't always equate to \"fun\".  I know I'm going against the tide, but I just didn't get attached to Halo the way some people seem to.  The graphics may have been great a few years ago when the Xbox launched, but today, I don't see any level of detail that can't be found in other games.  In some respects, they're even a little sub-par.  Now, with limited RAM and a limited GPU (by today's standards), one could very easily argue that these graphical limitations are the result of hardware limitations.  For instance, to its praise, Halo offers expansive environments with a lot happening on-screen all at once.  Obviously that's resource intensive, and other games that look better (Def Jam's Fight For NY and ESPN's NFL come to mind) were probably able to achieve better graphical quality because the environments were significantly smaller.  So, understand that I'm not placing my disappointment in the graphics on the shoulders of the developers, but rather on the shoulders of hardware that doesn't permit superior graphical quality AND wide open environments all at once.This is one reason why I believe FPS games are better suited for the PC.  I've been spoiled by PC FPS games that have had far superior graphics, such as Rainbow Six Raven Shield and UT2004.  The developers of these games were able to take advantage of a much larger pool of memory, CPU, and much more advanced GPUs.So I've been harping on the graphics a bit... but we all know that gameplay is perceived as the bottom-line (though I would argue that good graphics lend themselves to better gameplay since they help you to immerse yourself in the experience).  I mentioned that the controls were easy to handle (VERY easy, in fact).  Well, I found the gameplay a little boring.  I can't quite put my finger on why I felt that way - especially since the game's gameplay mechanics have been praised so much by others - but I think it's based on the fact that it's almost *too easy* to target your enemies (very large hitboxes).  The problem goes back to this being an FPS on a console: you can't make targeting too difficult (by shrinking the hitboxes), because aiming your crosshair with a thumbstick is inherently awkward to begin with.  It's a catch-22, and in my opinion, is a big reason why consoles just don't lend themselves well to FPS.I'm sure this is going to be seen as some sort of \"insult\" to consoles and console gamers, but you folks will just have to get over that.  It's not an insult; it's an observation.  Like I said earlier:  I own a PC and I own a console.  Each has its own job to do.  The PC runs the shooters, and the console runs the sports, driving, and fighting games.That's what each does best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

I played Chain of Memories, but didn't beat it, so the story is extremely confusing to me in this game. All I know is that Sora/Roxas keeps going in and out of what I call \"comas\" and they make no sense; they are just flashbacks to Kingdom Hearts. This story line is whacked and annoying. The game also starts off EXTREMELY slow for about the first 3 hours or so.Graphics: 8/10. The graphics are OKAY... people say they look A LOT better than the original, but they don't. If you ask me, there is a very slight texture difference on characters and whatnot, other than that, there is really no difference at all.Sound: 8/10. Yeah... some licensed Disney songs are in this game, of course, but there are also some annoying made tunes for this game that are extremely annoying and pointless... the game would have been better off without it.Control: 7.5/10.

This game fails more than it does succeeds, and it did not meet the level of hype it recieved. This is a so-so game that in no way can ever compare to the original. Sure it's a good play with great characters and fun levels, but the repetitiousness (is that a word?) of this game is ridiculous, and you will do a LOT of backtracking. It's also not very fun seeing videos of them sitting down and talking about nothing. ( Them being \"Roxas\" and his buddies in the begining of the game ) They talk about CRAP and just munch on random blue popsicles all the time. Did I mention they freak out when the beach is mentioned? \"It's summer and we haven't been to the beach yet!\" ...Oh yay... \"LET'S GET SOME PRETZELS!!\" And that's not the only time they get excited by pretzels... anyways, like I said, this is a game that people should play, but it's not as good as people say it is on this website.

The gameplay of course is showcased from a wild guitar that is used as a controller, instead of any dance pad. Like Dance Dance Revolution, the gameplay is very simple, you have to follow the scrolling on the screen and play your guitar chords to the best to score. There is a arrangemt of great songs here like Joan Jett & The Blackhearts I Love Rock N' Roll, and some other great guitar classics here showcased for each set of difficulty. The graphics are just driven for all gamers who can't dance, and for those who are driven pros. There is one disadvantage to the game, and that is the price.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3PM","description":"","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"Never been a lego game fan but this one is worth it","reviewText":"I've never gotten into the lego games, and my 9 year old son hasn't either.  He loves legos, he loves the lego movies, especially the ones with the Police and bad guys - he laughs his butt off when he watches them.  So when the Wii U was announced, and we saw Lego City, we figured it was a must have.Amazon still wouldn't have had it shipped yet despite being ordered over 4 months ago, but I was going to wait since the download was apparently a whopping 22GB in size.  But then I saw a local brick and mortar had it in stock, and with my reward certificates, I ended up getting it for free, so all worked out much better in the end.After waiting forever for them to actually get it out to the public, I was ready for a letdown.  I mean, that's a lot of anticipation for four months.  But it delivered on almost every front.Graphics - just stunning.  It's the little things that really catch your eye like little lego crabs scurrying along the beach.  Everything is nice and crisp, well detailed.Scope - almost daunting.  You don't realize just how huge this \"world\" you get to roam freely in is until you use the map on the game pad and start scrolling it around.  I'm sure there are people who will whip through this as fast as they can as if it's some kind of race, but I'm planning on this game taking us a nice LONG time.  There's just so MUCH to see and do.  And there's like 450 gold bricks apparently from the counter, so I know there's going to be a TON of exploration here.Side note - don't fall off the ferry building platform, that shark is RIGHT THERE and will nail you instantly.  Nearly wet myself I was so startled...The use of the game pad is just absolutely perfect.  In so many respects.  Using it like a scanner and holding it up and seeing the wireframe world around you looking for things, the way the people pop up when it's a communicator (and if you have the volume turned up on the game pad, their voice ONLY comes from the gamepad, a very nice bit of detail there), the GPS function, it's just fantastic.  I'd really hate to be playing this on any other platform now because it REALLY adds a depth to the game experience.The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because like most lego games (and the reason I never got into them) the control is just really really fussy.  And while the right stick controls the camera, so many times you have NO control over it where you really would've LIKED to spin it around to see where you are better.  Jumping is a bit of a pain at times because it can be a real pain lining up perfectly when the camera won't go where you want it to.  And driving at speeds, it's tough to do little adjustments sometimes.  Although it was VERY cool when I came across a Segway in the game and got to tool around on it, knocking down light poles and trees.But that's the ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five, since for me that adds to the frustration (especially for a 9 year old) enough to have to take a breath sometimes.  So if you're already used to that from the other Lego games and have mastered the art of movement, you may very well find this is a five star game in your estimation.The only other down side is a lack of information about the game in the manual - about all it has is the controller layout.  I've come across a few pads and even built a couple that I have no idea what they do, there's not the normal lock sign by them showing they're locked until you upgrade to a certain costume or something.  I guess I'll be doing a bit of googling as I come across things I just don't know.But none of that detracts from the overall enjoyment.  I can see why this was such a large download that even the larger black unit owners like myself were told that if it was going to be downloaded, use a USB drive.  There's just SO MUCH to this game.If you're any kind of a lego fan at all, and if you enjoyed ANY of the lego games and have a Wii U, this is an absolute MUST HAVE game for the collection.  Up till now the Sonic Transformed game was our favorite Wii U game, but this easily supplanted it as much for the game play itself as for the way they so fully integrated the gamepad into the game.  Fantastic job.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2013"}

Sure it is the best looking madden game ever. It's got various new online modes. But on par with ESPN 2K5's presentation, it is not even close. EA added a few scenes showing spectators cheering, concession box activities, cheerleading squad dancing, which were done by Sega back in the Dreamcast era. What's missing is decent in-game recap with commentary, stats presentation and comparison, pregame show, half-time report, postgame show, news recap with substance all in the sports news style. Awful, incorrect and lackluster play-by-play commentary and sparse recap and insightful colorful commentary in each game's context is worse than even Madden of the past. Have you heard the commentary in ESPN 2K series, EA? Furthermore, all the extra features entirely focuses on online-features rather than to give you real depth on pseudo-experience on NFL life. Bucketful of extra features such as crib, coach's mode, franchise mode, business mode, 1st person football, trophies were all done better almost decade ago by 2K series.The gameplay mechanics and execution is as good as ever but not a single noticeable major upgrade like 'playmaker' or 'QB vision' from the last year except gang tackles. If anything, the flow of the game is now tad slower than the last year.Just when Sega's ESPN 2K series was about to surpass Madden in terms of popularity, EA purchased the NFL exclusivity and killed off any possible competition. And the result has been dissimal except Madden 09. Madden 06 was horrible, 07 was mediocre, 08 was slightly better, 09 was actually almost great, and now 10 is very disappointing considering all the potentials it had and the hype they created.The series is exactly where EA wants it to be; game sells every year no matter what with no other competition, tons of online features that might requires additional fees. The thing that bothers me the most is that EA spends tons of money every year on Madden but not on the actual innovation. EA throws money on advertisement, NFL exclusive fee, more advertisement, online features, more advertisement, fees on new facial model for new stars, more advertisement and pay little focus on what would actually make the game great. But I am not surprised. After all, it's EA. \"EA SPORTS, IT'S NOT IN THE GAME.\" It had been in Sega's NFL 2K series. Madden 09 remains the best Madden in the series, but it took the 20th anniversary collector's edition, which includes Head Coach 09, to match all the features that was already included in ESPN 2K5. And the game was mere $20 when it was released.  Once again, ESPN 2K5 will be sorely missed this year, or until Madden actually eradicates all mistakes and come out with the definitive version.***Addendum***The people who think 2K series were superior to Madden believe so because the series captured the exact feel of the broadcasting-style NFL experience. 2K was more arcady while Madden was geared toward football simulation.I am a huge fan of NFL, to me, the only American sports still worth watching. I used to buy 2K and Madden together annually to enhance my NFL experience because neither one was perfect. I ended up enjoying 2K more overall in 2K4 and 2K5 past Madden. What pro-Madden at all cost people do not plainly see is the same software companies like EA (Spore), Activision (Modern Warfare 2) DO take their customers for granted and spend tons of money not on talent but on advertisement and business deal to ensure more people are addicted to their products (not for the right reasons) so their products will always be sold no matter what without any question asked. If you are familiar with the history of video game industry, you know how many (hundreds) talented and creative game developers were absorbed by EA, Activision and Ubisoft without rewarding the actual talents.I am not mad because EA bought NFL exclusivity or Madden sells better than majority of video games every year. In fact, I cross my finger every year that EA comes out with the definitive edition of Madden. But we're talking about EA here, the same company who thought all customers are nothing but stupid consumers who will pay for anything EA provides and to a certain extent, EA's wish has come true. If it weren't for now notoriously infamous 'Spore' backlash with the DRM to end all DRM, EA would have put even worse DRM on 'The Sims 3' and definitely would have on upcoming 'Dragon Age: Origins'. Sensible gamers made a stand enough is enough and drew the line with lawsuits, boycott and torrent downloads. EA, being efficient profit-driven company, weighted all pros and cons and decided to back down.I'll never be loyal to any company and product blindly. I'll drop my favorite games such as 'The Elder Scrolls', 'Metal Gear', 'Zelda' or 'Metroid' any time they become stale. No company or product deserves any loyalty blindly and persistently. A product should always speak for itself by the quality and worth. Is 'Madden 10' a bad product? I don't think so, hence I rewarded 3 out of 5. Is it great product that meets its potential? Not by a long shot. Is it worthy to get Madden every year if things remain unchanged? As long as people blindly buy it, you can guarantee you'll hear about 2K series in the year 3010.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"engnir1","summary":"a cool game....","reviewText":"Uncharted was a cool game to play! It is pretty much linear in design, and it did have some open areas, but you still had only one way to go through the game, so it is not an open world/sandbox style game. It did get kind of monotonous as you basically hide behind cover and shoot the bad guys with an occasional puzzle thrown in. The puzzles were interesting and some were challenging.I think there were a dozen or so different weapons, but some weren't worth using as the ammo was basically non-existent and you are only allowed to carry two weapons at a time. So I basically used the 9mm pistol and an assault rifle the entire time. Those two had the most abundant ammo and are pretty decent weapons.I do consider myself a slightly above average gamer, and it took me about 10-11 hours to complete the campaign on the normal hardness. I'm not too interested in platinum's so I didn't complete that, but I did find some hidden treasures along the way. I thought this was a fun game, and I'm glad I played it, but I don't see myself playing it again. I do have Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3 to play and hopefully those will improve upon this game.I also have the inFAMOUS collection (highly recommend) and have completed the first game in that series. I think inFAMOUS is WAY better than Uncharted, and would recommend that game over Uncharted in a second. I would still say Uncharted is a must play, because I haven't really played many like it, so it was a nice change of pace. It was fun, and I would have to recommend it.

{"product_name":"B001UEN67Y","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"All its predecessor was and more","reviewText":"Dirt 1, Colin Mcrae's first showing on the next gen consoles was a godsend for racers, it had great graphics, entertaining gameplay that was initially easy to pick up, and simultaneously difficult enough that refining slides in the game took a long time to get just right. But Dirt 2 has come to prove that codemasters' series isn't going to go away simply because Colin McRae is gone. In fact Dirt 2, intends to tribute the rallier with the best off road experience ever in a racing game. Lets see if the tribute is a good one.GraphicsWow is all i can say, the presentation and attention to detail that codemasters put into every aspect of this game with almost no framerate drops is literally insane. Cars look wonderful, and even the menu which is a 3d RV world is all animated crisply and beautiful. There are so many little things in your RV too, the rally on the tv, the magazines strewn all over tha place Dirt 1's menu on the laptop... it really is immersive and it stays that way with little load times between menus and races. In short, Dirt 2 is the most beautiful racer released to date, period.GameplayThis is a long session, gameplay is broken down into several modes for racing types,New Modes:Trailblazer:Trailblazer is a rally, without a co driver and with out fear, these are incredibly fast events, similar to the hillclimb type in dirt 1, except there is not hill and its just average point to point. But trailblazer has its own flavor, its fast and very fun, i look forward to these events everytime i play.Dominator:The racetrack is split into 4 sections and whoever has the fastest time in a section \"dominates\" that section, at the end whoever has the most dominated sections combined with the highest position in non dominated sections wins the race. Its decently fast paced but can get repetitive.Last Man StandingThe race continues until all racers save one have been eliminated, the time between eliminations is 20 seconds, and the last place driver is eliminated each 20 seconds.Landrushrace on a track with buggies and trophy trucks, but its not P2P like Raid is.Old stuff, everything but the hillclimbs are back, so the rallys, rallycross, Raid, etc. are all back with a vengeance.- Handling- Dirt 2's cars all handle differently, some are really touchy and the e-brake will make them turn around like no-one's business, and others will take a lot of coaxing to get them sideways. But Most cars are balanced in the class they are in so picking your favorites and using them is possible. Dirt 2 has some quirky handling as its an odd balance between realism and arcade, but it makes the balance work, giving a rewarding feel to beginners, and the more advanced players some options to fine tune their driving to shave those seconds off. In sort Dirt2 is easy to pick up, but very difficult to master. Usually a driver with little experience won't beat one with a lot of it.- Career - Career has 100 events with a bonus at the end, and are separated by rookie, pro, and all star. Each mode requires a pack for cars in that class which requires you to buy a package specific to that level of play, in addition packs cost money to cross - discipline cars, (Ex. if you buy a solstice, you need a rallycross pack to race in that discipline, and need a pro pack to upgrade the car for pro class races.)Career mode has you racing in events in different countries. But to unlock these other events and countries you must level your driver up. Simply racing in events will earn you experience which pools to level you up, as you level, you unlock special toys, horns, events, liveries and other items to customize your car and advance in the game firther. There are also 3 X-Games events which come up for drivers of certain levels and the world events that show up at all star level to challenge you further. Career mode is robust, it is quite challenging and it will teach you how to play the game.Sound- The soundtrack is mostly driven by rock and gives a higher paced feel, not only that i liked most of the music on the game, but if you don't like it you can turn it off. The cars sound great and all sound completely different. The sound helps the immersion feel.Online- Online is mostly the same as dirt 1 and grid, which i can't complain about, but it does feel a bit lax. Lag isn't a prominent problem and it does a good job.Overall - Dirt2 is just awesome, its better than its predecessor in just about every way, its faster, its graphics are better and its feel is more i think what dirt one wanted to achieve with the racing.Dirt 2 is worth at the very least a rent, you probably won't beat it in the time you rent it, but its worth at least that much. But Dirt 2 is definitely worth adding to your library, as its longevity is extended by its online play, which can keep you hooked for a long time.5 stars, by far the best offroader out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2009"}

At times the gameplay can be exciting, and others really boring.  The graphics can look good when looking out over a huge vista, and bad when indoors.  The animation and voice acting bring characters to life, but bad script and story make it all uninteresting.GAMEPLAY:  The controls for Rage are very, very good.  Shooting feels solid, aiming is precise, and movement is quick and responsive.  Driving vehicles, which makes up for about 40% of the game, feels right.  The maps you explore are huge and filled with detail.  It's a solid foundation that is squandered on boring missions that have no real weight.  Despite how solid the control mechanics are, the game itself doesn't offer you anything interesting to do.  When you begin the game, you will meet some people who will hand you a gun and ask you to murder other people.  And you will do it.  There is never a good explanation for WHY you are murdering other people, just that they are in a cave and you need to go murder them.  Also, why are you, a fresh noob straight out of a vault, better suited to murder mutants and such instead of the grizzled veterans who inhabit this dangerous world?  This is never explained.When you go to towns, you will talk to it's inhabitants who will ask you to murder various other people in the wasteland of Rage for paper-thin reasons.  Then you'll buy ammo and upgrades from vendors, then you'll drive a dune buggy to your destination, then you'll go inside a building or cave and murder everyone inside, then you'll return to the person you spoke to for rewards.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Unfortunately, wandering the wasteland is boring and driving is slightly less boring.  Killing mutants and whatnot can be fun, but they never really feel like a ruthless enemy.  More like fish in a barrel.  You feel no emotion toward your opponent, and thus kills don't really feel satisfying.  The AI is really good, and will duck, dodge, and weave to avoid your attacks, and battles can be challenging when stronger enemies flank you and flush you out of cover with grenades.  This rare moment is when the game shines, but it only happens about 10% of the time, and the other 90% is boring.  Instead of an \"open world\" approach, Rage would have worked better as a linear, focused affair, like id's previous game Doom 3.GRAPHICS:  This is where Rage was supposed to be outstanding.  Unfortunately on the PS3 Rage looks pretty weak.  Character models can look good close up, but not any better than what most games are offering these days.  When viewing a vast landscape, Rage can look pretty sweet, but when you look at textures close up, they look blurry and muddy.  It's like they tried to squeeze in more detail into each texture than the actual resolution could support.  It's because of this that most of the game looks like a muddy mess.  Also, on the PS3 there is a lot of texture pop-in.  Everywhere you turn, textures will pop-in from extremely low rez place holders, to medium rez, then a third pop-in to the final texture.  This happens ALL THE TIME.  Even if you look at a wall on your left and all the textures load in, then you turn right and watch all of those textures load in, if you turn back to your left all the textures that you were just looking at will have to load in AGAIN!  I can't stress enough how annoying and ugly this makes the graphics.The frame rate runs very smooth at 60 frames per second, and I only saw the frame rate dip once in the 12 hours I played.  But to maintain this smooth frame rate, other corners had to be cut.  When too many polygons are on screen for the engine to handle at 60fps, the screen resolution will drop down to 480.  I have never seen another PS3 game do this, and it was weird the first few times I saw it.  After a while I got used to it, and while it didn't affect gameplay, it was ugly nonetheless.  The lighting and other effects are good, but nothing I haven't seen done in other games.  Overall the graphics for Rage on the PS3 are dissapointing.SOUND:  The music is very good, and I enjoyed it a lot.  The voice acting is okay, although everyone's delivery was monotone.  None of it was corney, but it was also emotionless, much like the rest of the game.  The sound effects were pretty good, but at times they reminded me of old school video game SFX.  Especially distracting was the \"melting\" sound effect of dead mutants.  It was like something from the SNES.  Overall the sound did it's job, but some odd sound effect choices felt out of place.MULTIPLAYER:  Rage does not have any competitive first person shooter multiplayer, which is very odd for a game that is marketed as a first person shooter.  The competitive multiplayer is vehicle combat only.  How much you enjoy this will largely depend on how much you like the vehicles in Rage.  I did not care for the vehicles, so the multiplayer felt boring to me.  There is online co-op that does feature first person shooter gameplay, and it is more fun than the competitive multiplayer on offer.  Unfortunately the co-op only has special side missions to play, and you can not play the campaign in co-op.  If only Rage could have had local co-op, FPS multiplayer, and full campaign co-op, it could have made this game significantly better.  Other games like Gears of War 3 and Halo Reach have local co-op, competitive FPS multiplayer and full campaign co-op, so I don't think that's asking too much.Overall Rage was a dissapointment.  The story is barely there, the characters are boring, the pop-in is ugly, and the lack of multiplayer modes make this a lackluster game.  The foundation is solid, but without motivation the game feels pointless.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}

A noticibly terrible frame rate, blurry textures, missing sound effects, an even worse save system, and ridiculously long loading times plague what could have been a stellar game.  The storyline, plot twists, and even the once mediocre graphic novel-esque cut scenes are the game's few saving graces, along with the run 'n gun bullet time action that was so enjoyable in the first game, but in the end Max Payne 2's flaws outweigh it's strengths.  It's a shame more time wasn't taken to make Max Payne 2 something as memorable as the first game; I really wanted to like this game despite it's flaws, but they're just too much.

When the characters pick up speed and start flying every which way, you're instantly reminded of what Sonic is really about. The levels are nicely varied, and some like the obligatory casino pinball stages are fantastic to look at and play through. The framerate never dips, and the levels guide you along on a set path without ever making you feel confined. Sonic isn't Mario, and subjecting him to exploratory missions wouldn't feel right.However, Sonic Heroes will also test your patience. The team idea of switching between 3 characters is novel, but constantly rotating between them gets tiresome. Also, having four teams feels a bit unnecessary. Everyone wants to play as Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, and Amy and Cream are decent additions. But the alligator and bee? A bulky robot and an oversized idiotic cat? It doesn't help that Sega went with the voice actors from the 4Kids Sonic X series, who seem to match their roles appropriately but speak in shrill, high-pitched tones (and speak they do...the characters can't seem to shut up sometimes). There are other, technical annoyances. Some levels seem to guide you through on auto-pilot, while others have you line up odd jumps that have you falling to your death (the rail canyon stages). Also, at an average of 5-6min per level, you're left wondering if things will end soon. I know Sega wants to extend playing value, but I'm not sure if this is how to do it.I've actually ended up listing more bad than good here, but this is still a fun game. The sense of speed and wonder outweigh the game's flaws, and it's worth the investment as a player's choice value title.

JRPG games tend to lose my interest in about 5 to 10 hours, but this game is one of those rare exceptions that has me craving more.Without spoiling much of the story, this game is about a hero with a special sword that lets him see into the future.  Naturally, he needs to save his people from a terrible threat and finds himself at the forefront of an epic war with his loyal companions by his side.  Admittedly, the set-up is a little generic, but the story and characters are well written and gain momentum throughout the game as things progress.  Combined with quality gameplay and a long story with tons of side-quests, there is a lot to look for in this game.GAMELENGTH: So far, I'm only 20 hours into the game and it feels like the main story is just picking up.  I've been doing a lot of side-quests and it seems that most of the estimates on the internet are very accurate when they say the game will take between 60 and 70 hours to beat.  There are literally hundreds of quests to complete in the game.  The world is massive.  I easily spent 12 hours in the first area of the game alone.  You can pretty much go anywhere you want, but you will quickly find yourself in some areas where the monsters are way too powerful if you start getting a little too curious and wander too far astray.GAMEPLAY: The combat and many other gameplay mechanics are probably most similar to some of the massively multi-player games out there like World of Warcraft.  Although there is a primary story arc you can find side-quests all over by talking to random people and characters you meet throughout the game.  Quests range from item collection fetch quests, delivery quests, kill X number of creature quests, and challenge quests where you are expected to slay a unique and power special monsters.  There are a lot of NPCs to talk to and keep track of, in true JRPG fashion.  Luckily, the vast majority of the side-quests and NPCs are not necessarily important, but they can be a lot of fun to talk to them, trade with them, and complete their quests.COMBAT is a nice blend of automatic attacking mixed with special abilities that have cool-down timers.  Although the game is single-player only and you only directly control one character at a time you still have a party of other characters to back you up.  You can switch between characters as the primary character and the others operate on auto-pilot.  Don't let that fool you though, because the game doesn't just play itself.  Combat can get very hectic very fast and requires that you keep a close eye on your character, your abilities and your allies.  There is also a mechanic that allows you to do linked chain attacks using special abilities of each of the party members.  So far my experience is that it can be rather difficult to build up the Party Meter that allows you to use these attacks, but when you can pull them off, they are devastating.  Additionally, the combat gameplay actually incorporates the main character's ability to see into the future, periodically showing you what is about ready to happen to the party and thus giving you a chance to change the future.  It is definitely a neat twist on combat and it is handled rather well.INVENTORY AND CRAFTING: Like most RPGs, this game has a lot of inventory management.  Some people (like my crazy roommate) love managing and tweaking inventory, some people hate it.  I lean towards hating it in this game in the same way I hate it in most RPGs, but this game does it pretty well compared to most.  You will get a lot of loot and periodically you will have to just spend some time sorting and selling the junk you don't want.  You get lots of storage so you can go quite a long time without having to do an inventory cleanup which is very good in my opinion.  The game also incorporates a gem crafting mini-game that allows you to create mods for you gear.  The crafting mini-game is decent and I'm sure it has its uses for people that want that extra edge on their enemies, but so far I'm doing pretty well without doing much crafting.GRAPHICS: This game is a mixed bag graphically.  The character models are nicely done but are very low resolution.  Animations are often repetitive and characters and monsters often fade into existence visibly out of thin air as you approach.  In that respect, the game is pretty average by today's standards.  The game excels by providing gorgeous and massive environments with rich colors and interesting architecture with brilliant artistic style and flavor.  As a current generation game, the game suffices in the graphics department. As a Wii game, the game is one of the absolute best looking titles on the system.SOUND: The music in this game is great but as with anything you listen to for 60+ hours, it will eventually get a little repetitive.  There is a reasonable amount of voice acting in the game and what is done is done well, although the animations and voice acting tend to be off more often than not.  Since the game has not been localized to the United States the voice acting is done by European actors instead so you will notice some accents.  I personally like it because it gives a bit of cultural flavor to the experience.STORY: Like I said before, the story is long and engaging.  It does have a few annoying elements to the story that seem to plague all video game stories, but overall I have to say this is definitely one of the better stories I've seen in a game.CONTROLS: The controls are pretty smooth.  They aren't amazing but they aren't bad either and they definitely get the job done.  I never feel like I am fighting the controls and they allow me to focus on the game.  Since this game supports using the classic controller I haven't even tried using the Wii Remote at all.  I can say the classic controller works great for this game.  The camera controls are a little slow, but they really have no effect on my enjoyment of the game.PROS+++ Long and engaging story+++ Literally hundreds of quests+++ Quality voice acting+++ Great music (but you get to listen to it for 60 hours)+++ Amazing environments+++ Deep and involved inventory customization+++ Deep and involved combatCONS--- The under-powered Wii shows its limitations and you can often see how the programmers had to \"cheat\" with the graphics to make sure the game runs smoothly.--- Tracking down where you need to go for sub-quests can be really hit and miss and can leave you wandering.  Luckily the main quest-line goals are very clear.--- Inventory management may be a little tedious for some folks--- Combat can get very hectic and overwhelming at times--- Some bosses are brutally lethal and you may have to fight the same boss many times before progressing.All in all, I have to say this is an absolutely enjoyable game, and as a Wii game it is simply amazing.  The blend of classic RPG action mixed with real-time combat and party based mechanics has me hooked.  I typically don't like most modern RPGs except Fallout or Mass Effect, but I am definitely enjoying this game more than anything else I've played on the Wii for over a year.  If you are looking for a great RPG experience, pick this game up immediately.  The limited release in America is probably going to make this game very expensive very quickly, but I could be wrong.========NOTE: As stated by other users, this game is available through Game Stop at normal retail price for new release games.  At the time of this writing, most of the Amazon sellers offering this game are trying to mark the game up way more than they should be, double in some cases.  Of course, if you don't have a GameStop in your area, Amazon is definitely a good place to consider buying.========","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}

But the truth is, if there weren't major problems with the controller, Microsoft wouldn't have taken the time and resources to bring the Japanese controller to the States. So now, the Xbox Controller S has made it to the States. Does it have what it takes to be a vast improvement over its American counterpart? Sadly, no. While it does improve upon some areas of the original controller, it falls incredibly short in others.First, the improvements. The size of the controller has been reduced, which is good news for all those people who complained about the American controller's large size. The triggers feel a lot more comfortable and responsive, and the D-pad actually feels better and more usable. But the biggest improvement has to be the face buttons. On the original controller, the colored face buttons were in an awkward, bunched-together set up that made it difficult to find the right button without looking right at the controller. With the Xbox Controller S, the set up is more natural, making it easier to find the right button. The buttons are also more much flatter, which means gamers no longer have to press horrible oval-shaped buttons.But then there are the flaws. The first is the Xbox logo. Why Microsoft puts that enormous logo there is beyond me. Do they really think we'll forget which gaming system we're playing and need to remind us with a big, round logo that actually makes the Xbox Controller S look even uglier than the first controller? Because of the placement of the logo, the Start and Select buttons were moves to under the first analog stick, which makes it somewhat awkward for most people to press them with their left hand. But the biggest flaw is undoubtedly the black and white buttons. In the American controller, they were placed above the face buttons; they took some getting used to, but were accessible. With the Xbox Controller S, they are placed below the face buttons in a sloppy configuration, and just trying to press these buttons is a pain because they are set deeper in the controller than the face buttons.With this said, which controller is better? American or Japanese? Truth be told, neither is better than the other. Actually, each controller has its advantages over the other in certain games. For example, the D-pad on the Controller S makes \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3\" and \"Dead or Alive 3\" much easier to play, but the analog sticks on the American controller work a lot better on \"Halo\" and \"Project Gotham Racing\". If only Microsoft would take these controllers' strengths and place them in a hybrid controller, then they would have the ultimate controller.Make no mistake, the Controller S isn't terrible; however, it's also not the saving grace controller that everyone wants it to be. It has its strengths and weaknesses, just like the American controller, and it'll hopefully point Microsoft in the right direction for a third and perfect controller for the Xbox.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2002"}

There was a good mix of tension, strategy, and narrative. I'm a big fan of the Hitman series, and this game reminds me a lot of Agent 47's adventures. Thief: Deadly Shadows (T:DS) is dark and at times creepy, and Garrett (the protagonist) seems a perfect fit for the edgy world that he plies his trade in. While T:DS is not a great game, it does a number of things well.Gameplay: The game plays as a typical first-person adventure game, using the ASWD keys and the mouse to control much of the action. Garrett has to complete a number of missions in and around a dark medieval-like city as 3 factions vie for control. All of the missions follow a basic formula: sneak into an area, loot it, and get out. The missions are generally well done, and a few are downright spooky. If you can do all of your work unseen, all the better since the game places a premium on stealth. Garrett hides well in shadows--fortunately it is always night time in the game--and is quite lethal when his enemies are unaware of him. However, he is very weak in melee and usually goes does in a few blows. Also, he is a wanted man from the very beginning. Even in the city, you'll find yourself sneaking around to avoid guards, and you must be careful about committing crimes in front of other citizens.The game has a lot of options. You have a number of nice tools to work with, from various arrows to climbing gloves and explosives. Also, you'll be able to cash in your loot for additional supplies at local shops. Most missions can be completed without killing anyone. However, you also have the option of using your arrows and daggers for lethal results. Overall, the story is unremarkable, and there are really no big surprises. However, the stealthy roleplaying is really immersive and is good for about 35 solid hours of gameplay.Graphics: Very good. No complaints except for the excessive use of a few character models and the awkward way in which unconscious and dead bodies sometimes come to rest. This is a dark game which uses lighting and smoke effects as well as any game I've played. The cutscenes are decent and do their job of advancing the plot. Overall, the graphics are quite fine and give the game an appropriately gloomy feel.Sounds: Most sounds work well for creating atmosphere, whether footsteps, guard chatter, thunder, or creaking doors. There is a bit of music scattered throughout the game, but it's mostly forgettable. The voice acting is decent to good, though it sounds like the same two guys did all of the guards.Overall, I found T:DS to be quite enjoyable. It was very stable on my computer and came with a decent amount of documentation. I recommend it to anyone who likes action-adventure games or stealthy gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2005"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense.

I've played every version of it since released back on PS1. This is the prettiest version and the largest version. But it's lost it's soul. A while ago.First- the game was in development too long. That LONG gestational period dried up the passion and it shows. The graphics are truly stellar in most parts (crap in others... really crap) but the \"fun\" is GONE. I blame the controller for a lot of it. If you have a good wheel- USE IT. The DS just stinks for driving power.The tuning is nice but... feels academic. There doesn't feel like there's a real shift in performance with most tuning and it's not always easy to understand what's supposed to do what anyway. Tires alterations should be the most obvious, but I still don't feel connected to the road after making adjustments.This may be the best SIM on the system, but it's not the best racer IMO. I'd go with arcade games for the best racing. GRID for example, is awesome. There's almost no 'realism' in that game, but it's a thousand times more \"fun\". If you have a lot of time to devote to GT5- and I mean a LOT of time- you'll eventually get to the higher end cars and it starts to open up a bit more. It's the same tracks but you'll see them turn into blurs and that makes it a bit more entertaining for all the work you'll be putting into it. And there are other fun things to do in the game. The photo mode isn't really 'fun', but it's gorgeous if you have one of the nice modeled cars. Online is fine but not really that much different. At least the real world people drive real world-ish. The AI in this software is terrible. There's NO personality to the AI racers and that makes it feel more like they're just there for you to pass and shove around.Musically this game is pretty great in places. The menu's exude class and look great to boot. The in-game is mostly forgettable with a few exceptions, but that's what stereo's are for.The additional content is great and for the price- this is the best option if you haven't already gotten into GT 5 when it came out. If you have multiple systems- Forza Motorsport 4 on the Xbox 360 is a much, much better game (sim and racer and fun and personality and soul and musica. Graphically, FM4 is more consistently beautiful but GT5 outshines it in certain places with the right car and right track combination). And if you have a PC, there are a ton of better sims out there but without a wheel, this may be a better bet (depending on your PC set up).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2012"}

Zidane, a monkey tailed guy, the protagonitst, one of the band, finds the princess, and while the queen watches the play , the princess agrees to being kidnap because her mother is acting very strange, thinks her mother is plotting a war against the nations. The story goes on, and no one in this game is who appears to be, the princess is not who she thinks she is, Zidane is not very human; more characters appear as the plot thickens.What I don't like about it, is that it looks less real (like ff8,x, XI, XII, XIII), it doesn't have that many sidequests like ff8 or ffX-2. The dungeons are not that interesting like in FFX or FF8, the superboss is not fun like Omega in FF8, this superboss heals himself and is extremely hard. What I do like, is that it's the story keeps you guessing, the weapons/abilities system is kind of fun (The weapons have the abilities that the characters need to learn.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

The rebellion's only hope is a mysterious young hero riding a dragon. In aerial-combat action gamePanzer Dragoon Orta, you are that hero, and you'll employ multiple weapons and dragon powers against a variety of enemies. The game features unlockable subquests, that allow you to play the game from the enemy's perspective, and a branching story line with unique encounters.","reviewerName":"darkguardian2 \"darkguardian2\"","summary":"Not so much a game but a test of your frustration...","reviewText":"This game requires a great great great deal of patience. The environment's graphics are eye catching. You play Orta who escapes from a prison where you were kept not for crimes but as a weapon to be used in future wars. This escape leads to a chase through different lands battling the Empire trying to recapture you. The game is a rail game in that the direction of motion is already chosen like a roller coaster. Your job is to dodge and destroy the enemy with the drone at your disposal. There are 10 long levels with bosses at each levels. The frustration comes in that any mode the game is in is not easy. You can make it up to and pass the boss but if you don't finish the level you either have to start ALL over again at the beginning of the level or if your lucky at the boss. This may or may not be a good thing since you start with the life points at the level you entered with. No whole new life so if you're barely alive you might as well restart the level. The other problem I have with this game is that if you do get to the boss and have to leave to do errand or homework there's no saving AT the boss. You either have to keep the box on or start the level all over again. Changing dragon modes takes practice but my next gripe regards control response after trasforming to the desired dragon especially from Heavy wing to Glide Attack. There's a lag in that you can't glide for 3-4 seconds after tranforming and this has nothing to do with the regeneration bar. I've played video games sinces 1976. This game is way difficult and not recommended for little kids. You will get blisters on your fingers from firing and transforming. There are subtitles and the characters speak an unfamilar language. The movies can be skipped by pressing \"start\". There are lots of \"Easter eggs\" in the game. The real bad thing about this is it's replayability. I'm presently on Level 4 (Normal) and after all the levels are done I WON'T be playing this game any more. There's just no way I'lll take that trip again. It's like Boot Camp.

Why? Because people don't want to read a review that bashes the game they like. They just vote for the reviews that support their own views. So please, don't give me like 10,000 unhelpful votes just for expressing an opinion. I didn't like it but a lot of people did and that's ok.Having bought a used gamecube, I got Paper Mario as one of the games. I thought I was missing out before, but boy was I wrong. This game is horrifically boring in every way possible.Let's start with the graphics. They're good, and as you probably guessed, are 2D cel-shaded graphics for Mario and the rest of the world. Being a huge fan of Super Mario RPG for the SNES, I was extremely disappointed with this new appearance, giving it an extremely kiddy feel rather than the more mature feeling of Super Mario RPG. What a shame. It's comparable to the change in style between Windwaker and Ocarina of Time in the Zelda series, except that they were able to retain good elements and keep it excellent. Here they weren't. Still, the graphics are decent, and are part of the gameplay so I won't knock them down for it. 8/10The audio in Paper Mario is a mixed bag. It has sound effects down and everything, but the music just stinks. It doesn't alternate and quickly gets boring. The lack of voice acting seals the deal, especially considering there's a lot of dialogue. 6/10The gameplay is where it really shoots itself in the foot. The battle system is so boring, and you're confined to using Mario and a sidekick who is basically useless. There isn't even any equipment besides the badges you periodically get. Finding the Crystal Stars is both boring and mind-numbingly predictable. The only decent parts are the boss battles. Otherwise, there is just nothing fun about the gameplay. 5/10The story is even worse. Save Peach and the world. That's the story in a nutshell. Same one they used in Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario and every single Mario game. Characters are predictable and stereotypical, plot is predictable and boring, and it just feels like Nintendo once again milking the Mario franchise. I don't expect Shin Megami Tensei here or anything, but at least something respectable. 3/10Conclusion: Don't even waste your time or money on this horrible game. It's so incredibly over rated. I really wanted to like it, but frankly this is just another horrible cube RPG. I know there are a lack of them on this system, but rating this game high just to say you have a good RPG is just wrong. Once again, Mario is just being milked for all he's worth. Stay far far away.

Johnson","summary":"Made me feel like I was there!! Loved it.","reviewText":"As many of you already realize there there is no shortage of FPS these days.  Fortunately this one has managed to set itself apart from the other FPS (excluding Halo), that have saturated this genere.Call of Duty takes place during WW2.  Depending on the level your on, you are either an American,British or Russian soliders in an army.  Unlike many other FPS's where you are basically a \"Rambo\" type, Call of Duty instead does a good job in making you just another person in the army.  There are some few levels where you are on your own, but for the most part its you and the army fighting together.The graphics on this game is nothing that is earth shattering, but they do however do a very good job into capturing the WW2 feel.  Just playing the first few levels, it is easy to get caught up in your surrounding and actually think you somehow travelled back in time and ended up in the 1940's fighting in WW2.  I espeically loved the Stalengrad level and also the level where you are fighting in the trenches.  I even enjoyed the \"training\" level in which a quartermaster is barking orders to you while you complete tasks in a very realistic looking training course.The sound in this game also does a very good job in successfully capturing the overall \"war\" feel.  To really appreciate the sound, you must have your speakers turned up a notch.  It was kind of scary running through the fields and having mortars blowing up all around me.  The gun shots, mortars hiting the ground around you and voice acting all contribute to an enjoyable experience.The overall game play was also done very well.  The controls are almost indentical to most other FPS's.  But this in no way affect the gameplay.  Unlike other FPS however where you can carry at least 9 large guns, here you can only carry what a real human can feasibly carry at one time, this consists of a large gun, a sidearm, and some grenades.  There are always weapons available, but you must drop your weapon before picking up a new one.  You can also pick up your enemies weapons, or your fallen comrades weapons, so there is usually not shortage of ammo or weapons in most cases.Overall I really enjoyed this game, and plan to play it again.  The level do get a bit tedious and boring near the middle of the game, but the last levels more than make up for it.  This game is extremely fun an addictive, if you ever dreamed of fighting in a war without running the risk of getting shot or killed, then this game is probally the closest your going to be able to get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2004"}

They tried and they definetely beat FF12. But this is NOT a final fantasy experience.What you may notice is that the battle system isn't random. Now this non-random thing is pretty debatable because think of it this way: when it's random every now and then you would have to engage in battle no questions asked. In this game you have bump into your opponents before facing them, however most of the time the enemies are put into positions where it's impossible to get past them so it would make no difference whether or not it was random or noticable.The battle system within the battles tries to be revolutionary by letting you move the characters close to the enemies and pressing buttons to use commands that you want. Although better than the gambit system in FF12 the only thing that's different to the ATB system is that you have to walk up to the enemies. Not revolutionary but a slight and unnoticable improvement.The characters have their stories to tell but at points this could be irritating. The cutscenes are very very very very very very long. Some can be up to two hours and can be very tedious as they don't seem to have the RPG cutscene charm as much as other RPG games. But the characters are...intersting however you may never use some of the characters.One of the most addictive parts of the game is the inventing system. Although simple this system allows you to invent, place patents, and become the top inventer as you watch your items being sold in the shop. However you need to pay alot of your money.Buy this game if you're an RPG fan...if not you should buy something else.......God of War anyone?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2008"}

So many Pokemon-related stuff coming out: cereal, plush toys, band-aids, and games of course. Here we have a different approach to the Catch-em-All tagline: you take their picture. It's fun, neat and short.Story: You don't play Pokemon games for their story but essentially Pokemon professor and researcher Oak wants pictures taken of the Pokemon so you hop in his vehicle and travel different areas to do it. Pretty simple, no?Graphics: This is in the N64 days so it's not incredibly detailed but it does its job well although you might find like the Simpsons, Pokemon look odd in 3D.Sound/Music: Unlike the Gameboy games, the characters actually say their name for once which is a good plus. Music was ok but nothing hummable, like most Pokemon music.Gameplay: The pictures you take are ranked in basic areas: how close they are to camera and not extreme close-up or faraway either; whether they're in the middle of the frame, if they're doing a special pose and if there's more of them in frame. To get the poses you have 3 basic moves: using your Poke-flute which could make them dance or maybe fall asleep, bait to get them closer to camera or a ball which basically gets them mad. Some also can net you a great photo such as one level, if you knock Pikachu off a balloon and you do something else you can get Pikachu to ride Articuno for extra bonus.One complaint is the fact that you'll often re-try levels cause your machine is just too damn fast. Trying to take a picture of a creature when you need so much prep time isn't the best thing. You'd have to have incredibly good aim for many things too. Another complaint is that there's only around 60-65 Pokemon....out of 151?(This is pre Gold-Silver games). Some of my favorites from the games are not even in here like I don't think I saw one Eevee or its evolutions in the game.Having an interest in photography I can appreciate a game like this but photography in a lot of cases is about patience. Waiting for that perfect moment before you click and riding that machine just quite frankly sucks but if you're into Pokemon, try it out(if you can find it still).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2005"}

I am just a gamer, not a writer. So here are very summarized thoughts:- This game does not have trophies, which really sucks. The game is difficult so it sucks that you don't get even one single bronze trophy.- The game includes missions where you must use the motion sensor capabilities of the PS3 controller, to guide arrows and cannon balls. This is damn tricky and difficult at the beginning but once you get the feel of it it's very nice. Pretty innovative.- The game is relatively short. I don't think it has a lot of replay value to be honest.- I don't want to spoil the story but given how the game ends, it's difficult to think of an iteration.- The graphics are cool but nothing out of the ordinary for PS3.- Learning the combat moves is a must if you want to complete the game, particularly to beat the bosses.Overall, the game is very nice.

A definition I was reminded of after the latest Must-be-OnLine-to-play disaster. If there ever were an attempt to prove that there is, indeed, bad publicity,  the release of SimCity 2013 sure was it.Mega-publishers are repeatedly trying to turn the beautiful artform of gaming into a utility, where &#34;gaming content&#34; will be streaming to your TV or PC or phone - and you will be charged by the second for it. Monopolistic issues aside for the moment, are they even remotely ready for such a model? It matter because their every attempt is (involuntarily!) financed by the customers they manage to scam in paying for games that do not deliver the gaming experience advertised. Paying for a product or a service that you do not receive because the seller planed it this way is the definition of a scam. So calling it an idiocy is in fact generous.Let's count the number of times the same idiocy was repeated, shall we?Bioshock,Spore,Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,Splinter Cell(or any UbiSoft game at this point),Command & Conquer 4(was that a stinker!),Diablo III, SimCity 2013 (and every single EA game requiring ORIGIN). The list is long and it could go on.The problem with gaming today is not the hard-working and creative people working in game studios but the executives at the top of game publishing houses, the likes of EA, ActiVision/Blizzard and 2K.They do not love, comprehend or even care about the product they are marketing. They might as well be peddling sacks of potatoes. And they clearly do not care about the game developers who provide them with games to market. They only care about one thing: their annual bonuses. And their bonuses depend solely on last trimester's profits.That is why they operate on a very short-sighted basis.Sell the most popular games for over $150 by portioning them in thin DLC slices? Sure!Release games before they are completed to catch the Summer or Christmas market? Why not?Exploit and truncate a beloved franchise in order to promote the new Digital Distribution DRM? Go ahead!Ruin the experience of most paying customers by forcing them to log on to servers that do not exist? Who is to stop us?They do not care about the company they are running (and the bigger it is, the easier to dissociate) because this time next year they may be running a company selling hardware or health care insurance or weed control. So, they do not care whether they insult, make angry and chase away customers the company they are now running enjoyed for years. It takes almost a decade for a game studio to acquire a loyal fan base. Yet it only takes a couple of months to chase them away never to come back.But the bozos at the top do not care. They will have grabbed their fat bonuses and run.Who is there to stop them?Well, we all are. I, for one, have stopped buying EA and UbiSoft games for some time now.We are the Gandalfs standing on the bridge they want to cross.And THEY. SHALL NOT.

What with all the 3D hoopla and the console wars, someone out there hasn't forgotten the pleasures of 2D gaming.  Thank you, Konami, for Contra: Shattered Soldier.After two horrendous outings on the original PlayStation, one of the most beloved franchises in gaming history has returned with a vengeance...and yes, it's in 2D!  Old-schoolers rejoice - you've now got a reason to bring those long-forgotten razor-sharp reflexes out of the closet.  Contra: SS takes a few liberties with the old formula, but the result is a gorgeous, difficult throwback that will bring back all those memories.  Contra is back in a big way.  If you played, and enjoyed, any of the previous Contra games, you'll fall for Shattered Soldier big time.  Everything's here, and then some.For those too young to remember: prepare yourself for a gaming experience unlike any other.  Contra: Shattered Soldier is a side-scrolling action shooter in which you must survive by destroying everything in sight - in fact, you're actually GRADED by how much you destroy via a readout called Hit Rate %.  You control master criminal Bill Rizer (released from a cryosleep prison sentence for killing 80% of the world's population - how's that for over-the-top, eh?) or his female android companion Lucia, sent to save post-apocalyptic Earth from swarms of some of the most disgusting yet glorious aliens to ever grace a console.  The set-up is simple:  move left to right and fire away at approaching enemies.  You can fire your three weapons in any of eight directions, ducking or jumping as the situation demands.  You'll hang from ledges, crawl up walls, and be slung airborne underneath a guided missile.  You'll ride a hoverbike and ski down a snowy mountain.  You'll be attacked by everything from gigantic water-skiing mechs to mechanized turrets to hideous mutant fish to screen-filling monstrosities that almost defy description.  The game fits its Shattered Soldier name all too well:  touch an enemy - you're dead.  Get hit by explosive vomit - you're dead.  Get nailed by a bullet, rocket, laser, or explosion - you're dead.  Get carried away by giant insects - you're dead.  There are lots of ways to die in Contra: SS, and by the time you're done, you'll lose count, it'll happen so often.  Play alone or with a friend for some co-op action - you'll need the help.  Choose at any time from a machine gun, flame thrower, or grenade launcher (each equipped with a chargeable special attack), and don't worry about running out of ammo - you won't.  The name of the game is run n gun.  If you're lucky and good enough to make it through all the levels alive, unlockables await.  You see, this is how gaming used to be - trial and error, rock-hard challenge, pattern memorization.  You'll progress slowly, but each time you'll make it a little farther and be presented with another disgusting alien just begging to be blown to slimy bits.  Eventually, with practice, you'll emerge victorious, and wonder why more games these days don't feel like Contra: Shattered Soldier.  It's one of the most intense rides you can take on the PS2 - enjoy it, for it may be one of the last.Enthusiastically recommended - Konami has created one of the best games of the year, and one not to be missed by anyone who craves a masterfully executed, adrenaline-pumping thrill ride.

At the time the cheapest new copy of the game I could get was $70, so I was expecting much more from the game.However, a few months ago, after finishing Ghost Trick, I decided to give Radiant Historia another chance. And now here I am, a little over a year and a quarter from when I first picked the game up, writing a review, having just finished it a few hours ago.I don't exactly recall what caused me to put the game down, but having now gone through the game I think it may just been the wrong time for me, as both the story and music - two of the major reasons I typically enjoy RPGs over all other genres - are pretty dang good.The musical score at times reminds me of Final Fantasy VI, Nier, and Lost Odyssey. The branching storyline reminds me of Chrono Trigger (albeit it's definitely not as complex). The character art reminds me of Blue Dragon (or maybe just Raynie reminds me strongly of Zola).The gameplay is perhaps the one slightly insignificant aspect, as while it does feature some complexity when it comes to moving the location of enemies on the 3x3 grid they inhabit, I found myself using 4 characters (including the main one who can't be swapped out) for most of the endgame, depending upon who I had access to in the storyline.In short, I found the game to be really quite good, once I was able to really get into it. However, I'm not sure how much of the 40+ hours I put into the game will stick with me down the road, especially given the fairly safe ending.I give Radiant Historia 4 of 5 stars, primarily because of the great music and story/mission structure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

This game has the most well written story that I have ever seen in my decade of game-playing (which stems back to the Atari).  The dialouge is beautifully written and seems to be genuine Old English scripting.  The musicis kinda bad though.  I really didn't care for it as it sounded more like etheral background music with no real melody line, just chording.  The weapon and armor design is a nice touch too.  You can make your own weapons and armor by combining blades and armor pieces to form stronger (or in many cases weaker) weapons.  This coupled with a simple Risk system and battles become a lot of fun to try to master.  This comes even more into play with bosses.  The bosses in this game are very difficult, but their difficulty can be slashed if you have the right weapon to use against it.  The game plays very much like the game Brandish (for those with SNES).  You are Ashley Riot and arein a giant maze-like area and you hack and slash your way after the evil Sydney who has kidnapped the Duke's son.  You travel from area to area gaining treasures and defeating bosses and that pretty much is it.

{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"Carmilla","summary":"Perfect? Not quite...","reviewText":"This game is not perfect as the Famitsu review would lead you to believe. Famitsu has only given like 5 games a perfect score... this being one of them.The characters, design, music, story, atmosphere, and presentation are all top notch and beautiful. The story is sursprisingly mature and the characters are all memorable, especially that mystery man Sydney.So if all of those things are so good and put together, why did this game 'ultimately' fail when it was released? Because of its gameplay.The gameplay 'could have' been fun and classic but the makers decided to bog it down with a tremendously confusing, tedious, and unintuitive menu and weapon system.The base of this game, its weapon system, is beyond complicated. Each weapon can be either piercing, blunt, or edged like a edged sword or a blunt hammer. Then each weapon has about 20 'affinities' such as light, water, physical, undead, etc. Then throw in the fact that each weapon must be made from seperate parts such as a blade, a grip or hilt, plus 1-3 gems. Lost yet? You should be.But thats not all. Each weapon has damage points, kind of like health for weapons, and phantom points which inscrease special attacks. Throw in the fact that the longer you fight the more tired or excited your character gets, which leads you to miss more often and take more damage as the battle goes on.This game does have an awesome quick menu that can be used with the L2 button. This menu lets you do anything from find items to use magic with one push of a button. However, for some reason there is no weapon quick menu in a game almost totally based around your weapons! To change weapons, and you will often, you have to make about 5 clicks through slow menus which can take anywhere from 10 secs to a minute.This games difficult learning curve has turned away so many players without the patience to learn this games ridiculous systems. After all, hitting a boss for 1 damage, when he has 500 health, can be very frustrating, and i dont blame them.In the end, this game is both brilliant and ridiculous. It has been voted one of the greatest games of all time and for good reason. But it also failed on a commercial and gameplay level by not selling enough copies.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"One of the Best Games of 2005, One of the Best Games in Years","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 is flawless.  Its presentation, stage design, controls, graphics, and sound are unparalleled in almost any other current-generation video game.While never a big fan of the original Resident Evils, Resident Evil 4's change in game design had me hooked right from the start, when the game immediately throws you in to non-stop action.  Rather than slower-paced, puzzle-based survival horror, Resident Evil 4 can better be described as action horror: sort of a slower paced The Suffering in terms of the amount of action.  The horror no longer comes from jump-out-loud-noise scares either; you will be scared just because of how intense the action gets, and how many close-calls you have on your adventure.The gameplay is from a fixed, over the shoulder follow camera, rather than set cameras a la previous Resident Evils.  This allows the action to flow much better, and better still, allows Capcom to implement their genius shooting mechanics.  Aiming is crucial in this game.  Aiming for the head or for the leg will depend on how much ammo you have and how many enemies are on screen.  If you are surrounded, knocking down a few enemies temporarily by shooting them in the leg is a better tactic than lining up a few head shots.Graphically, this game is in a league of its own on current-gen systems.  Its real-time graphics are rivaled only by the pre-rendered visuals in previous Gamecube Resident Evil outings.  The only disappointment graphically is that there is no background interaction; nothing reacts when shot except enemies.  This is too bad, but not a change from Resident Evil games of the past, where everything was pre-rendered anyway.Also, the weapons upgrade system is genius, and is the reason I kept coming back for more.  It is just addicting, simple as that.  Collecting money from fallen enemies and hidden treasure chests, and then spending it on new weapons or on upgrades to old weapons is strategic and rewarding.I've been a serious gamer for fourteen years, and never before have I replayed a game so many times.  Even once I had unlocked everything I found myself periodically playing through the game again every month or so.  Worth getting, without doubt.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"nafysmiley","summary":"Final Fantasy IV bad, Chrono Trigger good","reviewText":"I had never played either FF IV or Chrono Trigger before this, so this review isn't a nostalgia thing.  Chrono Trigger is highly regarded as a classic SNES RPG, and one of the best games ever by some.  FF IV is a Final Fantasy game.  I was pleased and a little bit tired of Chrono Trigger once I'd finished, and I never wanted to see FF IV ever again.I played FF IV first, and it wasn't cool.  I'd expected more from it.  It did start out okay, and it does have cool characters, like Cecil the morally conflicted dark knight, and Kain, and Cid the crazy airship builder, and Edge the ninja prince.  But it just fell to pieces.  The first major problem is when Cecil is turned from a decent character into a sissy paladin a couple hours in.  That was just lame.  This meant that instead of having an interesting role to play (the conflict between morals and following orders), you are just saving the world.  That is what you do in most games, but in FF IV it isn't a well developed theme.  The story is okay, but not innovative, though there is some cool stuff (like the underground dwarves).  The ending was just stupid.The main problem, though, is the combat system.  It has the standard Final Fantasy action system, which is decent, but it doesn't have action bars, which it seems to need to keep itself honest.  This results in enemies attacking four times between each of your guy's moves.  There is also plenty of spell junk, the worst offender being the enemies which give all of your guys every negative status affect at the same time.  This is especially annoying because FF IV has at least ten different status affects.  The boss fights are all based on finding the trick rather than having to perform well, which is a bad thing.  Fighting becomes boring quickly, and you do a lot of it, because the random encounter rates are high (though some more recent games still top it in that respect).The music is actually good for its age, though it gets annoying after awhile.  FF IV is also too old to discredit the graphics.  Just to mention, the translation was bad, like most old Japanese games.  And to air some minor grief's, each FF IV save takes up 2 blocks, and the save times are crazy long.  It took about 20 hours to finish.  Also, I had to level up for 5 hours before the final boss (which is a fourth of the game) which was the most infuriating thing ever.  FF IV could have stood for 4 or 5 stars when it came out, but no more than 2 now.  Some games can stand the test of time well.  FF IV could not.Chrono Trigger, on the other hand, is a great game, that would have been the best game ever if I'd played it when it came out.  It is definitely an RPG classic.  It has awesome characters, like Frog, and Robo, although their default names could use a little work (Crono, Marle, Lucca...ick).The storyline is the best part, and is one of the best I can recall.  It features some excellent dialogue, and flashbacks, and in-game cutscenes.  The anime cutscenes they added in were nifty, and they left the old ones in too, which was an excellent touch.  The time travel aspect of the game was also a lot of fun.  The graphics are nice enough, and actually good for the SNES.  The style is rather unique.  The music, a few songs in specific (like the \"Frog Theme\"), is good, and even stirring at times.The combat is all right, though it eventually begins to stagnate, so I could only take Chrono Trigger in small doses.  It uses a standard action system, with the main difference from other RPG's being that each character has a list of moves they learn in order, instead of having all the spells available.  I can't decide if this is better or worse.  The boss fights are unique, though several fall victim to being trick fights as well.  Chrono Trigger is awesome in that it doesn't have random encounters.  That was a wonderful change, and a definite plus.The main problem is with the emulation on the Playstation, which gave Chrono Trigger horrific load times, for some reason.  This was a terrible error which did detract from the game.  They are really bad, as bad as most new games.  Chrono Trigger took about 25 hours to beat, and would be a 5 star game when it came out, but the load times are bad enough to bring it down to 4 stars, combined with age.  While age hurt it less than FF IV, Chrono Trigger has still been weathered down.In conclusion, buy Final Fantasy Chronicles for Chrono Trigger, and don't even get FF IV out, unless you are a huge Final Fantasy fan.  In the case of video games, a compilation is worth as much as it's best part.  There are several newer, better RPG's you could play first, but the more Chrono Trigger ages, the worse it will seem, so pick it up as soon as possible, if you haven't played it already.  It is good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2002"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

They added nice little touches in the animations, you'll see characters playing with their weapons before and during the fights. Like the character with the Nunchukus, with moves that would make, Bruce Lee, proud if he were alive today. Other characters swing their swords or daggers like pros in their hands. You'll also notice that all the weapons have nice looking light streaks when they are swung. My Favorite Character has a sword that morphs into a chain on command. It's truly a pleasure to her whipping at rivals with the chain, then slashing with the sword. Great sound effect of swords clashing. To top it off the game has excellent controls, different game modes, finishing move replay and lots of characters with unique fighting styles.

Dynasty Warriors 4 is a cult classic with great graphics and a combination of button-mashing fighting and strategy.The graphics in Dynasty Warriors 4 are REALLY impressive. Maybe not in a Splinter Cell sort of way, but the facial movements in the cut scenes, the body movements during sword attacks, the fields of reeds and rolling plains are quite impressive for the PS2.The game is in essence the same as previous Dynasty Warrior games, but greatly enhanced. You are a General in China during a rebellion of the Han Dynasty. The Yellow Turbans sought to bring a time of peace by overthrowing the Han dynasty, and of course the Hans resisted!The well done encyclopedia fills you in on all the factual background of the locations, events, and personalities involved in this series of battles. You can customize your own character - male or female - down to the color of the outfit and style of armor worn. You can customize the bodyguards that protect you.  You can play around in duels or skill contests. But the real fun is when you head into the main campaign.Each level is huge and involves a variety of terrain and landscapes. There are numerous generals each with large number of forces under his or her control. Luckily you're not alone in this - you have fellow generals and tons of troops under your control. An overview map keeps track of where each main force is, and within that you are hacking and slashing your way to victory.It seems a bit overwhelming at first - is this a strategy overview, a first person slayer or a combo of both? Once you get into it, though, it's quite easy to understand and extremely addictive. You can't hurt your own forces. It's very reassuring to see your bodyguards hanging out nearby and taking out enemies. The map and status bar help you keep track of the tides of war. You gather up powers and health from fallen enemies and nearby barrels. The combo attacks and powerup attacks are great!Your weapons gain levels, your loyal troops get stronger, and you really feel like you've accomplished something of worth when you get through these historical sequences and stand with your troops, battle hardened, at the end of the road. This is way more than a hack-and-slash - it is a strategic lesson in real life history.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2003"}

Not only do they show emotion in story scenes, but they make battles look like a cool anime show, such as DBZ.As for the gameplay, it`s pure classic Zelda. Along with old weapons/tools like the hookshot, boomerang, and bow & arrows, there are new things like the grappling hook, deku leaf, and skull hammer (previously megaton hammer).

{"product_name":"B000HCL5QO","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"A Little World, a Lot of Fun","reviewText":"This has to be one of the most surprisingly fun games I've played in awhile.I'll be honest, I have no idea what's going on with the story nor have I ever even heard of the television show so I don't really know the whole point of the game but I do know one thing, it's a lot of fun.So the game begins with you at your farm which you were just given the deed to. There is this green lady crying over your farm and she later gives you a shovel to get to work on fixing the place up (if she had the shovel why didn't she do anything about it?).As you begin to change the atmosphere of your farm (by breaking down the tough dirt, planting grass, or digging pond space) animals begin to take notice and join into your ecosystem. As the animals join others who prey on those animals also come. You can also plant flowers, trees, or vegetables in order to attract other forms of animals.The animals interact by preying upon species which they find to be tasty. For example, the fox pinatas will eat the rabbit pinatas that they see in your garden so you have to be careful if you want to keep them around.As you progress you're given new abilities (like digging the ponds), you attract better pinatas, and are given more land. So the game starts off fairly simple and becomes more complicated as you go which is the correct way to handle the learning curve. It's a beautifully designed game in that sense, I must say.As for the level of maturity of the game, I'd say grade school children could probably easily play. Reproductive related activities are present in the game between pinatas but they just do a love dance and a flying faery lady comes by and drops off an egg. The food chain preying also isn't too bad and when the pinatas crack open candy comes out (just make sure the kids don't start thinking real animals have candy in them).The game also has an XBox Live component which was nice of the developers to work in but I have yet to experience it so I'm sure someone else here can give a better review regarding that.All in all a great game and just as much fun for us adults as for kids.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

Also, played it on PC. I should say they couldn't have done it better. Graphic feels real and bright. Ps3 version was kinda dark and Lara's face didn't have much detail into it. But PS4 version is amazing. They have added all DLCs as well for free. So, that is like a huge discount for people who didn't play and pay for DLCs on PS3. However, multiplayer is still suffering from lag, but since it's 60 frames per second, it looks smoother.One thing that I wish they add is CO-OP. Something like Uncharted 3 Arena or Gears Of War. They should accept the fact that not everyone likes to compete online to get to lvl 60 and complete their trophies. Anyways, if you are a Tomb Raider fan like me, go and buy the game. If you haven't played the game on PS3, just get up and go to the closest store and buy it. If you never ever played Tomb Raider, I highly recommend it to you if you are a 3rd person action/adventure fan. Right now there aren't many great games on PS4, we all know what Battlefield 4 and COD Ghosts did to us, so take a little break from first person shooter games and enjoy the beautiful/ stunning next gen TR graphic.

That is exactly what you'll say when playing Brutal Legend thanks to Tim Schafer's genius imagination, and Jack Black's great voice acting. Brutal Legend isn't exactly revolutionary, but it does have some ideas that are interesting.When it comes to the story this is one of Brutal Legend's strong points. You play as Eddie Riggs who is a roadie and gets sent to another world, and that world is full of metal. Eddie runs into many characters, but his main goal is to find out why he is there and defeat the evil lord Diviculus.The game starts out strong and shows you the ropes of combat and your Deuce. Yes the vehicle you drive around in the big open world. Combat consists of a strong attack and a normal attack followed by your axe. Your axe can shoot lightning upon foes or burn then. Along with this you can smash down on the ground to send foes flying. There are some upgrades you can get that will extend combos and lead into using your axe, but combat is pretty shallow. Nothing ever really evolves, and it can even be a bit sluggish at times and a tad unresponsive. Upgrading the pain and strings on your guitar can make certain attacks more powerful. Not only can you upgrade your axe, but the Deuce as well (more on that later).While you may think combat sounds shallow you can also use \"super powers\" which are little riff mini-games that can do certain things. The main ones you will use will be the one to summon your Deuce anywhere. Another is the face melter which is followed by a great camera cut of melting faces! There is even one to rally your troops, block your enemies from creating more troops and so on.Finding the relics for these powers is a huge pain since the world is so big and finding these rare relics can be tough, but wait a second I'll get back to the open world later.First let's finish combat. Yes you can upgrade your vehicle with weapons to help shoot down foes and even get a secondary weapon such as mines or flame throwers. The main focus of the game is RTS...wait...what? RTS? You're kidding me right? I thought this was a God of War type game...I'm very sorry, but this is true and while it works it is the game's biggest let down. I too thought this game was all action adventure until I got hit with a tutorial on how to do this. Well to make things simple all your basic RTS elements are here: Creating troops, upgrading your \"base\" to create stronger troops, and collecting \"resources\" to fund all this. With a unique take on RTS you have to build \"merch booths\" on green holes in the ground to create fans which in turn let you create troops. Upgrading your base, up to two times, lets you create greater troops like roadies, bouncers, and even fire barons. You have basic troops (head bangers) and chicks that shoot fire out of their guitars. There are a lot of units, and while you command them around the map via a light you can tell them to hold, attack, go to, or follow you. Eddie gets to fly around the map and when you need to aid your troops you can use any of your \"special attacks\". If you Eddie dies he respawns at his stage thanks to his fans.Now while all this sounds simple it really is TOO simple and could have been cut from the game. There are \"in between\" levels that have you fetching these troops, or going from A-B and I really liked those missions better. The RTS just took too long and felt out of place in an action adventure type game. I was also disappointed to see only two boss fights which were at the beginning and end, thus the developers using side missions as fillers in between story missions. These side missions are interesting at first, but become extremely repetitive since there isn't much of a variety.Side missions vary from helping the Ironheade (yes with an E so people know we're serious...) members ambush an enemy convoy all the way to racing. Some other missions consist of using your vehicle to fight off convoys and the rare unique side mission. There is even a hunting record breaker, but this allows you to send that creature into battle to help you fight. Of course you get something for completing these missions and that is fire tributes. Think of these as currency to buy stuff at the store.My favorite part about the whole game is actually the art style. Everything from the trees to the rocks to the animals is influenced by metal from the 70's ad 80's and Double Fine captured the feeling perfectly. The graphics are amazing and the voice acting is top notch, but you can't help but notice the attention to detail in everything. Not only is the art style unique, but the execution as well such as the dry ice mines, and the great wall which is made of amps that are so powerful they can kill you. Everything is pure metal and so is the great 40+ song soundtrack.Brutal Legend isn't for everyone, but metal heads or people who just appreciate great games or music will enjoy this very much.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Shut Your Mouth has stuff this one doesn't, and SD vs R 2006 is better in every way.","reviewText":"I've been a fan of wrestling for twenty years. Well, I ducked out during the stagnant WWF period of the mid 90s and stayed away for Stone Cold's push to the moon. Then I was with it again, until things became stagnant again with Triple H's invincibility and the lack of any real WWE competition. God bless you Chris Benoit and Rey Mysterio, you keep wrestling from being all boredom.Similarly, the games have been hit and miss. Once WWF Warzone hit in '98, wrestling games skyrocketed. Create modes made things immersive as possible, and almost every entry made things even better. Unfortunately, though this game is getting inexplicably high reviews, it's a genuine step backwards the likes of which were last seen in the first PS2 Smackdown, \"Just Bring It\".Here's the reason: Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth was incredible. A huge, long story mode with choices that went on forever as well as the most robust roster of superstars. Here Comes the Pain took a slight step back by trimming the roster and completely cutting the story mode in half, giving you about three plays through to see everything. It added some cool stuff like complete wrestler stats and records, as well as grapplers like Goldberg and Mysterio.This time, the wrestling game is as basic as it's been in years. Don't get it if you want a long, interesting storyline. There are about 4 or 5 different outcomes, and they all begin the same way. You'll start by trying to steal a foreign wrestler's diva or some other boring storyline. As others pointed out, you literally have to play through the story mode once, twice at most, to see all the different things.The new create a belt and pay per view modes are a wash, too. In an overcomplicated mess, you need to have two memory cards to create a belt and compete for it against a friend, since you can't fight the computer for it or some other insane obstacle. There goes half of what I bought the game for, which was the ability to defend my titles anytime in any match type (which you can't). In wanting the best wrestling simulation, I adored the ability to sort of engineer my own seasons and belt rivalries. Smackdown 2 for the PS1 let me do all of that, and never tried again since. This time, I thought create-a-belt would give me that chance, but it really doesn't. Even if you do make a belt, have fun playing a basic singles match against your friend because that's about as far as it'll go.The roster isn't very impressive either, but that's because, in my opinion, the WWE's current roster is missing a lot of former greats nowadays. It missed out on faces such as Eugene as well, who was around before the game was. It's not all bad, just another thing that sets it back. The addition of some truly fantastic wrestlers in the Legends roster is great, though. Can't go wrong with Bret Hart and Roddy Piper. Oddly however, some of these guys don't have their original entrance music while others do. Not huge, but noticable.The game itself is ok. It takes an evening or two to get through the storylines, and along the way you'll constantly be judging the new wrestler voice-overs rather than just accepting them. Vince Mcmahon is dialed way up and Eric Bischoff is half asleep, but some guys like 'Taker and triple H can at least work the microphone. You won't notice much anyway, since I played the story mode four times and literally fought the same group of 5 or 6 people each time.Don't be fooled by the new match types either. Some stuff is fun, like the strength-related ability to stay in the Royal Rumble when thrown over the ropes (though this takes all spontaneity away from it, since wrestlers DO sometimes go out right away in real life). But then they did away with pretty much any backstage areas whatsoever to instead give us two that revolve around gimmicks. Fight in a one-room car park where each of the 5 or 6 cars does something different (like flashing lights) when you wrestle on it. The other area is a backstage hallway where you can throw the wrestler into food or fences. Believe me, it's not as fun as it sounds and gets old after about two times. There's no way here whatsoever to recreate some of the wild backstage stuff like the Kane/Raven/Big Show WM17 match. Like everything in this game, it's as basic as it can be.The gameplay itself is okay. There are new pre-match button tricks that you can compete in, but won't since they're a chore more than anything. And online mode, though I didn't try, is supposed to be decent but nothing special as well. The matches that are there, and the game mechanics that have been ported from previous installments in the series, are as good as they ever were but unfortunately surrounded by a shell of letdowns. Unlockables are even a joke. Want new clothes, lots of new arenas, and stuff like that? NO? Good, because aside from a couple basic arenas and a John Cena outfit, pretty much all we have is a big handful of loading screen photos.Bottom line? If you want an engrossing, lengthy story mode that gives you all kinds of crazy options and rivalries and contests, just drop five bucks on \"Shut Your Mouth\". If you want a more up to date roster, go with last year's \"Here Comes the Pain\" which is a more basic story mode but right on par with this one (and without the dumb voices). However, if you crave an online experience, or the most up-to-date roster, or a game with a pretty linear story structure and 70% poor voice acting, then this is the one for you. It's not a terrible game, but nowhere near as good as these ratings tell you. At least rent it first, because surely one of you will be as disappointed as I was.EDIT: The sequel, Smackdown V Raw 2006 came out and made this game completely disposeable. It has a vastly improved season mode, new match tricks, and entirely new gameplay modes. There's no reason to play this game if you can get SDVR2K6.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2005"}

If you're looking for a game to show the system off and justify your six-hundred dollar Blu-Ray player, you could certainly do a lot worse.  The game is a true beauty among the current crop of PS3 titles.  Unfortunately its good looks is about all it has going for it.There's no off-line multiplayer, no car customization, no unlockable content at all, no career mode, no difficulty adjustments (easy, hard, etc, etc), horrific loading times, and only EIGHT TRACKS!  So many of these features have become such a standard to racing games, I just can't see any reason why extra content of some sort couldn't have been included.Overall, the game's a blast, but it seems so geared toward a single-player experience and with nothing extra to play for the replay value is pretty low.  Until the price comes down, I couldn't recommend it.  Like the cliche, beauty is only skin-deep and, in keeping with the saying,  there's virtually nothing here underneath the (albeit dazzling) surface.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2007"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"Better than expected, better than Ghosts","reviewText":"After having dropped $60+ on Call of Duty: Ghosts, and quickly gotten to the point of selling it after a couple wasted weeks, I went back to Call of Duty Black Ops 2 (BO2) and am now writing a review about it, finally.I was NOT a fan of Black Ops 1, I thought it was too hard in bad ways in both the campaign and multiplayer modes. I loved MW2, liked MW3, and figured I would skip BO2 for the next MW game, until I finally, skeptically, tried BO2 at my friend's place and was amazed that I really liked it. I bought it myself then.Campaign:I really was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the campaign mode - I was expecting it to be terrible (boring, WAY too fast, hard in the whole you-get-shot-once-and-have-to-hide-most-of-the-time way like a lot of the games seem to be getting like, and cliche), but it was not any of that - it was quite fun! You cared about the plot, the game play was fun enough and I liked that in some parts you had an option with which action to take depending on a few different things, and the action you took determined the ending of the game. It was enjoyable to play.Multiplayer (online):The multiplayer was quite difficult at first, but I found that while I died a LOT early on, with practice and upgrades I still died a LOT, but had more fun doing so.  The levels are fun enough (Standoff!) with a few that aren't so much (Aftermath, Yemen, Overflow), some are sprawled out, some are smaller, they vary in size and shape and offer different ways of playing for each type of player.  They are such that you can usually see the opponent(s) somewhat clearly.  They are fun if you run-and-gun, if you camp, and evidently if you quickscope or stab people too - you can play differently with each map depending on what you are in the mood to do (and the kind of people on your team or against you).Rather than trying to avoid a rant as I originally wanted to do, I will instead happily go on one now about people who are TOO good at this game (fill in the blanks for what that means).  It gets frustrating at times, but I will say quite frankly after going from Ghosts, which is a nightmare for a casual gamer, back to BO2 with \"too good\" of players and all, it is still comparatively like Disney Land in terms of fun. I tend to just back out of a match if I see people who have no rank next to them, since they seem to be the people who have absurd scores.I have read many blog and forum conversations, and many people out there just condescendingly-dismiss people who say there is cheating happening, and tell them (in overly-insulting ways, of course) they are just \"bad at the game\" and \"there IS NO cheating of any kind that exists.\"  Of course there is.  It is obvious.  Sad, morally-flexible people who cheat but always justify and excuse it and then blame or are condescending towards others (thus come off as a bit sociopathic) make the experience less fun for those who are good enough to play fairly.  Don't let people try to get you to deny your reality and tell you otherwise.  Sure there is unintentional glitching and lag that happens naturally (you shoot a person 5 times then they kill you, in the kill cam you shot only once), but you also see it obviously happening intentionally (frozen people, flying through walls, boosting, etc).  But it is also just how it goes, how things are, the nature of online gaming - most games out there, I'm sure.  You have to take the bad with the good, or give it up.  You see the best and worst in people when they have the opportunity to anonymously interact with others from the safety of behind made-up screen names.So don't be afraid of playing online, and don't be afraid of reporting people for cheating.  The best thing to do is just report people who are TOO good and CLEARLY doing something fishy.  \"Lag-Switchers,\" for example, ARE out there (as I am writing this I just saw a person go 26 - 0 doing this).  You can follow someone on your team who has a ridiculous score and watch them do it on your screen - you can see the person they are shooting get frozen.  Report these people.After reporting the person who you believe to be cheating, quit the match, otherwise you will either be slaughtered if they are on the other team or you will get few kills if they are on your team.  OR, you could do what I do and mess with the person and follow them around and shoot at them and distract them as much as possible to annoy them, which lets them know that you know what they are doing and do not appreciate or respect it.I don't think it is as completely and utterly rampant as a lot of us, even myself many times, think, considering the punishments/penalties you can get for getting caught - I think a lot of it is just as simple as one person's connection speed may be a little faster, that kind of innocent thing.  It seems pretty clear to me when someone is doing something fishy more than the normal stuff.  Not completely rampantly-common, but I would not say rare either.**End online rant**Bots Mode (either online or offline multiplayer with or without friend):The custom games mode with bots is VERY cool to do in this game and excellent to do if you get tired of online play against the \"TOO good people\" - you can do it online and offline split screen with a buddy next to you!  Every level/map including DLC, perk, weapon set and score streak is unlocked immediately so you can figure out which combos work best for you - the game saves your layouts too.  You can even unlock up to 17 different things within each layout if you want (only for bots mode).  It is very customizable and a lot of fun!My friend and I finally became sick of trying to play against people online, so we have been able to extend the use and enjoyment of this game entirely through Bot play.  We first challenged ourselves by passing every level against all 9 possible enemy bots on first the easiest, then next easy, then next, then finally Veteran level with 50 kills.  Then we've tried to pass every level on the easiest setting going 50 - 0.  Next, we'll do it all with 75 kills, and so on.  We've also tried going 50 kills just by stabbing.  Because there are so many different ways of customizing it has made the re-playability of the game even for those who do not want to deal with online players awesome and enjoyable.Random Thoughts:--I finally have all four of the DLC packs: Revolution, Vengeance, Apocalypse and Uprising.  Not a HUGE fan of the Revolution maps (Downhill is ok, the other 3 are not very fun to me) or Uprising (except Studio which is fun), but I like the ones with Vengeance ok and have enjoyed Apocalypse quite much.  I'll try to be more specific soon.--I'm not a fan of Zombies mode, though I know others are.  It's like a challenge mode with waves of enemies.--I will mention, since they are the two most recent Call of Duty games, the big difference between Ghosts and BO2 I can see with online play is: with Ghosts, the problems of online play lie primarily with A) how EASY it is to die (you get shot at all you die, which may be more \"realistic\" but is NOT FUN which should be the overall point); B) the terrible spawn points; C) the layout, colors and sizes of the levels; and D) how the screen seems so zoomed out.  With BO2, the problems lie with the people playing the game.In Ghosts you can't see anything, so everyone is running around frantically or camping because they have to in order to play the level layout. In BO2, people do that if they want to, or they can have some logical tactics too, depending on the preferred weapon. Sometimes you see that (people playing like normal human beings) and the games are a lot of fun, and sometimes you get the hyperactive stabbers and quickscopers trying to get trophies or whatever, and the games are then not fun. But it varies, and CAN be fun, unlike Ghosts.--The graphics are nice! The levels are simple, not too big, the bad guys are clear and everything is fairly easy to see, so if you try Ghosts and then this game you will understand how much of a good thing that is.--It is fun when you get with a group of people who don't all run straight at the opponents, die promptly, then think something will change so they repeat over and over until the match is over with a score like 32 - 75.  In other words, in TEAM deathmatch it is fun when you get with a group who play as a TEAM.--Too many young kids (and I mean children, not teens) are allowed to play this mature-rated game, as is evident if you do not immediately mute everyone, which is what you always want to do since you don't want to hear high-pitched rambling.  It's obviously something that has been widespread and blatant from day 1 of the advent of online play for video games, but it still just seems so sad (and irritating!) to hear children who should be playing outside with friends or simply not playing an adult game instead cussing at people using words they barely understand the meaning of.  Parents?  Actual parenting?  Sigh.Bottom-line:I give the game 4-stars (instead of 5) because of the silly cheating/exploiting-type crap you do have to deal with online sometimes/often, but overall I really like this game.  This is a game with a very high re-playability factor.I will say I am surprised this game is still up around $50 new - I would suggest buying it used for no more than $40, since it is not a new game now, but regardless of how much you choose to spend it is fun. Worth the cost, and was very surprisingly enjoyable to me. A very good parachute for when you inevitably jump from the disappointing wreckage of the COD: Ghosts airplane.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Naw, but it is damn good","reviewText":"After reading reviews that Dead Space was the second coming of the original Resident Evil, I decided I'd give it a try.  Review sites were claiming it to be \"the scariest game evar!\"  Hell, when I picked the game up from a local store I was boldly told, \"within two minutes of gaining control of your character, you will jump out of your skin!\"  Eagerly, I rushed home, ready for my next jolt of adrenaline.  So, it was with a pair of rubber underwear (I kid...or do I?) and some excitement that I set out to see what dark terrors Dead Space would contain.Turns out there's not much here we haven't seen before.  No, I didn't jump two minutes into the game...and in fact the first chapter felt pretty tame.  Monsters pop out of vents or can be seen in the distance, usually followed by a loud \"DUN!\" from the soundtrack.  Maybe I've grown so hardened from my years of playing horror games that the thrills in Dead Space don't amount to much.  I'm also wondering who these reviewers are.  If Dead Space is so terrifying to them, I'd hate to see what'd happen if they got their hands on F.E.A.R. or Condemned, for example, two games that have made me jump out of my skin.  But that's the nature of fear.  Sometimes games that scare the pants off one person, elicit a shrug from someone else.Things improve as the story continues, though, with some disturbing images (usually involving a crazed survivor) and some stick with me, even now.  The game does improve on its terror level, the further in you get and there are some shocking moments, both in terms of graphic depictions but also in a \"holy crap, I'm being dragged by a tentacle\" way.  But, as a personal opinion, I've never really been fond of the silent protagonist.  And here we have not only Isaac, the mute, but Isaac the faceless since he's always holed up behind some mask.  Sure there is a personal story here for him, what with his girlfriend stuck on the ship somewhere, but it never really clicked for me simply because Isaac felt like a doll and not a real person.This isn't to say Dead Space is a bad game, just the opposite!  I had an absolute blast playing it because what it does, it does exceedingly well.  The weapons are never your cliched space marine-type fare, which brings a fresh feel to the game.  They can be \"leveled up\" via work benches, and you can really design both your suit and your weapons to fit your play style.  Dead Space also controls amazingly well and you'll never feel like the game is hampering you by horrible movement.  The graphics are pretty damn awesome, especially in terms of the grotesque monster designs (which remind me of The Thing) and the animations.  The concept of \"strategic dismembering\" is also a fun little twist of the genre, as you'll find yourself blowing the hell out of their limbs, just to keep them from coming at you.I also appreciate how each level feels completely different from the last and EA has truly made the Ishimura come alive.  When I first heard that the game took place on a ship, I was worried.  Usually that means the same old corridors and bad level design, but here it means a fully realized space ship.  Breaking up the action are sections taking place in zero-G areas, which are great, and some puzzles that require you to utlize the environment.  However, everything, even the environmental obstacles feel justified and fun.All in all, and even though I don't share the opinion that it's the scariest game ever, Dead Space is the best action horror game I've played in a long time.  Regardless of whether you think it's the scariest game you've played or not, EA got it right in terms of playability and fun.  The plot is very intriguing and pulls you along, but it's everything else that really adds up to making it what it is.  In the end, Dead Space feels more like Aliens than Alien, and that ain't shabby.Definitely recommend a purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2008"}

What I mean by slow is that you're literally moving at a snail's pace. Almost all the RE games allow you to run, turn 180-degrees quickly, and do something that would've made a lot of sense when in battle: duck for cover. For anyone who hasn't played RE0, RE and RE3, this game does a nice review and gives you a taste of the RE mythos and some behind the scenes stuff (like Rebecca Chambers' and Wesker's side missions). But aside from that, upgrading your weapons becomes pointless until you pass everything with an \"S\" rating (which is almost impossible without maxed out weapons)so you can have infinite ammo for your other weapons. You're stuck with mainly the default handgun that has infinite ammo and the bosses all have a \"pattern\" that when you figure it out, it's almost too easy. The Resident Evil franchise made a drastic change when it released RE4, but as a rail-shooter, quite the disappointment. The stories are even modified a bit. You'll see in the \"Mansion Incident\" in this game (where's Barry?!? How did Chris?!??!?). Inconsistent storylines and what a SLOW pace for a railshooter. You'll be halfway through the game and finding yourself saying: \"Will you get a move on it!? Hurry up!\" If rail-shooters are your thing, I'd go with the House of the Dead games for the Wii.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2009"}

In fact to be honest, I have played only a handful of FPS games (Bioshock, Doom 3, Bad Company,) and several demos for other FPS games.That being said........BUY THIS GAME!I will spare you a huge description of plot, Lord knows there are plenty other reviews out there which go in to it.  But I will say it is the plot that truly draws you in and goes for the jugular at first with a bit of mystery then erupts in to a full-out action story.  With casual gaming I beat this game about 4 days.  Not to say the game is small, but when I did sit down I was going through two or three or more missions at a sitting.  And now I have upped the difficulty and going at it again.The weapons are mostly typical from many FPS games out there with one or two really fun weapons to use......the Auger comes to mind.  There are also additional weapons for you to use once you beat the game for your other run throughs.THe multiplay, at least offline, seems rather cookie cutter of other offline multiplays with other FPS games.  This is not to say it's not fun.  It is, and a nice touch is the customizable map size.  Although for me, I like the large maps to make it less a brawl and more a game of cat and mouse.In short, if you like FPS games, I have a feeling this game is for you.  If you don't like FPS games, at least rent it.  But at this price.........buy it.  I have gotten a lot less out of 20 bucks........a lot less out of 50 now that I think of it.  This game has redefined what I have come to expect from FPS games and may very well open the door to me buying others.......specifically Resistance 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2008"}

You are a Mercenary, working for the ISA, but it gets complicated. Your primary goal, more than anything else, is to make money, and that is what you wind up doing, at the start anyway. Everything you do gives you money, which can be spent on unlocking more weapons and armor, and here's where the freedom kicks in. You could theoretically take on any of the game's challenges with any of the weapons, and the loadout items unlocked in single-player are valid in multiplayer. What's more, you are never punished for carrying specific weapons, because ammo found works for all guns, a brilliant design choice. Stealth? Guns-blazing? A mix? Go for it. However, this leeway extends so far, and some mandatory segments, like the final boss, force your hand a little.The campaign is cool, but short. Each mission has three additional variations to play, and have a few collectibles to incentivize replays, as well as angling for the cash to buy all the unlockable gear. I didn't get to play the multiplayer, since I didn't have memory card space for the patch when playing the Gamefly copy, but I've heard good things. It's novel that an FPS decided to tie it's two disparate aspects together, and actually tries to use the single player as a way of leveling the power disparity that shows up so often in the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Chilling, atmospheric and utterly terrifying!","reviewText":"Though the game has been around for years I've never taken interest in Resident Evil until recently. I got the game for dirt cheap and was surprised how good it is. I saw my cousin play the old Playstation version years ago and was unimpressed but for the Gamecube the graphics have been re-rendered to absolute lifelike perfection. The shadows, the sound, the ambience and those thunderclaps...all highly, highly realistic. Play this with your Gamecube hooked up to your home theatre. And like me, you'll totally jump out of your skin at the scary parts (many of them).My main hint is conserve your ammo. If you see a zombie, put it down right away (no funny stuff) and burn it. Take care of them one at a time. And if you don't burn them they will soon come back as Crimson Heads-faster, deadlier, scarier.Much like the Myst series, Resident Evil is one of those games where you have to keep your eyes and ears open. Clues and puzzle pieces are scattered all over the place and you need to pay attention.Don't be put off by the size of the mansion. After a short while it's easy to get your bearing and find your way through rather easily. Though I will be honest with the fact I did not understand most of the story. I have no idea what Trevor's diary from 1968 had to do with the plot and I really didn't get why Umbrella would create the T-Virus. I know there are various ways to finish and complete the game though. Especially seeing as how there are many clips during the end credits that did not happen in my gameplay (I did it in just over 8 hours). If you finish it in certain timeframes the next one is always different somehow. I only managed to unlock a new outfit for Chris. Wow!My only gripe is about those boring `door opening' cut scenes. They really got on my nerves. Still, it's a chilling game that will freak you out if you play alone in the dark. Well worth the time and money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2004"}

I have a feeling it's going to be about like Bioshock 2 multiplayer--or GTA IV multiplayer.  A nice diversion and a worthy effort, but certainly not a staple like Halo, COD, Gears, or Left 4 Dead.  Let's leave it at that.What I'm here to applaud is the single player.  And this is a guy who never enjoyed any GTA games and have a tough time finding sandbox games that are fun (Crackdown, Fallout 3, Just Cause 2 being notable exceptions).Having said all of that, I'm very impressed with this game.  To me it's more manageable and fun than GTA IV.  The acting is more authentic.  Particularly from the lead character. It's no so loud and over the top sometimes.  He's a western gentlemen.  They took one step closer to \"movie dialog\" with this and integrated it into the game play. There's a subtlety there to some of the characters (Bonnie's over the top) that's a pleasant surprise.There are animals everywhere.  And you can kill them.  Or not.The landscape is varied and beautiful--it's as technically impressive (or more) than Fallout 3, but not depressing.  The horses are rendered incredibly. The world is alive with people and animals just going about their business.And I don't know if it's because I like this game or not--but the difficulty level here just \"feels\" more manageable.  I found GTA IV to be frustrating but this hits a sweet spot.  Also, this game is way less gratuitous from a violence, language, and sexual content standpoint than GTA.I'm giving it a 4 for fun but a five overall for the achievement. Well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2010"}

Please...","reviewText":"On a first playthrough, the main mission will take you about 1  to 3 hours to complete. My playtime was about 3 hours. However, aside from the Ground Zeroes operation, there are also 5 other side-ops, each which should take you around 40-60 minutes or so to complete going by my experience. That ladies and gentlemen is around 8 hours for 30 dollars. God of War 3 on release gave me about as many hours of gameplay on my first run-through for 60 bucks.And aside from the side-ops, there are many things to collect, such as cassette tapes which contain a good portion of GZ&#8217;s narrative and explain the history leading up to the GZ mission. There&#8217;s also a detailed summary of all the events of the previous game, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. MGS Ground Zeroes also features  XOF patches to collect and weapons to unlock etc. The weapon unlock system works via your mission ranks. If you end the mission with an E rank (terrible) you get nothing, but if you end it with an A rank, you will unlock the weapon most pivotal to that mission. Other weapons unlock between ranks C-B as well. You can also strive to achieve S ranks, which are fairly difficult. Just try passing the 3rd mission on Hard mode with no kills.The gameplay in Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes is incredible. It is easily the best mechanic&#8217;s wise out of the entire MGS series. GZ improves the crawling mechanics tremendously. Wall hugging is now automatic as opposed to being linked to a toggle button. If you walk towards a wall, Snake will lean against it which works fine most of the time, but isn&#8217;t always precise. Nearly everything is silky smooth, especially the running to crouching to crawling transitions. There hardly seems to be a break in the animation when transitioning from one position to another. I do however seem to detect very slight drops in framerate every once in a while, but they&#8217;re hardly intrusive and not really worth being bothered by.So far, I have put over 20 hours into the game running through the missions, trying to better my ending-ranks and collecting patches and tapes. At 20 hours, I still haven&#8217;t gotten the top ranks or acquired all weapons so whoever said you can do &#8216;everything&#8217; in 5 hours flat-out lied. I am no where near done with MGSV GZ, because going through the missions is just one part of the franchise. Another part is exploring all there is to be had, and just simply having a blast by messing with the guards and doing random things. I can easily see myself spending several dozen hours on MGSV Ground Zeroes.Rule #1 of not being a dumb gamer: Research before you buy.Seriously, anyone who actually expected this to be a full game, or for the story to be 6-7 hours even at most, played himself like a damn fiddle!. There was no malicious intent by Konami here, no deceptive advertising. We have known for over a year that MGSV Ground Zeroes was to simply be the prologue to MGSV The Phantom Pain. We have known for quite a while that there was to be a single story mission set in a large base with only the objectives of extracting two individuals + several side-missions.Would I recommend Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes?The people who would appreciate GZ the most are definitely the die-hard fans of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. I would recommend this mostly to them.If you&#8217;re not a die-hard fan who can&#8217;t wait to get a taste of MGSV The Phantom Pain and the new Fox Engine, then don&#8217;t bother with GZ because you&#8217;ll just end up whining.As a huge fan of MGS and especially Big Boss, I love Ground Zeroes and it was worth every cent of those 30 bucks + taxes I paid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2014"}

We can barely fit our review of Team Fortress 2 into this review space but you can see the other full reviews of the other components on our bellaonline website.-----One of the three games in Valve's \"Orange Box\" package, Team Fortress 2 is a long-awaited sequel (announced in 1998) to the original \"Team Fortress Classic\" mod for Half-Life 1. Despite the abhorrently long delay, this game is worth every second of development.Team Fortress was one of the first big games to use classes, each with their own weapons and specialty. Following either a Capture The Flag or a Control Point objective type, players combined the unique abilities of each class to capture their objectives. TF2 has kept this basic premise, and added a wicked, madcap sense of humor and colorful stylistic choices to it.There are 9 classes in the game each given their own weapons (including a unique melee weapon), abilities, and personalities. First is the scout, who is the fast character who is meant to rush in, get the flag, and get out. In TF2, the Scout has a smart mouth and constantly wisecracks as he downs foes with one of his three weapons - a shotgun, a pistol, and an aluminum bat. The Soldier is next - a grunt armed with a rocket launcher, a shotgun, a shovel, and a military drawl. The soldier can \"rocket jump\" by firing at his feet, which injures him but launches him far upwards. The Pyro is armed, as one might guess, with a flamethrower (as well as a shotgun and a fire axe) and is the game's least comprehensible character - muffled as he is by his flame-retardant suit and mask. The Pyro is meant to ambush characters, due to the flamethrower's short range, but if he can get in close and start spraying fire and setting enemies ablaze, the kills just rack up.The Demoman is a bit of a quandary - a self-described \"black Scottish cyclops\", he is equipped with two grenade launchers (one that launches regular grenades, one that launches remote-detonated \"sticky\" grenades that can be used as deterrents for enemies proceeding carelessly through doors) and an empty bottle as a melee weapon. The Heavy is perhaps the game's most recognizable character - a huge, Russian man armed with a minigun. Gameplay for the Heavy consists of firing or winding up the character's huge weapon, or on occasion using his backup shotgun or his mighty fists. The Engineer is one of the more intellect-oriented classes in the game; not adept at physical combat, the Engineer prefers to build gadgets to help his team. The devices that can be built are a sentry gun (an automatically firing turret that can be upgraded to three different levels of weaponry), a dispenser (which gives health and ammo), and a teleporter. All of the engineer's devices require metal to build or upgrade, which is gained by collecting ammo from fallen enemies. The Engineer's personality is laid-back, with a southern drawl more relaxed than the Soldier's.The Medic is the main support unit for any team - with the use of his healing Medigun, the Medic is responsible for keeping his team alive. Furthermore, after healing enough, the Medic can use his Ubercharge ability to render himself and a target invulnerable for roughly ten seconds. The Medic has a German accent, perhaps a nod to the stereotypical Mad Doctor. Snipers are Australian Bush Rangers armed with high-powered rifles. These rifles charge up their power, but only when zoomed in; this encourages snipers to wait and time their shots, rather than using the sniper rifle as a really accurate close-combat weapon (as seen in Counter-Strike). Requiring reflexes and accuracy, the Sniper is a highly specialized class, and every map has windows looking out over a large battleground for the Sniper to fully use his abilities. Finally, the Spy is perhaps the most complex class. Capable of taking the appearance of an enemy unit (to allies, he appears to be wearing a paper mask with the target class' face drawn on it), the Spy must try his best to infiltrate the enemy and take them out - through backstabbing, sappers (which disable engineer tools), and good old-fashioned misdirection. As a backup, Spies can cloak themselves, useful for infiltrating and exiting the enemy base. While Spies cannot be easily detected, certain suspicious behaviors can be noted and so a Spy must try his best to blend in - for example, not charging the enemy base from his own base, where no regular soldier would be doing so.These nine classes form the wildest, most madcap First Person Shooter in recent history. Set on six different stages (the development team states in the in-game commentary that more were considered, but playtesters noted that players usually only play maps that they really like over and over, for example De_Dust in Counter-Strike) with a Mad Scientist theme, players join either the BLU (Builder's League United) or RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) teams. Both sides are fronts for secret corporations, and the maps revolve around capturing secret data (the equivalent of CTF) or important secret bases housing nuclear weapons or laser beams (the Control Point game type).The graphics are the most noticable and unique new feature to the game. Using a cartoonish style and shading/lighting type, the characters and maps are designed to let the characters stand out and be identifiable by their color, class, and weapon (in that order). The result is fantastic - TF2's style is possibly the best use of a cartoonish style in a video game that I have seen. Each character is vibrantly alive and unique, a fact further fleshed out by their in-game taunts and sounds (many taunts activate automatically when certain conditions are met - for example, if a Scout kills a Heavy with his bat, there's a sound clip for that). A far cry from the mostly silent and serious setting of Team Fortress Classic, TF2 embraces the ridiculousness and outlandishness present in its gameplay, making light of combatants rushing headlong into their death (when killed, you get a screenshot of your killer, complete with arrows marking your body and, if you were killed by something explosive, any little parts that are nearby).As a whole, this game is a blast. Its frantic gameplay, hilarious voice acting, and strategic simplicity make this a game for almost anyone to enjoy. There's nothing to dislike about this game - even the small map selection doesn't seem to matter because of how involved one becomes with the strategy used in each. This game is brilliant.10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Surprisingly Good","reviewText":"I bought this game when it first came out and thought it might be ok but it was better than ok. It combined many things to make a solid game. It doesn't have really flashy combos such as God of War but it has a good enough battle system that allows you to learn new combos and moves by buying them witht he souls that you collect. You are able to buy items, weapons, and upgrades with souls. Now the story isn't all that impressive about one of the four horseman getting framed and basically trying figure out who is the culprit. It leaves itself open at the end but the end is satisfying and actually sets itself good for the sequel.As for further details, it looks good and the art style is nice but it doesn't look like the quality of some such as Uncharted 2 and Assassin's Creed 2. The game does a good job of keeping things fresh with the implementation of smart puzzles that are integrated in the levels that resemble the quality and style of what you see in Zelda titles. It has a portal weapon but its restricted in its uses. The boss fights are great and take strategy in knowing how to attack them. The game's voiceovers are pretty great especially the protagonist who sounds badass.Its not easy to recommend at 59.99 but the current price Amazon has it makes me recommend the purchase. It is a good game and can take between 16-20 hours to beat depending if your trying to gather all the artifects and such in the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}

Martin","summary":"Definitely a Classic! Superb game!","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was a one-of-a-kind experience for me. I personally didn't really think much of the Grand Theft Auto games prior to playing this. A lot of my friends always talked about how much fun these games were back when I was at school. I always dismissed their recommendations for this game because from what I heard about it, the game just sounded stupid, to put it bluntly. Boy was I wrong..Not only is the game not stupid, this game includes some of the most hilarious political satire I've ever heard in any video game - ever. There were actually times when I was just sitting there laughing while listening to the different radio stations you can listen to in this game. The radio, and the hilarious commentary on it is one of the game's best features, and it all contributes towards an overall feeling of living in the 1980s.There are a couple aspects of the game that different people seem to enjoy. First and foremost, the game has its own story line that I thought was quite well done, and missions for you to do in the game for other criminal figures all over Vice City. I personally thought most of the missions were quite enjoyable, though there was a few that I didn't really like. In particular, I thought that the game did a poor job in terms of making the helicopters or airplanes easy to fly. I personally found the helicopters/airplanes in the game to be more frustrating than fun. Hopefully future Grand Theft Auto games will fix this aspect to make it easier and less frustrating.The other aspect of the game that people enjoy as I understand it is that this game is what you might call a \"sandbox\" style game. There is just an immense amount of freedom in this game to drive wherever you want in Vice City, or do just about anything such as buying a business, running over pedestrians, or whacking random people with golf clubs. I won't go into all the different \"vices\" you can find in Vice City, but just let me say they're there, and it really adds to the overall sense of being able to do anything that the game has to offer. Sure, it might sound immature, but it's just a game really, and everyone knows that.All in all, this is a very well-done game that is very deserving of my recommendation. The only problem that I would warn people about is that the graphics are pretty outdated on this game. If you can look past that however, you should have quite a lot of fun. I was personally not a big fan of the Grand Theft Auto games prior to playing this, but now I very much look forward to buying and playing Grand Theft Auto 4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}

It was worth the purchase. I love Resident Evil, and have only played re 4,5,6. Dead Space is spookier and scarier than Resident Evil. To say that I was terrified would be an understatement. I was scared of Isaac's footsteps! I was in paranoia ville! This game is not for the faint of heart! I don't recall a game terrifying me to this degree.You play as Isaac Clark (third person shooter), an engineer who's sent to repair the Ishimura ship, and that's when disaster strikes! The ship is infested and crawling with Necromorphs! The Necromorphs are grotesque, mutated creatures and they can come charging at you anytime. They can break into a sprint and jump! They can even play dead! When I walked past a seemingly dead Necromorph, I let out a blood-curdling shriek when I realized it was playing possum! They can materialize from the vents, doors, and hallways. So you're ALWAYS on EDGE. The tension is UNWAVERING! Even though the ammo was sparse, I used it on every Necromorph I saw lying on the floor! I was that paranoid!The combat is different than other survival horror games. With Dead Space, you must strategically sever the limbs. The game repeats this strategy quite a few times during the first chapter, so you never forget. Once severed, they ooze. You can also stomp on them, and that makes them gush. It's quite the bloodbath! The producers were very detail-oriented. The only time I began to relax a little bit was when I was next to a save point.The graphics are stunning, the voice acting is fantastic, the score is creepy, and the controls are fluid. Overall, the gameplay is fantastic. You get access to a store (chapter 2 and onward) where you can store /sell your items, buy weapons. There are work benches if you want to upgrade your suit and weaponry. I loved the weapons in this game. The weapon I depended on the most was the plasma cutter. It can rotate vertically or horizontally, which adds to the flexibility of the game's combat system.Since the ship has many dark hallways, you can get overwhelmed and feel disoriented. So the great thing about this game is that you cannot get lost. By pressing the R3 button, the game shows you where you must go by illuminating a blue light.There are two things that I didn't like about this game. Firstly,(it's not really a flaw) is that Issac doesn't speak. I wish he spoke or had some kind of dialogue with the crew members so I could get invested in the character a little bit more. With that being said, it didn't subtract from the enjoyability of the game. (The producers amended this in Dead Space 2.)Secondly, in Chapter 4, there's an asteroid shooting objective which frustrated me to no end! It killed the fun factor! I plain hated it! I spent hours trying to pass it and I died over 40 times! I would rather face an army of Necromorphs than shoot the asteroids! The right analog stick was very hard in aiming at the asteroids. Plus, I'm left-handed and my right hand is very weak. So this also factored into dying countless times. Many people have encountered difficulty in passing this stage. I don't understand why the producers included this in the game. It is horrible! I knocked off a star due to this part. It really discouraged me from re-playing the game again due to that horrible asteroid-shooting mini-game.Overall, I recommend this game! It's one of the best games I've played on the PS3. If you're a fan of survival horror, or just want to play a great game and scare yourself silly, then this game is for you. I hope you find this review helpful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2013"}

This is nice because, based on my own experience, 160GB should be sufficient for a few years of use for as long as you don't plan to purchase lots of movies from the PSN store or download to many full games - if you are thiking about storing movies on your PS3 disk, consider upgrading to larger storage. However, unless you believe that Uncharted + Pain are worth the extra $100, you may be slightly better off buying the 80GB model for $100 less and then upgrading.To give you an idea of the amount of storage you may need on your PS3, I recently checked the status of my 320GB disk and I found that I had 198GB free. That means that, one year after purchasing my (then) 60GB box I was using 122GB already. The space is taken by family pictures, a little music, lots of demos, many 'disk' games that dump gigabytes of data to the disk to improve performance, many videos the kids are making with the 'Eye' camera, game saves. I suspect that 'Home', when it becomes available, may require a few more GB's for its own use so 320GB may be what you need if you don't want to constantly worry about deleting old stuff before you run out of space.If you are on the upgrade path, $80 would buy you a 320GB drive. I used theWestern Digital WD3200BEVT 320 GB Scorpio Sata 5400 Rpm 8MB 2.5 inchmyself but that was back in June/July and I paid about $150 then; you could get much larger drives for less now. 500GB drives are available for less than $100 and you should try to get one of those if you are planning to store lots of videos. One that I tested would be the Western Digital 500GB Scorpio Blue SATAII 5400RPM 2.5IN 8MB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive WD5000BEVT which replaced my laptop's 60GB little drive and I helped a friend upgrade his own PS3 with. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 80GB or $160GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and theStarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosureworked for me. I am using the free leftover drive as a backup device for family photos.Upgrading the disk is (relatively) easy and you can find a lot of advice on the Net. Search for \"PlayStation 3 Hard Drive Upgrade (HOWTO)\" for videos that should help you decide if you are comfortable with upgrading. If upgrading is the first thing you do (before installing games or uploading personal files), everything becomes very easy because you need not worry about backups or restores. I upgraded my box in a couple of hours WITH the backup/restore steps.MEMORY CARD INTERFACES:-----------------------The lack of memory card interfaces is annoying but you can get around it. Copy your stuff to a USB drive or flash drive and... problem solved. You can then upload your things through the USB. It's somewhat inconvenient but it's no big deal.USB PORTS:----------My old 60GB model has 4 USB ports and I am using all of them. One for the PS3 Eye (camera), a second has a wireless keyboard dongle, the third is where the racing wheel plugs in and the last one I use to charge controllers. Of course, you can and you WILL be able to live with 2 slots but it is likely that you will be doing some plugging/unplugging if you begin adding peripherals. One way around it is to get a USB port multiplexer. Another solution is seek Bluetooth peripherals (wireless) if you can find them. Bluetooth keyboards, for example, are available.PS2 COMPATIBILITY:------------------This model does not support PS2 software. Since the original PS2-compatible PS3's are hard to get, this has to be accepted as reality. I assume that Sony, after polling existing and future PS3 users, found that most users don't need PS2 compatibility. Soon after we upgraded to a PS3 my kids were playing Kingdom Hearts and Destroy All Humans but I haven't seen them doing so in quite a while. It is nice to have PS2 compatibility but its lacking would not stop me from buying a PS3.PSOne GAMES:------------The PS3 has full PSOne compatilibity. Lots of them are available for download at the PSN store. They are quite inexpensive and some of them are still fun to play.SUMMARY:--------- If you like Drake's and you do not consider upgrading, buy THIS model. In fact, you should buy this model regardless of Drake's because you are likely to be unhappy with an unupgraded 80GB model - like I mentioned above, I am already using over 120GB and this is BEFORE Home.- If you are planning to upgrade, you're better off with an 80GB model selling for $100 less because you can use the $100 you save to buy yourself Drake's for about $40 and use the balance to help pay for your disk upgrade.- Get yourself a USB port multiplexer if you need more than 2 ports- Transfer your photos to flash drives to get around the missing memory card interfaces- Or or, even better, get thePlaystation 3 Media Hub+for 2 extra USB ports AND a card reader- Keep your PS2 if you have one and still wish to play PS2 games in the future.- Enjoy your new PS3._____________________Note: I am not taking off one star for the lack of PS2 compatibility. I understand that Sony must compete on price and make a profit and times are tough. However, I simply can't see why Sony cut the number of USB ports from 4 down to 2 and this explains why this unit gets 4 stars instead of 5. This is a relatively significant inconvenience and I can't see how it would cost Sony more than a dollar or 2 if it provided 4 ports instead of 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2008"}

Paul \"John doe\"","summary":"MK vs DC Universe review","reviewText":"Now I'll do The MK vs DC Universe it was released in 2008 & on a Sunday believe it or not it was also the last Mortal Kombat game put out by Midway Chicago before Warner Brothers got it. A lot of people believed Mortal Kombat was finished after Armagedddon. In 2007 there was talk of a new project that was going on. Around April 2008 the info was released on this game I can remember the reaction to the news \"OH NOES!\" Cause it was going to be Teen rated & I'll admit that I had my concerns about it I didn't want MK 1 SNES. The DC people didn't want Superman & Batman killing people even though some of The DC finishing moves look like they kill people. I really didn't want MK to cave into The DC guys. To an extent they didn't. MK vs DC is the game I play the least in the series. Now the story is Shao Kahn failed at another attempt to take over relms. Raiden blasts him into a portal. At the same time in Metroplis Superman has defeated Darkseid he's knocked into a portal. What happens is Darkseid & Shao Kahn become 1 being Dark Kahn. As the relms merge some werid s  h  it happens with the fighters on both sides they get inflicted with \"Kombat Rage.\" That's pretty much the plot. I like this game but it's but I wouldn't play it like I would the other Mortal Kombat games. Joker is great to play as I like Raiden in this game Darkseid is just a killer. On Arcade mode I like that you can pick if you want to fight just Mortal Kombat guys DC guys or both. The Rage mode is cool. Story mode is good but The  Mortal Kombat 9 story mode blows this 1 out of the water. But I wish if they ever did another cross over that it was with Street Fighter. Well MK 9 is next it will be the final MK review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

Denick","summary":"A great game for kids and families!","reviewText":"Like all the games in the Lego series, this one shows an amazing level of attention when it comes to fan service... including characters, concepts, and jokes that true Marvel fans will get a kick out of, as they explore Stan Lee's incredible universe. This is a very lengthy campaign, packed with boatloads of objectives, collectibles, and new superfolks to unlock. For the most part, it's a lot of fun, though it can get a bit monotonous at times, and the save system is in desperate need of an overhaul.However, I do really enjoy this game and have to commend it for offering the option of drop-in/out cooperative play at any time, which is HUGE. It's great, because anybody can stroll by, pick up the controller for a bit, play, and then step aside later if they wish. Lego Marvel also gets huge points for being a fun game that is essentially non-violent (you're just smashing up building blocks), making a great choice for those with kids.And on the subject of kids, it's nice to see their minds put to a challenge as they play this game, and they are forced to figure out how to solve the many, many puzzles that must be overcome in order to advance the campaign. None of the puzzles are overwhelmingly difficult, but they do push the kids toward thinking outside the box and developing their problem solving skills (the game also gives you a few hints, but it doesn't solve them for you). Therefore, as the young players solve these puzzles successfully, they are not only improving their abilities to do so, but they are also getting a really good blast of positive self-esteem, which I love to see - it's much more productive than all those games that just have you destroying people/things. Lego Marvel is a blast!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2014"}

I am really enjoying the motion controls.  I prefer them over the older Zelda games.  The game itself feels like a combination of: Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, Wii Sports Resort and Mario Galaxy 2; taking many of the best elements from each.  It is heavy on dialogue, especially at the beginning, so Wii fans only used to Super Mario types games, and not Zelda or Paper Mario games, may get frustrated.  To those folks I would say, stick it out, as the dialogue adds to the great story and is part of teaching mechanics of the game.  Also, don't be afraid to use a guide. There are many available online, as well as in print.  The game will take over 25 hours to complete and side quests (or inexperience) add more time, making it up to a 50+ hour game that is one of the true gems on the Wii.  For parents, I would not recommend this games to kids under 9 as there is lots of dialogue and some scary themes and characters, but generally it is a tame game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"Possibly Mario's worst launch","reviewText":"As someone who has been enjoying Mario games for over 20 years, it's difficult for me to admit that I finally purchased a Mario game that made me miss my money...I know a lot of people could not understand why the 3DS launched without a Mario game (if you're wondering why I'm talking about the 3DS, just keep reading). It's just become a sort of staple or tradition with Nintendo consoles. If a new console is coming, it's usually accompanied by a Mario game. Said Mario game is usually fresh and shows off what the new console is capable of. Unfortunately, New Super Mario Bros. U is kind of an exception.Whereas the game does have some worthwhile features such as challenge mode and boost rush mode, what is actually \"new\" here is hardly enough to offset what is recycled -- which is practically 90% of the game. This is not to be taken literally. Nintendo didn't literally copy/paste levels from old New Super Mario games, but you can clearly see that there is hardly any inspiration here.All that is different this time around is the backgrounds of each level. Even though the game does not run at 1080p, the backgrounds look gorgeous anyway! Otherwise the gameplay, the music, the playable characters, the enemies, the collectables, yoshi, etc., are all identical to previous New Super Mario games. This game couldn't have taken long to put together...If you've played any of the prior games in the New series and found that you did not enjoy them, my advice is to pass on this game. I did not enjoy any of the prior games and felt as though perhaps this game would change that. It did not. I've heard some people argue that this game was challenging. I honestly found the DS version to be the hardest. It did not take me long at all to collect all the gold coins in this game. There are levels that are challenging, but not many.I feel as though Nintendo threw this together just so they wouldn't repeat what they did with the 3DS. Some will disagree with me (I expect this review to get hammered with \"unhelpful\" votes), and that is perfectly fine. I am simply throwing my unbiased opinion out there so that others who feel the same as me can save themselves some regret -- oh and some money.Cheers!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2012"}

GTA4 was a bore to me, over production, horrible accents, too chore based; take Susie on a date, Susie forgot her purse at the restaurant, go out on a second date with Susie, mow your lawn, wash your car, tuck in your shirt, ENOUGH !  I sold GTA4 in a few days.I expected the same here, even after I watched the live streams, this game doesn't look that great on stream, but the hacking, ominous way of the game still called to me. I cancelled my $54 preorder like a fool after watching the early pre release vids, couldn't stand the hype machine it called me back, I bought it for $65, flipping love it.It's raw, it's more real than GTA4, it's subtle, it's ominous, the music is excellent, the instrumental drama comes on in a intense moments.  My second day playing was way better than my first day I'm more powerful, have more skills, know more of what I'm doing now.Only knocks I could give would be car chases, it's hard for me to evade the cops on some portions of the map, cuz some are tighter than others.  I wish I could customize my character a little more, I'm not a hat guy.  I'm so weird there, I  wish I could at least put a \"fitted\" on Aiden.  They show small tutorials, but it would have be nice to have a small intro level that walked you thru the game more, but I'm less experienced with these open world games so maybe that's just me.  I just don't know exactly what I'm doing, I'm only 5% thru and my buddy already finished it, but he didn't do any side stuff, took him two days, hard to believe especially since I do a ton of story and my progression says 5%.  Again I'm not experienced with these open world games, slower, more cautious.Anyway to the pessimist guy, which is definitely me, might be you, have no worries about this game, get this game.  Also don't know what people are talking about, graphics look really good, graphics 8/10, game is a 9/10 at least; the 82 Metacritic score to me is too low.Note: I have not played the multiplayer, and haven't accepted any hackers request.  Don't use my advice on multiplayer I'm afraid to play it yet, cuz I'm just learning the game, but looks fun on stream, PS4 live feed.Funny story:  I think a online hacker can steal your data even if you don't accept a hackers challenge, or maybe I hit accept by accident anyway I was on a CTOS tower freeing the map (like Far Cry 3's radio towers) I was up high and it said an online hacker is downloading your data.  I felt I didn't have time to hack the area, felt exposed, quickly tiered down the CTOS tower, jumped in the fastest car I could find close and took off out of the area, immediately saw a girl running, ran her over, and it was the hacker, dead in 30 seconds after I saw the download, how cool, and funny, and lucky is that ?!Remember no games coming out unless you are a UFC fan until last week of April, which is Madden, second week of September, which is Destiny, too long to wait.I endorse Knack, Killzone, NBA2K14, Resogun, Watchdogs, all excellent..  COD Ghost is good, but frustrates me, not magical like MW, MW2, full of speed merchants.  I didn't play Battlefield..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

You control the leaning, the movement and position of the block, the punches direction and strenght, and the walking of your boxer, ALL WITH THE TWO CONTROL STICKS!  The x, square, triangkle and circle buttons are almost useless in the real fight.The fun part is to figure out the fight \"pattern\" of your oponent, and start blocking, ducking and counter punching. When you can accomplish that, the sound of the punch and the blood coming out of the swollen face of the guy your fighting is awsome. Fells great, and make you blood thirsty.Theres one bad thing about FNR3 thou, the carrer mode is very repetitive, you just traing then fight once and again for literally dozens of times with no real purpose. Eventually you get some sort of trophy, but thats not incentive enough. This is the main star stealer aspect of this review.

The character models are impressive, down to sweat streaks on their bodies.If someone walked into the room while you were playing a game, they might think for a second that they were watching an actual fight. The movements of the characters are impressive. The level of details on their faces and bodies - from the veins in their arms to the ripple of muscles on their stomach - was done with great attention.You also get good quality voice acting from the commentator.Now, that being said, my biggest issue is with the controls. The controls here are to use a joystick and to sweep it in the direction your first is going to go. So if you want your right fist to come sweeping around from the right to hit the guy's face, you use your joystick to go right and then forward.But in practice I found that I could be telling the controller to do right jab - right jab - right jab and that randomly a left hook would throw in there. And there's no way to aim for the head vs the body.I think a bit issue is that I have motion-based boxing games that I adore. I throw a left hook with my arm and the on-screen character mimics me perfectly. I *love* that. To try to do that type of action with a joystick just doesn't work. Both in a technical sense and in a visceral sense.Also, the beautiful character modeling comes at a high price. The load screens are often interminable. Moving between screens can take quite a while.I think if there were't other options out there, and this was the only boxing game around, that I would play it. It's pretty to look at. It does provide a boxing experience. But with all the other games I can choose from, which are enormously fun to play, I just don't have a reason to pop this into the PS3 and then wait for it to eventually get me into a match.Rating: 3/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to write this review.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2012"}

However, this is more than a simple port&#x2014;every aspect of the game has been reviewed and enhanced. Additionally, a host of brand-new elements have been seamlessly merged with the original game, providing unexpected surprises for longtime fans. With new dungeons, new job classes, and other exciting features, both old-school players and newcomers can enjoy this genre-defining Final Fantasy title in a portable format!","reviewerName":"Midnight Distortions \"Cloud\"","summary":"A classic game from the past!!","reviewText":"In response to some of the negative (& i mean negative) reviews i just want to clarify, this game is NOT overrated. If anything its underrated.  Tell me how many people have actually played Final Fantasy for the first time, playing FFX or XII & think, hey these games are pretty cool, lets look at the older games & see how they are.  When they get a hold of the game they're like.. \"e[...] this game is horrible, graphics are bad, character development is lame & god forbid the noise they call music\" or whatever it is they complain about not liking the game. People have to remember, this is an older game! From 1994!! Graphics were limited at that time & this game is no exception.Anyways, what does make this game so great? Well for one thing you can have 4 characters instead of 3 during battle & you get more characters overall. So whats not to like about this game?  Well sure it can use a graphics overall maybe some voice-overs but other then that NOTHING. I think the story is superb, you start off with a girl who has no recollection of who she is or what she is doing in the middle of an ancient 'magic war'. Sure that's nostalgic but i think the greatest thing about this game is the fact that the characters don't give up hope. Not only that the music for this game is phenomenal, especially for a Snes game. The sound is a little different from the original i think due to the fact its on a portable system that still uses cartridge technology but that doesn't really bother me, it sounds different, in an interesting way. Not only that you can choose what magic spells you want to learn for those who still want to do the black mage, white mage, fighter style, they can! You also have some innovative tech skills that enables you to certain things for every character. To me this fun is enjoyable, epic & has a replay value up the roof. For all those naysayers, well its your loss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2009"}

I asked her later what she thought of the game and she said it was ok, but would probably be going back to Mario and Luigi.

{"product_name":"B002C0VNVG","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Buggy Port of an Outdated PC Game","reviewText":"Risen would have been a decent game if it came out a decade earlier.Unfortunately, the game industry passed it by in terms of graphics, story, and design.Story: 3/10The opening cinematic poorly shows a Dark Lord using a magic spell to sink a ship, in fact, it's so poorly done, I'm not even sure what happened.  There was a weird guy, a spell, some monster face thing...  Keep in mind that this pre-rendered intro is supposed to set up the story for the player and get them excited about the game.  Instead, you just feel sort of disappointed and confused.When the game begins, the main character wakes up on an island with debris and bodies.  After some time, he finds himself in a power struggle between an oppressive order of holy monks and lawless bandits.  To make matters worse, ancient ruins and creatures are appearing all over the island.  The hero must save the day by performing 250 menial tasks by talking to bored NPC's and delivering items.Graphics: 1/10Low res textures, bland character designs, no normal maps, no bump maps, texture stretching all over the environments, character animations popping from one to the next, some characters moving without animations and sliding around the world with their arms straight out... The only thing this game has going for it is the forest created by Speed Tree (used in Oblivion.)  In the grand scheme of things, Morrowind (2002) actually looks better than this game.(Sacred 2 and The Last Remnant may be the only games that look worse.)Gameplay: 3/10There are two types of gameplay:  Combat and QuestsThe Combat involves blocking by pressing RT and attacking by pressing LT.  As your character levels up, you unlock new moves like parry and slash, but the game basically boils down to you standing in front of an enemy and swinging your sword by pressing RT over and over.  If you are attacked by multiple enemies, it's best to try not to get flanked, so you need to move around.  The combat is somewhat buggy.  If you attack a wolf from behind, it can't turn around to attack you.  If you attack a powerful ogre and get in close, you can repeatedly hit it 100 times to kill it and it can't hit you.Missile and Magic attacks are somewhat worthless.  Most of the fights take place in enclosed places, so bows and crossbows are only good for one shot before the enemy is upon you.  There are two basic types of spells in the game:  Navigation and Combat.  The Navigation Spells are used almost like puzzle elements to get through environments.  You can levitate, turn into a nautilus, open doors...  The combat spells are all projectiles with a damage type, fire, frost...  But you cannot use the spells together.  You can't levitate around a room and throw fireballs at the same time.  Risen could have really used buff, shield, and debuff spells.  It would have added a much needed level of depth to the combat.Most of the Quests involve finding a person, then clicking on all of the dialogue options.  What you say doesn't really affect the outcome of the story like Mass Effect, instead you basically just try to speed through the dialogue so you can get the item that you need.  The quests are very simple, but they are structured in a really annoying manner.  Here's an example:You must give this amulet to Carlo in Harbor Town.  So, you walk to Harbor Town, (30 minutes) then open your quest window, scroll through the quest list, then scroll through your map interface.  A dot gives you a rough idea where Carlo is located.  So you try to find Carlo (5 minutes) and when you get to him, he refuses to talk to you.  Then you realize that this quest was dependent on some other quest that you had, so you scroll through the 100 quests in your quest log to try and find the right one.  Then you spend the next 3 hours talking to NPC's who don't help you and ask, \"Don't you have something better to do?\"  (No Joke, they actually say that!)If this sounds fun, then this is the perfect game for you!Interface Screens:  1/10The quest / map screens are a notch above completely worthless and when you trade items, highlighting any item opens a window that obscures your Gold, so you can't see how much you have without moving the cursor out of the way.  The screens that are supposed to make the adventure interactive actually work against you.Character Advancement:  4/10As you level up, you gain Learning Points and additional Hit Points.  In order to improve a skill, you must search the world to find a Trainer.  However, Trainers are few and far between and you will most likely have to walk to a town that's far away to increase a certain skill.  Most Trainers only teach 2 skills.  You can increase in weapon and crafting skills, but crafting in this game is overly simplistic and fairly useless.Sound:  4/10The main character sounds like Ewan McGregor in Star Wars the Phantom Menace, in both voice and tone.  Basically, he sounds like an English guy who sounds bored out of his skull.  Almost all of the characters sound really bored in the game.  The music is very subtle, but fits the mood and the combat sound effects are fairly weak.Replay Value:  3/10The main story is linear, but there are hundreds of side quests.  But the only variation of how you play the game is where you start.  You can start as a knight, a monk, or a bandit.  Other than the beginning, there is no variation to the story and there are no multiplayer modes.Bugs:  9/10Buggiest Game since Golden Axe: Beast Rider!It crashes, animations pop, characters get stuck on walls and teleport to roofs, texture tears are everywhere in the environment, some enemies can't hit you, there are invisible walls, and some quests seem to be broken.Tedium:  10/10The game is tedious and does NOTHING to help you adventure through the world.  You can unlock over 100 side quests at a time, but many of them must be done in a particular order, but you don't know which order.  Your only option is to wander aimlessly around the world to try and find someone who will talk to you.  You will literally waste hours doing this.  When you level up, you must search the world for a trainer that teaches the skills that you want.  You can find them on your map, but you will usually have to walk for 20-30 minutes to find the right one.  Water...  Water in your inventory restores mana, but when you drink it out of a barrel, it restores Health.  When you find a barrel, you can drink the water and the character leans over, cups his hands, and drinks the water, then stands back up.  When you do this, you get 10-20 HP.  Most games would just fill your health, but since this is one of the few places to get free HP, you will have to press the drink button about 10 times and watch the animation over and over and over and over...  There are chests all around the world.  Some you can open and some need to be picked with a set of lock picks.  After you search the chest, your character closes the lid and stands back up, so there is NO WAY to tell which chests you have already searched.  The searched chests should have remained open, so this results in you seeing a closed chest and saying, \"Cool a chest!\"  Then you run over, crouch, open the lid, search, find it's empty, close the lid, then stand back up...  You'll waste time doing this, too.  Dying... The game is loaded with deadly falls and insta-kill traps.  Save often because the game likes to kill you.  Healing during combat is also broken.  You can hotkey a healing potion and access it by pressing RB+Y, but your character puts his sword and shield away, takes out the potion, drinks it, then stands there like a dummy during combat.  The entire time, you are getting attacked and you lose more HP than you gain by drinking a potion.  But, you can access your inventory during combat and the monsters stop attacking.  They just stand there, so you can drink a potion or eat 15 pieces of meat, while your character performs the eat meat animation 15 times.  When you close your inventory, the enemies immediately attack you.  Because of the crafting / recipes in the game, you are encouraged to become an inventory hoarder.  At times, you'll be too paranoid to sell items because you may need them in the future.  Also, there is no way to DISCARD any item in your inventory and many items are unsellable.  So, that key that you found in the small shack must clutter your inventory forever!  Most games destroy quest items after they are used, to avoid confusion.  Navigation is also tedious.  You have a compass and you can pause the game to look at a very crude map, that's all you get.  I could keep going, but talking about this game is making my review tedious.Maturity:  MSwearing, Sexual Suggestions, Scantily Clad Prostitutes, and Fantasy ViolenceOverall:  3/10The only strong point of the game is the satisfaction of completing quests and finding useful items through exploring.  There is so much stuff hidden in the environment, you do feel rewarded for exploring and solving quests.  Besides that, this game is poor in every category.If you like open ended RPG's, I strongly recommend Oblivion, Fallout 3, Red Dead Redemption, Dragon Age, Mass Effect 1 & 2, and Assassin's Creed 2.If you also play PC games, check out The Witcher!Buy this game if you like old school RPG's and have hours to kill.The interface is probably better on the PC, so if you have a PC that can run this game, I'd recommend the PC version over the 360 version.It's about a 50+ hour game, so I wouldn't rent it.Avoid this game if you need good graphics.Avoid this game if you need a good story.Avoid this game if you like streamlined adventures.Avoid this game if you like complex combat and magic systems.Avoid this game if you hate buggy gameplay.If you enjoyed this game, you could probably stomach playing Sacred 2, but it's lacking in story, atmosphere, and graphics.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5JW","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Lost in the space between a 3 and a 4","reviewText":"I should begin by admitting that I really loved these games when they were first released. Playing through them again has really brought home the fact that gamers are quite spoiled these days. We expect amazing everything. And most of us grow weary when games don't deliver. In their time, these games were the best of the best; they offered unique gaming experiences and were responsible for a great deal of what is common in today's platformers. That having been said; these are all showing their age. There are simply a vast number of games which have come along that look, control and please much more than these will. They aren't bad games. And the fact that they're being bundled at such a decent price makes it a worthwhile investment. It also doesn't hurt that there are three decent platinum trophies to be had here. But just don't expect to feel the same fondness for these titles that you may have when you initially played them. Titles such as these have the unfortunate disadvantage of being unlike certain other platformers (think Mario or Sly Cooper), in that they've been shown up a number of times since their creation. I played the Sly Collection recently and it (much like the original NES Mario games would) still felt worthwhile. Games like this weren't choppy and overly pixelated, the controls were near-perfect, and the direction was usually pretty clear. The Tomb Raider Trilogy can't really claim most of that to be true. They don't look great comparatively, the camera and controls are certainly not the greatest, and the game isn't always good with directing players to their next objective. Even I have to admit that that last complaint isn't always a bad thing. The frustration of these once-groundbreaking games is something that many of you may consider its greatest strength. And I'm on board with that. Some of the puzzles were simply too unclear for my tastes. And that really saying something, considering I just finished playing and loving Portal 2. Regardless, I think the game rests somewhere between a 3 and a 4. It's certainly no 5. And newcomers are likely going to agree with me on the 3. Nostalgia, trophies, and an excellent package price drive this ever closer to a 4 for me. But the look, camera, and controls wedge this one much closer to a 3 than a 4, in my opinion. I don't expect everyone to agree. I just know that there are better games out there to be played at this point in time. There are even better PS2 re-releases to be found (the god of war collection, for instance). Again, these are decent games. Playing them, you'll quickly realize where most puzzling elements in newer video games had their roots. Those newer games owe lots of credit to these groundbreakers. I gladly admit all of that. So invest. It won't be the worst gaming purchase you've ever made. That much I know. But, as a consumer, I must admit that these have not aged well. As much as I hate admitting that fact; I still feel it right to give fair warning.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2011"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Great Game for a 10-Year Old","reviewText":"Laughable voice acting, stupid story, dumb-looking character models.

And, along with Episodes 1 and 2, it remains my favourite to this day. Valve have taken their 1998 classic Half-Life and improved on it in every conceivable way. Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 -- the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters. I could bang on about this game for ever and a day, but just let me say this: play it -- you won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"Bigger, badder and better!","reviewText":"As the Xbox 360 was released I was always on the fence of either buying that or the PS3. There was one game that shifted favor towards the Xbox 360 and that was Dead Rising. With a game set in a giant mall, hordes of zombies and some of the freakiest boss characters it was a great experience. The sequel not just gave us the same experience but it broke the mold as it gave us new options and even a crafting system. Capcom has now come out with the latest in the series named Dead Rising 3. But is this a zombie game you will want to play or should you revisit some of the classics?The game takes place ten years after Dead Rising 2 and takes place in the fictional city of Los Perdidos California. You are in control of a young mechanic named Nick Ramos as you are stranded in this city. Nick learns that in three days the military is going to level the city in a massive airstrike. Everything that is contained within the city will be destroyed and that includes any survivors. You have to figure out a way out of this city or otherwise die in a firestorm with thousands of zombies.There are differences between this game and its previous installment for example the map is gigantic. Both the maps from two previous incarnations can fit in this map with room to spare. The graphics are taking advantage of the Xbox One&#8217;s capabilities as the zombies look more menacing and instead of having hundreds there are thousands of zombies everywhere. You will have the ability to grab various items to use as weapons and combine them in weapon combos. In addition to combos there are also super combo weapons including a massive bomb. This bomb acts as a mini nuke and will obliterate any zombie in the nearby vicinity (along with the players clothes).My only problem with this game is that it is going to be an Xbox One exclusive. I can understand that this game will not be available on the Xbox 360 due to processing requirements but really? Not even a PC version? So the only way to play the latest installment of this game is to shell out $450 for a new console. But from what I have seen of the gameplay videos it is money well spent. So if you are getting an Xbox One this is a no brainer make sure you get Dead Rising 3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

This time around Sega released Jet Set Radio Future for Microsoft's Xbox video game console system. Developer Smilebit pretty much takes the original Dreamcast game and creates a reboot/reinvisioning of that Dreamcast game. The cel-shaded animation was an improvement over the original game and gives this Xbox release from Sega a daring and innovative art design. Later console games will make use of this animation technique but none did it better than Smilebit with Jet Set Radio Future.The game takes place in Tokyo in the near-future where freedom of expression, especially of the artistic nature, has been supressed by an all-powerful corporation which has influenced and/or infiltrated the government. The gameplay is simple in that the player must go around the city and tag specific areas. In order to create these graffiti artwork the player must find and collect graffiti souls that have been put in different locations around the city. To move the game's storyline forward the player must complete a set of missions per stage and when done successfully unlocks the next set and so on and so forth. The music for JSRF is a nix eclectic mix of techno/house/remixes. The best part of the game is actually the soundtrack and some songs could only be unlocked when certain stages or goals are met.2002's Jet Set Radio Future was a very good game with an innovative game design in addition to a nice techno soundtrack.

While many would argue that &#34;Super Mario World&#34; was that title for the Super Nintendo, I would say that the distinction belongs to &#34;SMB 3&#34; (as packaged with Super Mario All-Stars).  With the possible exception of &#34;Mario '64&#34;, &#34;SMB3&#34; may just be the most well-rounded Mario game ever produced.I could go into a detailed explanation of why this game is so well-renowned, but I think I'll stick to something a bit more esoteric here: Basically, it is just a ton of fun to play!  What the original Mario Bros. did for gaming was to show the gamer what true fun playing a TV-based video game looked/felt like.  &#34;SMB3&#34; expands on that with even brighter colors, more visually interesting locals, and a good difficultly scale (easy to pick up...really tough to beat!).  When I tried playing &#34;SMB 2&#34; or &#34;Lost Levels&#34;, I always got the sense that the experience was &#34;work&#34;.

As he leaks out, he notices the Terror Mask, and is given a choice, die here, or put the mask on, and save his girlfriend. Without much thought, Rick chooses option B, becomes a hulking mass of muscle and becomes 110% committed to retrieving his Girlfriend, and will kill, maim, disembody, gut, cleave, and pummel anything unfortunate enough to get in his way. Rick's good to go, but will you want to play?What's Good:The Graphics:The environments are well animated,and though the game has a slightly cartoony feel, it doesn't come off as unrealistic per say. The best description i can come up with is a realistic caricature of the characters, while maintaining a par or better version of realism for environments. With exception of the doors you get to feed.Damage:What i really liked about Splatterhouse is how much effort Namco put into the actual damage system, enemies can be cut limb from limb, decapitated, sliced in half, and Rick himself can be dismembered, all in battle, with no hiccups in frame rate. I like that Rick can be missing chunks of his flesh under normal play, i guess it gives me some sort of real showcase that though rick is the powerhouse he is, its still killable.Violence:Ok this game is excessively, brutally violent in almost every sense. Blood coats the walls, pours off and out of gaping wounds, and flows a neat little trail from corpse, up ricks leg and into the mask. Rick can do what's called splatterkills, which is even more violent than the usual beat you can disperse normally. Usually it involves literally tearing a enemy apart, in one case, you provide an interesting version of a fatal prostate exam. Basically the game offers up all of those things people swear they don't like to see, its a massive collection of gore, and its good at depicting it.Controls:As a whole, i liked the control scheme, X was attack, a jumped, used the triggers for different movesets, and with very minor touchy issues with certain things the controls worked, quite well in fact. The combination weren't obscure, if anything they might have been on the side of too basic.Upgrades:There are plenty of upgrades, purchased by BLOOD which is received through killing enemies, with more moves, health, mask power ups, special moves, and upgrades to the way you even use weapons, Rick is very customizable to the way you play most first. Almost EVERY upgrade is worth getting and will help you fight back the crowds easier, many platformers do not provide effective upgrades, it was nice that when i spent all of my BLOOD i saved up on a skill, I didn't feel like i was ripped off.The Bad:Jumping(sidescroll):Personally i got used to jumping pretty easily, but it felt funky. Rick's jump is a really pathetic thing given what he can do. Its short, most cases, just long enough to get you where you need to go, but its a minor issue at best, especially since Rick jumps a lot early on and then it kind of just never happens in the side scrolling portions again.Loading:The loading screen, though decidedly creepy, and quite well conceived is ridiculously punishing. Though the game loads a lot once and then in very little snippets, really keeping you in game with only a few mandatory load screens througout the story mode, if you die, you will hate this screen. Make a minor error and die, you will be rewarded with a 40 second to 1 minute load. It SUCKS, honestly this one problem almost made me put the game down for a while during one part of the story.Apparent Repetitive nature:At first, the game seems fine, but you begin to feel you're doing the same thing over and over and over. This is true, about 30% into it, Splatterhouse begins to drag its feet. But, towards the last few phases, it begins to ask MUCH more from the player, forcing the player to open up his moveset me, dodge more, block and use different moves, so yes it does get a bit repetitive, but it fixes back up later.The End:I won't spoil it, but i didn't like the end, it fits the bill, but the way it was done i think could have been done more permanent than the choice they made to implement. If there is a S2, then i think i can forgive them for their choice, but without that, its not going to work.All in all, Splatterhouse does have what it takes to be a good time, its challenging late game, its fun, it more or less does what it needs to with some frustration. But if you can look past what it doesn't do right. Its a good way to spend a few days.**Note: this game is not in any way for children under its mature title rating, it contains excessive violence, vulgarity, and pornography. If you are not comfortable with this, or not comfortable with your kids' playing this sort of thing, you should not purchase this title.

You play as Sly Cooper, a racoon whose goal is to retrieve his family's stolen book of theiving techniques. You'll make your way through the game collecting it back piece by piece and gaining new skills while doing so. The in-game graphics are clean and refined, and carry over the cartoon-like atmosphere found in the cinematic cut-scenes well. Even though the whole game is rather easy to beat, the experience from beginning to end is a grand one. Sly's only drawback is that there is some slowdown present in the later levels. It never really interferes with the gameplay, but it can get annoying at times. I also would have liked to see this game to be just a little longer. By the time you collect all of the skills, the game is just about over (I estimate it will take the average player about 7-10 hours to beat). Overlooking those small flaws however, Sly Cooper is an excellent choice for PS2 owners looking for another great platformer to add to their collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2003"}

Getting to play these two games in the series is quite a joy just to see how the series has evolved through the years. In Final Fantasy I, you pick a team of four to set off on a journey to battle the forces of Chaos. Picking the right jobs are key in this game to beat Chaos' forces. In my opinion, the story was a little lean in the first game but it's a good game nonetheless. In Final Fantasy II, four orphans unite and fight to undo an evil empire. They key to making it through this game is to pick the right weapons and use them alot to do battle with as you don't level up through experience...the more you use your weapons & abilities- the stronger you get. I have to admit, it was fun to finally get to play FFII as it was previously unavailable in america on a handheld.Thankfully, Square Enix improved the graphics and sound somewhat from the originals(although not a great deal). It would've been nice to see a little more animation used on the enemies but, then again, I guess we wouldn't have seen how far the game has come through the years.If you like old-school roleplaying, you can't go wrong with Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls.

Even moreso than the Phantasy Star Collection on the Gameboy Advance and that's one of my favorites.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2006"}

While at its heart it could be compared to other open world role-playing games, like Borderlands or Fallout 3/Fallout: New Vegas, it's also the first zombie role-playing game set on an incredibly lush island that turns into a hellish paradise once you dig further into the madness.Pros:- Terrifying Beauty - The island of Banoi is soaked in atmosphere, from the most beautiful of locations, to the most horrific, this is one vacation that is a pleasure assault on the eyes. Pack your bags, and make sure to include a machete and spike baseball bat, because you'll be needing both. This is one huge island packed with a lot to both see and do.- Top Notch Atmosphere - The sound design, the environments that come to life, etc., really put you into the experience.- Undead Meat - A cool feature in Dead Island is the analog control option in the menus, which allows you to aim for any part of a zombie's body. Is the zombie swinging its arms wildly at you? Target each arm and begin to chop away. You can break the bones and make them just hang there, or you could just chop them off entirely. After chopping off a zombie's arms, the zombie may then try to headbutt you, so simply target the head and chop it off. The tech here is very cool and allows you to play around with the zombies and kill them in numerous gruesome ways.- Tons of Content - Dead Island will take the average player around 35 hours or more to see everything there is to do on Banoi.- Role-Play Depth - Level up, unlock skills, find loot, get tons of quests, go through your inventory, etc. Dead Island isn't some easy way to make a buck, this is a game packed with a lot of depth and it shows that the developers wanted to give players a rich experience.- Fun Melee Combat - As I already mentioned, I can't recommend the analog option enough. It keeps combat from feeling repetitive, as it gives you various ways to defeat your enemies.- Co-op That Redefines What Co-op Should Be - This game is an absolute blast with some friends. Did you enjoy Borderlands with a few buddies? Now take that, ratchet up the fun factor even more, and this is exactly what Dead Island delivers. The focus on intense melee combat is a nice change of pace from other co-op games out there.Cons:- A Few Hiccups - You'll experience a few flaws and oddities, but the Xbox 360 version is generally pretty good in terms of overall performance. In addition, a patch was just released on Xbox Live that gets rid of the majority of technical flaws.Dead Island is a game with depth, beautiful environments to explore, and some really enjoyable melee-focused combat, so it should come as no surprise that I'm definitely recommending this to anyone that enjoys a meaty single player campaign or 4-player co-op. As long as you like a deep and rewarding role-playing game, you'll definitely get your money's worth out of Dead Island.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003TIVSM4","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"An enjoyable action game","reviewText":"Space Marine does pretty much what it says on the box: it puts the player in the feet of an eight-foot-tall, genetically-engineered warrior created for the purpose of defending humanity against myriad alien threats and heretical insurgents. The game is a third-person action title blending shooting with melee combat. Engagements typically begin with long-range exchanges of fire before closing down the gap and attacking with close-in weapons (players are advised to hold off and pick off enemy heavy weapons first before closing to melee, as the enemy have no compunction about mowing down their own troops if it kills you as well). In contrast to a lot of recent action games, the game has no cover system as the ethos of the Space Marine is to constantly attack and stay on the attack. Hiding behind a crate and sniping at the enemy for ages is considered both dishonourable and also damaging, as it delays the fulfilment of the Emperor's Will.To encourage an aggressive play style in keeping with the setting, Relic have used several techniques. One of these is a melee combat system that allows you to build up special attacks and chains of attacks through constantly staying on the offensive. The other is the game's health system, where the only way to regain lost health is to engage in melee combat and carry out special 'finishing' moves on stunned opponents. Thus, gloriously counter-intuitively but in-keeping with the battiness of Warhammer 40,000, if you are low on health the best course of action is to charge straight into the middle of a pack of enemies with chainsword whirring.This focus on melee and de-emphasis on stand-off firefights means that the Gears of Warhammer comparisons that have been floating around aren't very accurate. The game also makes use of the extremely rich and well-developed setting to give the story more depth and emphasis. The game's depiction of a Forge World at war is brilliantly atmospheric, conveyed by the excellent architectural design and the high quality of the graphics. The writing is surprisingly good for a linear combat game, with an interesting subplot developing about dissent in the Ultramarines' ranks (which builds to the morally ambiguous conclusion to the game). Secondary characters are fleshed-out well, and the game designers are to be commended for avoiding cliche with the game's only female character of note, Lt. Mira. Even the (initial) principal villain, the Ork Warboss, is surprisingly badass and at one stage even sympathetic.Elsewhere the game is more predictable, especially if you are familiar with the WH40K setting in general and Relic's Dawn of War strategy games in particular. The 'unexpected' arrival of a third faction in the late-game period, the unveiling of a core character as a traitor and other plot twists are signposted well in advance. Still, for an action game, the plot and characters are above average.Combat is satisfying, with the Space Marines' arsenal feeling suitably overpowered. There's also a nice burst of originality in doing tiresome 'turret' missions only to find you can rip the weapon off the turret and walk around with it as a normal (but massive) gun until it runs out of ammo. The hordes of attacking Orks are depicted well and the game manages to strike the right balance between being too much of a pushover and too difficult to be enjoyable. Whilst the game rewards you charging straight into the midst of a horde of 20 Orks, it also punishes you if you do so without being fully aware of the situation and eliminating bigger threats first. In particular, keep an eye open for suicide squigs (animals with explosives strapped to them) which have a tendency to charge up to you and explode whilst you are distracted in melee.The game breaks up the numerous large-scale battle scenes with set-piece events, such as sitting on the back of a train blazing away at an attacking Ork battlewagon (which seems to conflate two Firefly references into one, with this particular Ork ship strongly resembling a Reaver warship). These are surprisingly infrequent, with the game preferring to mix up combat scenes with 'tense' sequences of exploring areas and expecting an ambush. In practice these 'tense' sequences are a little bit too common, making it feel that a good quarter or so of the game is spent running through empty rooms, some of them suitable for a good firefight, only for nothing to happen. The limited interactiveness of the game - aside from shooting or hitting things or stocking up on ammo, the only thing you can do is listen to some logs lying around the place - makes the between-firefight sections feel a bit pointless. Unfortunately, just as I was getting ready to praise the game for the total absence of tiresome Quick-Time Events, the game decided to end on a rather annoying one (albeit one amusingly based on an event in the Lord of the Rings movies), which felt random and out-of-keeping with the rest of the game.Space Marine's engine is impressive, handling the numbers of enemy opponents, ludicrous amounts of mayhem and the vast levels with ease. In fact, the engine is good  enough that I'd love to see Relic doing more with it: adding more interactiveness or maybe even producing a WH40K role-playing game using the same assets would be an interesting move.Overall, Space Marine (****) is a fun, playable shooter. It's on the short side at six hours, but it also doesn't outstay its welcome, cleverly adjusting the plot twists and turns to keep things as fresh as possible given the limitations of the genre, though the shoot-'n'-slice gameplay does start to feel a bit old towards the end. I'd hesitate to recommend it at full price, but on rental or budget, it is a solid and enjoyable slice of entertainment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}

Just 2 months later, as the nation continued its recovery from the tragedy, Rockstar Games released the game that would not only shatter sales records all over the world but also spark severe controversy for its glorification of the dark side of humanity's need to survive, Grand Theft Auto 3.Flash forward 2 years later and Rockstar released the virtually inevitable sequel to GTA3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (also considered to be GTA4).  This volume of the GTA series takes place in the middle 1980's, when \"Miami Vice\" was popular TV and \"Scarface\" had yet to achieve the cult status it has now.In GTA: VC You take on the role of Tommy Vercetti (voiced by Ray Liotta), a small-time thug who just got out of prison for doing a little jail time for his boss.  Tommy is sent to Vice City (think Miami in the 80's) by his boss to help secure a stronghold in the town by running several errands (missions) with the help of several savory and rather unsavory characters. As the game progresses, Tommy learns that his boss is clued in to the fact that Tommy is getting a larger share of the business in VC and is now coming down to take it from him one way or the other.  Do you think that Tommy is going to give in and surrender?  Not without a serious fight.As with GTA3, VC features famous actors and actresses voicing several of the characters Tommy meets along the way, including Burt Reynolds as an unscrupulous property owner, Phillip Michael Thomas of \"Miami Vice\" as an ally of Tommy's (talk about poetic irony), and Jenna Jameson as a popular porn actress (not much of a stretch, huh?)The violence is slightly ramped up for VC, with a brand new assortment of weapons for you to unleash on the populace of the city, including remote detonation bombs, a chain gun, a katana, a Magnum handgun (perfect for a one-shot kill), and more.Also, motorcycles and boats, which weren't available to you to ues in GTA3, are now yours to get for missions or just cruising around and enjoying the huge scenery of the VC area.  Also, the graphics are cleaner and more detailed for VC than the slightly blocky graphics of GTA3 (The effect of seeing someone fall off of a motorcycle if you shot them is priceless).  Alas, the game does suffer from the fatal flaws of a severely long lag between loading missions/cutscenes and a flawed targeting sistem (woe be you if you try to target a random stranger in the street and inadvertently target a cop, which pretty much gets you an automatic 2-star Wanted level).Now that the game is considered a Greatest Hit and is available at a lower price (or for those that really want to build their GTA collection in case their copy of GTA3 is a little worn the duo of GTA3 and VC are available in a Double Pack), those who were itching to play it but didn't have the cash to get it can finally afford it.  Also you can get in your practice in anticipation of the release of GTA: San Andreas by playing at least one of its predecessors.  Believe me when I say that this is one vice (city) that you won't want to give up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2004"}

Sure, it wasn't a perfect game.  It did have some highly annoying game play moments such as the section where Starkiller has to make a frustrating jump on Raxus Prime.  I'm sure if you played the 1st game you know what jump I'm talking about.  It's the jump where you have to bend a piece of metal a certain way to make the jump.  If you don't bend the piece of metal the specific way, then you will get a chance to watch Starkiller fall to his death numerous times until you get it right.  Then there's the part of the game where you have to pull a Starship out of the sky.  This simple act took far too long for a Jedi on Starkiller's level to perform.  Even though these game play moments where huge annoyances in the 1st game the rest of the game more than made up for these inadequacies with a compelling storyline, great use of the Force, beautiful-interesting cinematics,  varied environments, and likeable characters like Star Killer, Proxy, and General Kota, and the game has high replay value.  I enjoyed going back through the game finding things I missed the first time, replaying with better force abilities, getting new costumes for Starkiller to try on, and experiencing the story over and over.  This storyline felt like it belonged in the Star Wars universe and was tragic yet captivating.Unfortunately game 2 suffers from the same fate as most modern movies.  Just like a lot of modern movies a lot of time and money was spent on the visual aspects and not enough attention was given to character development or storyline (movies like G.I. Joe: the Rise of Cobra, Transformers, and The Clash of the Titans remake immediately come to mind).  The result for the player is a great looking game with an inferior storyline.  This game was heavily advertised as being about Starkiller discovering is true identity and finding himself; however, by the time the player finishes the game Starkiller doesn't learn anything new about his identity, he doesn't find himself, nor is anything resolved.  Starkiller has an anticlimactic battle with Vader and then shortly after the game just ends.  If this was somehow supposed to make me look forward to another sequel then the developers failed miserably.  If anything I'm more inclined to skip a sequel.  The sort of lazy storyline that this game has is unacceptable in a modern video game world where the competition is turning out great games that have a storyline, character development, look good, have an actual ending, and fantastic game play (Uncharted 1 and Uncharted 2 immediately come to mind).Another problem with the storyline is it focuses on the power of love.  Having a story that focuses on love wouldn't be a problem if the romance was well done unforunately in this game it's not. The problem with the love between StarKiller and Juno is that it is poorly done.  The two have zero chemistry together.  The writers are partially responsible for this, but the other part of the blame lies with Sam Witwer (who I actually like as an actor and in the part of Starkiller) and Nathalie Cox who both fail to convey any passion for one another in their performance in either game 1 or 2.  If you compare their performance to that of Nolan North as Nathan Drake and Emily Rose as Elena Fisher in Uncharted you'll see a huge difference.  North and Rose did such good jobs in their roles that the chemistry between the two is so hot the player can feel the heat.  So again, this romance aspect in the Force Unleashed II only adds to the game's mediocrity.  It is completely unbelievable that Juno is the only reason Starkiller would find Vader and face him again.  It is also unbelievable that he would risk the future of the rebellion for said woman.  To me if they wanted make the romance a heavy part of the storyline then they should've done 1 of 2 things.  They should've have either replaced Nathalie with a woman Sam has chemistry with or writen better material for the actors to work with.Getting to the game play aspect this time around StarKiller starts the game off so powerful that leveling up isn't as rewarding as the first game, which makes replaying the game for this reason a waste of time.  StarKiller can now move multiple objects at the same time.  He can also use the Jedi mind trick, which only seems worth the effort against the clones.  StarKiller has two light sabers instead of just one like in the 1st game which changes the way he interacts with enemies in a good way.  He can also use Force Fury in a cool way.  I found the combat to be enjoyable.  Slicing and dicing enemies was fun and so was using lighting attacks and force fury on them since the targeting system is even better in this game than the 1st one.  This aspect could've been better utilized if the developers had bothered to include a greater variety of enemies for StarKiller to dispatch.  Since they choose not to do so the the fun combat isn't fully utilized, which is a shame.  Also fighting Darth Vader wasn't much of a challenge.  He was much weaker this time than in the original game, and the meeting between the two wasn't emotionally charged either which I think was another wasted opportunity.  If the game had better writing leading up to this battle and the eventual confrontation was presented better their fight could've propelled this game to greatness.Again, this is a beautiful game to look at.  The only problem with the cinematics is that they aren't as interesting to watch this time around.  I found the cinematics in the original game to be much more captivating to view. Also the two cinematic debut trailers weren't even in the game, which was a major letdown especially since they were much better (by better I mean exciting) than any of the cinematics in the actual game.  Talk about false advertising.Another major problem with the game is the length.  This game is extremely short maybe 5 or 6 hours long at best.  The first time I passed the game, I thought that I must've missed something.  I thought to myself that there was just no way that the game was over considering that it felt like it ended in the middle and nothing was discovered or resolved.  I played through again and this time I choose the dark side ending.  Nothing much changed and again the game just ended abruptly.  This game is definitely not worth $60.  My recommendation for any gamer who is considering buying this game is to rent it first or purchase it once the price drops.  You'll be less disappointed.Rating:  D (73%)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Poop Thang","summary":"Differences Between This Brawl and the Old One","reviewText":"Many people just object to the game and claim, &quot;This is the same as the old one!&quot; This is actually completely false. There are many differences between the new and old. First, the obvious. The graphics have greatly improved. Characters are now much more detailed, and items, which used to be paper flat and blurry, are now three-dimentional. Also, since there are tons more courses and characters, I have no idea how anyone can say this is merely a repeat. There are also new modes to play such as adventure, (SMALL SPOILERS) All Star, objective, and many new multiplayer modes such as giant, tiny, invisible, lightning, coin, Slo-Mo, Camera, and some more. There are also trophies to collect, about over 300, as a matter-of-fact. Overall, if you said this is the same as the old, you are severely incorrect.P.S. My name is a joke, obviously!

Every map is so darn small. Some small maps are good but every single map feels like a hamster cage.Spec Ops missions are good fun and some add to the story.

Anyways after playing a few hours of both the campaign and multiplayer each, I can report the pure epicness of both! The single player is short but sweet, however the biggest reason people are here THE MULTIPLAYER. This is the most refined and best running/looking/playing multiplayer yet. Imagine the good and bad things about black ops and mw2 being stripped of the bad and combined with the good. It has a few new game modes like kill confirmed which keeps it interesting and seems to wean out campers and snipers. The game launches with SEVERAL maps 15-17 I believe which is awesome. The game also features a spec ops mode returning from modern warfare 2 and call of duty's take on the gears of war 3 popular hoard mode which is fun!

The campaign is good but not great , the multiplayer is the absolute worst of any call of duty ever released. If another Modern Warfare is released it will be a no go for me until I rent it and try it first. for me and most of my friends its back to Black ops and another years wait to see what Treyarch has to offer. I really cant believe I am writing this negative review for a call of duty game because I have loved all the others. I guess they all cant be great and a flopper had to come eventually. I am really dissapointed I droped 60 bucks on this. If you like MW1, World at war, MW2, and Black ops save your money and continue to play those because any one of those are better games than this. If you have never bought or played a Call of duty game I recomend Call Of Duty Black ops. one last thing, I checked to see how many people were online with MW3 today and only saw 175,560 then checked black ops and it had 365,450.

The PS3 normally sells for $299 so if you can get it for $199-$249 or with a gift card then you will be getting a great deal. This bundle includes two games. The Last of Us is one of the greatest games of this entire generation- if not of all time. Batman: Arkham Origins is a step down from the two previous games but still a good title in my opinion. Just be aware that these games are not rated for kids so keep this in mind if you are shopping for a younger child.The PS3 itself is a good system with a vast library of games to play. The only thing that bothers me is that this particular version has the lowest build quality of all the PS3 models. It feels cheaper, especially around the door which opens when you want to put a game disc in the system. This version of the PS3 is also a bit noisy. It is nothing too distracting but it is a little disappointing after the excellent build quality of the previous two versions. That said, this is the only model of the PS3 that is currently being produced so if you want a new PS3 then it is a moot point. At this stage of the system's life span you're best bet is to buy a bundle like this, get a very good sale price or preferably both. Just be aware that the PS4 is available now and support for the PS3 will begin to decline.I would say that anybody who wants a new PS3 now should consider this bundle as I believe it is the best value out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

The narrative and art design is highly unique and even as someone pretty overdosed and jaded on the genre trappings, I found it surprisingly engaging and downright interesting.Fun character growth, simple and straight forward magic and melee, lots of REALLY inventive encounters.Visuals have a nice color tone, good art direction, but it is ultimately a bit Playstation 2.5-esque. Music is just wonderful, probably my favorite soundtrack of the generation thus far.Ultimately, it's a rough around the edges title, but ultimately when the chips come down, does anyone really care if it's not as perfectly polished and presented? This completely nonsensical focus on the most ridiculous aspects of visual appeal is what's causing the console market to hemorrhage developers and money like it has been lately.Anyhow, kudos to Square on the publish and support.

As most of you know(who've read my reviews, anyways); I've been a Twisted Metal fan since the early days of the PSone. I've owned, practically, every game at some point and have loved every single one.Given that Twisted Metal 3&4(developed by 989 Studios)tarnished the Twisted Metal name somewhat, Incognito Entertainment(now called Eat, Sleep, Play) decided to bring Twisted Metal back in style for the PS2. Thing is, Twisted Metal: Black bears no resemblance to the games that have come before it. Except for the core gameplay and the characters returning, Twisted Metal:Black is a darker, more violent beast. I have to say, this new beast intrigues me. However, if you're coming into Black expecting it to be a walk in the park, well-my friend, you're going to be unpleasantly surprised. Things have changed drastically in the TM universe. The levels you battle in are massive, The game is faster and more responsive.

The game requires quite a lot of stealth and I really missed having the ability to save when I wanted, rather than at pre-defined checkpoints. This would have dropped the game to 4 stars, were it not for the fact that this game plays flawlessly without issue on my system. I can't remember the last game that I played without a crash or hitch, so my hat is off to the excellent standard of software engineering and artwork put into this game.It isn't a sandbox, and the route through the game is fixed, so you do miss that feeling of freedom. However, if this had been a sandbox game, it would have challenged that heady throne taken by Fallout 3. There is a lot of tension in the game, from the heavy breathing and swift attacks made by the monsters, to the need to find respirator apparatus to survive certain areas. There are a number of tactics that you can employ, such as extinguishing lights, using silent weapons and even shooting off the respirators from your opponents that adds lots of extra dynamics to play.I obtained the game directly from Steam, and I do have very mixed feelings about using Steam. They have a licensing model that allows them the luxury to completely rid you of all your games with impunity. Whilst I doubt they would do that, most large companies have no sense of benevolence where money is to be made, so I am expecting the draconian grip of control to start squeezing tighter by Steam, once they feel they have secured sufficient market share. It's an inevitable \"evil\" where large companies are concerned, despite the better wishes of their employees, I suspect.You take a risk using Steam, but where the quality of this game is concerned, it is money well spent.

This game took all the mistakes of the first installment and fixed every one of them. There is actually a nice amount of customization for the armor and weapons. There is now 3 respawns in terrorist hunt and the graphics have been improved nicely. The campaign is based on XP that unlocks different armor classes and camos during the campaign, and you can use your XP online. The only gripe I have is that you can't transfer you data, I have to swap in my old hard drive to play it.Presentation- The game has some pretty cool menus showing off your uniforms. The graphics are great, but a few cut scenes would have helped the story. The music is epic as always and the enemy dialogue is still pretty entertaining. 4.5/5Graphics- The graphics were a nice improvement in this installment. They are crisp and overall pretty well done. The uniforms are elaborate and every seam in your vest is shown with great clarity. The guns are also pretty well done. Overall the game has a great look. 4.5/5Game play- Everything that was wrong with the first one was fixed for the sequel. There are some pretty sweet upgrades in guns and uniforms. The change of camos is pretty cool. The addition of the XP system is a great way to get you to play the game. Also the lack of respawns in the terrorist hunt is now fixed with three lives per match. The levels are also a lot better. There are about as many missions as the first, but these are more memorable. This game overall is 1st/3rd person shooting at its finest. 4.5/5Story- This is a story of betrayal. It is a pretty good one. I didn't understand some of it as I didn't remember the story from the first one. Some cutscenes would have been nice to add a movie feel to it, but that seems to be a problem in a lot of games. 4/5Lasting Appeal- This game has an online that is pretty well done, along with some addicting co op adventures, and a level up single player. You keep playing the game in order to rank up and unlock more items to use on your character. 5/5The Verdict: This game was a great sequel it fixed almost everything that plagued the original and was one wild ride.

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Another hit in the series","reviewText":"Zelda being one of the best Nintendo franchises (if not the best), this was a must play game for me. After finishing story and optional quests (50 PLUS HOURS), here is what I think.PROS.PLENTY OF DUNGEONS:  Just like previous Zelda games, this consists of a big world map and then plenty of dungeons in the world map. As the story progress, you will have access to different dungeons and as you make your way through different dungeons, you will encounter different enemies, obtain different items and finally fight a major boss. However, things are not as repetitive as it sounds. The story does very good job motivating you why you should go through each dungeon, plus, between the dungeon you are required to and also you have an option to do many different things (see below for more details)WOLF/HUMAN GAMEPLAY: So as you may know, in this game you can turn into a wolf (more like you are forcefully turned into this creature in the beginning). To progress through the story (and to get access to different dungeons), you are required to do perform tasks at both human and a wolf. In the beginning of the game, this may feel a bit redundant; however, as you go forward (say about finishing first three dungeons), this will actually become fun. Both being human and wolf has their own advantages for both in combat and accessing different areas and this game will challenge you to successfully use your abilities both as wolf and human to progress through the game.WEAPONS AND GADGETS: As many of you may know, Zelda games are famous for weapons and gadgets you get to use. This game is no exception. As you progress through the story, especially when you go to different dungeons, you will get access to different gadgets. Boy these gadgets are fun to use. Creative use of gadgets is required to solve many puzzles in many dungeons, beat bosses and get secret treasures.BOSSES: There are plenty of sweet bosses in this game. As mentioned above, each dungeon will contain one major boss. Some dungeons have two major bosses. On top of them, there are also bosses outside of dungeon gameplay. So if you are like me and enjoy beating bosses in games, then you will love this game. Also as mentioned above, YOU WILL HAVE TO use your gadgets and human/wolf ability creatively to overcome these bosses. While earlier bosses may seem pushover, later bosses are more fun.VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY AND MINIGAMES: As mentioned above, you will be playing both as human and wolf. On top of that the story and side quests will also introduce you to different type of gameplay, such as horse riding, kayaking, swimming over and underwater, riding big birds, riding boars (slightly different than riding boars). Honestly, I love games that provide you with so many different types of experiences.SWORD AND SHIELD PLAY WITH WII MOTE: While not perfect, different moves you can do with Wii mote for using sword and shield work 90% of the time. Some moves will feel cooler than the other.LOTS AND LOTS OF SECRET ITEMS: There are hundreds and hundreds of hidden items throughout the game, some more useful than others of course. If you are a completionist, you will love hunting for these hidden treasures. And as mentioned above, creative use of gadgets truly makes this treasure hunting experience enjoyable.STORY: The game has a decent story with some what of a suspense to it. Can't describe much without spoiling it.CONS.FISHING WITH WII MOTE: Dear lord, THIS IS SO ANNOYING. To those who actually fish may find it fun, but I don't fish and I don't find it fun.  Unfortunately, there are two places in the story where you are required to fish and I find that experience torturing and horrible. If you want to get all the secret items, you will have to fish more.WII VERSION UPDATE: As you may know this game was originally created for gamecube. It was pretty sweet how they made sword and shield control with wii mote, but I wish they had done more in terms of improving graphics. While wii is not known for its graphics, some games like Metroid Other M and Super Mario Galaxy look pretty awesome on it. So if they wanted, they certainly could have done better job.CONCLUSIONSo other than fishing and graphics, this was pretty much a perfect game for me. People who like action adventure, THIS GAME IS A MUST.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

Very fun, great combos, the game is short, so you can beat the Arcade in less than 1 hour. The story mode both for MK (7 chapter) and DC (8 chapters) can be beaten each in around 2 hours. Very good for achievements and quick way to increase your gamer scrore. If you are a true MK fan you will not be dissapointed. Even if you beat the game, you still need to beat it and master each and every of the MK and DC characters. 17 hit+ combos with Flash really cool","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2010"}

Took the chance anyways and boy am I glad. I'm simply loving this game! I dunno why people rated this so poorly. The controls handle smoothly, the game looks great and supports widescreen, the story is awesome, the cast is cool, it's packed with above average speed action. I'm having fun all the way through. I've seen alot of new school cats who don't know about their gaming roots talk about how they messed it up by not making it a first person shooter. Oh please lol. I've been playing Metroid since the NES and let me tell ya, it was NEVER a FPS. Metroid was a 2D side-scroller. Only the Prime series adopted this FPS crap and to me, it ruined the game if anything. Anyone who knows where Metroid came from would love this game. You other guys should stick to Call of Duty. Don't get me wrong, I've played the Primes and it's good, but don't talk like that was Metroid's style. They've gone back to 3rd person gameplay and thank god! That FPS stuff doesn't appeal to everyone, they just made the game the way it was suppose to be originally. They even added in some FPS action into the mix which feels great. I've missed seeing Samus' entire body as she sprints and flips, dodges and battles. Prime pretty much destroyed that but it's back and it's better than ever!Another thing people have a problem with is the fact that this game actually has a story line lol. C'mon, seriously? They believe that Samus should just be this dark mysterious mute without a past, present or future as long as she's blowing stuff up. Again with the Call of Duty mind set. Samus isn't a robot, she's a girl in a suit for crying out loud. A GIRL. If you don't expect some sort of tenderness or frailness underneath that mask, you're in the wrong room. Go make a Rambo version of the game and play it instead. The story doesn't make her come across as a wuss, it just shows that even the toughest warriors are human just like everyone else, and have the same worries and problems. I'm very happy they shed light on Samus in this game. She never says it out loud, so she's still the strong silent type, they're just finally telling you what she's been thinking. She has more reason to pull the trigger in this game. Go out and get it people, it's a wonderful game, ESPECIALLY if you haven't played any Metroid game before, or haven't played any Metroid Primes to confuse your perception of what a Metroid game is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E5OE","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Another solid effort with different issues","reviewText":"Each and every August the video gaming public is treated to the new Madden football game for the year, and with just as much consistent frequency, the game is presented with a few tweaks, a few screw-ups, and a few totally useless add-ons.  Madden 2012 is no different, and for the most part the game works great with a few glaring mistakes.What works well for Madden 2012 is, thankfully, the actual gameplay.  EA always attempts to throw new gimmicks at us with each new installment, but thankfully a lot of the updating and improvements rests with the mechanics of the actual game experience.  The first noticeable attribute is the tackling and blocking.  Never has Madden been more realistic in this area with the players following all the way through with their blocks and tackling completely on the player with the ball.  The animations and movements are very fluid and realistic for the most part, and when you make a tackle on someone he will fall the way it feels like he should.  Gone are the clipping and magnet-like actions of tackling where a defender would somehow sidestep five guys with one breath and make an incredible tackle amidst a gang of six players.  This is something entirely new for the franchise, and though it took some getting used to, it definitely is a feature that is most welcome.Another facet of Madden that has been improved upon from last year are the receivers keeping both feet in bounds for the catch.  Last year's Madden did a fine job of correcting the age-old annoyance of players running out of bounds to make a catch, and this year Madden has made it even better and more realistic.Graphically, the game is marginally better than last year, but Madden 2011 looked great anyway, so the slight improvements really look polished.  The reflections in the helmets, the facial expressions, and the on field movements and footwork look very detailed and extremely realistic.  When Desean Jackson scored a touchdown against me and they showed his face close up, I was stunned at how accurate he looked.  Really good work.Most of the features from last year are still here such as the deep franchise mode and the option to use the Gameflow system or conventional play-calling.  For those who don't know, Gameflow is basically when the computer calls your plays for you.  This feature is useless to me as I only play Madden to be my own creative self, but thankfully it's just an option.Something that has marred all Madden games in the past is the ability of the computer to come back in the third quarter and slaughter your offense.  With old Madden's, the game would become possessed if you got a lead on the computer in the third quarter, and it would simply cheat in order to even up the score.  That doesn't happen with Madden 2012, and it's yet another cool attribute that has changed this year.  Another annoyance that is gone is the action of throwing ridiculous interceptions whilst getting sacked.  In Madden 2011, if you were in the process of getting sacked the ball would shoot into the air and, of course, into the arms of a waiting defender.  It would never go into your hands, always the defense.  Moreover, it was totally unrealistic.  In Madden 2012, when you get sacked, you get sacked.  No balls shooting into the air, and no CPU's taking advantage of weird developer placed glitches.Despite so many things that make Madden 2012 such a highly playable experience, there are some brand new issues that have made themselves evident, and it will really make you wonder if the Madden franchise will ever be able to get everything right.One of the maddening things this game franchise does, every single year, is spend far too much time making changes to peripheral things that no one cares about.  The kick meter, for instance.  Every single year the developers feel it's necessary to change the kicking meter in some way.  Why do this?  Are people really clamoring for a new kick meter each year?  This year's kick meter is the worst it's been for years, as well.  It starts off slow, then goes fast, then slows down again, with the gauge being this weird crescent-moon shaped orb which makes it slightly difficult to tell what the hell is going on.  The kicking meter was perfect two years ago.  A straight bar across, push the buttons, and you're golden.  Instead, the developers are obsessed with changing it, AGAIN.Madden 2012 is unique, though, for its introduction of some new and improved problems to go with the new improvements.  The first issue you'll run into is the clunky play-calling process.  In the past, when you selected a play, then changed your mind and went to a different formation, your previous entry would still be selected for you to more easily navigate.  This year, if you want to go backwards in the play-calling setup, it will take you back to the top of the play-calling system making it tedious and time-consuming to get back to where you were in the first place.  For instance, if you call the shotgun formation, then navigate halfway down the list to the \"spread\" execution, then change your mind and go back to the shotgun formation, it will take you to the top of the shotgun formation instead of leaving you at the \"spread\" execution.  Every single Madden in the past would take you right back to where you were before you called a play, but now you have to thumb through all the options a second time.  With the play clock moving, this can get really annoying.Another odd thing about the new Madden is waiting for the computer to take kicks.  When the CPU scores and comes in to make an extra point, a full ten seconds will crawl by before the CPU actually makes the kick.  Hurry up and kick already!  What's the holdup?Another pointless addition this year is the on-field intros to the players and such.  Yes, it makes it more realistic, but does anyone really care about this?  I find it hard to believe that many Madden players are jonesing for new intros and fanfare to their favorite video game football team.And, once again, the commentary is no less than awful.  It's intriguing to think of why EA can never seem to get this issue right, but the commentary is, as always, late, pointless, and completely ingratiating.  Chris Collinsworth's snarky delivery has always been amusing and entertaining, but Gus Johnson has got to go.  The guy is just terrible.  One of the typical things he'll say is \"he caught that for the first down, didn't he???\"  Uh, yeah, genius.  Are you watching the same game I am?  One of the most irritating things Johnson will do is get all excited about absolutely NOTHING AT ALL.  Yeah, yeah, I know that's his schtick, but gimme a break already.  He'll say things like, \"THIRD DOWN AMD SIX TO GOOOOOOOOO\" or just make sounds like a barn animal.  Wow, really?  You're gonna get excited about that?  Keeping my fingers crossed that EA will axe his completely useless behind.  More than that, though, the commentary is just late.  You'll throw an 80 yard touchdown bomb, but if Collinsworth and Johnson are busy rambling on about something completely irrelevant they will stop at nothing in order to finish their aimless diatribes.  The most exciting commentary you'll hear is when the CPU makes a great play.  This only proves that the CPU knows what it's going to do before you do, making it kind of tough to follow along with the commentary.Without question, the biggest annoyance with Madden 2012 is the superhuman ability of every opposing middle linebacker you will face throughout your season.  You will soon learn, after playing three or four games against the CPU, that you will not be playing against defenses, but playing against one single middle linebacker who will block every other pass, make every other tackle, and make amazing glimpses into the future and call each and every route your receiver runs.  You'll be amazed with what each MLB, regardless of skill level, is able to accomplish: jumping five feet in the air to make an interception, one-handed grabs, one-armed tackles, and just the general ability to suss out whatever it is you'll be doing.  I had called a slant play and the hot route was to the slot receiver.  The MLB slowly crept over to the slot guy, knowing he would be the hot route.  I called an audible to my running back, and all of a sudden the MLB crept over to the left to cover the route of the running back to the other side.  How would the MLB know this?  Quite simply, he wouldn't.  This is the single biggest drawback of the game this year in that, no matter what you call, you have to be ready to take on the MLB.  He will just omnipotently KNOW what you're up to.  What this indicates to me is that the computer obviously knows what you're calling and the code writers of the game have heaped all of the defensive challenges on one player.  That's all fine and dandy, but when you're taking on one player instead of an entire defense it gets very unrealistic.  It seems as if the developers have done this to make the game more of a challenge, and while this game is the most challenging it's been in quite some time, it makes these changes in trade of realism.  When you check the stats at the end of the game, the opposing MLB will have 30 tackles, an interception, and a sack.  Kind of ridiculous.When all is said and done, there is much to like about Madden 2012.  I would give this game three and half stars if I could, but I think three stars would be too harsh in light of Amazon's rating system.  What ultimately rings true about this game is that it can't decide where exactly it's going.  It's trying really hard to appeal to the hardcore Madden pros, like myself, by making it more challenging and less flashy.  At the same time, it really wants to woo new amateurish fans by including things like Gameflow and adding useless peripherals like extended team intros and highly annoying commentary that would only be helpful to an 8-year-old.  It's trying too hard to be something for everyone and cutting corners to get there.  Any Madden fan is going to see that Madden 2012 is a slight step backwards for the franchise despite some nice improvements.  One thing EA needs to learn is that you don't always have to make changes to something that already works.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2011"}
