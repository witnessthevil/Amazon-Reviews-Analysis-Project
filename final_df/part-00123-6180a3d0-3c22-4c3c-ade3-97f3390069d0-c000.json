Perfect in its portability.  A great bargain in that you and several friends can race - wirelessly - on only one game cartridge.  The game features all of the beloved characters from Mario's world.  The on track \"pick-ups\" and hazards are all there.  If you've played and enjoyed this game on any of the living room consoles, you'll get a real kick out of the portable version as well.  My wife and I enjoy playing the game as much as my son does.Nintendo has some sure fire hits, and this is one of them to be sure.  The longer you play the more tracks you'll unlock, which just adds to the fun.  There are re-imagined classics and brand new offerings, too.  Lots of re-playability.

{"product_name":"B001YI0Z2U","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Mind-blowing!","reviewText":"This is a game that almost passed me by completely.  I had played the demo and was entertained by the over-the-top main character and the frantic combat, but I didn't think this game was worth full price.  Exactly 4 days before writing this I picked it up, and I'm so glad I did.  Bayonetta is one of the best games I've played this gaming generation!It's important to note that this game contains features that may not appeal to most players.  Button-mashing? Check!  (More on this later)  Jazzy J-pop music during fight scenes? Check!  Overt and gratuitous sexuality (not sex)?  Check!  So if you're cool with those, then read on.At the beginning of the game, it's difficult to know what's going on.  You're a witch who wields four guns, one on each limb, and can attack with her hair at times.  She's sassy, she's sexy, and is really great at those double entendres and one-liners.  It's amusing.  But after the tutorial and the first couple of chapters, the game's true colors shine.  Behind all the flash, you will find a deep story, compelling characters, beautiful vistas, ethereal music and some of the most epic boss fights ever!  It definitely took me by surprise!As far as gameplay goes, it's a hack n slasher that's more similar to Devil May Cry than God of War.  The combat is very combo-based, but if you do the right combos Bayonetta can unleash several entertaining means of dispatching her foes.  She can conjure up ancient torture devices (such as an iron maiden) to throw her enemies in, for example.  In boss fights, she can do a devastating finishing move where her hair turns into a giant dragon.  Dodging attacks at the last second results in \"Witch Time\", where everything slows down but you.  Quick-time events are thrown in there too, but not too often.  Most levels involve the player controlling Bayonetta through various locales, but every once in a while the game will change things up and have you riding a motorcycle through the streets, or flying through the air.  There are five difficulty levels, and if you play on Very Easy or Easy, the combat is defaulted to \"Auto\".  This means that you can simply press the X, Y and B buttons in any order you wish, and Bayonetta will automatically unleash any string of attacks.  This is the best way to play if you want to just watch the story and also be able to witness Bayonetta's best attacks without effort.  Essentially, mashing buttons FTW!  If you play on Normal or above, you have to actually execute all the attacks, and the combat becomes more strategic and less button-mashy.  It's entirely up to you.  Defeated enemies drop rings that look strikingly similar to those in Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega did publish this game, after all).  Rings can be used to buy techniques, accessories, weapons and items from the in-game shop.  There are many, MANY more things to buy than can possibly be bought in one playthrough, so completionists out there will want to play this many times.  Bayonetta will also run across little trinkets here and there that can be used to synthesize your own items.  Most entertaining are the small homages to other Sega games from the past...most obviously the original Space Harrier.  There's even a part that hearkens back to Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy!The story is surprisingly great, and the voice actors do a superb job at giving life to the characters...especially Bayonetta herself.  Luka is a pretty interesting person too, and the character of Cereza, who is a mysterious toddler that is integral to the story, is probably one of the cutest characters to grace a video game.  The story is told through traditional cutscenes, and also motion comics.  At the beginning of the game, the story may seem somewhat shallow, but as it goes on it becomes deep and enthralling.  The characters actually grow throughout the game and by the spectacular end they are quite different.  There are many more cutscenes than I originally thought.  While it's definitely not on the level of Metal Gear Solid games, some cutscenes are rather lengthy, especially near the end.  However, all are interesting.Technically, the game runs extremely well.  Full 60 frames per second with no framerate drops to be found on the 360 version.  The graphics are simply beautiful.  Some of the locations you visit are breathtaking...especially during the last few chapters. The boss design is incredible as the game goes for an evil angelic theme for the enemies.  Sound is great as well, with action scenes and battles bordering on sensory overload at times!  The game's score (when it's not a Japanese-inspired rendition of \"Fly Me To The Moon\") is atmospheric and ethereal, and really adds mood to the game.Before this game was released, many were skeptical about it.  Then the reviews came in, and skepticism became confusion at how this seemingly generic title can rate higher than, say, Final Fantasy XIII.  After playing it, it became perfectly clear to me why.  This game is pure entertainment, and I can't believe I almost missed out on it completely.  This is definitely worth trying and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fast-paced action games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2010"}

Now he's chasing them across the Game Boy Advance inCastlevania: Circle of the Moon. He'll use his trusty whip, as well as a few magical items, to combat Dracula and more than just a few foul minions. The game takes advantage of the GBA's rich color palette to create detailed, moody environments and intricate spell effects.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Recommended only for those with a GBA light.","reviewText":"This is the only game where the lack of a backlit screen on the GBA causes serious problems. Since Castlevania games are gothic horror, much of the action occurs at night. Without a steady light source, you are not likely to make it far. I seriously recommend this game only for people who have an attachable light. Otherwise, the game is frustrating because it is too dark.But if you get the light problem solved, this is as solid as any other Castlevania entry. It contains some of the magic and RPG elements of Symphony of the Night, and is a treat for any long-time fan of the series. The control is easy to manage, and the enemies are diverse. The same weapons, attributes, and items are available, and the gameplay is classic Castlevania. The backgrounds are nicely detailed, and despite the fact that the animation is choppy at best, the graphics stand out. This is Gameboy, let's not forget.If you can get past the obvious light problem, this is an enjoyable game that will satisfy on every levil. But please, to avoid disappointment, get the light.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2002"}

Mindless fun, but a nice bonus that can border on obsession.And....I have to be honest...there is part of me that lives for this sort of over-the-top, plain and simple shoot 'em up with flair....plus throwing in bullet time, acrobatic sword fights, wall running, & angel dives(just to name a few....)never hurts. The upgrades and arcade-like tally system for style/kill points works well; much like Red Dead Revolver, you get a score at the end of each scenario, and points depending how well you did. You can repeat the level to get a better score if you want...and you will.I was impressed how easily the controls flow once you get used to them; I can tell this will be a game worth repeating, as by the end of the first run, the controls will be second nature; then you can go thru it again and kick some serious butt. The controls do take a little getting used to, but eventually 2nd nature.I found elements of some of my favorite games in here....both good ones and guilty pleasures; Bloodrayne(the heaviest influence to me in this game...), Total Overdose, The Club, Samurai Western, Killer 7, Max Payne, POP, Ninja Gaiden, & Stranglehold...just to name a few. Plus the whole 'grindouse' look is great; there are some pretty funny little cut scenes in between......Somehow this works. Mindless but actually fun. And after coming off Fallout 3 for about 150 hours(sad, I know....), this is a welcome find.  Not for everyone, but def a grade A 'B Movie' style game....I did hit one frustrating part: The training near the beginning that had the timed target shooting while running thing; it took me a while to learn some of the movements as far as running up against walls, jumps, etc....it was mildly annoying but proved beneficial in the end as you will be def well versed in Rubi's abilities....If you are looking for a nice diversion that will offer you a lot of replay value, WET is something worth looking into. Try the demo on xBox live or on the PS3......if you like it, the game is mostly more of the same. But they keep the action fresh by continually throwing in new tricks, weapons, and upgrades for each level.This could have been a total disaster; But thankfully the developers knew what they wanted to do, and stuck to their guns(so to speak....). Fun, funny, bloody, stylistic, & well executed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2009"}

I was skeptic on buying this game because of all the complaints so i rented it, but now wont hesitate to make the purchase. I realized the only people that were crying and butt-hurt were people who wanted another sandbox game so they can put a 100hrs into this and explore under every nook and cranny, turn over every little rock they stumble upon. I guess i just dont have the time and or patience for that and get bored. This game is action packed, fast and stealthy. I have logged 6 1/2 hrs into it and im 53% through the single player campaign (thats super rushing through it since its a rental). I love how smooth the game plays, the arsenal of weapons is excellent and so are the upgrades. Graphics are top-notch as well as the sound.

I liked how you can play as nine different characters instead of just Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Gandalf is the best character becasue he can shoot power blast out of his staff. The levels really follow the book and the movie really well. They started the Hobbbits path with escape from Oglislith only because they wouldn't have had many other levels with them. The Black Gate is a great level and I'm so happy none of the orcs have sheilds besides the big ones. I was really disappointed that all four hobbits are basically the same and they're all pretty weak. I wish they had had Eomer in it because he's so cool. I also thought it was way too easy and you should probably and if you don't like to play games over and over well you wont like this one. The secret level stunk too. A good game but too easy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000KLNLUK","reviewerName":"Rodrigo Toledo","summary":"After a long time... but still surprised","reviewText":"Since i've heard of this game it looked attractive. But wasn't able to buy it, a lot of time after that I just saw it at $13 more or less, it was cheaper in other stores but I just simply prefer amazon's service. It came about one week after, by the way I live in Guatemala, and I was really really surprised. Not like an epic Metal gear of Uncharted of course, but actually a refressing one, and style of game. Also a lot of quality on it own.Graphics: Really impressed, textures really show themselves. The shadow of the character is really well done, a lot better than those pixelated ones from Call of duty games. A great special effects, feels great when someone throws a grenade at you.Sound: Voice acting is not the best, but does the job. Special effects, rock solid, specially on explosions. Music... according to the moment but nothing memorable.Control: Great, maybe few more actions are welcome but the way it is keep it simple and easy to jump in.Story:  So far solid, its not as sissy as I thought. It actually keeps you  waiting for the next portion to solve whats happening. Its simple.Style. Somehow it reminds me to Gears of War, but somehow to uncharted too whis is better, its not a shooter and thats great because there's too much shooters these days.Overall: This is not a 10 out of 10 game, maybe an 8 - 8.5 game. But its a satisfying one, its a game that really shines if you are not comparing it to those new classics. Its a game, that really entertains, it has issues, but nothing to bother at all. its an amazing price, its and amazing value, its different even when it takes things from other games it implements them great. The glave(weapon) is really fun stuff. Sad but I dont think its going to be a sequel, because it didn't sell well.Just give it a try, and try to not follow those who buy only hyped games, there tons of gems still to be discovered.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2009"}

Immerse yourself in the glorious chaos of all-out war, found only in Battlefield.","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Great Addition to the battlefield series","reviewText":"While narratives have never really been DICE's strong suit, Battlefield 4, the next entry in its popular series of shooters, at least takes things in the right direction. While Battlefield 3 delivered an incredibly boring campaign that bordered on dreadful at times, the new entry at least seems like it tried.The story is not wholly impressive. It features a villain with few defining qualities, apart from being a villain. He is talked about frequently, but only ever appears twice. The antagonist hails from China, rather than Russia as has been the tradition of late. Russia does appear as an enemy in the game, but it is brief. Luckily though, this game spends more time with China. As a result, it provides some exceptional graphical flair, like the night time panoramic visual splendour that is Shanghai.As to be expected, through the course of the story, pretty much everything that you come across explodes. It might be instant. It might already be in the process of doing so as you get to it. Sometimes it might take a while. Just know that it will explode. There are occasional breathers in between explosions, offering the opportunity for gorgeous visuals. Emotions and sad situations are thrown in too, but their effectiveness is spotty at best.The campaign offers varied locations, excellent level design, and looks pretty, but still manages to feel dated. Many of the set pieces are things that have already happened in other military shooters. One level in particular feels extremely similar to the stage in the Gulag in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Mainstays of the genre like stealth segments make appearances. Unfortunately, vehicle combat (a specialty of the series) is criminally underutilised in the campaign, only really offering one level for you to have a go with a tank.DICE has always been one of, if not the best, in the industry when it comes to audio design, and this title is no exception. While the game's score is okay, it doesn't really add anything to the experience. The audio design, however, is astounding. Buildings falling apart. Towers toppling over. Distant pops of gunfire. It has never sounded better, and is one of the strongest aspects of the game.If we're going to be honest, though, people don't really play Battlefield for its campaign. There's one thing that has kept this series around this long: the multiplayer. And there is a clear-cut winner between the generations. While the PlayStation 3 version feels like an iterative jump forward, the next-gen version of Battlefield feels, well, next-gen. The game can now accommodate the same number of players as the PC (64 in select playlists), and the visuals come close to matching high-end PCs. In particular, the lighting on the PlayStation 4 is truly incredible.The multiplayer component is exceptional, offering a widely expanded array of weapons and gadgets to work with. Re-tooling of progression, such as being awarded new weapons by getting kills with other weapons of a similar type speeds up the process. The new interface for class customization thrives. While not perfect, it makes everything more readily visible. It offers a great step forward from Battlefield 3, which had a time consuming, cluttered interface.New vehicles, new locales, and new maps abound, offering a nice variety of new toys to play with. Map design has always been one of the series' strongest areas, and Battlefield 4 indicates that this trend will be continuing for the foreseeable future.A nice feature making a return is Commander Mode, which has been absent since 2006's Battlefield 2142, in which each team has a &#34;commander&#34; who micromanages the entire battlefield, pointing out enemies to the team, keeping their troops in supply, or launching tomahawk missiles at the battlefield.Series mainstays like Rush, Conquest, and Air Superiority make returns (as expected), alongside more classic playlists like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Territories (Domination), and Capture the Flag. Joining these game modes are newcomers Obliteration and Defuse. Obliteration is a neutral bomb game type that offers a quicker pace than some of Battlefield's slower options. Meanwhile, Defuse is an infantry only playlist in which there is no respawn. This playlist seems to encourage camping, and all-in-all isn't terribly fun, especially for a game like Battlefield. Series mainstays like Rush are the best option, especially given the support for 64 players, which drastically improves the experience.Unfortunately at launch, the multiplayer is full of issues. Some game types are completely inaccessible, while some are only accessible by a few gamers, creating pitifully small lobbies. Others, meanwhile, function normally. Conquest only works on occasion, for example, whereas Team Deathmatch performs without issue consistently. DICE has acknowledged these issues, and is actively working on fixing them, promising a week of Double XP as an apology.The fact remains that, in spite of these issues, Battlefield can pride itself on being able to offer a lot more depth than many of its competitors, and brings with it some features that you can't experience in quite the same way anywhere else. This comes in the form of &#34;Levolution&#34;, the phrase coined to describe the dynamic changes that can occur on the maps mid-game, such as players bringing a rather large skyscraper down in the middle of the game, or obliterating a dam, and having the destruction subsequently flood the lower portion of the map, allowing you to swim through areas that you had previously been walking through. The system works beautifully, and offers some truly dynamic, map altering 'wow' moments, that would be worth just sitting there watching if it didn't mean that you would probably get your head shot off.ConclusionA lacklustre campaign shouldn't stand in your way of experiencing Battlefield 4's top of the line multiplayer. While it can't quite shake the feeling of being an iterative entry in the series rather than truly revolutionary, it does enough new things, and sees the return of enough fan favourites that it shouldn't go unnoticed. Next-gen visuals and 64-player online combat mean that if you don't want to sink money into a high-end PC, this is without a doubt the best way to play DICE's latest destructive hit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001QXNBNI","reviewerName":"Joey Joe Joe Jr S. \"high flyer\"","summary":"BFBC2","reviewText":"I love this game. There I said it, Battle Field Bad Company 2 is an absolutely amazing shooter. Yeah it has its detractors who complain about \"hit recognition\" and \"camp zones\" but if you know how to move and check your angles on a map you can engage most any opponent. I did not experience issues with being immediately shot after spawning, that rarely happens in this game as the spawn points are relatively safe and out of the action without being too far away. The online multiplayer is absolutely awesome, the perfect blend of strategic shooting (Counterstrike) and run n gun shooting (Call of Duty), I like how the game is designed to compliment either playing style resulting in a very \"strategic\" or \"frantic fast paced\" game feel that is up to you to define based on your personal style. It also really hits that sweet spot with how many shots it takes to put down your enemy, it takes just enough shots to put them down, unlike games like Halo where you are duking it out forever and everyone swarms on you, not that I don't like Halo because that series is cool too. It is just a different style of game, where if you really are on the money play wise you can rack up a bunch of satisfying kills very quickly. Also the ragdoll physics are the absolute BEST I have ever seen, the way that people react to shots, grenades etc. is incredible, I have seen some random kills that looked so realistic it took my breath away literally. And of course you have heard about the destructible environments, this further restricts camping, and makes for some really fun engagements, someone sniping out a window? Engage them with the grenade launcher out the bottom of your M-16A2, blow up the wall, switch back to machine gun, then mow them down as they try and escape. AWESOME! Some of the most distinct shooter thrills I have ever experienced are to be found in this game, the campaign is really polished as well. I highly suggest Battle Field Bad Company 2.

I found the GoTY version and the normal version for the same price of $29.99 at gamestop brand new!  the funny thing is, right next to it they had the used version for $44.99 still, $15 more then the brand new ones!This isn't just a Call of Duty World at War Zombie mode revamped...even though the premises is nearly the same there is four people, and if you don't have 4 players to play the 4 survivors then the remaining survivors will be OP'd by computers.  In the multiplayer mode you can be the zombies (the special zombies with super moves).  The only thing that i didn't really like about this game which others may have liked is that there is no story mode at all.  The weapons aren't extensive at all in this game.  You can either have the pistols, shotguns, sniper rifle, or uzi.  theres some health packs, pills, molotovs, and grenades. to me, this was just a renter after a week or two of playin this game just became pretty boring and repeptitive.theres only 4 main maps that the survivors fight their way through 4 or 5 stages of the map to get to the end where they will try to be evacuated.  its the same story on every map! i gave this 4 stars because 5 stars would just be overatin the game and 3 stars doesn't do it all justice, but know this i wont be buying or playing the sequel because unless they add a storymode or drastic changes all a sequel could be for this game is just a big expansion.**Edit**DO NOT buy this with the $59.99 price tag its cheaper at gamestop for $29.99","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2009"}

I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called \"Additions\" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG. By that time you'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG's should be compared against. Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times, even the worst FF is better than this. I don't think I'll play this one again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Great free roaming... but sparse landscape?","reviewText":"Red Faction Guerrilla offers the player a great experience exploring on mars. Obviously influenced by GTA and Volition's own Saints Row franchise, the game plays similar to most other free roaming games where you have a central set of missions to complete and sub missions which give you better weapons to aid with the main mission storyline. Most missions can be completed in any order and as you do them more of mars becomes accessible to you to reveal new challenges.The look of Mars seems to be created faithfully (as best as I can discern from nasa Mars Rover pics), and indeed as you travel from one 'zone' to the next the developers have attempted to offer a variety in the graphics so it's not all orange mountain lumps. Unfortunately the variety just isn't interesting enough to sustain the entire game, especially on EOS which is supposed to be an advanced city but in-fact looks like a dirty quarry with the same blue walkways repeated over and over again.Of course, the much touted destruction is stunning, with entire buildings collapsing almost brick by brick as you hack away with your sledgehammer... and as you destroy them small pieces of 'salvage' (the game's currency) pop out. The salvage pieces seem out of place graphically though with an almost 'mario game' type feel - think gold coins popping out of a headbutted brick. They glisten too - ugh.The vehicle handling also has its problems. I never liked Saints Row's vehicle handling with its digital gas and brake, and thankfully in RFG there's at least analog acceleration, but there's a huge delay in between the time you turn and when the wheels move. I'd say it's quarter of a second. If you hit RB so you can see from the front of the vehicle and then move the left stick the delay is obvious. Why? Don't know, but it makes for lots of bouncy driver induced oscillation moments which can be frustrating especially on timed missions.So it looks like this review is all negatives. No, not at all. Despite its flaws I loved the game, even taking into account the god-awful final mission (you'll know what I mean when you get to it), and would definitely recommend RFG to anyone who likes these sorts of free roamers.Tonnes of fun and oodles to do. It's a great, entertaining game well worth the money especially at the current price point - which ultimately is what it's all about right?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

The graphics are very top-notch and the environments are beautifully detailed with a great soundtrack. I have only one complaint though. The leveling system is quite awkward. Instead of simply leveling up, you gain stats, and I have a hard time telling if my characters are ready to defeat a certain boss because of this, but this doesn't mean that I dislike the game, in fact, this is one of the better RPGs I have played, it would just have been nice to be able to level up normally.

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Spirituality meets Scifi?","reviewText":"Xenosaga is a fun game. Almost on par with it's predecessor Xenogears, Namco did a great job. I'm glad they revived the series with something new. As for the other two sequels that go to this game... Uuummm.... No comment. But if you're looking for a little something to pass the time give this a whirl. It's one of a kind! On a side note this game has a few Bible references. One of the most memorable ones is straight out of the book of revelations \"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.\" Also there's a character who has a mark on his right hand labeled 666, he is known to be manufactured in a lab according to the game. Also there's a few crosses you'll notice here and there. One is Peters cross (Upside Down) in a church at one point of the game. Also there's another church that has the Catholic Cross with Jesus on it.Why would Namco put all this in a Scifi game? Beats me. Maybe the director is spiritual or maybe the crew felt Christianity would be something that would survive all the way to a Scifi setting thousands of years from now. Who knows? Just want to put that out there for anyone of the Christian faith. Ok, moving on.*Some things I enjoyed that aren't seen in too many RPGs nowadays*-Voice Acting, They must have hired on a bunch of Hollywood actors because it's just amazing. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and even get the creeps!-Sidequests and a few mini games. A lot of game companies seem to have forgotten what makes a great game these days. Things to do besides the main quest that award the player. Xenosaga is huge on this concept, there's even mini games that are 2 player, so grab a friend.- Soundtrack!!  Type in \"Miracle Xenosaga\" in youtube search. You've most likely heard this tune somewhere and it's definitely one of the best written pieces of music in gaming next to Sephiroth's theme. This game has a great soundtrack. Although there's no music playing in towns or battlefields. Lot's of silence, but when there is music lookout. It's going down!-The Battle System is fresh and doesn't stray too far from Xenogears. Which makes this an epic winning in my book. They just added more to it like enemies on screen, skills you can learn, ether attacks, special attacks. Also there's still the feature to fight in a G.E.A.R (AGWS) on the field which rocks.Overall it's a pretty awesome game, I didn't care much for the next two installments. Maybe I'll try them again in the future, but Xenosaga by itself stands strong as an RPG! Enough said.Happy Gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000088KH3","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Addictive, intense and fun!","reviewText":"Of all the games that have ever spun off a movie, Enter the Matrix is definitely one of the best I've played in quite some time.  Although the game was a bit over-hyped, it is in no way a bad game.  In fact, its one of the most addictive and entertaining games I've played in a while.First off, one of the most interesting parts is the fact that the game was actually produced and supervised by the Wachowski Brothers.  With movie footage shot exclusively for the game using the real actors, the game's story is conveyed clearly and with excellent production values.  The story is actually a side-story to the Matrix Reloaded, so everything that occurs during this game does in fact affect the plot of the movie.  While you won't necessarily have to play the game to understand the movie, the game does help to explain alot of things from the film.You get to play as either Niobe(Jada Pinkett) or Ghost(Anthony Wong), the crew of the Logos.  Each character has a different path through the game, with different levels and cut-scenes exclusive to the character, making for some high replay value.  As the game progresses, you learn more of your character's backstory and their relationships with other characters, which is an interesting aspect.  Other characters, such as The Merovingian, the Twins, Cain and Able, Persephone and even Trinity and the rest of the crew make an appearence.As for the game itself, the action is intense.  If you see it done in the movie, you can do it in the game, everything from rebounding off the wall to deliver a roundhouse to your victim's face to cartwheeling around bullets while firing your guns to kicking your fallen enemy about 20 feet away from you, sending them sliding across the floor.  Using the 'Focus' button slows down time(ala 'Bullet Time' from Max Payne), allowing you to perform more lethal martial arts moves and throws, perform greater leaps and acrobatics, and giving you a distinct advantage in gunplay and other combat situations.  The hand-to-hand combat is arguably the game's strongest point...I had so much fun on certain levels that I replayed them several times over.  The amount of interaction with the surrounding environment is very high, and makes the more intense hand to hand fights (such as boss fights or the Merovingian's chateau) much more enjoyable.  I can honestly say I had more fun with the hand-to-hand combat in this game than I have in any fighting game that's come out in the last few years, and that's saying alot!Other modes of gameplay involve driving.  These segments are not quite as fun as the regular action game, since they can be pretty frustrating.  The physics on the cars are pretty bad.  Depending on which character you choose, you will be either shooting or driving, though sometimes the roles will be reversed.  The 'flying' portion of the game, in which you get to pilot the Logos, is somewhat more enjoyable than the car driving scenarios, but can still be pretty frustrating at times.  Depending on which character you choose, you will either be piloting(Niobe) or manning the guns(Ghost).A great extra feature is the 'Hacking' mini-game, which allows you to unlock more features in the game, such as secret levels, more mini-games, cinematics, cheats, and other features such as allowing you to drop weapons into certain levels to use.  It takes a little while to learn but that's the fun of it.  Once you become good at it you'll find yourself unlocking tons of new things.Save points are frequent...while the game is not easy you will never end up making tons of progress only to have yourself killed in one of those typical overwhelming moments and losing all your progress.  It doesn't make the game easier, but it sure does beat the frustration factor down.  No need to worry about losing anything!Despite all the game's good elements, there are a few problems.  The graphics, especially for an XBox game, could be better.  They aren't bad at all, but they definitely don't push the power of the system.  Its not that big of a problem, but nitpickers will notice.  The game is a tad glitchy and the control is sometimes unresponsive, which can lead to frustrating accidental deaths.  The camera is a bit touchy as well.  It has a tendency to whip around suddenly or focus in an awkward position.  This is particularly annoying when you are trying to focus on a particular enemy, or when you want to watch the opponent you just kicked go flying out a window and it ends up focusing at a bizarre angle.  Other problems include just plain bad animation.  One particular example is in one of the earlier levels, where the objective is to shoot out the wheels of plane.  The animation is so blocky that it looks like it was done on the Nintendo 64 or PSOne.  The graphics during the car chase scenes also leave alot to be desired.Aside from that, the game itself is really alot of fun.  I see many complain that the game didn't live up to expectations...unfortunately people just hold too high of criteria for games lately.  Just because the game is based of the Matrix doesn't mean its going to be the Messiah of video games.  It's a very fun and addictive game, and that's all that matters to me.  So if you are a fan of the Matrix, get this game...the story alone is worth the price of admission, and I gaurantee you that you will have a good time playing.  Go into this game expecting the game of the year, and you'll be disappointed.  Go into this game expecting to have fun, and you'll be satisfied.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2003"}

It was the norm to have 5+ Mendoza's on the screen at the same time. Factor in chasing Baron Raymondo for map sections and you see how difficult it is to finish at an early age.Plus, as the difficulty increases, your crew gets unhappy quicker.Pirates! is the best pirate game I've played.Maybe the next one will let us actually play a Pirate :-)* not one single crash ... using XP/SP2* did notice ....> if you constantly cut short/skip the cutscenes, the sword fighting screens will load slower(...luckily, you get 3 sword exchanges before you input a move) ... saw no difference in seas battles","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2006"}

I said it.  Its true.I have played other installments of the franchise on my old, clunky, 1st gen PS2 and so when I saw that this was available for the PS3 I jumped on it like white on rice :)  Im really happy that I did.The feeling of sheer speed is there and amplified.  I feel like a racing stuntman when I play this game...it feels fast, dangerous, responsive, and real.  Not an easy feat with any game...but this one comes the closest so far.I like the fact that you dont have to waste any time with prelims, qualifiers, tutorials and such...this game just dumps you in a car and lets you find out the rest.  The learning curve is shallow and most people will love the \"pick-up-and-play\" aspect of Burnout: Paradise.The city is expansive and open, it feels like driving through something that could actually exist and I really enjoy finding the hidden paths, the numerous jumps and cool stuff like that scattered around the city.  Memorizing the race tracks takes a bit of time and makes you drive back to the start when you lose a race...but this is all logical and fits with the goals of the game.  How are you going to get top time without having seen the whole track?  It also features well into crashes (the best part of any Burnout Title) by helping you scout areas out and see the traffic patters and where you can maneuver...I thought I wouldnt like the removal of a map-marker/compass thingie (something to show you the way)...but I dont miss it at all.Im not happy with the lack of split screen two player mode, but I also know that this was most likely done so that you would need to go online to play against others.  Speaking of online play: I dont use the online features in the game, as I am usually a solo gamer, so this feature didnt really resonate one way or the other with me.  I am sure that others will be put off by it, but honestly, with most homes being wired now and most games venturing into online play...this shouldnt be more than a minor annoyance, certainly not one that deserves a demotation in \"star\" rating here at Amazon.com.The upgrades available to your license \"level\" are nice and keep one coming back for more and more...just to get the next goal.  And then the next one.  Honestly, it can be a quite addictive at times, lol.  But still a great addition to the game.Where Burnout has always shined, in my opinion, is in the ability to make a total mess out of you vehicle and everyone elses...its fun to crash stuff without fear of reprisal.  How cool would it be to go petal to the metal all out and smash into other stuff at over 80mph and walk away unscathed?  That why \"Showtime Mode\" (a replacement of Crash Mode in earlier titles) is so much fun.  Its great to be able to control the wreckage and send pieces flying in all directions...also a hefty testament to the physics engine and the detail and time put into making it feel real and not contrived.  Pull both trigger-like-buttons on the controller and crash to your hearts content...scatter wreckage like Johnny Appleseed did, well- apple seeds.Bottom line, this game is fun.  Its fast, addictive, easy to learn, has plenty of challenges to unlock, secrets to find and many different styles to play.  One of my personal faves?  Try to not crash into anything for the whole race...harder than it looks...sideswiping something just looks too tempting.One thing i would like to see someday...real cars.  The vehicles are inspired by some real-world counterparts, but I guess the manufactures wouldnt license their precious cars to a game that was going to subject them to untold scenes of brutality.  Minor tick of irritation, but something that will blip off the radar as you race past the other motorists with you eye on the finish line.  Great game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000TT4GBG","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Harmonix Delivers another Slam Dunk","reviewText":"Let me first admit that I'm a Guitar Hero fan. I adore playing all of the Guitar Hero games, and we have multiple guitars in the house (for multiple platforms) so that we can jam together. When Harmonix turned over Guitar Hero III to another company, I was really curious what they would choose to do next. I am THRILLED with the result - Rock Band, which combines together all the fun of singing karaoke, playing guitar (lead and bass) plus DRUMS!!!My boyfriend is in several bands, and he plays lead guitar, bass guitar and drums. I love to sing. So we have played many, many games in all of these genres (including the Donkey Kong Konga game which is surprisingly fun). We were quite interested to see how the Harmonix guys would merge these variety of instruments into a single game.First, the instruments. The guitar is FAR better than the guitars previously released for Guitar Hero. The buttons are \"full fret\" making the much easier to press. You don't have that annoying ridge line. You get TWO sets of buttons in fact - one for easier guitar solo play. You have sound settings. I can't say enough about this guitar. The only thing it lacks is stickers :) Really, couldn't they include a sticker set or two, to customize the thing? A minor flaw :)The drum set is REALLY cool. It comes with a stand and it has a very nice feel to it. My boyfriend complained a bit about the wood sticks not being smooth, but heck, you're not paying for high quality sticks here.There is a four-plug USB hub so you can actually plug all these items into your XBox 360 :) And there's a few headset adaptors, and a microphone. We already had several of these.Now for gameplay. The graphics are visually lovely, although really, with up to four people playing and singing, the background stuff is pretty meaningless. The screen is taken up by all of the progress bars and alert bars and so on. I do have to comment that the customization for your characters is AWESOME. You customize their style of movement (punk, rock, etc), their facial look, hair style, eye color and much more. Plus you can buy all sorts of great outfits in the store. Never mind equipment. They really went overboard in this area.I found when I played an instrument whose track was on the far left (the lead guitar, for example) that I could easily see the \"overall progress\" bar showing how everyone in the band was doing. I could see that the drum guy was doing poorly and slipping down into the red. However, when *I* was playing the drums - and the visual for my drum track was on the far right - I had NO idea how well or poorly I was doing. That overall band progress display was on the far left (past the other instruments' tracks) and there was no way to watch both my own drum note list and see how I was doing at the same time. So you almost need to designate whoever is playing in that far left track as the \"band alert person\" to yell out if someone is doing not so well.The band works as a unit. If for example the drums are doing poorly, but the guitarist is doing well, the guitarist can use their energy the rev up the crowd which helps everyone in the band. So the guitarist can save the drummer, for example. On the other hand, if the drummer is really bad, after a few failures, the crowd gives up. You can't have the remaining players try to play the song out.Which brings up one of my only complaints about the game. Let's say you start a band \"Asia\" with the leader being a drummer. Now any time Asia wants to continue on their career, the drummer MUST BE PLAYING. In real life, band members change positions sometimes. You have a drummer who also likes to sing. But here, if you have a position set as the leader, the game can't be played (with that band and the songs it's unlocked) without that instrument being played. We found that really annoying. You should be able to say that person X now wants to play instrument Y and keep going.Now, interestingly, my boyfriend plays the drums. He found the drum pads AWFUL to use and thought they were broken. We swapped off and he took over guitar while I played with the drums. I did a 100% performance. So it's something about the way you hit them. I *think* they have to be hit pretty close to dead center, with a sharp rap. I'm not a drummer so undoubtedly I'm not hitting them \"technically right\" but I am able to sail through many songs on easy with 100%. So it's a matter of getting used to how they work.The vocal / mike track is much like any karaoke game, and you \"yell\" to activate overdrive. It's a lot of fun. I did try several songs with a mike stand setup so I could play guitar and sing at the same time. It was a lot of fun - but part of the mike track is \"cowbells\" where you're supposed to thwap the microphone in time to the beat. Unfortunately if you're busy playing the guitar or drums you no longer can thwap the microphone. I tried yelling \"POP\" and it worked about half the time, if I used a very snappy sound to my POP. Still, it's a shame you can't sing and play because of this.The songs in this list are GREAT. I really love some of them, and there were few that I simply didn't like at all. It's cool that they have multiple venues per location, instead of the Guitar Hero games where there was just \"one Boston\" and so on. You have to actually earn a Van or Bus or whatever to move on to a new city. You actually build up a fan base as you go, and lose it if you do poorly. That is all very cool. On the down side, the progression of songs is rather odd. You can play 2 songs you like in Boston, and then go to Chicago and play the exact two songs again to earn more stars there. The songs seem to unlock slowly. I'm also not overly fond of several modes where you have no idea what songs are coming up until 2 seconds before the songs begin.They do have a training mode and solo mode, but really you figure the great appeal of this game is to play with your friends, using the various instruments. So we found that interface - where you are stuck with a single leader, and it is very much one-person-one-instrument oriented, to be a bit frustrating. Sure, I love playing drums - but I love playing guitar too! Sometimes I love to sing. It didn't seem like it should be THAT bad to let a person switch instruments once you'd unlocked a bunch of venues and songs.Finally, I really like that right from the start you have access to all difficulty modes, and can set them by person. So if you have a really great guitarist in your family, and someone who is perhaps younger or just getting started, the great guitarist can set themselves to difficult and the younger person can set to easy and both can have a really fun, challenging time.I am really looking forward to new song downloads too, and imagine that could make this game last years and years and be just as much fun.Highly, highly recommended if you can get your hands on this thing. We were there right when the store opened to get our hands on ours, and it sold out immediately. Well worth tracking down!! Note that I have photos of the instruments on my website and am happy to answer any other questions you guys have about this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}

The games for this system are decently fun, the controller is an ergonomic wonder (although you either need to replace the batteries or buy a seperate charging kit) and all in all I'm happy with the purchase.I realize I'll probably get 'no' votes for this but I do prefer my PS3 because it has more features when stacked up to a comparable xbox unit for the same price and fewer add on fees (xbox live, rechargeable battery packs, etc).  Everything considered though if you like first person shooters you really can't pass this system (or a newer version of it) up.  One thing I would note is that microsoft has more money for video game development so most games that are on both systems are developed for the xbox first and ported over to the PS3.  This generally means they work better and have fewer issues on the xbox.  A great example of this is Oblivion (or any bethesda game for that matter) has glitches on PS3 and works fine on xbox.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2010"}

Did right. We finally have a decent turn based Paper Mario game just like it used to be. Sure it's still missing companions, equipment, and exp points that let Mario level up to grow more powerful, but the feel from the first two games is back! What made this game unique to me was the sticker system. Pretty cool concept. I'm still waiting for the full Paper Mario gameplay to  come back, instead now games like Dream Team seem to have stolen essential themes and claimed it as it's own thing. Wrong.Please Nintendo. For the fans restore Paper Mario to it's former glory. That's what made it so popular in the first place. Bring back the fun loving companions of Kupas, Goombas, Boos. Bring back the wonderful exp/level up system. Bring back unique equipment and more villages. Make it the full RPG experience it used to be. This although is a great start!

I've played this game all the way through and I have to say this was a darn good game. Not one of my favorites in my vast collection, but it was a purchase I don't regret making. I wasn't even considering this game at first. I was 'Halo'ed out so to speak. The last ODST game didn't interest me, and my friends told me to stay away. So I did. Halo 3 was great, but it wasn't amazing or anything either. Multi-player was its saving grace for me. Halo Wars was interesting at best. So I figured this latest installment would be another ho-hum game, but then a store I stepped into had it at a special $20 discount for the game if you bought it on opening week. So I figured, \"Sure. What the heck?\". Boy was I glad I made that purchase.This Halo is the prequel to all things Halo, and the story line doesn't disappoint. I like how they made this game more grittier and less flashy than any other Halo I've played. It kind of had that Call of Duty/Medal of Honor/Killzone kind of feel to it. What I mean by that, is that this Halo focused more on the gritty ambiance of war, and the characters around you that help you along the way accomplish your missions throughout the game. Those games did that, as you would follow a character along the way, develop relationships to a mild extent, and you could be drawn into the story. This Halo did that.AI is good at times and really bad at others. Your own folks sometimes will be great shots, and at other times allow themselves to be slaughtered in the open. Don't even think about letting them drive the vehicles for you.Graphics are great obviously.I found the controls to be very fine tuned as well. No issues here. That's saying something, because I'm a keyboard and mouse guy. However, there are games on these consoles that are worth playing regardless of how bad I or you may suck at these games with a controller. I found this game to be an easy quick learn with the controller, and I had very few issues mowing down the bad guys in this one.Overall, I really do recommend this game. You may want to wait until it comes down in price in the 30s to 40s area. For some reason this game just didn't have the epic feel of a Gears of War, or a Metal Gear Solid, or a Mass Effect, or another blockbuster game like those mentioned. Hence, the reason I wouldn't plop the 60 bones down for this one. However, it's still a great game to play if you're itching to see how the story began, or just have some fun in a sci-fi action shooter that is among the \"Very Goods\" in that department.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"demonsRendangered","summary":"Final Fantasy XIII?!?!?!","reviewText":"First I just want to say that this is not meant to be the most accurate review that can be found on Amazon. This review is only meant to encourage people to try this game and to try it the right way. I've been a follower of Square games ever since the original Final Fantasy. I've also followed Enix since Dragon Warrior (Quest). The two companies have since merged and it's a decision that makes sense at least from my point of view. Both companies have been putting out high quality RPGs for well over two decades. It wasn't a hard decision for me to at the very least give this game a chance. I just had to make the time because in today's gaming industry there are more selections than ever and not really enough time to try everything, especially if you commit to an RPG. I think I spent an entire summer trying to master Final Fantasy X. It just depends on how busy a person is I guess. I'm assuming that anyone looking to try this game has played the previous installments. Is the story as good as previous Final Fantasy's? Well, I can't really answer that because I'm only a couple hours into it. So you may be asking yourself why I'm writing this review already. I'll tell you why. I'm playing this game on a 120 inch screen with a DLP projector that converts 2D into 3D. The difference is outstanding! I mean, I compared just a little bit of this game in 2D and in 3D and all I can say is if you haven't tried it yet you should wait until you can give it the &#34;theatrical experience&#34; because it is much much better in 3D on a big screen then just standard 2D on a t.v. The world absolutely comes to life in 3D and really makes the game that much better. I really do think it's the only way to experience it. Perhaps Square-Enix intended this because there is a brightness adjustment in the menu and I don't think any other Final Fantasy games had one. Anyone scratching their head about that statement should know that when you convert a game from 2D into 3D you usually have to turn the brightness up a few notches to compensate for the 3D glasses because they are slightly tinted. Anyways, so far the story is decent enough to keep me interested. Square-Enix have never disappointed with stories(at least the ones I've played) so I'm optimistic about the long run. I've heard about some of the complaints about this game and all I can think is it's not going to matter on a 120 inch screen in 3D. I'm not talking about an expensive upgrade either, you probably just need your own living room and maybe a little over $1000 to upgrade. I'll never go back to t.v. and this really is one of those games that feels right at home on a big screen because it really is like playing a movie. The only other thing I can add information wise about this game is the battle system seems a little overwhelming at first but starts to become comfortable with practice. That and the level up system is a lot like the sphere grid from Final Fantasy X. Hope this helps anyone looking into getting this game and sorry if it sounds like I'm trying to promote DLP projectors or gloating about mine or something but it really does merit a mention because of the big difference it makes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2014"}

The sniper rifle scoping system that was in place in COD2 is back, also, and many new weapons are available.Different from COD2, the interface is much more dense, the map more complex, and options well beyond that which was available in World War II.  And yet despite this, it is easy to get used to, and despite the addition of far more things on the player's HUD and interface, it doesn't get in the way of the gameplay itself, seeking out enemies and killing them.Another unique addition is rankings and unlockables in the multiplayer.  You start out as a private, with only the three base classes of Assault, Spec Ops, and Demolition available to you (this means assault rifle, machine gun, shotgun), with the other two classes unlocked when you rise in rank.  Rank upgrades are easy, requiring XP which is earned from killing people and just playing multiplayer maps.  Even more unique, you can create your own class, picking what sort of weapons to start with, as well as bonuses such as bullet stopping power, increased health, and perks like extra grenades or RPGs.  More options are available the higher you rank.With more technology and better guns, there's more things to do in single player and multi player games, making it a more complex and rewarding gameplay experience to have.  But if it's too much all at once, there's still COD2 and 3 to go back to.  COD4 has that quality of both appealing to the player, and not alienating the predecessors.  That sort of quality is what makes a franchise like this amazingly successful.Potential Spoilers followCampaign:My god... at first I thought it was a nice little thing, very fun but without a much interested storyline.  You play as two characters: SAS's Soap MacTavish and USMC's Paul Jackson.  Soap and his officer, Captain Price, are hunting a Russian terrorist Imran Zakhaev and rebels (\"Ultranationalists\") connected to a major Arab terrorist Khaled Al-Asad (think Osama Bin Laden) who is being hunted by the Americans, after assassinating the president of the Middle Eastern country in question (never named) on live television.The campaign is utterly brilliant in its realistic depictions of surgical strikes and combat.  The AI is beyond brilliant---enemies take cover, have powerful guns, use LOTS of grenades, both frag and special, can blind-fire, use snipers, use the terrain to their advantage, etcetera.  It's absolutely phenomenal how brilliant they are, and absolutely frustrating in some places where simple FPS-\"Doom\" style \"run in and shoot everything before it shoots you\" strategy ends with you covered in bullets.This realism peaks in Sgt. Paul Jackson's last mission.  Assaulting the capital city where Al-Asad is hiding, the Americans must proceed with caution, as Al-Asad has a nuclear weapon, and they must enter in helicopters, assault, take Al-Asad, and escape.  As Jackson's helicopter is escaping, looking over the city and making room for the US team to defuse the nuclear weapon, the bomb goes off, and my jaw absolutely dropped at how devastating, graphically crisp, and just plain realistic and frightening depiction of the nuclear bomb going off, and Jackson's helicopter goes down.  The next mission is literally Jackson, half-dead, crawling out of the helicopter into a hellish landscape, and dying in a second blast.That's right... one of your main characters dies mid-campaign, and very brutally.The rest of the campaign centers around Soap, finding Al-Asad (who wasn't in the city) and hunting down Zakhaev while he aims nuclear weapons straight for the US.The campaign is brilliant not just for its innovation in AI, missions and objectives, and setting, but for the sheer gritty realism of it, and the genuine horror.  This is perhaps the scariest video game I have ever played, because unlike fantasy horror games like Resident Evil, this is one game that shows -what could really happen- today!Five stars all around.

It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

The graphics are so superb and meticulous attention is paid to every detail imaginable.  The voice acting is rather well done too, although some of the voices sound rather sarcastic and like they're hiding something.  The controls will take some time getting used to, but once you do you'll be loving Shenmue.  This massive game was originally the first of many chapters, but Shenmue 2 has been cancelled for the US Dreamcast (a shame) so this is a true gem.  By the way, there is nothing better than being able to play the original versions of Space Harrier (an all time favorite of mine), and Hang On (even though the controls for it are rather sensitive), and the other arcade games are fun too.  Tedious at times, and sometimes just plain frustrating, Shenmue is an experience, and its a sin if your a Dreamcast owner and don't have this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2002"}

Has its great moments, but misses the mark in my opinion.What i do like about the game is the loading, or lack there of, very seamless and fast .. i wish more games where able to do this.My main issue I have with it is, cut scenes not initiating and with no real save feature you might be stuck for good or have to restart your Xbox,,.. there are many doors, treasures, jewels , etc that you try to get that the game won't allow you to do or get, resulting in painfully trying to achieve something you can't do, or must do in a quest, or with a certain item, or at a certain time, but,,, you don't know that. Too much time spent having to fail to figure out why you can't do something, it's becomes a chore. Forced to go online to figure simple stuff out because THQ, thought it would be fun to waste huge amounts of time doing nothing.I wish it had more puzzles and less time the puzzle being, that after an hour of trying to get a jewel you figure out you cant and weren't supposed to in the first place,,OR IF THE GAME IS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY..,, Sometimes quests don't kick in properly, initiate properly, this is a knowN issue and will likely get patched, but can burn you for a lot of wasted time and you won't know it. Comparing weapons is a chore, walking is a chore as you wish you could go faster. I wish the blood actually splattered on the walls and floor which would have been cool, but like I said the graphics aren't that great. (see game site videos)One thing that might be a deal breaker for some. You can go into an arena, say with 5 health potions and use them fighting a boss, however, get to the next room get locked in with a boss and not be able to fight because you have no more health, and not be able to progress or leave because of the lack of a previous save feature. This can cause a game re-start with is truly annoying. (see forums)However, when you use health potions, the game does have a knack for dropping them in loot for you which is nice.The game play is fun, the fighting / combat is enjoyable..if not a bit repetitive...The graphics are ok, but very old looking in my opinion. Probably why the loading is so fast.. I have about 30 hours into it and finally finished it. The second to last boss was very annoying to me,, and came off cheap, many people had to do it over 20 or 30 times..(See forums) This game is frustrating often and too much time spent painfully figure out if your even supposed to open the door or get the jewel in the first place. What they did is add a lot of time to the game this way..If you look at the forums for it all you will see is,,,HELP!, STUCK!, STUCK!, SWITCH WONT WORK!, CANT CONTINUE!,,,SEE FOR YOURSELF.I GIVE IT A 6.5.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2012"}

Theres a few gameplay adittions such as a little minigame but my biggest problem is that this game has been released so many times that its almost a joke, this can be said for several final fantasy games.  For this one game it started on the NES, ported to the ps1 which is compatible with the psp, a GBA version was released, a psp version was released and not too long ago a iOS version was released.  The one thing these all have in common is that with every release they add just enough to justify a $40-50 price tag on an old game.  The best release would be the most recent one but to keep bringing it back is discouraging, it leads me to think that they dont feel that they can make a quality new game so thy go back and re-re-release their older games.  This might seem like a rant but the game is still good and its a good addition to the collection however if your a potential buyer beware because they will probably re-release this with FFII as a single cart on the vita with slightly improved visuals and features so keep this in mind, in closing these constant releases are just silly, if it was porting its one thing but they slightly change the game and mark up the price which I find wrong","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Really Fun Game for Hours of Entertainment","reviewText":"I really like this game because I've always enjoyed RTS games like Empire Earth, Age of Empires, etc.  I didn't play the original Starcraft but this one is a lot of fun so far.  I think what I like is that the units are very well matched up and all do such specific things that to really do well, you need to know what your units can do and how to use them.  It's not like some other RTS games in which you can just throw a bunch of whatever against the wall and hope it sticks.The mission is good, nice voice work, good cutscenes, good story.  It also has some challenge levels to help you get better at understanding what units are good for fighting other units.  There are tons of skirmish type games too that you can play against the computer or with others and finally there's the multiplayer.Unlike some other RTS games, you don't really spend your time building up villages and advancing through ages over and over and over.  Sure, there's some building and research but I think its the understanding of battle strategy and what to use and when that's the core of the game.Graphics are great and run totally smooth on my computer, sound is excellent, good music.  My only complaint is on multiplayer they do this thing called real ID which I think gives out your real name.  Whenever I log into the game it shows my real name and that's a little disturbing for me because I don't like to be forced to share personal information like that, and this has kept me from exploring multiplayer options more.Anyway, if you like RTS games, you'll definately like this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2011"}

It is a mature game so there are parts which make the getting coffee scenes in GTA look like a Disney movie so please don't buy it for your child because you will have some explaining to do about the human reproductive system. It is also quite violent. I like that its not just a shoot em up; you must formulate a strategy in some parts.  You also get to search for enigma codes and gold.  The game is kind of short for most seasoned players with 15 to 20 hours of gameplay.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BQ","description":"In the tradition of great 3-D action jumping games,Crash Bandicootis probably the PlayStation equivalent of the groundbreaking Nintendo 64 titleSuper Mario 64. Now repackaged as one of PlayStation'sGreatest Hits, this top-selling game takes you away on a tropical island adventure that is filled with precarious enemies and challenging levels. Our spiky-haired hero Crash needs no weapons to survive the harsh jungle. Instead, he jumps, jogs, and spins his way through numerous lush and downright fun environments.With 26 levels spanned across three tropical islands,Crash Bandicootis sure to amuse old gamers as well as new. Crash must rescue his girlfriend, Tawna, from the evil clutches of Dr. Cortex. Along the way, he can gather fruit for extra lives, smash boxes for random prizes, and gather tokens that can be used for bonus rounds. Numerous big bosses block your path, which also includes more than a few risky jumps that require split-second timing.Crash Bandicoot's impressive graphics and strong gameplay have already won over many hard-core and casual gamers. While this PlayStation classic has already spawned two successful sequels, the original version remains a worthy purchase--particularly at the sub-$20 price.--Kasty ThomasPros:Sub-$20 priceHidden bonus levelsCons:None","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Crash's First Outing is Flawed","reviewText":"Back when the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 were first released, people were getting all excited over Super Mario 64 in 1996.  It was new, it was innovative.  It had something.  Meanwhile, the Sony Playstation got Crash Bandicoot, and this was described as a game that could take Mario on at his own game.  That, of course, didn't happen, as Mario still holds the torch.  However, Crash Bandicoot wasn't a bad game.  It was, however, a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons, the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty.  There were, of course, other mitigating factors.Crash Bandicoot carries the--even then--overdone save the damsel in distress storyline, ala Mario saving Princess Peach over and over.  Much like Mario, however, Crash wasn't about storyline.  It was about gameplay, and here it's just as simplistic as it is in your average 2D side-scroller.  Crash only has two attacks.  His spinning attack and a jump attack.  You'll use this to take down your enemies.  There are advantages to using one attack over the other.  For example, the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives Crash some extra air, which is actually needed to access some of the games little secrets.Throughout each level, Crash also has the ability to obtain Aki-Aki.  A mask that serves to protect Crash.  If you have one you can sustain two hits before you die.  If you have two you can sustain three hits.  If you have three you'll be temporarily invincible.  The game also makes it a point to give you an Aki-Aki if you're dying too many times in a certain level, and believe me, that'll happen a lot.  The good news is that Crash Bandicoot isn't shy about giving you extra lives.  The bad news is that you'll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly.  A lot of the times things are just unfair.  The camera is permanently fixed behind Crash, so sometimes it's hard to predict jumps, or sometimes even where some enemies are.  Also, the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well.  Like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that you've no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose.  Thus, you've no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levels.To its credit, though, Crash Bandicoot has a variety of levels.  There's the basic 3D platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you, but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being 2D side-scrollers.  There are also levels where you'll run from a boulder in Indiana Jones style, levels where you'll ride on a hog.  You'll get your fill from these levels.  Although, many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward.  There's not a whole lot of exploration to be done, and even when you can veer off course, you'll only be backtracking to get back on the right course.  In short, many levels are just too linear.Mastering the game is also fairly difficult.  Throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash.  If you smash all the crates, you score a perfect.  Seems simple right?  Well, the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying.  And again, with some unfair camera angles in some levels, and the trial and error, you'll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times.  Likewise, it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken down--including the final boss Dr. Neo Cortex.  Most boss battles aren't a challenge, but getting to them sure as hell is.Even the games save system is flawed.  As you go through each and every level you'll find tokens that'll let you catch a glimpse of the girl Crash is out to save in this game.  The problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level.  The second problem is that you need three of them.  The THIRD problem is that you have to go through some stupid mini-level in order for your game to actually be saved.  They're played out in a 2D side-scroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some 3D elements, which again require trial and error to get through sometimes.  At least you don't lose a life... just the chance to save your game.  The FOURTH problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens, whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not, you can't get them again.  Thus in each level you're only given the chance to save once, and you may not even get it!  This is inexcusable.  The later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature.  There's also a password system here for those who don't have a memory card, and that's really nice to have.  Again, however, it sucks that you only really get one chance to save.  You can save after scoring a perfect on a level, but again, that's a one time deal.  You can't go to an easy level, score a perfect and save again.Despite its gameplay issues, Crash Bandicoot looked good at least.  Especially for a game released in 1996.  It runs fairly smoothly, and just looks great for the time of its release.  It wasn't a launch title, but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes.  The levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it.  It can't hold a candle up to today's graphics but in 1996 this was a charmer.  The game also didn't sound so bad either.  Some tunes do get annoying, but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels, and the sound effects are brilliant.  As far as presentation goes, Crash Bandicoot really knew how to hand it to us.Unfortunately, it's unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while.  Was it a good game?  Sure it was.  But the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game.  It's not bad for a first outing, but a game shouldn't be so unforgiving in its difficulty.Pros:+It's a good looking game+It sounds good+Simple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learn+A variety of levels+Tons of secrets and little things to do; you'll be busy just trying to complete the game 100%Cons:-The difficulty level of this game is unforgiving-Bad camera angles-The games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easy-A lot of trial and error moments-Many levels are too linear-The save system set up is absolutely horribleIt's still a good game, but later games in the series do a far better job.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"The PSP rocks, let's see how the games are...","reviewText":"Any gamer worth his or her salt will tell you that it doesn't matter what a system's specs are, it's the games that make it.  The Gamecube is a fine machine, but the utter lack of games is what's killing it, and the opposite is true for the Gameboy: hardly cutting edge (even the DS, which I also own), but keep the games rolling and people keep buying.I confess to being a techno-geek, so I was really impressed by the PSP.  It looks supermodel gorgeous, whereas the DS feels cheap and plasticky by comparison.  Here is my breakdown:PROS: Beautiful design.  Hey look, an Analog stick, hurrah!  Are you listing Nintendo?  AMAZING graphics.  The screen is enormous.  Ability to play music, view pictures, etc, though to be honest, I couldn't care less.  I have an MP3 player for my tunes and a computer for my files.  Let my PSP play games, and I'll be happy.  Small and efficient storage format.CONS: Power switch too close to right thumb when playing.  The proprietary UMD disc design is a bit worrisome, as is any non-standard format.  The whole movie aspect of PSP will crash and die within a year, guaranteed.  Why would you buy a movie for this unit when you can get the DVD for cheaper and you can play it in more places?  The unit feels a bit fragile and easy to scratch.  The battery life isn't great, but no surprise there.  That said, all those cons will die out when I can play Grand Theft Auto on my PSP, which should be this summer or fall!Overall, this is more an adult gamer's machine than a gameboy.  The look, feel and design is sleek, sexy and powerful.  It has the potential to humiliate the Gameboy in terms of power and versatility, though it remains to be seen if that will happen.  Until then, I'm content playing with both my DS and my PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":".... \"..................\"","summary":"Slightly dissapointing third installment carves path for future RTS games","reviewText":"Age of Empires, a critically acclaimed computer game series that a lot of us have heard of. After nearly a 4 year layoff from the last installment, Microsoft finally releases Age of Empires 3. The game is set from the discovery period (Christopher Columbus time) to the westward expansion. Choose between 7 civilizations including the French, English, and Russians as they each struggle to control the new world. The game includes a story based campaign mode and a skirmish mode. In both these modes you must manage a home city. The game has its ups and downs, and here they are.Graphics: To start off positive, the graphics in this game are outstanding. Watch as buildings and ships slowly crumble to peices, which is unlike any game before. 5/5Skirmish mode: The skirmish mode offers a choice of civilization and contains a well designed but rather limited selection of maps. Low resource start-off makes games slow. Limited adjustable features. 3.5/5Bugs: Few,if any, major bugs exist within the game. 5/5Story-Based Campaign: This is the meat of the game. Play through 3 different acts of the Black family legend as you fight the legendary circle of ossus. Story is well plotted and the missions are fun although the objectives may contain too many shortcuts. Final mission is too easy. This campaign is the only one. 3.5/5Combat: Combat is realistic and demonstrates strengths and weaknesses well. 4.5/5Historical accuracy: Quite accurate although different generals have little difference. Not enough emphasis on development of gunpowder warfare. i.e. pikeman are still used during the industrial age. 4/5Gameplay time: Very limited. Only one campaign and two single player game modes. This is the real weak spot. 2/5Overall: Although lacking in some areas, this game makes up for it with stunning graphics and a well put together story line. This game is a nice addition to your collection although it wont keep you occupied. 3.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2005"}

It's like an MMORPG (because of it's character creation and having to put on whatever you want on your character and, for the PC version only, making your own race weapons and areas.), but it's a single player game, so there is really no online play. Like I said before, this version (the PC version) allows you to create your own race, so you don't have to pick a default race; Your own classes, custom weapons (I don't know 100% for sure if you can make your own weapons from scratch, but you can take an existing sword copy that file of the original sword and make a new sword.), Make your own little areas in the game, and the list can go on and on. One thing about the whole creation thing is that it's for more ADVANCE COMPUTER PLAYERS who have lots of experience on computer games, so if you aren't computer crazy, don't use the Construction disc; or if you aren't ready just yet, just play the game, then play around with the program (like I did) and you will eventually find out it's easy.Now for the actual game itself, you create your own character, do this and that to be free and then go on a bunch of crazy quests. You can either plan to destroy everything in it's path or just do what people tell you to do. The game, like I said, is like a MMORPG for single players. The world is ungodly massive and, unless you plan to spend every waking moment of your life playing this game, probably will take a long time to beat the game and every little side quest and whatever else that this game has to offer. This also includes Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions, but because I bought this package and had to install it with Morrowind right away, I didn't really notice that everything on all 3 discs were in the game when I was playing it (like the little continent on the upper left hand corner of the world, from the world map, was from the Bloodmoon disc, so if I didn't install that disc, the game wouldn't have that continent).So I really recommend this getting this game because it's really fun and If you don't like paying bills for MMORPGs (which by the way is Multiplayer Online RPGs) like me, then this is the next best thing to get that craving of MMORPG madness put to rest. If, however, you have enough requirements on your computer, then get the Oblivion game (I don't know if that has some of the things that this game has to offer like race creation). If not this game is worth every little penny you bought it for. I really would recommend that you get this version because of the Construction disc and the expansions, but if you do not have a gaming computer, then just get the Xbox version (I don't care which one it is) or If you have a Xbox 360 or a good PC, then get the 4th game Oblivion (check to see if the PC version has a construction disc or something similar that you can create your own stuff, If not get this game instead or , you know what, you just make your own decision about that because I don't have Oblivion so I can't help you compare this with that game)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2007"}

Fans will revisit this beloved story and come to care for a new troupe of characters in KINGDOM HEARTS II.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Well Worth The Wait","reviewText":"It's been quite some time since I played Kingdom Hearts I - a game that, at first, I wasn't sure I was going to like.  Of course, once into it, I found the game every bit as addictive as everyone else did.  So it was a great deal of impatience that I waited for Kingdom Hearts II to come out.  With a short vacation in hand I settled down to play it through, and I want to report right now that this game is not only as good as its predecessor, it is even better.  Maybe even a lot better.The game picks up about a year after the first part.  It starts without Sora, Donald, and Goofy.  Instead, we spend a week with Roxas (who looks very familiar) and his friends.  Gradually Roxas remembers who he really is, and a huge and complex plot begins to unfold as Roxas is replaced by Sora and the old story unfolds again, but with a lot of twists.  This time the bearer of the Key Blade must unlock the paths between the worlds - one at a time (and sometimes twice).On each world there are heartless to defeat, and 'nobodies,' what's left when the heart is taken.  These come in shapes both monstrous and human, and even have an 'Organization XIII' dedicated to the success of the darkness.  In addition many of the old villains have returned to join with the new in a cast that must number over 100 characters, including a guest appearances of the likes of Yuna and the Gullwings.  In fact, Final Fantasy characters make a much bigger showing in this game.The game is brilliantly done.  Plot and subplots, scripting, and animation are simply magnificent.  This is a game that was clearly not rushed to market, and the result is that special magic that few games ever achieve.  Artwork and music are equally breathtaking.  The game manages the balance between violence and more positive messages beautifully.  All told a credit to the director and the creative staff.Of course, with both Square Enix and Disney involved one should expect this.  But seeing and playing is believing.  After some 60 hours of game play, I'm a believer.  Even the fighting is carefully done to avoid monotony.  Each opponent offers different challenges in a complex battle system that will take a couple of play throughs before it is fully mastered.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2006"}

It is a difficult game to recommend to others though.On the one hand it is still as fun as the first game if you liked that game.  The cars handle better which is good news.On the other hand it is _so_ like the first game, it is astonishing.  And there's obviously going to be DLC released that should have been in the main game.

Never in my life did I think I would put 30 hours into a portable game. Especially one that is not an RPG of some sorts. This is the first portable game that makes me feel like I am somehow playing a current gen console game where I please. The multiplayer is a blast as well, and it's consumed 16 hours of my 30 hours played so far. It is just an addicting blast. The story as always is over the top, but it's expected and part of the entertainment.One thing I need to point out is nearly every review will say you can't aim and move without the add on. That is false. You can hold \"L\" and strafe while aiming and shooting, or move forward and backwards. It works great, and I use it all the time. I went into the options and made the aiming view identical to RE4 & RE5 and it looks and plays like a dream. This is one of those rare games like Mario Land 3D and Zelda where the 3D is done extremely well. Usually I turn it off and forget, but for much of the single player I was trying to keep it on at all times. It really adds to the experience over being just a gimmick.Pick this game up and support the mass of content and effort the developers poured into this gem!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2012"}

There are many new enhanced graphics and visuals. The experience can be additionally enhanced with a HDTV. Overall, the whole game is a lot more lively and vivid than the last. Many visuals seen on the game are usually seen on Sundays.The new player models are excellent and the uniforms look superb. On one cutscene, the texture of the uniforms can be seen. In the previous next-gen versions of Madden, many of the player models were kind of bulky looking. Now, the players are built more realistically. New uniform accessories have been added, such as towels, hand warmers, team colored gloves, and team colored cleats. They are not the same boring black and white cleats, which was on the previous versions. For the first time, uniforms can be interchanged, as well.Seen on SundaysDuring the game, many details and animations can be seen on the game, fan interactions, QBs talking on the phone, coaches ranting, players talking on the sidelines, kickers practicing kicks, players riding the exercise bike, referee interactions and chain gains. One of the coolest features is seeing fans leave early, if their team's game has gotten way out of hand. It is also quite funny.Game PlayThe game play is better. First off, the game speed can be adjusted. Many of you played the demo and didn't like the speed of the game. Well, it can go from very slow, slow, normal, fast and very fast. Also, EA has added a new threshold differential. This means setting to the higher the level will give the player less of a disparity between the fast and slow players. A lower setting will increase the disparity.The player animations and movements are realistically fluid and not robotic, such as the previous versions.I noticed on some movements, the players use more momentum. Players can't just break out and turn different corners, quickly, like they are on wheels. They actually bend and don't stay upright, while turning a corner. Sometimes, the player may have to make a cut, in order to head up field. The best animations are while going through the hole. Pressing the directinal buttons will make the RB make many different cuts. Time them right and the defender can be juked. Typically, juking could only be done by spinning.The player animations have improved. Players fall many different ways. Sometimes, it even seems as if they are going to break out of a tackle, then they start to fall. There have been times when I was on the edge of my seat because I thought my player was breaking the last tackle in order to \"take it to the house\", but he goes down. Not to bad. The Pro-Tak is realistic. The players pile up, when necessary. It is not an every down occurrence. Keep in mind, different modes carry different Pro-Tak results.The game is very competitive!!! Even this year's version of All-Pro is a lot harder than the previous versions. Players cannot expect to just dominate the game above the Pro level. Many glitches from the previous version have been neutralized, as well. Also, the computer does not make themselves sitting ducks for hit-stick tackles, such as previous versions of Madden. They do more weaving on this game, which is fine.FlawsThere are a few things that disturb me about the game. The first issue is the new running motions of the players. It seems like they run with their heads down. They also look as if they are just struggling to try to run. In addition, every player runs in the same motion. The previous Madden had at least 3 or 4 different running motions.The next issue is the new \"fight for the fumble\" feature and the chain gang. \"Fight for the fumble\" is a joke. It is like a mini game, which you have to press various buttons rapidly in order for possession to be gained. There was a play, which the player fumbled and two of my team members dove on the ball. Clearly, I had possession of the football. Unfortunately, I still had to fight for the football and lost possession of the recovery. Of course, this feature can be turned off. The chain gang will drive you crazy. Every single time you have a nine yard play, the chain gang comes out. I mean, lots of times, you know that you didn't get a first down. What is worse, this feature cannot be skipped.Some of the cutscenes get repetative. During the game, you will constantly see the same cutscenes, which involve the same position players. For example, when you see the QB talking on the phone, you see the FS over his left shoulder, each time. Then, you will see the triplets sitting down (QB, RB and WR). Then, when a play goes awry, the coach will be ranting at a player who had nothing to do with the play going wrong. For example, if the QB throws a pick, the coach will rant at the OL. Why not the QB? If the QB throws a pick, he yells at the OL or the FB. That makes no sense. They should have had at least 20 cutscenes, which involves different position players.Depending on what level you play on, you will experience some of the issues, which was on the other Madden games. You will still see makeshift tackling. This goes on during \"Pro-Tak\" animations. In modes other than Pro, you will NOT see double-hit tackling. In All-Madden, the AI of your teams just goes out of the window, such as OTs ignoring blocking assignments. In addition, many of the issues become more magnified. All-Madden is totally unplayable. I would suggest playing on Pro or Custom and tampering with the settings.The commentary is just dull and scripted. It would be nice to have a Madden, which has some loud an exciting commentary. For example, if someone makes a spectacular catch, I want the commentator to have excitement in his voice, when the play happens. I compare this to how it feels when watching Sunday Night games on ESPN. Hearing exciting commentary, while watching a game makes it more exciting. The dull commentary takes away from that experience.Though the half-time presentation is good, the highlights are shown out of order. When watching real football, half-time and post-game shows at least have the highlights shown in sequential. This could have made the half-time presentation more organized.The VerdictEverything on the game has been improved in many ways. In fact, it is a complete turnaround from the last version. If it were not for the flaws, which I mentioned, the game would be even more superior. Of course, no game is going to be perfect, no matter what. Many critics need to realize this. Therefore, if you loved M09 (2008 was horrific), you will absolutely love this latest installment of Madden. Keep in mind, this finished product is a lot better than the demo!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"The Good, the Bad and the Helghast ...","reviewText":"I have now finished the single-player campaign and spent over 10 hours playing online multiplayer (all modes). I played through the campaign using the Move controller. I played through part of the campaign again using the standard controller. I played through the entire campaign in 3D and through part of it in 2D, to compare.So I've pretty much blown every whistle and rung every bell Sony's including with this game (the only thing I haven't tried is the offline co-op). Here's what I thought of the entire thing:The Good:Online Multiplayer. It's incredibly fun. Using the Move controller gives you better accuracy, which usually lands me in first or second place. It almost feels like cheating, but this is the direction Sony took.Single player campaign. Ignore the bitter critics who are crying because they didn't get a chance to play it in 3D or they're rendered incapable of praising any FPS that doesn't star Master Chief or have someone Calling for Duty. This is in the top 10 best FPS titles ever made. Its set-pieces are similar to early Lucas or Spielberg movies in how EPIC they are. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark or any of the first 3 Star Wars' films. It's a really well put together game with more jaw-dropping moments than the last 3 Halos combined.The Move Controls. They work better than you could imagine. They work better than the dualshock itself. It's the closest you're going to come to the keyboard/mouse experience on a console, without literally using a keyboard and mouse on a console. Very accurate. Very fun to play.The graphics. Pure awesomeness. Thought Killzone 2 looked good? This one looks better.The Bad:As much as I loved it, the campaign is way too short (7 hours to finish on medium difficulty) and may be just a little too disjointed. There were a few times where they went overboard making scenes that would stand out in 3D and leave 2D gamers scratching their heads. If the single-player campaign ran 10-20 hours, I would have given Killzone 3 a 5 out of 5. I'm sure they'll have more of the game to sell us later (there's a \"6 months later\" moment that feels created for DLC).Lack of maps. I'm not sure how many maps the game comes with, but with 10+ hours of play time, I haven't seen more than 6 or 7. Not to mention, everyone memorizes one map and then keeps voting to play it over and over again, which is really annoying. Again, I'm sure they'll have plenty more maps to sell us later as DLC. Am I the only one noticing that to get a \"full\" game, you have to shell out around $120? Seems like sort of a scam.The Ugly ... er ... \"Helghast\":The 3D. The 3D worked well enough. Some parts were worthy of pure amazement. One section had me screaming out to my girlfriend, \"Now THIS is what 3D gaming's about!\" Then I felt like a geek. A geek wearing $100 3D glasses. Thinking back on it, it's hard to believe she's stayed with me this long.The problem with the 3D is the nonstop crosstalk (it's worse in darker areas and cutscenes). If you're not all that familiar with 3D, crosstalk basically looks like you're having double (or even triple) vision. This can be pretty problematic when you're staring at three crosshairs, when there's only supposed to be one. I just kept the, \"hit the one in the middle\" line from Rocky IV in mind. It's the worst crosstalk I've seen in a game or in a movie. Which sucks, because, had it not been wrecked by the crosstalk, it would have easily been the best 3D ever put into a game.That said, if you have the chance, I'd recommend playing in 3D. At least a few of the scenes (feel free to ask me in the comments, which parts work best in 3D -- I don't want to give away spoilers in this review). But for all the 3D hype, the game looks and plays just fine in 2D. I wouldn't invest in that 3DTV just yet -- at least not if you're doing so just for this game. On the other hand, I'd definitely invest in this game. If you're a fan of shooters; you won't be disappointed!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"ajnrules \"ajnrules\"","summary":"Game of the Year: 2003","reviewText":"Utter the words &quot;Mario Kart&quot; in a group of gamers, and you are likely to receive a reaction that can best be described as &quot;awe.&quot; Why not? Mario Kart made appearances on three Nintendo since 1992, and each time they had been among the premiere games of their respective consoles. In 2003, Nintendo finally comes out with the Gamecube version of the legendary kart-racing series: Mario Kart: Double Dash!! And once again, Nintendo has a winner on their hands.Veterans of the Mario Kart series would feel right at home with the new Mario Kart game. The controls are generally the same. Even those new to Mario Kart would have no problems adapting to them. The biggest change to the Mario Kart formula is the appearance of what I call the &quot;buddy system.&quot; Now, instead of one racer controlling the driving, you've got one person manning the wheel and another dropping the items. However, there's no difference whom you have driving and whom you have dropping. Unless you're playing Co-Op (more on that later), all you have to do is press Z and the characters would switch places. The only advantage this new system has is that it allows you to store items for later use.Another important addition to the game with the addition of the extra racer is the appearance of a new Co-Op mode. Now two players can combine to control one kart. One player drives while the other takes care of the items. One person Drifts while the other person does the Turbo. It may seem difficult to coordinate between two players, but the execution is quite excellent.All the various driving techniques make their reappearances in Double Dash!! Mini-Turbo Boosts are back and easier to perform. Boosts off the starting line are also back. The jump is gone, but seriously. Can you jump on a go-kart? The options in Double Dash contain old classics and new features. As was expected, Grand Prix, Versus, and Battle are back and better than ever.Unlike Mario Kart 64, which is easy to jump right into 150cc Grand Prix and capture first, or Mario Kart: Super Circuit, which has an astonishing jump in difficulty between 100cc and 150cc, Double Dash eases you into the Grand Prix. Gone are the days where the AI catches up almost immediately after you take care of them. Now you can easily build up a 10-second lead, or find yourself 10 seconds behind the computer. The former is the case in 50cc, which is easier than a walk in the park. The latter describes 150cc, which often become bitter battles for first place.For the first time ever, Double Dash features an All Cup Tour, which is an intense, 16-course marathon Grand Prix with all of the courses. This is just one of many unlockables present in the game. Other important unlockables include Special Cup, Mirror Mode, and two secret Battle stages.Of course, the most important aspect of Mario Kart is the courses. A kart racing game with bad courses are no fun to play. Thankfully, we don't have anything to worry about. The geniuses have supplied us with some of the most enjoyable courses ever to hit a racing game. Sure, there are some duds, but courses like D.K. Mountain are just pure delight.The problem comes with the Battle courses, which are excellent in their own right, but just seems like of lacking when compared to the courses of the past. (Tilt-a-Kart is cool, though.) The addition of two new battle modes makes up for the state of the courses. Shine Thief is like Oddball in Halo. There is a Shine on the course, and one player must take control of it for a combined 60 seconds. Bob-Omb Blast is just insane. Players chuck Bob-Ombs at each other for points. You gain a point if you hit somebody, and you lose a point if you get blown up. And for the traditionalists, there&iexcl; the Balloon Match.While Nintendo refused to supply Mario Kart with online play, it does make use of the broadband adapter in LAN mode. It may be rather costly to connect to LAN, as two Gamecubes, two broadband adapters, and two copies of the game are needed in addition to a standard network cable. However, nothing can top the joys of 8-player Mario Kart, even the lack of a player-select.Graphically, the game is very similar to Super Mario Sunshine. The character models are detailed, and everything seems to have a sort of glossy, cel-shaded look. The game certainly is no Metroid Prime or even The Wind Waker in terms of graphics, but the visuals are definitely no slouch.The music of this game doesn't seem to be as good as the music in Mario Kart 64. However, they do fit the racing mood very well, and some of them are rather catchy. And it&iexcl; always great to hear the Mario Kart 64 Rainbow Road theme pop up in Double Dash. Sound Effects is where the game excels. There are 22 characters, and each of them has their own distinct voice samples. Even Daisy's &quot;Hi! I'm Daisy!&quot; line has its charms. The screeches of the karts are present but virtually unnoticeable in the heat of the race.All in all, Mario Kart: Double Dash may not be an epic to the scale of The Wind Waker or Prince of Persia, but with the best replay value in gaming since Super Smash Bros. Melee in 2001, Double Dash may very well be the best Gamecube game of 2003. It's never fun to fall from first to fourth following a cavalcade of shells, but you'll still find yourself wanting to play some more. Now that's power.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2004"}

Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark.

This is the game that Two Worlds wanted to be and Too Human should have been. If you need  a Diablo fix before part 3 comes out...this is about the best you will get. I will say tho, the game I would have preferred seeing being ported over to console of this type  would have been Titan's Quest as it's the game closest to Diablo right now in fun.Well, moving right along, the stregnth in playing this game is in its simplicity. All of the controls work as they should and you don't have to fumble too much trying to find the proper button to push to make spells work when they have to. Its a find mosters, kill loot, level up and have fun kind of game without all of the combos and intricate button learning seen in some newer types of games.As far as exploring is concerned you can't go 5 feet without finding a new quest and truth be told, you can take them and never complete them because sometimes you may get one better than the last or you way finish so far ahead on the map you may not want to travel back to  finish another, but that's ok, you don't get penalized too much for missing missions.There are varieties of monsters to engage and as I am only on level 10 I haven't fought anything huge yet outside of a giant.Speaking of leveling, so far the first 10 I have done seems to go by quickly considering I only bought it yesterday.Some of you are on the fence about getting this game...so let me run down some fo the bugs that bring this game down now:- Pathfinding and AI: The map could have had a better zoom feature built in allowing you to really figure where you are going as you have to follow the path to get to your destination. cutting thru the woods will have you backtracking a lot as more times than most you will run into a wall or a mountain and can't find a way around it.  The AI is also sometimey as in many cases they just stand around and do nothing when I am attacked. Also what i really hate is when they run off and aggro a large mob and initiate \"The Benny Hill Chase Effect\" which doesn't end until the mob is dead or your companion- Descriptions of objects could have been better: Sometimes you simply have to experiment with items to figure what they do as the descriptions aren't aways clear in what magical items are for.- NO PAUSE BUTTON.  I don't know what Ascarion was thinking but ummmm I really hate being in the middle of a mob fighting and want to step away for a min but CANT because I can't pause in the middl eof playing and have to run into the nearest town in order to get a reprieve. I hope this gets fixed.- No way to sort items self explanatory however one thing I do like is that you have sotrage chests scattered all over to put your items in.- Limited customization: There were some classes Iwanted to choose but because you couldn't change the sex, I didn't.- Camera severely limited: On one hand, it could have been what i got in NWN II but still you are severely limited what you can see around you in terms of distance but you rarely miss much.Graphically speaking, it's passable for a 360 game as a game of this sort I wouldn't expect to have great graphics...it works for a game of this sort but it's not stellar and the gore facor? Hehe, could have been upped a notch.What will get you laughing or a straightface are some of the comments you get from your character as they wisecrack thru the game...problem is about 2hrs in you have heard them all.Thankfully what some will get this game for is the multiplayer aspect and it offers a campaign mode, PVP mode and free roaming mode. One thing I did note is that instead of Ascaron building this  as a pseudo MMORPG game, they set the servers up similar to how Blizzard did with Diablo and allow you to instance your own map with up to 4 people joining in and allows you to make small tweaks on who gets in...a nice touch.All in all, it's not a bad game but not a great game either. it's been out for PC for a little while and seems like it made a decent move to console and while it's not the Diablo killer or Oblivion killer, it's a nice light game to play while waiting for bigger and better to come out later.Again, here is to hoping that Titan's Quest makes a move to console...but I won't hold my breath.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}

Roman","summary":"Ok Kratos, we get it- you want REVENGE.","reviewText":"Right when it came out, people were hailing God of War 3 as being one of the best games -ever made-. That's a pretty big statement to make, especially when people said the same thing about the previous 3 titles. I'm not someone to buy into hype, since whenever I used to do that, I'd always end up disappointed, but after a few trusty co-workers told me about the things in GoW3, I figured I'd give it a shot. Normally, I don't like the super violent games, with the exception of Wolverine, but that was because the game was so over the top, that it was funny. Sure enough, I got pretty bored of Kratos' ways of killing people off within 2 hours, but that's not to say it's a bad game. People who loved the previous titles, and like nearly non-stop action games will more than likely like this one too. I'll say this though- GoW3 managed to keep my interest until the very end, enough for me to not give up on it after I hit first first phase of boredom.Story-wise, you should know what's going on by now. Kratos is after Zeus, and will take out anyone, and I do mean ANYONE who stands in his way. Other gods, innocent people, massive monsters tens of stories tall that you'd think would be able to just step on Kratos and end it...everyone's there for Kratos to beat the hell out of. You'll use a lot of the same weapons/techniques from the previous games while running, jumping and solving [usually] simple puzzles here and there. Aside from the occasional puzzle, there's almost always a couple dozen enemies to take care of. Combat was fun at first. I liked that I could take out weaker enemies with a simple press of the circle button and get a quick kill out of it. There are a lot of the usual QTE button mashing events too, in-battle and during what would otherwise be a regular cutscene to watch. The levels aren't as diverse as you might hope, and while Dante's Inferno wasn't much of a game, the version of hell there trumps GoW3's version by far. 'kinda disappointing since you know they could've done so much more with how well they polish the rest of the game.Some of my most hated things in games are anything involving mashing a buttons and turrets. Sadly, both of those are here, and what kept me from giving the game 4 stars. Can anyone tell me why we need to hammer on the circle button for Kratos to open a door or pry open a monster's mouth when he's effortlessly swinging around huge weapons and surviving falls that would liquefy anyone else? And why the need to hold R1 for a few seconds just to open a treasure chest? It might seem like a stupid complaint, but I really want to know why the designers felt the need to still keep that. Even Link in the Zelda games didn't have any problems opening big chests, and the guy wasn't exactly in great shape. They give you a couple of weapons to toy around with, but the thing is, you'll mostly be using the main chain blades and these big gauntlets you get later on. The other 2 main weapons are really useless, and I never used them apart from the initial testing period right after getting them. There's also a bow and a neat, unique 'weapon' that blinds the enemy, but the times you'll use them are few and far between. But my other big gripe is the platforming parts. I won't lie- I did die a few times while playing the game, and it wasn't usually from enemies. In fact, I didn't die in any boss fights, and because of how generous they were with the health and magic refilling treasure chests, I never had much to worry about with combat. But it was the jumping that always killed me. When it'd look like I could glide over to a platform, the camera angle was off big-time once it adjusted to where I was going, and Kratos fell to his death. He fell again, and again and again. You'd think he could hold onto the ledge to prevent himself from falling instead of just on select ledges and walls. I wish the game would tell you how many times you died and how at the end, because I know the number of times I died from stupid falls is well over 60.Visually, this is probably the best looking ps3 game at the moment. I remember being 15 when the ps2 and Dreamcast were out, and wondered if games would ever be able to have in-game graphics that looked like their FMV cutscenes. 'didn't take too long, but God of War 3 looks incredible in every way. I just wish I could've enjoyed some of the QTE kills more without having to look around for a button to show up on the top, bottom or sides of the screen. The music was pretty good too, and appropriate for whatever was going on. But I still couldn't help but think Kratos' voice was pretty overdone. To me, he sounds like a wrestler that's still trying to figure out his character.My complaints shouldn't keep anyone who liked the previous GoW games from enjoying this one too. In fact, I only played a little bit of the first game, and watched a video walkthrough of the second one since I didn't have a ps2 when GoW2 came out. So this review is more from someone who isn't a fanboy of the series, but isn't against the series for no reason. Action games just aren't my thing most of the time, but am I glad I gave God of War 3 a shot? Yeah. Plus I like how many trophies you get for doing simple things too. :p","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2010"}

Here it is, that feeling has finally returned, Mortal Kombat is back with a beautiful, gory, screaming, bloodthirsty and triumphant vengeance!!! This new but original feeling Mortal Kombat is a true epic blessing. Thank you so much Ed Boon and Co. for bringing back the once amazing fighting franchize to it's glorious roots. This fighter trumps every other fighter out there today and even the fighters of the last several years. I will even be so bold to say the last decade! Thank you very much! My friends and I are even planning to ditch work to get together and hold a grand tournament. Just like old times. I cant wait! One of the biggest hooks that this game offers is just how extremely fluent and intuitive the controls are. I have never, ever played a fighter where the controls worked so well. You can easily ( once you have learned the moves ) chain together and pull off some amazing combos. New comers will love this because it wont make you look ridiculous and stupid when attempting to pull off moves for the first time. There really is no need or excuse for button mashing with Mortal Kombat. It's great to see Mortal Kombat retake the fighter throne and become the \"King of Fighters\" once again. All newer fighters that come out, including any future Mortal Kombat's will have a really steep hill to climb to be able to contend with this.

This system brings your PS3 into the world of motion sensing technology. It ends up being both better and worse than the Wii.This PlayStation Move Starter Bundle is just that - the bare bones to get you started in the world of \"Move\". You get the camera, which is absolutely necessary. You get a controller, which is also necessary. Then you also get one game, which isn't exactly necessary, but is fun.Camera: The camera is the core of the Move system. Where the Nintendo Wii has tilt sensors in their controllers, to know which way you're angling your hands, the PS3 takes a different route. They literally have a camera pointed at you to see what you are doing. This means they can have very fine responses to your movements. You can swing hard or soft, slow or fast, high or low, and the camera tracks it all.This is great because the level of detail is great. This is also challenging because it means you have to stand where their CAMERA wants you to stand, in their \"box\". Normally with our Wii we stand anywhere we want, close or far apart, based on the game. Here you really don't have a choice. That can be challenging for people with less-than-ideal living room layouts.Controller - The main controller for Move looks like a magic want with a globe stuck on the top of it. The globes light up with different colors which is neat. They are comfortable enough in your hand. Many games, though, want a single person to have two of these globe-controllers, one for each hand. Other games want you to have the globe controller in one hand and the secondary controller in another. Since this starter pack only comes with one globe controller and nothing else, it means you'll have challenges playing many of the one player games, never mind any two player games.Game - The starter pack comes with \"Sports Champions\" which has a number of basic sports games - disc golf, archery, table tennis, sword fighting, and that sort of thing. Again some of these games want you to have two controllers just for one person to enjoy it fully. If you want two people to play, you need two controllers. So just buying this starter pack alone will NOT be enough. You'll want to buy extra controllers as well.I have full length reviews of each of the components (for example the wand controller) separately in their single item sale locations, rather than turning this starter bundle review into a gigantic 8 page opus. Suffice it to say, if you enjoy games that involve movement, you'll want to get this starter pack - but you should also promptly buy more controllers and better games. There is a lot of potential here, it's all a matter of setting up your room to handle the requirements, and then buying games you love to play!It's worth noting that the Move system is only going to work with games that were coded to use the Move system. You can't randomly stick in any old PS3 game and expect it to know how to use the Move system inputs.Well recommended.Rating: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000069BD9","description":"Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancebrings theMortal Kombatseries a new 3-D fighting engine, adds tons of features and extras, and still offers up classic gameplay.This installment features a 3-D battle system that still manages to maintain a 2-D feel. For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Shanghaied","summary":"Forget What You Thought you Knew About MK","reviewText":"I will admit that I was somewhat skeptical of this title at first.  Now I'm hopelessly in love with it.  It started as a taboo interest (I used to be a devout Virtua Fighter fan, any other fighter was blasphemous in my eyes) that blossomed into devout loyalty.  This game was a very pleasant surprise and definetely surpassed my low expectations.The fighting system in MK:DA is a lot more complex than previous MKs, with 3 different, unique stances for each of 21 characters.  Still, it doesn't have the deep, intricate fighting system that Virua Fighter has, instead it has projectiles and weapon stances.  If that sounds like a digression from the sublime heights of Virtua Fighter's stardom than you've probably interpreted it correctly; but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  MK:DA doesn't try to improve on the best names in the fighting series; it's merely trying to create a new name for itself and offer something a little more different.  The fighting is more direct and straightforward; you don't have to completely understand every punch to get the job done (though knowing does help).Unlike previous installments, the controls for each fighter really do vary, and that's not just considering their special moves.  Almost every character has unique stances and moves; no more crouching uppercuts and foot-sweeps across the board.  You'll actually have to learn to fight with each character individually to be effective; a somewhat novel concept in the MK univers.The new gameplay and the loads of new content to unlock (hidden characters, stages, storylines, etc.) gives the game high playability for the solo player and is even more addicting with friends, expecially once you've gotten all the characters unlocked for kombating.The only reason I would recommend against getting this title is if you dont' like gore (which you can turn off); MK:DA definetely entails the amount of blood and guts that Mortal Kombat is legendary for.  However, if you're like me and you were initially dissuaded from this title because of the blasphemous, unsophisticated gameplay from previous MK titles, then worry not, because that's all been improved here. The controls are many times more sophisticated.  Definetely give this one a shot if you're not faint of heart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0009Z3K9O","description":"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness delivers an entirely new storyline and main character to the classic game world. In Castlevania the story always revolved around the Belmont family and Dracula, but now there's a new character with new abilities: Hector, a Devil Forgemaster who once refined his skills under Dracula. Fueled by revenge for the murder of his girlfriend, Hector sets off to confront the evil forces of the night. Armed with the powerful skill of Devil Forgery, he must find his way back to the ruins of Dracula's castle and uncover an intricate web of deception -- completely unaware that it is all a sinister play, orchestrated to lure him home.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Curse of 3D Castlevania Games!","reviewText":"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into.  Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great.  And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems.  Sometimes scary problems.  Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so.  But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow.Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way.  Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception.  He looks a little like Alucard.But we're not here to discuss that.  Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers.  Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of  Valachia.  Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in.  He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved.  If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge.  And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome.  And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot.  The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story.Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania.  This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania.  You explore a large castle riddled with goodies.  This includes weapons, subweapons, armor and much more.Playing the game can be quite fun.  Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters.  That isn't as boring as you might think.  You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the circle button.  You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos.  This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without.  Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em.  Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that.  Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing.  This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage.  Again, you must be locked on for it to happen.Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system.  In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time.You also have little helper monsters.  You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon.  They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do.  It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone.  Each enemy also drops evolution crystals.  Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve.  You won't grow to like them, though.  That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the gameplay.  The monsters have special abilities, though.  Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground.  But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same.  You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve.One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons!  And Hector can do it at any time he wants!  That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it!  Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger.  You can do this simply by opening the menu.  I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that.The weapons have their own little downside however.  With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat.  You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use.  Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon \"type\".  This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points.  Unless you're a person who likes to use \"cool\" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun.It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle.  Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia.  Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more.  So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change.The problem with this \"world\" is that you don't see enough of it.  There's not enough detail to it.  You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at.  The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments.  You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over.  If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those \"looping\" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle.The monsters are also not so great.  What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters.  The attacks they use on you.  Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect.  Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety.  You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new.  Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new.  Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on.  The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all!  They'll never change.I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not.  It takes away from the challenge of the game.  The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true.  And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge.  The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all.  The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy.  Later on, however, they get  start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun.  Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try.I wish I could say the graphics are great.  Hey, Hector looks great in combat.  But the enviroments don't have enough detail.  Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now.  Where's the detail?  You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving?  We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting.  Visually, it doesn't look half bad.  It's just that there could be so much more.  The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail.However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME!  As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming!  Is it better than Symphony of the Night?  No, it's not.  It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game.  Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD!  I just wish I could've heard more of it!Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game.  But there are a lot of things that keep it down.  It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation.  You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games.  It's got nothing that makes it stick out.If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop.  If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of \"Dawn of Sorrow\".  It's a much better game.The Good:+Great Music!  Some of the best in gaming!+Good weapon system+It's pretty fun to play+You can steal from enemies!+Great Voice acting!The Bad-Little innovation-Lack of cutscenes to advance the story-Too much of the game gets recycled too fast-Too easy-The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments-Not a whole lot of different enemies-It's too easy-Boring level designs (not enough of them)-You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation!  It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D gameGet Dawn of Sorrow, or one of the other 2D versions of the game.  They seem to fare so much better than this one does.  Even the die-hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Still my favorite series","reviewText":"While there have been many great games over the years, Dead Space is still my favorite series. I have replayed DS1 and DS2 many times. The differences in DS3 take a little getting used to (mainly the crafting), but it's hard to imagine why anyone who really liked the first two wouldn't like DS3.The crafting bench takes the place of the store and the workbench. In addition to weapons, you craft med kits, stasis, etc., from raw materials -- there is no money in DS3. While you can carry only two weapons, each weapon can be a combination of two weapons. So in effect, you still get to carry four weapons, with the advantage that you can fire one with the trigger and the other with the bumper -- much faster than changing weapons. For example: combine a force gun with a line gun you can knock foes back and before they get up, immediately hit them with the line gunUnwanted weapons can be deconstructed and, to some extent, the parts used to build a different weapon. You can also \"sell\" excess med kits, stasis, ammo, etc., for their components.Like the stores of DS1 & DS2, the crafting bench can also store your excess inventory for later retrieval. The only thing the bench doesn't do is suit upgrades, for which there is a specific machine. Suit upgrades are also crafted from raw materials, however. The same machine also handles upgrading statis, kinesis, and other rig features.I've never liked the save system of DS compared to games like Fallout and BioShock which let you save at any time and resume from the exact time and space. DS3 is even worse than DS1 & 2. It autosaves at times, but the only way to manually save is to \"save and quit\", but when you \"continue\", it acts like you got killed and have to restart from what appears to be the last autosave, meaning that you have to repeat any battles and looting you may have done just prior to saving and quitting.Another major change which, IMO, takes some of the interest out of the game, is that the same ammo is used (in different ways) for all weapons. Each weapon determines how the ammo comes out. In DS1 and DS2, you may run out of ammo for your favorite weapon and be forced to use some other kind of weapon, which made the game a little more challenging. Not in DS1, and there always seems to be plenty of ammo.Despite any shortcomings, which every game has, DS3 is a very solid 5 stars for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2013"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Tobie \"broadbandfreak\"","summary":"The Sonic Series is Dead","reviewText":"I'd have to say the last time I played an awesome Sonic game was Sonic Adventure 2 for the Sega Dreamcast. The Sonic games that have followed that seem to have lost the wow factor for Sonic. Sonic Heroes was ok, Sonic and the Secret Rings was mediocre, and the olympic games one was just entertaining because of the multi-player function.I have played Sonic Unleashed maybe three times since I got it as Christmas gift 1 1/2 years ago. I haven't beaten the game, and I don't know if I ever will. It's not that the game is hard; if anything, I think my two year old nephew could play it well. The mechanics of the game are so dumbed down, and the storyline is as diluted as a pot of coffee left out in the rain. I feel like I can literally just shake and wiggle the Wii remote, and I would make it through the level. I thought that maybe Sega would've learned with Sonic and the Secret Rings on how to improve the graphics quality on the Wii; if anything it seems just as bad. I do not think Sega took the time to tweak the graphics so they looked somewhat decent on the Wii. I know that the Wii cannot push graphics as vivid as the XBOX 360 or PS3, but come on, at least take sometime to make it look somewhat complimentary; Sega has gotten lazy over graphics, which is a strike against them. The voiceover for Sonic is a different actor as well; I don't know about everyone else, but to me, the voice is what helps me connect with the character. When the voice actor is constantly being changed from game to game, that disconnect becomes prominent. I also don't like that fact that when you travel to cities, you don't move Sonic through the city, instead you click on icons on a map to talk to people (a lazy scheme on Sega's part). I find myself playing the game for maybe thirty minutes, and then have this itching feeling to put down the remote and walk away. The wow factor is not in this game at all; this is the first Wii game that I have never played from beginning to end. I feel bad ever asking for this game as a gift.I loved the Sonic series when it became next gen on the Sega Dreamcast, thinking that Sonic would actually compete with Mario, but ever since that platform died, we've only gotten shards of the Sonic memory. I don't know how Nintendo has managed to keep Mario alive for so long, but whatever they have done, they've done it well. Sega, on the other hand, has probably killed Sonic a few times over ever since they threw in the towel on making their own console. This experience maybe different for younger kids, but for someone who is a Sonic fan since the original Sonic on Sega Genesis, I'm left feeling rather disappointed.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"Has issues, but its heart is in the right place","reviewText":"Capcom is in a tough spot with the Resident Evil franchise. A lot of hardcore, old-school fans would love to see the franchise go to its pre-Resident Evil 4 roots and focus more on \"survival horror\" and less on action. A lot of other people would love to see the franchise move beyond RE4 and embrace more modern conceits. Resident Evil 5, while a good game seemed to make nobody happy: it took place in a brightly lit African environment, which annoyed the old-school fans. The game retained its \"stop-and-shoot\" mechanic, which annoyed newer fans. It had a prominent co-op system that annoyed anyone who loved Resident Evil 4's meaty, solitary adventure.Capcom's solution in RE6 is to attempt to please everyone. They do this by including three campaigns. One campaign is supposed to be more horror-based, another is more action-based, and a third is rooted in the RE3 style. Meanwhile, Capcom has revised the shooting mechanics to where it more closely resembles Dead Space - you can shoot and move basically. Honestly, there's a lot to like here. The game is enormous - each campaign compares favorably to many full-length games today. Each campaign has co-op capabilities, but the AI is much better than Sheva from Resident Evil 5. Capcom's attempt to expand the game even more is admirable. In addition to the very popular Mercenaries mode, there is Agent Hunt, which is basically an invasion system (like Dark Souls) and upgradeable skills.What hurts the game is an overall lack of polish. The shooting and movement don't feel as tight as, say, Dead Space, although you are agile than Isaac Clark. Resident Evil 6 does a very poor job of explaining mechanics (both in-game and in the instruction manual - oh wait there is no instruction manual), yet has no problem testing the player on knowing those mechanics. As such, the game will undoubtedly feel far stiffer and more unforgiving than it actually is, at least on normal (on harder difficulties it is a true test of abilities). It looks great, especially the lighting, smoke, and character models - although animation suffers a bit.Overall, I think RE6 is worth playing. It is fun and engaging and more accessible than RE5. If you can get into it, you will find a ton of game - this game is bigger than virtually every single non-open world action game this generation, and is extremely repayable. Considering the scale and variety, you are almost certain to find something you like. At the same time, you are almost certain to find something you don't. That is what happens when you try to split the baby the way Capcom does here. For now, I'll take it, but I hope next time Capcom settles on a formula and perfects it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}

Good luck downloading Uncharted on one game card, or BlazBlue, it's not worth paying 65 and 55 bucks to be able to avoid physical media taking up half your card. And the Tester videos, just watch them on your PS3 or get a 32GB card.They really need to release higher capacity cards, 32GB is plenty for a lot of downloaded content, but thank god for physical media so you can get more for your Memory Cards. However I am not a fan of wasting bandwith and having to delete/download constantly and I hate buying multiple cards to get around this, 8GB should be plenty for most casual gamers that do not plan on putting any games from the PSP, especially if you are going the physical route for Vita games. However, if you are going digital, keep the games small.Star Rating:0 for the Price, once this is around 9.99-14.99 this will be more reasonable.1 1/2 rounded up to 2 for the Storage Capacity.Updated: February 13, 2013, all games, movies, patch/dlc data and PlaystationMobile games updated","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

The fourth installment has incredible detail, wonderful graphics, lots to do, and a great replay value. With the addition of religion, leader traits, and a whole new technology tree, Civilization 4 is my absolute favorite next to Simcity 4000. Religion needs some polishing because it seems to be non-important later in the game and seems like its not even there. The only bug is the fact that a archer sometimes can defeat a gunpowder unit which is odd. It reminds me of the Phalanx unit in the previous Civilization where it somehow holds out against a tank.Basically you are in charge of a civilization (there are many to choose from) and you lead them from the stone age to the space age. You have to create cities, spend your gold pieces wisely on research and happiness, and possibly building projects. These projects outside of buildings such as granaries and barracks are called World of Wonder or a Natonial Wonder. There are loads of wonders between the 2 of them so be careful, you only can build a certain amount of each within each of your cities.  The addition of Great Leaders adds a value to the game that sometimes in other games waters it down and gives you an idea as to who will win. This is not the case. For instance, the Great General can bind your units together and give them expierence points where you can upgrade them. These upgrades can be: strength, extra defense, healing, extra strike, and many others. A Great Artist can give any of your cities a culture boost or give a city a \"shot in the arm,\" which means you can get extra prodiction and/or culture.With the addidtion of 2 expansions this game went from outstanding to amazing just like that.Some minor bugs have been fixed with the exception of early units defeating more advanced units as I stated above. Anyone complaining about it not being polished and horrible are dead wrong. When this game was released it was incredibly strong and hardly buggy. It's a lot better than most games that are released! I preordered it and recieved it when it was released. I was able to get the box that contained the tech tree and extras that included a Sid Meier interview. Not bad but if you get this edition or the one with no extras, there is no difference in price and its not jaw dropping material.Playing it immediatly, I was astonished and very satisfied. Yes I am guilty of the \"just one more turn\" thinking. This is an absolute for empire-building fans, people who like to explore, war, diplomacy, work the land and recources, and strategy fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2007"}

{"product_name":"B005C7R950","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"We're getting there.","reviewText":"Let's face it- the original Marvel vs Capcom 3 was pretty disappointing. The whole thing felt rushed, some characters were clearly overpowered (hey, just like in MvC2!), online gameplay was a nightmare, and it lacked polish. It was obvious that another iteration was going to come out, and as soon as Ultimate was announced, I sold my copy without hesitation. The final weeks leading up to UMvC3's release had me hyped, since I couldn't wait to get what could be the 'true' version of the game. While it's definitely better than the original, Ultimate still has its share of problems. It's only been out for a few weeks, but character balance is still an issue, though not quite as much, and people are still throwing hissy fits over the lack of MegaMan for some reason. But if you're looking for a much better online mode, Ultimate is for you, and you should pick it up. For anyone else who didn't get into MvC3 or is new to the Versus line, you really need to rent this game, as describing how it plays will only do so much.I'll talk about the gameplay first for the newcomers. You select three characters for your team to fight against others. Each character is given a unique assist move that you can use during battle. You'll need to use assists with some strategy if you want to really get good at the game, but if you're playing this game for casual fun, you can spam them like there's no tomorrow and still get something out of it. Every character's moves are different- some can shoot fireballs, others can counter physical attacks, some provide barriers, etc. Fighting is a lot faster than something like Street Fighter, and being patient and waiting for the right moment to strike is not a good way to play UMvC3. Sometimes a character will be killed as soon as they're in a combo. No joke- you can bring someone new out, only to have them get launched up into the air and beaten into oblivion before doing anything, only to have your next character come out. The moves in this game are light attack, medium attack, heavy attack and the special launcher move, similar to the Dust attack from the Guilty Gear series. It's the move that throws your opponent in the air, allowing you to go nuts with combos and team attacks. The other buttons call out your other team members to use their assist attacks, and holding the assist buttons down switch out to the selected character. Everyone has unique Super attacks too, like the Ultras in Street Fighter 4, and if you have enough meter, you can break out your whole team to use all of their Super moves at once, usually dealing massive damage. The game's crazy, and if you haven't seen any gameplay videos, you need to in order to get just how nuts it is. Plain and simple- it's not for everyone, and I even get frustrated with the game a lot, but that's mostly because I'm still relatively new to tag team-based fighting games (Guilty Gear X2 Accent Core Plus, The Last Blade 2, Street Fighter 3: Third Strike and Capcom vs SNK 2 are what I'm used to).Alright, for those who played the original, how much did this new version fix, and how much did it mess things up? Well, hardcore fighting game fans will already know most of this, as the majority of the changes had to do with fixing moves and balancing characters out...well, most of them. Characters that barely got used in the original, like Hsien-Ko and MODOK, aren't much better here, and it's painful to see them still getting pulverized. Others that were stupidly overpowered and practically button masher-friendly (ie- Wolverine) got toned down, but are still very good. And then there's Wesker. Oh Mr. Alberto Del Wesker...what were they thinking? Look, I'm not whining about this by any means, but taking one of the top 5 characters in regular MvC3 and making him even better makes you wonder what goes on at Capcom behind closed doors. Now, he has a mini-X Factor. You'll notice that Wesker's glasses take damage during the fight, going from semi-damaged, to badly damaged, to destroyed. Each of these phases adds to his power, and if he has level 3 X Factor without his glasses, all hell breaks loose. The only thing to make it somewhat fair is that when Wesker is tagged or snapped out, his glasses are back on when he comes back in. But the fact remains, he's overpowered, and there better be a patch coming out soon to fix this. Enough people threw a fit over Sentinel in MvC3 to the point where his health was severely cut down, so there's gotta be a chance for this to be fixed too. Dark Phoenix is still a threat as well, but her health was taken down a bit to give players more of a chance.Now for the new characters- most of them rock. Sadly, so many people are upset that x character from MvC2 wasn't put in (you'll always hear about Venom, Gambit, MegaMan and Cable) and are against the new characters for no good reason, but these guys are so much better than I expected, that I might have a team consisting of just new dudes. Hawkeye is VERY good and probably the best zoning character in the game. Firebrand has some great tools at his disposal, you just have to spend some time learning how and went to use them. Rocket Raccoon and Strider have very low health but some incredibly fast and useful moves to make up for it...I could go on about everyone. And it seems like we'll be getting 6 more new characters through DLC somewhere down the road, as there are 3 extra spaces on the character selection screen (filled up with Marvel and Capcom logos) next to the other DLC characters Shuma and Jill. Here's hoping that we get a couple of ladies and maybe Bishop.Aside from Arcade mode, there are a few extra ways to play, the main one being Online. Trust me- it got a big makeover and you no longer have to go back to the main menu when you can't find a game. Remember how stupid that was? Everything is much easier, you can watch matches in progress instead of just seeing two profiles thrusting at eachother, and I've noticed a lot less slowdown too. The old Mission mode is back, giving you a little schooling in some basic and advanced combos for every character. This mode is a must if you want to get decent at the game, and even when you do pass a stage, you'll want to do it over and over until it's effortless. There will also be a special mode to download soon that lets your characters equip special abilities for fun. This is its own gameplay mode and doesn't work its way into Ranked Online or anything. Do you want to be able to parry like in Third Strike? You'll be able to! Do you want a team with 3 of the same character? That'll be possible! Do you want to be invisible, confusing both your opponent and yourself? I don't know why you'd want to, but sure, you can do that too! This will no doubt be fun and be a nice break from regular online play.I really do love how much they improved the game, but with the character imbalance issues being nearly as bad as Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition [pre-2012 patch], that's the only thing holding it back from being 5 stars overall. Again, if you're new to the game, rent it first. If you played MvC3 before and are still on the fence about getting this one, you might as well since it's at a great price and has a lot more features. Now get out there, rip your shirt off, and start hitting people with dat pipe!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2011"}

Kinda.","reviewText":"A friend recently told me &#34;Borderlands 2 is the best FPS I've ever played&#34;.  Strong words, I thought!  So, I bought it used, sight unseen.  It's ok.  Here's why;- This game is too much:  Wayyyyy too many guns/shields/grenades to choose from.  I can't keep track of it all.  Not to mention that I've picked up guns accidentally, only to completely lose the gun I was using, which I liked.  Maybe it's a glitch?  Also along these lines are the fact that the enemies respawn - you never clear an area; start up a saved game, you have to slug your way through everyone on that level again.  It's tedious and annoying.- You can't save as you go:  You can save and quit - but I can't tell you the number of times I thought I accomplished something, saw the auto-save icon run, only to find I had to do it all over again the next time I loaded up the game.  Really tedious.- Graphics are good - I like the ability to snipe enemies.  Everything has that 3-d-cell-shaded look to it - a-la Crackdown.  I think the same people who made Crackdown made this - it's like a 3D version of that.  Control is pretty good - some guns have better control than others, etc.  I like the different effects on enemies; fire, shock, etc.- Sound is great - I like all the voices and effects.  Reload sounds on the guns are awesome, oddly enough.It just gets tedious.  You try to clear a level, maybe make it part way through and want to save it, but if you do, you'll just have to do it all over again when you re-load the game.  Or if you leave an area and come back, you have to kill everyone all over again.  It's just tedious.  I don't know if I'd recommend it.  Certainly not the best FPS ever.

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Preferred Sar Fox Assault, but this is a good game for Star War Fans for sure","reviewText":"Liked it, but it wasn't my thing.

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"wrrc","summary":"Good intro to a classic series","reviewText":"Here's the 1987 debut of a now legendary series.

Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"Really the next best thing to Halo.","reviewText":"When I saw some of the reviews from Gamespot and IGN, I thought the game was a let down. I still rented it the first chance I got, and the reviews were wrong. The only place where the game suffers is multi player cooperative mode. This is really what made Halo so great, but in Brute Force the split screen seems to take away a lot of detail from the graphics and feeling. You won't enjoy this game in cooperative nearly as much as Halo.Brute Force really excels in single player mode, this is more of a single player game, where you control a team of 4 and get to use their different guns and abilities. You will also need to take care of your team members or you will suffer later in the mission. One time a pesky bomb made me lose Brutus early in the level, and later I really could have used him to spot guys among all the fog, and this costed me as I spend a lot of medical kits. Basically it feels like Halo only it's in 3rd person and it's all up to you with 4 different guys and different abilities to use. The team members that your not currently controlling still fight with you, and let you know when they are taking hits and need medical kits.Many critics of the game argue that the different abilities don't really play much of a role, and that you don't necessarily need them to pass a level. This is true to some point, I mean if you 100% needed a certain ability from a certain team member then you would fail a mission as soon as you lost that certain member. What it really does is increases the success rate of the mission by having these different characters and using their abilities wisely. And it's very natural, it never feels like your trying to solve a puzzle thinking what character would be good for what area, that's not what the game is about. The main characters are Brutus and Tex. Tex can get the best guns, using Brutus really helps your vision and you can spot enemies very clearly, not to mention recover HP while doing so. The girls play smaller roles, they aren't as good but that's not a bad thing. Girls probably wouldn't be as good in real life either. Overall it's just an awesome single player experience. It's the next best thing to Halo in action shooters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2003"}

N","summary":"Tri-ace cooks up another excellent game...","reviewText":"First of all, I am so tired of how people think Square-Enix made this game - NO! Square-Enix did not make this game, they only presented it and slapped their logo on it (which isn't a bad thing, as Square is awesome), but give credit where it's due people! Okay, my rant is over, I'll begin the review.Being a fan of Star Ocean: The Second Story that I am, the debut of Star Ocean 3 is the one of the reasons I finally broke down and brought a PSX2, even if the hardware is the weakest of all the systems, both in in power and durabilty.On the positive side, Star Ocean 3 improves on its predecessor in many ways. Unlike Star Ocean 2, everything is now 3D (could you imagine if Star Ocean 2 was fully 3D on the PSX, the PSX would probably burst into flames trying to play it!) While the graphics are good, they never quite reach the level of other RPG's such as Xenosaga or Final Fantasy (there are some obviously cut corners). This, however, is understandable as combat is much more chaotic, being there is much more going on on-screen at any given time in Star Ocean than either of the afformentioned titles. The fact their is no slowdown during battles is also a testiment to the game overall (the same can't be said for the rest of the game however).Combat has always been Star Ocean's claim to fame, and this installment delivers in spades. While combat was extremely fun in Star Ocean 2, it was rather simplistic in nature as it mainly consisted of pushing buttons to preform special attacks to maul your opponent. Star Ocean 3 adds an entirely new layer the combat system with the addition of a fury meter (which is a fancy word for a characters' or enemy's stamina). No longer can you attack rerentlessly without pausing for a short break for your character to catch their breath. Fury also acts a blocking and counterattack measure as well, forcing players to use their heads instead of mashing buttons.Item creation, Star Ocean's other claim to fame, has also recieved another impressive upgrade, now allowing you to customize your weapons and armor with various effects and factors. You can also hire people to create items for you while your exploring dungeons and the like.Unfortunately, as far as Star Ocean 3 climbs, their are a few things that hold it back. The fact you can only use three characters in battle (compared to four in Star Ocean 2) is a bit of a letdown. Overall the game itself it pretty easy (the story portion of the game that is - say your prayers for some of the optional areas within the game).Star Ocean 3's story is probably the game's biggest stumbling block. It's not the story is not good (although it is slow to develop, just like in Star Ocean 2), but it's this element of the game that will ultimately end up being the deciding factor if players will enjoy Star Ocean 3 or not (I know it was for me - I liked the story and it's various twists, but then at the same time I didn't ~ talk about an enigma!).I definately would recommend Star Ocean 3 to any RPG fan, especially since there wasn't a new Final Fantasy title in 2004, but again, this game is not for everyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2005"}

You play as Daniel who dies in a car accident along with his wife. While she went to Heaven he got stuck in Purgatory and winds up getting involved in a religious war between Lucifer and the heavens. Lucifer wants to take over so Daniel is sent to stop him. While the story is semi-interesting is doesn't really go anywhere except for a few terribly made, low-resolution, CG cut scenes (I mean pre-PSX bad).The game is all about shooting and it does it well. You get five different weapons through the game (I know very low variety) and you just blast hordes of enemies coming at you from all angles. Each weapon has a secondary fire like the mini-gun launches rockets, the shotgun has freeze shells, the stake launcher has a grenade launcher etc. Using both in tandem is important because certain enemies and situations will suit different weapons. Even the area you're in will affect this as well. The shooting is solid and fast paced and ammo pick-ups are a top priority. You can pick up coins which are used to be able to equip tarot cards that act as perks. These are also essential to staying alive especially during boss fights.The game is really just shooting hordes (the AI just runs at you), but you can easily die due to sheer numbers. There's no cover, no special powers, just you and your gun. Every environment in Painkiller is very different so it's nice to always look forward to the next level. Not one is alike and even the boss fights are massive, tough, and rewarding to bring down. When you kill every enemy in an area the next area will unlock and you can move on. This proves a problem some times when there's on straggler left behind and you can't find him to move on. The little bit of platforming is floaty and badly done as well and should have been left out or tested a little more. While the environments and are looks nice navigating some of these levels can be a pain due to the terrible compass cursor and maze like hallways.Another thing I like are the huge variety in enemy types. Some of the designs are crazy, gross, creepy, and downright weird. A lot of the time the enemies go along with the level, so it kind of feels like playing a pop-up book. The physics engine was highly regarded when the game came out, but seems dated compared to today. Over the years the game got visual upgrades, so I highly recommend one of the new versions which actually looks pretty nice for it being such an old game. The multiplayer is what kept people coming back, but you will rarely find anyone playing these days. Overall Painkiller is a great shooter just to kill things and shoot bullets. It's solid, smooth, and you can adjust the difficulty for every type of gamer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Finally finished Heavenly Sword. Similar to my experience with Dead Space, this is a game that I quit about a year ago and then came back to it to finish it. This is a very good game but if you read any of the reviews for this game, you might think this game has a lot in common with God of War. This is not true at all. With the exception that you have light attack with square, heavy attacks with Triangle and dodge with the left right stick, everything else about this game feels completely different. There are two God of War copies out there and they are Dante's Inferno and Conan the Barbarian(you can read my reviews for those games separately.)In this game, with the exception of the final battle, you never really feel like you are leveling up or getting any more power(a staple of God of War) Also, there is no magic, no ranged weapon to speak of(I am referring when you play as Nariko, you can throw objects and guide with aftertouch but I never used this unless a puzzle required it,) no other weapons to use, no weapon or power upgrades.That being said, despite not being much like God of War, this is still a very good game which is worth giving a try if you have never played this before. Boss battles are tough but entertaining and quite an accomplishment when you beat them. Graphics are lush and gorgeous with some truly awesome set piece battles. YOu can read most of the other reviews for details of the story, etc.I thought that I should cover a few of the negatives though and the reason why this game does not deserve a 5 star rating.Frame rate: Boy I can see the flames already!! No the frame rate does not drop much during the actual gameplay. At least not enough to effect gameplay. Framerate appears to be a steady 30 frames or so per second throughout. No 60FPS Dante's Inferno here. What do I mean by frame rate then? The oddest thing is that the framerate drops during cutscenes!! Nothing more annoying the seeing a cutscene which is beautifully created and supposed to be impressive and instead watch a damn slide show!! I think the reason for this is that game loading is happening during the cutscene and this game(created just a year or so after the intro of the PS3) just wasn't optimized for this kind of multitasking. To make matters worth, the sluggish framerate during cutscenes also makes the lip synching be attrocious during cutscenes as well. By the middle of the game, the cutscenes work pretty well but the first half of the game drove me crazy!!Load times: Augghhhh!! What can I say? When you have just died fighting a boss, you do not want to wait nearly 20 seconds to reload your spot?? Has anyone played Uncharted 1 or 2? Those games are impressive visually but feature no load times at all!! Even stranger, those games do not do Hard Drive installs like Heavenly Sword but just load faster!! I really felt I had to address this as NO ONE has ever said this in any of the reviews I have seen. I am currently playing Dark Sector(will review when game complete) and this is another game with no load times after dying and nearly no visible loads even going from one stage to the next.That is about it!!! Despite a couple negatives and the fact that this is NOT God of War or a God of War copy, this is an excellent action game which PS3 owners should be proud to add to their collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}

Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"Ghostbusters Nostalgia Helping to Gloss Over Problems","reviewText":"I had been eagerly awaiting this game for over a year, as I believe the original release date was supposed to be last year. I finally got it in the mail and loaded it up to experience a since of nostalgia as the famous Ghostbusters music blared. Your character is a no-name recruit who gets to work aside the original cast, all voiced by the real actors, and the graphics immediately gripped me, along with the nostalgia and I was hooked--but not for long.The story takes place shortly after \"Ghostbusters 2\" and has you revisting most of the locations from the first Ghostbuster movie (i.e. the library and the Sedgewick Hotel, etc.). You also battle some familar ghosts (i.e. Slimer, etc.). The plot also involves Gozer and more or less pays homage to the first movie, while kind of ignoring the second one (which is fine by me).The graphics are spot on with the character models and weapons and vehicles. You will be amazed how detailed everything is, including the locations. The variety of locales is nice, but you often find yourself repeating some venues. The sound and music are all on-spot with Elmer Bernstein's classic score played throughout the action and cutscenes. Some of the sound effects can catch you off-guard and spook you a little which is always a good thing.All of the original cast do a great job voice acting their original roles; there is a lot of the same comedy and it certainly helped with the original screenwriters.The gameplay is a mixed bag and really makes this a 3 star game, which isn't bad, but isn't great either. It's not hard to control your character per se, except for maybe the run button being mapped to the circle button for some reason. Controlling your weapons is another story. I think the game company got caught up in adding so many secondary fire modes and additional weapons that they never made any one weapon really that good. You'll spend most of the game with the traditional particle beam weapon as seen in the movie. There are other beam weapons such as the one that shoots out a freezing-like beam; one that shoots out green slime; and one that acts almost like a fast response gun. You will find annoying the short length of time you can use any of them before having to hit the button to \"vent\" them; this usually happens in the middle of a battle when you don't have the time.  The PKG goggles are a bit gimmicky, but do help you locate some ghosts and more specifically add to Tobin's Spirit Guide info you may find interesting and sometimes useful (i.e. weaknesses of the ghosts, etc.)The teammate AI is perhaps one of the worst I have seen in a game in a long while. Not only are they incapable of holding their own, they rely on you to risk your own death to go \"recover\" them, which is a quick press of the X button when close to them. Most times this results in you falling down and you hoping there is a Ghostbuster around to return the favor--most times there is not or you can hear them coming and they get knocked down and it's \"Game Over.\" Often, you and only one other Ghostbuster will be in a certain area. The ghosts will gang up (wait till you get to the graveyard battle--you'll know it) and throw a lot at you and if you aren't saving your fellow Ghostbuster constantly, you will most certainly die. Dying wouldn't be as bad if it didn't have a ridiculously long load time. (Mind you, the game does an install on the PS3's HDD, so why such a long load time every time you die?)Among the issues above that seriously take their toll on your enjoyment as the game progresses, there are some inexplicable glitches (one in the library) where your character will just freeze for no reason (and it's not part of the game). Not often and definitely not something that bothered me too much, but it shows a lack of polish.I've read a lot of high score reviews and can't help think they are based on the feeling of nostalgia. This is the BEST Ghostbusters video game ever released. I can't deny that. Was it fun? Yes, though it was short (about 7-8hrs). I recommend as a rental or as a purchase when the price comes down some. It is a good example of how movies and games can become seamless these days. With more polish, better AI, and a reduction in load times, it would easily be a 4+ star game. Hopefully any sequel will take these flaws into account.3/5 starsPros:*Superb graphics and sound.*Great voice acting and nice plot that ties in with the first Ghostbuster movie.*Nice selection of weapons.*AI for the enemies is pretty good.*Nice variety of locations.Cons:*Load times. (Inexcusable for a game that has a HDD install.)*The worst AI in regards to your teammates.*Running is mapped to an inconvenient button.*The targeting is not always great.*It is short at 7-8hrs.*Minor glitches.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2009"}

With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad.

Basically Level 5 took what should be a 12 hour game and used time wasting methods to stretch that out to 30 hours. To see things through to the end, you'll need a mountain of patience and a bit of a masochistic streak (especially for the last boss).

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"","summary":"Best game in a long time!","reviewText":"This is the best game I have played in a long time.

If you don't have surround sound, you are missing out. My two gripes are the lack of surround and the fact that the controls are 100% customizable. True, you can make many changes, but I was unable to make it the way I wanted and ended up using a default setting, which was really no big deal.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.The return of Commander Shepard.View larger.A new cast of characters.View larger.Along with familiar faces from the past.View larger.New damage and dialogue systems.View larger.Integration with original game.View larger.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I purchased ME2 in April 2012 and paid 13 bucks for it. The seller was GeeksWholesaler.Mass Effect 2 is a quality production just like the first game.  The graphics are great, the voice acting and dialogue are very well done, the storyline continues and is expanded on, and the controls work well.  I thought there was a good balance between RPG and action; and the cut scenes are well done too. This game plays like a movie; you interact with characters, you watch cut scenes that take you from one situation to another, and then drop you into the action to continue the story.  Lots of fun, and very good story telling.There was one disappointment for me: the strong language.  It was noticeably more than ME1.  If you want to avoid much of it, then don't interact much with Jack or Zaeed.  Aliens don't swear, so you're always safe talking to non-humans! (or choosing them as squadmates)Regarding downloadable content (DLC)...I played the game with the following free DLCs:* Cerberus Arc Projector* Cerberus Weapon Armor* Hammerhead Firewalker Pack* Normandy Crash Site* Zaeed - The Price of RevengeAfter playing game, and since I liked it so much, I purchased these DLCs:* Arrival* Kasumi* Overlord* ShadowBrokerI have not played the above 4 DLCs yet; when I re-play ME2, then I'll play them.I highly recommend the Mass Effect series, including Mass Effect 2.

{"product_name":"B004CVWETI","description":"","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"A Modern RPG With A \"Classic RPG\" Feel To It...","reviewText":"Well, I'm always up for a good RPG.  When I saw this come out some time ago, I was mildly interested, but I had a ton of other games to get to in the backlog, so I mostly ignored it.  Then I noticed the overflow of gushing positive reviews, and also, subsequently, the insane scarcity and price inflation of this game.  Then, of course, I thought \"oh my gosh, I'd better grab one before they end up getting so expensive that it costs $300 and a kidney just to get one!\".  That's when I procured my very own copy from the Wild West land of ebay - only to have it sit on a shelf for a couple months.  Yes, I was still very much mired in that backlog I spoke of earlier.  No matter, though, I've gotten to it now!  So, having gotten so expensive in such a short amount of time, I've got great expectations for this game!  This must be the greatest RPG ever!!!  Or at least it has to be a a decent one...Graphics (score 8/10): Radiant Historia features 2-D sprite animations that'll seem instantly familiar to anyone who's played a lot of older RPGs (such as Final Fantasy VI or Lunar: Silver Star Story).  I must say, for using 2-D sprites the animations look great!  They may be remniscent of older games, but they are wholly modern in their lovely crisp details.  As for the environmental graphics, they are not bad at all considering the system.  The environments have great amounts of detail in them and a great sense of size and scale is achieved despite the small screen size of the DS.  Also, whenever anyone speaks, a portrait with their name pops up so you can see detailed versions of what the characters look like.  I rather like this stylistic choice because it makes it easy to see what characters really look like, and it helps the simpler-looking sprites not feel so graphically limiting.  As for the art style itself, anyone who's ever played an RPG of Japanese origin in their life can clearly see the anime influence in the art style.  Some people may not enjoy this type of art style, but I love it so I was quite pleased.  Lastly, I should mention that there aren't any pre-rendered \"cutscenes\" per se, as all the scenes are played out with in-game character models/graphics only.  Some people might think this would make the game boring, but I hardly noticed it at all because the in-game graphics are handled so well.  In fact, I was almost too caught up in the great storyline to notice...Music (score 9/10): No voice acting here, but that's okay.  As for the background music, it's great!  There's a good variety of musical tracks, and they are all sufficiently complex and interesting to keep them from getting boring.  It's not the greatest soundtrack of all time or anything, but it's darn good!Characters (score 9/10): I just came out of playing Final Fantasy XIII recently, and just let me say that I never thought I'd have to start an RPG with the immediate litmus test question of \"do I hate these characters?\"  You can probably guess that FFXIII was not a great experience for me, but at least I've now got a newfound appreciation for characters who don't make you want to kill them within the first 30 minutes of gameplay.  But enough about FFXIII - I'm very happy to say that I like the characters of Radiant Historia.  I like Stock, the protagonist - he's a quiet aloof guy but not a complete jerk either.  I like everyone else who joins the party later too.  I even like Aht, who's a child character - and most child characters in games are annoying beyond all reason!  I also felt that there was a lot of subtle but good characterizations - I got a feel for everyone's personalities without them being shoved down my throat.  As for the villains, they are quite good too.  I like the fact that there is more than one villain and they all have varied motivations for doing what they do - and they don't always line up with each other.  It made their interactions with each other seem more complex and realistic.  There are even distinctive NPCs (like Kiel) who pop up in the story, many of whom I became attached to.Story (score 8/10): You start off as Stocke, a member of a Military Intelligence organization who does secret missions.  It's during the middle of a war in which an evil empire is constantly trying to invade your small country.  Now Stock and his allies must find a way to defeat the empire and save their country...and the world.  Does this story sound familiar?  Maybe from every old-school RPG ever made?  Yeah, you might be thinking that this doesn't sound very original at all and must therefore be quite boring.  You'd be wrong!  While the setup seems very clich&eacute;, Radiant Historia quickly shows the player that they have a few new tricks up their sleeves.  In fact, the biggest point of interest is the introduction of time travel.  It's not the traditional time travel you may be thinking of, but instead you get to experience two different branches of history based on what decisions you make throughout the game.  These are not simple story branches leading to multiple endings either; you literally need to play both branches to get further in the game since what you do in one branch can affect the other.  I had a ton of fun seeing what results my alternate choices made in the historical timeline, and it doesn't feel like tedious backtracking too much (although sometimes it does get slightly confusing remembering what you did in one timeline vs the other).  Overall, I'd say this game puts a fresh spin on what could've been a dull and overworn plot concept, and the story is solid and entertaining enough to keep one engaged the whole way through.  As a side note, I'd like to mention that this game has absolutely no romance in the main plot - which is amazing considering how often you see them in RPGs.  Don't get me wrong, I like romances, it's just nice to have an RPG where you don't have to automatically assume that the first female character in the party is going to be a stereotypical love interest.  It's rather refreshing.Battle System (score 9/10): You know what I like about this battle system?  After playing a slew of newer RPGs, it just feels nice to play one with a good solid turn-based battle system with no gimmicks and no crap.  Every mechanic works and feels simple and easy to understand while still having enough complexity to it to keep the player interested.  First off you have the simple menu options an RPG player would expect such as Attack, Guard, Skills, Item, etc.  It's not all completely standard, though, as there is a also a nice grid system in place.  Basically, you can use skills (which consume MP) to move enemies around the grid and shove them together for nice combo attacks.  Chaining together combo attacks is an important part of gameplay and a fun battle mechanic in general.  I'd also like to mention the difficulty progression feels smooth and gradual (well, except for this one point near Ch. 4 when you're fighting for Celestia and I suddenly had to grind quite a bit, but after that, a huge difficulty spike never happened again), and I never felt like the game was overly difficult or required an intense amount of grinding.  Overall, Radiant Historia has a good solid battle system, and I'm thoroughly pleased with it!Gameplay (score 9/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, what can I say here?  The menus all work, and the pacing of the game is good.  I really like the fact that you can play this game entirely with the stylus OR entirely with the buttons (I prefer not using the stylus for turn-based RPGs as it can get tiring on the hand).  I also appreciate the game having a detailed outline of events that happen in both timelines so you don't get the story confused, and it also records sidequest events.  I don't really have much to complain about.  In fact, remember that time traveling mechanic I mentioned in the story section?  The levels your characters get in one timeline carries over to the other!  That's awesome!  I also love the fact that you can skip cutscenes by just pressing the Start button (which is essential if you time travel back to a point that has a ton of cutscenes you've already viewed).  If I had one complaint though, I'd have to complain that there aren't enough \"active nodes\" you can return to.  Active nodes are the points in history which you can time travel back to; if you leave one timeline to go to another, you could lose some of your progress from events past the most recent node and have to go through certain events again.  I'd like to say that's my only complaint, but I can think of one more little irritant: every time you time travel or even sometimes after a scene, the game switches out your party members, even if you have access to the members that you had already selected!  It's annoying to have to keep remembering to switch my party members back!  Other than those two things, though, I don't have any other complaints.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  It has all the charm of an older classic RPG but with the smooth gameplay conveniences of a modern RPG.  It doesn't get much better than that!  I daresay Radiant Historia is proof positive that an RPG doesn't need the flashiest graphics around nor does it doesn't to be an \"action game\" to still be awesome.  So if you are a fan of traditional RPGs and are looking for a good satisfying RPG to enjoy, try picking up Radiant Historia.  It's well worth the money!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2012"}

The wording and phrasing from the description seems to make this product required for all 360 fat models...but that's not really true. In fact, it's not at all true. This product will kill your 360 faster with it on than not having one at all.If you're thinking about getting this thing, then don't. I got it when I got my second xbox and within 10 months, my xbox died. It couldn't even last a whole year. Wow! I had this thing plugged in every time I was playing and it seemed to work. But, actually, it wasn't really doing anything and making things worse for me in the long run.If you really think about it, what it does is suck up air that the 360 fans already blew out. There is no point to doing this. Why do you need a device that sucks in the air that was already blew out from the 360 so that the air will blew out again? Also, the intercooler doesn't suck up more air than the 360's fans didn't already blow out. You would think that's what the intercooler did but it didn't.  How could it? Those 2 big fans and 1 small fan could not over power the 2 way bigger fans from the 360 itself? So, they didn't.All the intercooler did was hold in the hot air that was blow out in itself and then it will slowly blow out the hot air from itself. You would think it was doing it's job because when you feel the air coming out it was cool air.  Well, if was cool air coming out because the device was holding back the hot air and when the air finally came out from the device it turned into cool air.  That's not good. You want hot air to come out so that the 360 isn't keeping the hot air inside of it. When the device did this it caused more damage to the 360 than without it.The only good thing that it really did was keep dust out because the thing would stay after the 360 was off and continue to suck out hot air....but still it wasn't enough because the 360 was still hot after that and would trap the hot air in because the Nyko product was blocking the air vents. Doing that also caused more damage to the 360 than without it.Don't get this thing unless you want to have your 360 to die!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Edward B.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

First off the intro movie graphics are outstanding as is the the soundtrack, this is to be expected however.  Easily picked up by fans of the first Soul Calibur on DC (perhaps too easily) the GC controller in the new version feels much more intuitive and controls in a smoother manner.The biggest change besides the graphics update, is the change in missions. Instead of fighting for credits to buy art and other unlockables as in the first one you fight for new weapons in SC II and this makes all the difference.  While uncovering a piece of fan art for 500 pts was fun in the old one opening up the cat claws for Voldo with 800 points is much more satisfying.For those in need of a challenge the game also ramps up the difficulty in a nice even manner throughout the missions, making this the heart of the game.  With less characters to unlock and maybe too many of the original characters returning this game still manages to annihilate the competition.

In a nutshell, it attaches to the bottom of your GameCube, and allows you to play virtually all Game Boy Advance games as well as older Game Boy Color and Game Boy games via the GameCube on TV.  Well you won't get progressive-scan HD screens or 5.1 surround sound native GameCube games offer, but the Game Boy Advance games I've tried simply look great.  Surrounded by a frame of your choice, the games fill up the TV screen, offering graphic details that you surely have missed while playing on the Game Boy Advance or GBA SP's small screen.  Also the games look brighter and more colorful on a TV monitor, making them much more enjoable.  And, of course, for gamers with big hands like myself, using the GameCube controller is an added plus.Any cons?  Nothing significant.  My only minor gripe is snapping on and off the Game Boy Player takes a bit of an effort, so if you plan to travel with the least amount of weight and volume, this might be a minor annoyance.  But really, this doesn't even apply to 99% of us.  Simply leaving the Game Boy Player on at all times is fine.If there's one accessory you want from Santa, be sure to make the Game Boy Player your #1 wish.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2003"}

In other respects, it has quite a few shortcomings.  The game is very similar to \"Godfather\" and \"GTA\" in the controls, look and overall feel to the game.  The storyline picks up as a sequel to the movie and you play as Tony Montana, working your way back up the food chain and re-establishing yourself as drug lord.  Many of the characters from the movie show up in the game and the story line is decent.  Fans of the movie will enjoy seeing the parallels between the game and the film.Unlike \"Godfather\" or \"GTA\", the game is completely mission driven.  You no longer have the ability to abandon a mission if you are being cut to ribbons.  There is really no point in being able to explore the city as there is nothing to do or find.  The voice acting is good and although Pacino is not on board, the actor sounds enough like him to be believable.  The comments Tony makes are hysterical (and completely inappropriate) at times but there is a good bit of repetition.  The music can be annoying but can also be turned off or you can set custom lists to avoid some of the REALLY bad songs.  The controls are easy to learn and the graphics of the game are good, looking essentially like the GTA games with a bit less detail.  The game can get repetitive as you continually purchase and sell drugs, trick out your mansion, etc.  Overall, the game was a bit disappointing though and not worth the hype or the hefty price tag.  Rent it or pick it up on clearance if you are a fan of the movie but I thought Godfather was actually a much better game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"It's Okay, But Just Doesn't Quite Feel Right","reviewText":"Judged purely by the standards of gameplay, \"Wind Waker\" is a pretty decent game.  It is sprawling (like \"Ocarina\") and straightforward (unlike \"Majora\"), and can be picked up by veteran or amateur alike.  The problem?  It just doesn't FEEL like a Zelda game.To me, Zelda games are supposed to be epic.  The reason \"Ocarina\" was so great was, in large part, because of its engaging storyline.  Every temple had something to look forward to in terms of new characters, while the overall Zelda/Gannon plot just sucked you right in with its epic-style storytelling.  By the same token, this is where \"Majora\" was lacking for me, as the game was so confined to the three-day time period.  \"Wind Waker\" falls somewhere between the two.The graphics (cartoons, this time) are what make the game feel so different.  Instead of an \"epic\" nature, it is instead more silly and light-hearted.  Like I said, in terms of overall gameplay the more \"fun\" approach is just fine.  However, being a rather \"slow\" (takes me a long time to beat games like this) gamer, I couldn't really bring myself to maintain a high level of interest.Overall, \"Wind Waker\" will always (fairly or not) be known as the \"cartoon one\".  While the game itself isn't bad, the overall experience just isn't quite worthy of the Zelda name.  Play for as a simple adventure, but if you are looking for high \"canon\" material than you might be a bit disappointed in the new approach.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"It's hard to review this really","reviewText":"Nintendo for some reason tends to be stubborn. While they offer great games, they also have this attitude that they should stand out above all others with innovations and this doesn't always succeed. Remember Virtual Boy? Did you actually buy one, and still have it? Thought so. While Sony and Sega(and literally everyone except handhelds) were doing CD based games, Nintendo still came up with Nintendo 64, which took cartridges. They'll drop the brand new Nintendo DS which has the touch screen ability where you move a pen-like thing around the screen. Different yes but can you imagine how many games will actually use this? And most importantly, instead of online play, they opt for connectivity with the GBA/SP and let's face it, only 2 games really utilize this: this game and Zelda Four Swords. But anyway, onto the game.Who knew a Final Fantasy game would have very little plot? Basically, the world is covered in a mist called miasma which is lethal to people so they discovered a way to repel this with massive crystals inside towns. Trouble is, they have to be replenished so they send 2-3 caravans to recharge it with myrrh, a mysterious substance you get from trees. That's it. There's no character development, no real big plot twists. Even Zelda Four Swords had a bigger plot than this.While the story leaves much to be desired, the graphics are astonishing. The character designs are cute, the world's are rich and detailed, spells are fantastic, and let's not forget those cute redesigned moogles(they look fluffier here).I didn't get far but as far as I could tell, there was only one bit of voice acting: a narrator which tells you a story of the dungeon/level you visit. The music has a folk/Celtic feel to it which, while doesn't have anything has stunning as Liberi Fatali or Aeris's Theme, it does fit the world.As you've most likely have heard, you can hook up 4 GBA's to play it to it's potential. This may seem cumbersome(either you end up buying all 4 which is stupid to be honest with you or finding 3 friends who happen to have GBA's), it honestly is some of the most fun you'll have playing a game.As for the gameplay, it's so-so. In order to traverse the world, either a moogle or a friend in multiplayer carries a chalice which protects you from the miasma. Like the review, it's a ridiculous idea that hinders gameplay, especially in multiplayer. Actions are done by cycling through either Attack, Items or the spells you've collected. You'll have find yourself attacking when you should cure yourself cause you didn't cycle properly. You can create bigger, powerful spells if you and your friends time your spells in the same spot but since everyone pretty much goes on their own time, it'll probably miss. The other thing is the spells(or magicites as they're called) can't be taken with you when you leave a dungeon which means you have to find them again in the new dungeons. Ugh.Despite the many problems it has, it's probably one of the most fun you'll have in multiplayer but I very much suggest it. I end up playing single player as I only have one friend who has a GBA and he's busy most of the time but if you have friends with a GBA each, then definately check this out but you'll notice some problems along the way.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2004"}

Well at least, those that were based directly on the new trilogy films.  Phantom Menace left us yawning, Attack of the Clones didn't quite cut it, but Revenge of the Sith manages to do what the previous games did not: hold interest and provide a fun, if later too much of a challenging time.Following the events of Episode III with a bit of liberty on the designer's part, this action game puts you in control of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi as they battle against the CIS and try to restore peace and order to the galaxy.  Along the way, they both will acquire new abilities, and face deadly enemies both familiar and new.Each character plays surprisingly differently.  Obi-Wan is slower but more precise, but Anakin is faster and more powerful with his hits.  Though they both learn the same force powers (until Anakin turns to the Dark Side, at which point he learns Sith Lightning), they will learn different combat abilities that set them apart from one another.  Anakin is skilled at delivering instantly fatal finishing moves, whereas Obi-Wan has powerful, hard-hitting combos that do a number on bosses on strong enemies, where Anakin's intstant kill moves would be useless.There are a mere 15 levels in the game, so you can blow through it pretty quickly.  The levels start out easy enough, but as with any Lucas licensed game, suddenly become frustratingly difficult.  You may revisit levels in an attempt to earn more experience out of them, but what is perhaps the most annoying aspect is that revisiting levels, despite all your new powers, may sometimes prove to be more challenging than the levels you currently play on!  For example, when you battle General Grievous the first time, he shouldn't be all that difficult to beat.  However, if you revisit the level in an attempt to find the secrets or gain a higher level of experience, you may find him so difficult to beat that you just want to put down the controller and stop playing.  Aside form the main game there are bonus missions that often put you in the shoes of other characters.  One mission allows you to romp around as General Grievous!  Unfortunately these missions are basic and are usually nothing more than 'kill as many enemies as you can before you die' missions.The targeting system in the game is undoubtedly one of the worst target-finding systems I have ever seen, period.  Instead of focusing on the largest, most imminent threat around you, the targeting system will often center on an inanimate object all the way on the otherside of the level, or on an enemy that is so far away it doesn't even realize that you're there.  This leads to many frustrating deaths and cheap hits from the enemies.  Other problems inclue the abysmal camera, which will often times swing around in such a position that you can't even see the action going on around you, and thus will get blasted to the next dimension by enemies you can't target and can't see.As you progress, many enemies become just too difficult to contend with.  Somehow, I can't see a frail nemoidian stopping a lightsaber with his barehands, or Darth Vader succumbing to a group of nemoidian wimps with cattle prods...but you'll find it here.  Even your combat abilities become so useless that you might as well just let them kill your character.Furthermore, the controls are awkward, unresponsive and clunky.  Many of the special moves listed in the command list just cannot be pulled off, simply because the directions become so jumbled, should the camera shift a centimeter or two.  You are usually reduced to the same button mashing combo over and over in a frantic attempt to defeat your enemies.  In the rare event you can pull off one of these confusing special moves, they are often deflected or rendered useless against the enemy.  Sometimes a button press will take up to 3 seconds to repond...other times there will be no response at all.  Make note of this before you try the game.It does have its good points however...the boss battles, particularly with those featuring Dooku and Grievous are intense.  The cinematic experience during gameplay is outstanding, and there is even footage that was cut from the movie inserted into the game!  Furthermore, some sequences that were intended to be in the movie, but were cut out completely, have been re-envisioned in the game, such as a battle with Grievous and his bodyguards on the Nemoidian battlecruiser, while it is tipped over sideways!There are other game modes, including a co-operative mode.  The co-op mode is nothing spectacular but it is fun to play with a friend.  There is also a lightsaber duel mode which is one of the game's highlights.  As you progress, you will unlock certain characters to play as, including Grievous, Dooku, Mace Windu, and others.  Sorry Dark Side fans, there is no Sidious here.  Instead of giving us what we want by adding Yoda and Sidious, we get two generic, unoriginal and boring Jedi characters that are blatant rip offs of Qui-Gon Jinn and other characters from the films.  However, there are 2 other characters, whom I will not spoil, that are well worth the price of admission!  Each character has an alternate look, but as usual with games of this type, you cannot choose the often times better alternate design, as it is left only for duplicate player battles.Overall the game is fun, but the unbeleivably frustrating difficulty as you advance higher, or even when you try to replay some levels, drags the game down.  The abysmal controls and camera work also hurt what would have been one of the best SW games to date.Huge fans of Star Wars, such as myself, will probably dig it.  Casual SW fans will find little redeeming quality.  The casual gamer will probably not like the game at all.  Try before you buy.  I'm still feeling a bit cheated at the lack of Sidious and Yoda as playable characters...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

The story draws you in and I always wanted to see what happened next.But what makes the game is its atmosphere.  Everything's dark and grainy and eerily quiet.  The monsters don't jump out at you, they stay well back and wait for you to come in range, but you never want to.

You'll swear you saw a shadow dart across the room at points when there really is nothing there.  The music tightens into haunting notes of urgency and finality as you approach the various evils of the game with only a pair of legs to run with and a gun, often with not nearly as many bullets as you'd like.The game isn't really about shooting but about avoiding.  You'll be glad you could shoot at many times, but real manstoppers like the shotgun you need to use sparingly as some enemies will laugh off everything else--not literally of course, there's no laughing here.I could go on and on, but suffice to say--I really love this game.

Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Jon L","summary":"It's like Modern Warfare with an updated gun collection and single player","reviewText":"I'm not very impressed with this game but in a different sense, I am.

{"product_name":"B000F3AADE","description":"Dead Rising follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, a freelance photojournalist after the scoop of a lifetime. In a small suburban town that's overrun by zombies, he escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be safe. Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Tedious and Repetitive...","reviewText":"How many times can slashing up zombies be interesting before it gets very, VERY old? That is the question 'Dead Rising' asks it's players as you play as a photojournalist sent to Willamette, Colorado (which must not be too far away from Raccoon City) to investigate a zombie outbreak in the town that has centered around the shopping mall.You're dropped off to the mall via helicopter and have a little over three days to investigate the \"truth\" behind the matter. Now, this game uses a Level-Up system to increase such abilities as speed and attack power as you kill more zombies, find out more scoops, rescue survivors, and learn more info about the outbreak. You level up via PP points. The good news is, you carry over these points for as long as you play the game, meaning even if you start all over again, or play it again after gettin gto the end, you'll still keep all of your power. The bad news is, the FIRST time you play it, you'll be so weak (and incredibly SLOW) that you won't get to find out the main storyline behind the game. This essentially makes you have to replay the whole thing over again just to be capable of playing the \"true\" part of the game.As you spend days in the mall, you'll be tasked to save survivors and find out more about certain stories (\"Scoops\") that are going on within the mall. All of these are mostly optional, but the main storyline of the game is what you want to focus on. All of the scoops either involve saving trapped survivors in certain parts of this huge (and very poorly-designed) shopping mall complex or will be a boss fight between large and dangerous psychopaths who have gone crazy in the chaos of the zombie infection. The problem with ALL of these are the time limits, and the time limits are what KILL the fun you could've or might've had in this game. Although I'm sure some people like the 'challenge' of the time limits, the fact of the matter is, the simulated time in the game moves MUCH too quickly and the scoops that come by are way too many for you to handle without full Lv. 50 status, and even then, you won't be able to do too much more. You WON'T be able to save everyone or do everything in the very short amount of time given (especially when you play for the FIRST time and all of your skills are piss-poor). If you can't get to someone in time, you will miss out on being able to save them or get a good scoop. And when you first play, your poor skills will result in you missing virtually EVERYTHING! And when that happens, all you will have left to do is to cut and slash your way through a never-ending horde of zombies until your helicopter arrives to pick you up on Friday. I tried to be Superman and save everyone. But this only resulted in people getting killed by their own stupidity of not being able to simply follow you, or missing out on saving other people or doing optional boss fights against psychopaths. Or, in the most usual case, both.The thing I hate too, is that the zombies NEVER stop coming! I mean, you can spend an hour clearing out a thousand zombies in one area, making it \"safe\" for when you have to go rescue someone, only to have twice as many zombies \"re-spawn\" in that same area! I mean, that's so stupid! It makes most of the killing pointless. I could understand if they came back within a few hours and in the meanwhile, the area would be safe for escorting people back to your security room base, but nope. It's never safe, and rarely ever easy. It wouldn't be so bad if the survivors' AI wasn't so, so bad. All they have to do is follow you, and yet, the AI can't even do that right, either not being able to run around simple objects like a desk, or being too stupid to follow you.And like I was saying, the zombies never end, which I guess, some players might like. They say the town has 53,000 residents in it, right? So, assuming 90% of them get infected, you're dealing with roughly, 48,000 zombies in one oddly-constructed mall, right? So, you'd think if you killed, say, 10,000 of them (the game keeps a tally of how many you kill and rewards you a little bit for every 50 to 100 killed) it would make a difference, right? Nope. This is what makes the game as tedious, repetitive, and as boring as the game Crackdown. Just like in that game, no matter HOW many enemies you kill, it NEVER makes any kind of difference! And as the difficulity increases, the chances of being able to save people becomes even harder. But, this doesn't result in the game being 'challenging' or 'fun' as much as it does in being just plain old annoying and frustrating.Could the NPC's in this game BE any dumber? You tell them six times to \"Follow me!\" only to have them stand there, like idiots, until a horde of ten zombies advance of them! THEN, you have to go back and save them, while more zombies advance on them, while they STILL stand around like idiots, NOT following you! This game has a LOT of problems like this! It can be annoying even with one survivor, but when you get to escorting five or six at once, it becomes close to impossible to keep all of them alive (unless you've got a good stock of Queens saved up, which kill a large group of zombies all at once). Sometimes, you'll have items that don't work right or AI that is beyond legally retarded. I mean, the only NPC's that this game actually got right are the zombies! Even your main character can't do much, as ALL of his moves are either useless, incredibly complicated to pull off correctly, or only good for when you're already being attacked. You'd be surprised how many combat moves you get for when a zombie's ALREADY attacking you and how few there are to PREVENT them from doing that in the first place! Other than the Knee Drop and Jump Kick, all of Frank's moves are really hard to pull off, and you end up almost never using them, which is just as well as Frank's melee strength is beyond weak, anyways. I also can't tell whether or not zombies get more aggressive as you level up and get stronger or as time goes on and they presumably start to get more hungry, but either way, zombies will soon go from being harmless and ignorable to vicious and aggressive in the way they attack you. This seems to be the only AI thing that actually makes sense in the game. They fail with everyone and everything else.Weapons in the game are okay, but some are mostly useless. You get blunt objects, sharp objects like knives and swords, firearms, and heavy/large objects like benches and trashcans that you can't carry around with you. Your objects go into your stock, but so do your food and health items. Once you use up a weapon (which is rather quickly with most of them), you automatically are given the next weapon in your stock to use. Sadly though, both weapons AND food are in the same stock! The stock system is poorly designed, so I can't even begin to tell you how many times I accidentally used a food item with full health because they switched me over from a weapon that just broke. I'll be slashing zombies, then switched over to my orange juice and accidentally drink it! This happens SO often! Plus, Frank is SO slow with actually using the food items! You know how many times I've died during a boss fight because I couldn't use my juice or food in time? You have to sit there and WAIT for him to drink it all or eat it up before it heals you. This takes like, three seconds. And instead of that animation just being skipped when it's interrupted by you being hit, it just cancels out! So, yes, you can die quite easily because Frank is too slow to drink something up! These are the small problems in the game that quickly add up!You know what else is slow and takes too long? Your scoop messages. That Otis guy is so annoying! During the heat of a zombie fight, you may get a call on a scoop. But when you take that call, you have to sit there and wait and wait and wait for the guy to give you the info. Again, if you skip it, it doesn't count, and he'll call again, telling you how it's \"rude\" to hang up on him. Well, I'm sorry if that's so rude that I don't have time to wait for you for a full thirty seconds to get some useless scoop info while fighting off 100 zombies! You know, a text message would be so much simpler and convenient. How could they not see this as annoying? Waiting for his slow, insane rants about someone needing help for so much time during a few thousand zombies coming at you in the mall?The main storyline, once you're actually strong enough to go after it, seems to be written as something that sounds greater and more epic than it really is. But, once you actually sit back and take it all in, you realize that a zombie outbreak connected with the American beef industry actually makes no sense, at all. One thing they do get somewhat right, is making you feel for the characters given. Some people will survive and others will die, and when your allies die (the non-mall survivors) you really feel a little sad for them, given how much time you've spent with them. Not to give too much away, but the \"true\" ending is probably less desirable than the \"B-Ending\" where you just make it out of the mall after 72 hours, because of what happens to Frank during the 'true ending'. And just to bring it up, they misspell \"true\" a lot in your achivements! At first, I was like, what's a 'ture ending?' Isn't that hilarious? How could they not spell check something like that?Extra things in the game include you showing off your photography skills via Frank's camera. You get points for how good a photo you take, that range in the genres of Drama, Horror, Violence, Comedy, and Sex. If you grab the right books in the game (mainly, the Visual Cue book), the photography can be quite fun. Especially when you're trying to snap the elusive \"perfect\" photo during a boss fight or survivor conversation. It's fun to use the camera, but I also haven't played any other photography video game since \"Pokemon Snap\".Overall, this game is just tedious and often times frustrating, with too many game design flaws and poor gaming decisions. Like, dying for example, means actual death. There are no \"checkpoints\" or \"continues\" or anything, and you have to reload from the last time you saved or you'll just stay dead. Interstingly enough, in a game where timing counts for everything, you'd think there'd be a manual Load screen in the options or something for when you make a mistake. But there IS no Load screen! (Who ever heard of that, before?) If you mess up, you either have to intentionally die or log out in order to restart, and you'll likely be doing this a lot, so not having a Load Saved Game option is pretty bizarre.This game seems to try to be good, given the multiple endings, the variety of weapons and items, the photography minigame, and even the different outfits, so I'm not going to say that Capcom didn't at least try. They even have some really good songs in here (the rare times you get to hear any). However, the problem is that they just make too many mistakes and the over game ends up being more annoying and frustrating than fun and survivor-horror-esque. The zombies aren't as scary as much as they are just a pain in the behind. This game is NOT in the league of \"Resident Evil\" even, and that series, while popular, isn't even the BEST zombie video game out there.\"Dead Rising\" is maybe worth renting, if you're a zombie/horror game buff. Or if you like taking photos and investigating useless scoops and news info. I'd say the game is worth 2.5 stars. While there is some interesting gameplay to be had here, like investigating the \"True\" story behind the zombie outbreak, the time limits, NPC flaws, playing on weak level, and simple game design mistakes just suck all the potential fun you could've had out of this. Unless, killing endless zombies is enough to thrill you. Navigating the mall is also annoying, as no kind of real architect could've POSSIBLY designed a mall this inane and oddly constructed. What kind of mall only has ONE entrance/exit, anyway?The best thing I can say about 'Dead Rising' is that the storyline is a bit unique and the characters are somewhat worth caring for. The worst thing I could say about 'Dead Rising' is that the least-talented people at Capcom HAD to be the ones who designed and created this game as this is far below Capcom's usual quality. If they make a 'Dead Rising II', then hopefully the numerous mistakes and bad game designs will be taken care of and the game will end up as the fun, horror-genre title they probably envisioned while originally making this.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2009"}

Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Gameboy \"David\"","summary":"Nice!","reviewText":"Vice City....a wonderful game!

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"Last Flight of The Normandy","reviewText":"For obvious reason, the ending of Mass Effect 3 is where I will start my review. Having played ME1 four times and ME2 six times, along with various saves with various sets of decisions, I really looked forward to ME3 - but with apprehension.  Needless to say, much to my disappointment, my apprehension became a reality in an unexpected way: A high-flying tale of grand adventure - and one of the best of all time - crash landed both literally and figuratively at the final moment.And it does not matter how I will attempt to salvage the wreckage of an ending that was stolen from Ion Storm's Deus Ex (and badly applied to ME3), whether by believing that it's all is a marketing scam to sell more DLCs; or get indoctrinated into believing the `Indoctrination Theory'; or pandering to some cop-out philosophical concepts like cosmicism,  the circle of life, the galactic cycle, cyclical history, etc.; or wait patiently for EA/bioware to release the CE (stands for *complete* edition in this case); or simply made one up on my own... The ending still remains what it is, and just like the Normandy, it's a wreck. In other words, no matter what I dress it up in, and how many times I take it out on the dance floor for a spin, and what tune we dance to, the ending still sucks -- That's that, and it's now out of the way as far as my review is concerned.As my 4-star ratings for fun indicated, in spite of the pretentious ending, not all is lost because there is still a good 30 hours or so of excellent gameplay here if one can somehow temporarily put aside the ending.  Granted, a 30-hours game is noticeably shorter than ME1 or ME2, but whatever length there is - after whatever EA/bioware ripped out for DLC(s), or never get the time to complete -  is excellent for the most part.Right of the bat, I noticed that the cover finally features a femShep, which gets a thumb-up from me as I have more games saves with femShep than maleShep.  In addition, the game comes on 2 discs, and is stable with only 1 freeze.As for the gameplay,  ME3 is the undisputed winner in the combat arena for the ME series.  Although the different races that you can fight against are now narrowed down to human, Geth, and reapers, the sub classes within each race have increased significantly and will require you to employ different tactics and team members.Also, melee combat is also improved with the addition of a strong melee attack -  which your enemies also employed - with a new weapon, the Omni blade featured on the DVD cover.  The cover system have also improved - but still need work; Shepard is now more mobile and agile than ever, but still can inadvertently get into cover position at inopportune time.The most significant improvement of all combat-wise is that the enemies have vastly improved AI which really boosts aggressiveness.  They will now try to flank you; use smoke screen for concealment; melee specialists will close in on you; snipers will harass you; and some enemies even camp out until you saunter past. Unfortunately, your fire team members'AI improvement is a no-match to your enemies' AI.  Although your teammates can now shoot a little better from cover, without tight management, they still run head first into hostile fire or into friendly line of fire (blocking my view), or worse yet, come up behind me and try to shoot at the enemies through my helmet.Also, another minor let down is that, for about half of the game, in spite of the improved elements, the combat itself boils down to the MP style gameplay of holding an area against waves of enemies until a certain event took place; this gets progressively worse especially when you returned to Earth.In terms of RPG, in general, ME3 is a mixed result between ME1 and ME2.  To be sure, ME1 is still has the best RPG elements in the series; while ME3 is better than ME2 is some ways, but worse in others. To be more precise, in tern of conversational options, ME3 is the worst by far.  Way too often - and almost to the point of all the time, your choices are limited to either paragon or renegade; whereas in ME1 and ME2, there is almost always at least one neutral option.However, the weapon mods in ME1 - which I really like - are making a big comeback, along with a significant increase in weapon upgrades and selections.  As for armor, there is now a wider selection of armor and armor components for Shepard.  Your team mates' armor, unfortunately, remain purely cosmetic.BTW, The Normandy also saw some improvement, most notable is the fact that you can now move about the ship freely.  Incidentally, your teammates also move around the ship - which certainly adds a touch of more realism than before.Thankfully, mini games have been almost completely eliminated.  Scanning the planet is now a painless task - And along with planet scanning, there is also a totally optional mini game of `eluding the reapers' - which I do not mind playing (I also discover a startling fact while playing this mini-game: Under normal propulsion, reapers can move faster than the Normandy !)Story wise, which is the heart and soul of the ME series, (not counting the disastrous ending), ME3 also shines brightly in the relatively short amount of game time.  The highlight of the story, and one that is extremely well done, is the resolution of the Krogan/Turian/Salarian conflict and the Geth vs. Quarian war - And this part alone is the saving grace of the game for me.Also, it suffices to say that you will meet all of your former teammates again - provided they did not kick the bucket.  Some of these former teammates will happily rejoin you again - and if you have hooked up with them before, needless to say, you will get the chance to rekindle the romance.  In short, in terms of the story, everything that takes place away from Earth is noteworthy - if not superb.If I have to rank the game in the series, it'd be ranked precisely in its chronological order of 1, 2, 3.  It's too bad ME3 is a cracked diamond.  Otherwise, the ranking would have been 3,1,2.  For what it's worth, I still recommend this game to ME fans and new comers alike - but not at full retail price.In conclusion, for better or for worse, it is what it is; and as is, the Mass Effect story has come to an end in my book - And for the most part, it certainly was a grand adventure while it lasted.  Keelah' Selai.------------------------------------------------------Update 11/8/12: I give the game an additional star - making it 3-stars - due to the Extended Cut DLC.  Although definitely still unworthy of the Mass Effect series, the EC DLC did addressed some plot holes, and make the ending choices somewhat better than before.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2012"}

Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look.

But more on that later.Let me start my review with some qualifying comments.  Firstly, I am a huge fan of RPGs, and the bulk of my experience is with RPGs, not shooters.  Dirge of Cerberus is a shooter, and I knew that going in, but the draw of getting to play as Vincent (my favorite character from FF7) helped me overcome my hesitation.  So that's why I picked it up.  That being said, please understand that I don't know much about shooters (as I don't have much experience there) and that my opinions will be tempered by this background.  It is entirely possible that someone who plays primarily shooters will have very different critiques.  However, this review will probably be helpful for fans of FF7 and RPGs in general, like me!  Anyway, on to the review.Graphics (score 9/10): Firstly, the cutscenes are very nice.  They look just like the Advent Children movie to me.  The in-game graphics are slightly less impressive but still fine enough for me.  They look somewhat similar to the graphics in FF10.Music (score 7/10): The music itself is fairly good.  Nothing jarring or irritating.  However, there's nothing terribly memorable either.  Still, it's pleasant enough.  Plus, the voice acting is excellent.Characters (score 7/10): Hmm... This is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, Vincent and other characters that were part of Final Fantasy VII are portrayed excellently-- with their proper personalities intact.  On the other hand, new characters (mostly villians) are barely given time to develop (with the exception of Shelke) before they are dismissed from the story.  Also, don't expect to get equal amounts of exposure to all the main FF7 characters--I'll just let you know right now, the only people who get screen time worth mentioning are Vincent (duh!), Yuffie, and Cait Sith.  Why, Red XIII only makes a brief appearance and has no lines.  This was somewhat sad to me as Red XIII is my second favorite character from FF7.  Thankfully, Vincent is my favorite, and we see plenty of him.Story (score 9/10): The real value of the storyline here is the intimate look into Vincent's past, something which isn't well-explained in the original FF7 game.  These parts are pure gold and worthy of a 9/10 score for the story section.  However, the new parts involving the new villians are rather lackluster.  I think this really is due to the fact that they are given little time to develop as characters.  It's just that the whole story feels a bit generic--some random people are trying to destroy the world again.  After having watched Advent Children (which falls before this chronologically story-wise), I'm just starting to feel a little jaded with the whole \"Shinra's evil experiments\" thing.  However, this game is well worth playing since it gives some illumination on Vincent's past (and those parts are superb).Battle System (score 7/10): The battle system isn't too bad.  You basically have a gun and you shoot things.  The auto-targeting makes it easier for people like me (who have poor aim).  Overall, I did not find the game overly difficult.  My only complaint here is that there isn't much else to do but shoot things.  The other attacks at your disposal are melee attacks, magic (which you also shoot at enemies), and Limit Breakers (which involves transforming into a monster and fighting with its special attacks).  You won't really use these other things too much though, for various reasons, but mostly because you don't really need to.  On the bright side, you do get different kinds of guns and the ability to customize them, so that using the guns themselves doesn't get too boring.Gameplay (score 2/10): Speaking of boring, this is where this game falls on its face.  Remember how I mentioned in the intro. that this game wasn't fun?  Well, it's because the gameplay reminds me of the words \"boring\" and \"tedium\".  Everything is so repetitive that it almost hurts.  The only reason I continued was to see the next cutscene. There are several factors that contribute to the boring feel:1)The environments are bland and not very interactive (and why can I jump over some boxes but not other, identical boxes?!).2)The levels are very linear and don't really remind you of FF7, even though they are set in the same locations.3)Most locales consist only of hallways of varying colors. This makes for a dull experience.4)The enemies are incredibly unvaried.  You'll see mostly soldiers, and they are all similar in their blandness.5)The final nail in the coffin here is the repetitive chapter system.  Every level uses the same formula--cutscene at the begining, several sections of hallways to shoot things in, and then a boss at the end, followed by a cutscene.  Then the whole thing begins again with the next chapter.Overall (score 5/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  The terrible gameplay is really what lowers the overall score.  It was a real struggle just to keep playing because the actual gameplay was so un-fun and boring for me.  Ultimately, it was only the story and my love for Vincent that kept me playing this game.  If I had to sum this game up in a single sentence, I'd say: \"Dirge of Cerberus has a great story for the FF7 fan, but (really) boring gameplay\".  I do recommend this game for avid fans of FF7, just because it involves Vincent.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though.  And as for people who've never played FF7 and just want to pick up a shooter game, I suggest you stay away, because I suspect you would find this game dull too.  It's really a pity that Square-Enix didn't do better with this game, there was so much potential here that this game could've been spectacular.  Now, unfortunately, it's become just another bargain-bin game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2008"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

As proof of this I've played through the career three whole times, and plan to play it at least once more before the release of Mass Effect 3. Generally I don't replay games, and that is definitely the most I've ever played a game, except for maybe Rock Band. That being said Bioware dumbed this game down so far from the mastery of the original Mass Effect. This game is one of the most polished games I've ever played. However I feel like they accomplished this by completely eliminating any originality and progress in the gameplay. They stripped almost all of the RPG gameplay that I loved, leaving such a simplistic leveling system (with a really low level cap) and hardly any skills. Also, they got rid of all of the weapons and add-ons in favor of a series of upgrades. In my mind, while this made it easier for a young stupid player that's too impatient to enjoy RPG's, for me it was a useless system. I never felt more powerful after buying a new upgrade, it felt exactly the same, either because the upgrade didn't add enough or the enemies always got more powerful at exactly the same rate.In all of the videos during the game, the characters have so much more power than the minuscule amount of abilities you have in gameplay. Essentially, ME2's gameplay is just a very basic cover based shooter with a few interesting powers. Especially at higher levels, you have to stay behind cover most of the game if you don't want to die every couple seconds. Also, I find it amazing that in the future we replace bullets with cool-down clips that work exactly the same way. In fact some of the guns have less ammo than the present. At the higher levels this becomes a big problem, as multiple times I ran out of ammo, especially with the guns I liked the most. The technology of the world does not match the gameplay, while it absolutely did in the first game. Still however, the gameplay is fun even at its most basic.Now onto the story, while compared to everything else on the market it's amazing, but compared to the original Mass Effect the main story is pretty weak. Essentially there are only 4 missions in the main story, and there isn't really any main nemesis. There's just some goofy Collector that repeats annoying phrases and has no motivation for all the evil its doing. In the first game there was a guy we could chase after, feeling like we're always a step beyond, and then after that an even more massive evil with very interesting reasoning. Here we have one faceless enemy with no reasoning, there's never a twist or anything to compete against. Also, the act of killing Shepard at the very beginning of the story is such a goofy way to restart everything. However, the bulk of the game's missions involving recruiting and gaining the loyalty of characters is really fun and original. I loved it, at times it almost felt like a sci-fi version of the game series Suikoden where you'd collect 108 characters/stars (most of them weren't actually playable). In fact I'd love to see more of that in the next game, it really involves you in the story to gather these people/aliens and than talk to them.However, that brings me to another part of the game that I'd love to see adapted in ME3. It makes no sense to only take 2 other characters with you to fight hundreds and hundreds of enemies. I mean I understand the benefit of a small team, but you really never do any sneaking around. Also, it's implied that all of the characters are leaving on the mission even though you only have 3 total characters. From this, I'd love to see two additions, first it would be nice if each character had its own experience points so you'd be rewarded/punished by underusing or overusing the other characters. Secondly I'd love to see more characters on screen, even if they aren't playable. If it's too difficult for Bioware to achieve, they could just have more missions like the last mission on this game, where you have two separate teams.Even after all of the above complains, I still think that this game is amazing, and my favorite game of 2010.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ9QVI","description":"As always with any Nintendo game console, the first Super Mario game is one of the defining experiences on the system. Join Mario as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he&#x2019;s done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote.","reviewerName":"Hongster","summary":"Ultimate Mario Experience","reviewText":"As the title suggests, this game finally puts the Italian plumber in space!  The game is the successor to previous Mario installations such as Super Mario Sunshine and Mario 64 (although many have claimed this to be the true sequel to \"Mario 64\" and even the producer Shigeru Miyamoto agreed to that statement).The story is simple and cliche, Princess Peach invites Mario to her castle and when he arrives, his arch nemesis Bowser (King of the Koopas) attacks the Mushroom Kingdom (only this time he takes the entire castle out of space) and it's up to Mario to save the Princess and her castle.  As many people know, you do not play any Mario games for it's story, since it gets an 'F' for storyline (the Legend of Zelda and Metroid series has an more elaborate storyline for those interested in plot development).Game mechanics (this is the most important factor for any Mario game).  Previous installment Mario Sunshine was plagued by this factor, the controls were not easy to learn as there were many functions that you needed to learn and to do to progress throughout the game.  This is where Galaxy shines, all of Mario's movement are easily accessible from the beginning and are easy to pull off (also, no gimmicks such as \"Fludd\" to tinker with, all you have now is Star Bits which are easy to understand).  All of Mario's movements are fluid and fun to pull off.  'A' to jump, 'B' to fire star bits, and no \"wagging\" the wii remote, yes you will need to shake the remote (to pull off Mario's spin move and to move to another galaxy) but there are no other movements involving the remote (other than to picking up/firing Star Bits) as the nunchuck is used for moving Mario.  The camera is fixed, you do not need to change the view as the game will do it automatically (I did not encounter any problems with this feature, although some people might have wanted this feature to be included as it was in previous installments)Gameplay (the other factor for Mario games), your goal in this game is to collect stars (similar to Mario 64) and there is a total of 120 stars (though if you count the fact that you can replay the game the total is around 241 stars though you won't need that many stars to beat the game, only for those who want to complete the game).  Each galaxy is a stage on it's own (this is similar to Mario 3) where you can decide to go to any stage (if you had the required amount of stars to unlock the galaxy).  Each galaxy is unique on it's own, and that's the fun part of Mario Galaxy.  You will have to use the skills Mario possess to conquer these Galaxies, either it be defeating a boss, collecting star pieces or defeating enemies to get to the next part.  This time around, there is no collecting 100 coins or 8 red coins to get a star (no more tedious tasks) and though boss battles are easy, it does not mean the game is without challenge, as many latter stars will require you to use Mario's skill to perfection to obtain the stars.  In addition, the game can be played with 2 player co-op, where 1 player will control the actions of Mario while the other player can use the star bits to stun enemies as well as stun mario.The game runs in 16:9 (Widescreen) and 480p.  The graphics are colorful and bright and far easily the best graphics seen thus far on the Wii (only a few games can match this quality and those are all Nintendo made games as well).  The game runs in 60fps (frames per second) and there are hardly any dips in the frame rate throughout the game.  The soundtrack is very Mario \"esque\" and are orchestrated (a first for a Nintendo made game) and this includes scores from previous Mario games (my favorite happens to be the homage to Mario 3).Scores: 1-10 ScaleGraphics: 10Sound: 10Controls: 9Fun Factor: 10Overall: 10 (This is not a average)Conclusion: You will not be disappointed with the newest Mario game.  The game is extremely fun and is just long enough to statisfy any gamer (the game's average length is 10-15 hours, though that will increase if you are planning to complete the game)  This is the Wii game you must own for the 2007 Holiday Season!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Brendan Foy \"Foy\"","summary":"Get Lost in Space","reviewText":"I am 2 years late to the party but the good times are still here.  Mass Effect has completely blown me away and is easily my favorite game of this generation of consoles.  Fallout 3 was my most anticipated but compared to Mass Effect it comes across as dull and lifeless.I have never been a big fan of the way Bioware structures their RPGs but I enjoyed Star Wars: KOTOR immensely and figured if Mass Effect could simply be a High Definition version of that game then I would be happy.  Thankfully the game is so much more than anything Bioware has done in the past.  They not only created a whole new universe with a deep history and compelling characters but presented it all with such refinement and polish that you will completely lose yourself in their world.Immediately I was sucked in when I heard the retro synthesized music at the title screen; it was as if I were about to watch a John Carpenter, David Lynch or Ridley Scott film from the 1980s.  The music in this game gives the experience a personality all to its own and a charm which high budget Hollywood movies struggle to achieve.Upon starting the game you are immediately presented with a history of the world you are entering, the personal history of the character you are playing (fully customizable in both looks and skills) and a deep backstory to everything else from solar systems, to space technologies to politics.  As the game progresses the story and more bits of information about the people and world you are playing in are methodically revealed to you at a steady and exhilarating pace.  There is always something new to learn about and explore.  The main story is excellent (with some branching paths depending on the type of character you choose to play as) and the sub plots are more fleshed out than the main plot of most other games.  Of particular note is a romance subplot which has a bit of a soap opera feel but is exceedingly entertaining and will keep you at the edge of your seat.The visuals do not disappoint in the least.  There is a filter you can choose to have on or off.  This filter gives the game a grainy look as if you were watching an old VHS of the Ridley Scott Sci-Fi classic Bladerunner but I preferred the cleaner and sharper look when the filter was off.  The attention to detail in the visuals is just as particular as the detailed story elements.  Facial expressions are the most realistic and convincing I have seen in any game and the armor you wear is varied, stylish and gorgeous.  You can see each and every weapon on your character so when he draws one of them, he will do so through a smooth animation instead of having it just pop up in his hands.  Battles are intense and cinematic, the cut scenes are in seamless real time and even navigating the galaxy map in your ship is an experience unto itself.  The star clusters and nebulas are simply mesmerizing, the solar systems and individual planets are a sight to behold and the hypnotic ambient music which plays while accessing the map captures the magnificence and loneliness of space perfectly.  When simply navigating through a map gives you so much joy you know the rest of the game will be quite the treat.The gameplay is rock solid as well.  Much thought has been put into how you play the game and provides for one of the deepest experiences in a RPG yet.  You can play the game as a quick shooting soldier to a genetically/cybernetically enhanced biotic with access to super human powers (like the force in Star Wars but more than a cheap rip off).  The combat plays like a 3rd person shooter with a cover system and squad commands and it works pretty well.  The 3rd person shooting in Mass Effect is far superior to the stilted First Person shooting in Fallout 3 (aside from the VATS system which Mass Effect could have benefited from greatly).  If Mass Effect were not an RPG the shooting mechanics here would be a solid enough foundation for an average shooter to be made of it.  The sheer variety of weapons, upgrades, powers, skills and perks means very few people will play this game the same way, even if they choose a similar loadout for their characters.I could go on and on about the intimate experience you will have with this meticulously crafted masterpiece but I also want to touch on the few negatives I came across.- Dialogue.  Though in general this is a huge positive where you have multiple responses in a conversation and every word is spoken by a voice actor, my gripe is that the moral paths you take are still rather predictable as they have been in past Bioware games.  Bioware still can't do dialogue as well as Black Isle/Obsidian, but they are getting better.  The problem with the dialogue here is that though you can take a good, neutral or evil path, what you say really doesn't effect the game or who you are saying it to as much as it should.  If you want to be good, you pick the \"good\" response, if you want to be bad you pick the \"bad response\".  You'll get points for being \"good\" or \"bad\" but the responses you get from the other party will pretty much be the same.- Bioware has an incredibly predictable and simplistic view on who is good and who is bad.  To be good you basically have to be a politically correct idealist who fully embraces multi-culturalism and shuns violence unless being shot at.  To be bad, you're basically a sociopath.  One scene in the game which clearly shows this simplistic worldview is where you have the choice to kill the last remaining survivor of an alien species.  To kill this individual would be an act of genocide.  Genocide is bad, yes, but this particular species was known to be aggressive in the past where they nearly conquered the galaxy.  This individual had nothing to do with that war, it was brought to life by genetic scientists in a lab and it is begging you for it's life, but is it really worth the risk?  You do not have any time to fully investigate or keep tabs on this thing to see if it lays eggs to breed an army or a family, all you have is it's word that it has no plans to cause the other species any harm again.  All you really know is that this species has been extinct for a long time because of it's violent past and the logical thing to do would be to keep it extinct because you can't risk another galactic war.  Well the moral absolutists at Bioware don't seem to see it this way, you are evil if you kill the creature but good if you let it go regardless of the potential consequences.  There is no option to regretfully choose to end it's life, instead your character is shown to relish the murder of this creature as if he were some sort of serial killer.  If you choose to let the creature go, you are shown to be all noble and compassionate (even though your actions could lead to the destruction of the galaxy, but nevermind that, at least it makes you feel good for the short term right?).  This simplistic approach to morals and who is good and who is bad is prevalent in all of Biowares games and I really hope they work on this in the sequel because it could double the immersion factor in what is already an incredibly deep and powerful experience.- There is only one \"HUB\".  There is really only one planet/city where all the main NPCs (from merchants to plot related characters) gather.  Every other world you go to is a sparsely populated wasteland where a sidequest must be completed or if it is part of the main campaign it feels like another level to get through than a world to explore.  Mass Effect isn't quite as open ended as you might like.  In Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games you have massive cities and towns which feel independent and stand on their own.  In Mass Effect and pretty much every other Bioware game, you have one main area (which isn't all that big to begin with) and everything else is much smaller and pointless to go back to once you \"beat\" it since it is treated like a level.  The world of Mass Effect is so rich and vast that I want to feel like I can truly explore it and get a sense that there is real life here outside of the main quest.  Morrowind was able to do this back in 2002, I have faith that Bioware can expand on their dated RPG formula and make Mass Effect 2 feel like a more open ended and autonomous world.- Length.  I good game leaves you begging for more when it is all over but Mass Effect felt like it all ended too soon.  The gamer was excellent but I feel 10 more hours could have been added to the main quest and there should have been quite a few more fully fleshed out side quests as well.  The main campaign is around 20 hours of bliss but it is definitely on the short side for an RPG.- Repetition.  The last negative I see in Mass Effect is that some of the maps and layouts repeat themselves.  Now I understand that when it comes to a small facility on a colonized world, they probably use the same blueprints because variety in architecture is the last of their concerns in a hostile environment on a foreign planet.  Still, when you do the side quests and know exactly what the layout in a building or even a cave is going to be before you enter it hurts the exploration element to the game and wears on you as the novelty wears off.  This must be fixed in the sequel because by then the novelty of this beautiful world will certainly be gone.So those are the complaints for an otherwise AAA game.  If you were to buy only one game for the Xbox 360, it would have to be Mass Effect.  The best game on the system so far.  An easy A across the boards.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}

While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions.

For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Matt D.

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"CastleD","summary":"Good at first but then gets boring","reviewText":"I downloaded the demo version of this game and I've decided not to buy it.

{"product_name":"B003VR5PPY","description":"","reviewerName":"Benjamin M. Cady \"Ben\"","summary":"Stimulating those neurons has never been so fun.","reviewText":"This game is fantastic, I will give a brief description of the more pertinent aspects in suceeding paragraphs on why this is the case:graphics:The art style is reminscent of anime such as Cowboy Bebop, albeit in a modernised fashion.  The characters are drawn very nicely and the feeling of oppression and fear permeates through every histrionic pore of this awesome game.Gameplay:The point and click aspects of the game are at heart very simple, and the dialog provides good clues and hints as to where one MAY want to avert their attention.  There will be several areas where one will be searching in the same spot a few times over until the aha! moment occurs (both for the player and his or her on screen avatar) when this happens, it is quite satisfying and rarely feels like an impossible feat.Sound:The music matches the tone perfectly, conveying the sense of urgency felt by the characters.  Certainly one can appreciate the proper music for the appropriate situation. This is actually one of the better points of the game (although admittedly there are few low points).Presentation:Much like the graphics, the menus are quite good and easy to navigate.  The interface is fairly good but I don't think I've seen an option to customize controls (this is a bit of a pain for lefties like me, it got a bit annoying at times not to be able to hit R instead of L for the inventory screen to appear).  Either way, the characters are just as one would expect from an anime inspired and this is certainly a positive for fans of anime.Story:This is probably one of the strongest points of the game.  Essentially it's about 9 people who get kidnapped to partcipate in a game and need to find their way out of a ship.  I will spare you more details, but needless to say, while this may not be 100% original in terms of concept, the characters and dialog are hilarious and memorable (and in true anime fashion, they are full of histrionics).  I truly find this to be the pinnacle of conveyance in text based adventure/puzzle games.So all in all, I'd say this game is about a 9.5/10.

During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and  items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities.As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a  necessary option to win the game.

There's a very low rate of puzzles and abilities that utilize this new feature.2) The quest mode can be really frustrating. Sometimes you'll need an item that you have previously sold and can't get back unless you know someone selling it on the WFC shop mode or start the game over. They should've made any quest releated items non-sellable, or allow you to complete the quest even if you do sell them. Also, you can take on 5 quests at a time max, so if you have that quest and can't complete it, you're just stuck and can't pick up any new ones.3) Selling items is a huge pain, as you are forced to keep one item of everything to prevent the above mentioned quest problem. Even if you did want to sell a bunch of stuff, it doesn't remove your equiped gear from the \"to sell\" list, nor put an E or anything next to it, so you may accidently sell your equipment if you're not paying attention.4) Way too many enemies (and bosses) are reused...again5) The story is really comedy/anime driven and this proves to be a major distraction and seems very out of place given the timeframe of the game (WW2).6) Promise of co-op play is only limited to boss rush mode.7) 95% of the items and abilities are worthless or just clones of one another.8) Re-used stages (or similar looking levels) within the game. You'd think the portraits would bring in some new variety, but the only really different type of level is the pyramid level. Most of the others just look like any other CV castle.While still playable and sometimes enjoyable, this game definitely is the worse CV title since Harmony of Dissonance. Some of the levels and all the new enemies are cool, and so is the dual character mode. But for the above mentioned reasons this game fails to live up to Castlevania's previous body of work. The biggest improvement in this game, though, is it's back to the Circle of the Moon difficulty level.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2006"}

Neith and Anubis however are very similar to Jehuty: bipedal, very fast, powerful, etc. The story of the game, which is quite good, revolves around a young boy named Leo Stenbuck who lives in a space colony outside of Jupiter called Antilia. After he accidentally gains control of Jehuty, he has to deliver the machine to the people who created it in order to keep an invading army of Orbital Frames from acquiring it. Leo then meets up with his remaining friend Celvice and along with Jehuty's AI system codenamed ADA, faces off against the invading army while also defending innocent civilians from destruction.Another good thing about this game is the controls. They are very easy to remember and are not complicated at all. The only thing you should know is that to use the special weapons you acquire throughout the game, all you have to do is press the circle button (the game doesn't really tell you how to do that unless you read the manual). Jehuty is much more powerful than any Zaku or Gouf you may control in those Gundam games and is not nearly as difficult to control. The only thing I don't like about this game is how you have to go back and forth basically all the time in order to accomplish missions, and sometimes you might find yourself wandering about thinking \"what was I supposed to do?\" or \"where do I look for that program?\". As long as you keep your cool and read the objectives and hints listed in the MISSION area of the pause menu, then you'll do just fine.Now, I plan on getting \"Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner\", since the ending of this great, yet extremely short, game kind of leaves you hanging.

In this edition, you get a ton of new weapons and you can upgrade them at certain vendors.  You even get to upgrade your ship by adding on shields, guns and other mods.  What makes this game fun is that there are several mini games within the main game.The one thing I don't like about this game is that you can't move forward onto different planets unless you complete all tasks on previous planets.  For example, you must win a Hoverboard race before you're given a map for the next planet.  I think this will be frustrating to many gamers and may cause some to pass on the game entirely.

Some, like the never-get-it-out-of-my-freakin'-head Gummy Bears song, are loved by all ages.Also, the game is forgiving so if your (or your kid's) skill level is low it doesn't flaunt your low score and it never makes rude or degrading comments that are all the rage in some games.There are also statistics for your kids that parents can monitor (if you want to know how many hours your kids have played or what songs they play the most, etc.) which is helpful if you aren't monitoring your kid's play time.Multiplayer is a snap: the second player just jumps right in before any match. Only two can dance at a time, so you'll have to rotate them if you have more children or visitors.The game isn't without \"flaws\" though. (I call them flaws, although the developers most likely decided to go this way on purpose.) For example, there are long beats in Just Dance Kids 2 where there is no indication on the move timeline what dance move is supposed to be done. In Dance Central, for instance, you always know what move is happening and what move is coming next because of the moves queue that is constantly flowing on the side of the screen. In Just Dance Kids 2, you see some of the dance moves queued but not all of them and there are gaps in the notification where I guess the game assumes you know what to do next or that you should just continue the same moves.Another big \"flaw\" for me is that there is no visual feedback of whether or not you are making the moves. In contrast, Dance Central shows your actual body on screen, visualized with the dance avatar, showing your correct moves (highlighted green) or incorrect moves (highlighted red.) In Just Dance Kids 2, what you see onscreen throughout the song is basically a music video of three kids dancing the moves that you are supposed to mimic. But you get no indication of how you messed up on a move. You just get a red X or \"Ok,\" \"Good,\" or \"Perfect\" bubble up by your name at the top of the screen. This works for kids who are just moving around and having fun, but it's not that great for older kids (or adults) who want to get the moves right.Finally, as of this writing I haven't seen any downloadable content for the game. Unlike the other dance games, this one has its out of the box songs and that's it. I'd love to see more content from other children's programming (Backyardigans please!)All in all, this is an addictive, fun, and age appropriate game that kids love. If you have children and a Kinect this is a must have game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}

From the incredible music, a cheesy dialog, to an epic story.Last generation we saw several HD remakes of older games and you will immediately notice that SquarEnix made a greater effort.  The character models are incredible.  In addition, the colors and texture upgrades of the environments are vastly improved.  I still shocked! The music is the same but some of it is a remixed version.  Everyone has different tastes so some will like it and other will hate it.  In my opinion, it's still great and I really like it (The Zanarcand theme is unchanged ;-))This version of FFX and FFX-2 is based on the international version that was released in Japan and Europe.  Meaning, the following additions are accessible to everyone :)Expert Sphere Grid, new character abilities, alternate versions and optional boss battles including the Dark Aeon and super-boss Penance encounters, and new game play areas including FF10-2 Last Mission.New abilities in FFX:Pilfer Gil: Steal gil from enemies.Nab Gil: The Mug equivalent of Pilfer Gil.Full Break: All four \"Break\" effects at once.Quick Pockets: Use curative items quickly, without losing a turn.Extract Power: Same effect as a Power Distiller item.Extract Mana: Same effect as a Mana Distiller item.Extract Speed: Same effect as a Speed Distiller item.Extract Ability: Same effect as an Ability Distiller item.In addition, four new weapon auto-abilities. The weapon auto-abilities are called Distill Power, Distill Mana, Distill Speed, and Distill Ability. They force an enemy to drop a particular type of sphere after battle.In FFX-2, new Dressspheres will be available.This game also has a short film called Eternal Calm.

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"Facelord","summary":"Exceptional start to a new franchise","reviewText":"I'm going to make a few comparisons to Smash in this review, but it's important to understand that these are two fundamentally different series. Smash is about momentum and positioning, All-Stars is about combos and Supers. On the surface they look similar, but if you go into All-Stars thinking it'll be like Smash you'll end up either very disappointed or very satisfied(depending on your perspective). If you're reading this review, I assume that you at least have a basic understanding of All-Stars' gameplay mechanics. Now, on to the review.All-Stars. Is. Awesome. It has a ton of single-player content and could easily take up hundreds of hours of your time in multiplayer mode. The game's getting free-to-early-adopter DLC characters(like Kat from Gravity Rush), maps and game modes soon and the production values are very high, with a level of polish you'd expect from a major first-party PS3 release. The thing I'm probably most excited about overall with the game is its crossbuy/crossplay functionality- you buy the PS3 version and you get a download copy of the Vita version free. I can confirm that the Vita version is just as good as the PS3 one, with a slightly different menu interface optimized for the Vita's smaller screen; however, I did notice some performance issues when things got really, really intense on the level Sandover Village(a mix of Jak & Daxter and Hot Shots Golf). I tested each and every level on PS3 and Vita simultaneously and that was the only level to give me performance issues. Otherwise it's a steady 60 FPS in both versions, the content's all the same(with compressed textures and obviously a lower resolution on the Vita).The visuals are great, I purchased the game thinking it was 1080p(60 frames-per-second on the Vita and PS3 versions) but it's only listed as 1080i on the back of the box; still looks like 1080p on my HDTV and my friend's high-end LG Smart TV, so it's all good. Most of the character animations feel like they were taken straight from the characters' respective 3D games and modified to fit the 2D perspective of the title, with the notable exception of pretty much Parappa's entire moveset.The music is surprisingly very exceptional, I went into the game expecting boring music compared to the Nintendo stuff I grew up with in Smash but am just as impressed as with Brawl's lovely soundtrack. I especially love the way even the music is a mash-up of two franchises, this is a true cross-franchise game designed with that in mind from the start. Some of the new techno-y songs created for the game are nice, not quite as \"epic\" as Nobuo Uematsu's music from the intro to Brawl but still very catchy. The maps are also awesome, with my two favorites being Franzea(a mix of LocoRoco and Metal Gear) and Black Rock Stadium(a mix of Twisted Metal and Jak 2). Each map is a visually stunning combination of two classic Playstation franchises, you can turn off stage hazards and the only maps I dislike still have their uses(like the boring, platform-less Dojo map being great for learning how characters work and extremely simple fights). You wouldn't believe just how charming it is to see Hades(from the level, uh, Hades) taken down by a tribe of invading Patapon after he spends a few minutes reigning terror down on the players. This is another thing I kinda wish Nintendo would steal from this game, crossing over maps and music between multiple franchises. Unlikely, but eh, Nintendo could certainly learn a lot from All-Stars. It goes both ways.The characters play extremely differently, with no two Smash characters playing as differently as the two most similar All-Stars characters.  The Supers system is a great change of pace from the norm, unlike anything else I've ever experienced in any other fighting game- it can be very satisfying to have to endure level 1 and level 2 super attacks for a few minutes while you're waiting for your level 3 super, just to unleash your level 3 on your enemies and get five or six kills. It's also satisfying to just use your supers whenever you feel like it, the super system feels great either way. A few supers are similar(like Sly Cooper's and Fat Princess' level 1 attacks), but they're all different enough so that they aren't just straight copies: to compare the two previously referenced supers, Sly summons Murray to attack everyone in front of him while he stays stationary and Fat Princess herself takes down the people standing between her and the piece of cake summoned about a yard ahead of her. Very similar, but the characters' positioning after the attacks is certainly key. Some characters' supers are easier to charge(with AP that you get from attacking opponents), but they're generally less effective. This leads to great balancing, with Parappa's no-range level 1 being much easier to charge than Dante's or Ratchet's longer-range attacks. Either way, it's a satisfying system that deserves praise.I'd recommend you play through all the campaigns to get a feel for all the characters, by then you'll most likely have figured out your \"mains,\" the characters you generally play as. After about ten hours of testing the waters I settled on Ratchet as my main, Spike as my secondary and Sir Dan as my tertiary; you can become proficient with all the characters with enough practice, but I can tell very easily that it's near-impossible to master each and every single character. All-Stars isn't quite as easy to jump in and master as Smash, but that extra complexity could(likely WILL) lead to All-Stars having much better longevity than a Smash entry, even with half as many characters. Most people would recommend that you stick with one character and just try to master them, but I'd recommend you at least have a basic understanding of each character's supers and playstyles if you wanna dominate them. The balancing in the game is great, so you could potentially select any of the game's 20+ characters and just enjoy the title with them; that said, Kratos does feel a little OP and many Radec players like to spam their sniper rifle move obnoxiously, leading to either you try to focus on THEM in frustration while the other players constantly catch you off-guard, orrr take the beating and suck it up. Matches with multiple Kratos players or Radecs(worse yet, two Kratos and one Radec) can be very frustrating, but it's already been confirmed that Kratos will be nerfed next; Radec isn't OP, his playstyle is just a little annoying to fight against in groups.Overall, I can't think of a game more deserving of my dollar vote than All-Stars. The production values are great, it's the start of a promising new IP, the game design is top-notch and it comes with a free download copy of the Vita version. One big downside of the game is its inclusion of an online pass system, a form of DRM that blocks players who don't own a new copy of the game(or people who had the game loaned to them) from accessing the online tournament mode. Sure, I want the developers to make money off each sale but DRM is the reason I quit PC gaming and reverted to console gaming- I don't want my consumer rights curbed even a little under any circumstances, especially when the only used games I purchase are out-of-print titles with extremely marked-up prices. Still, at the end of the day this is one of the best fighting games of the past console generation and I can't recommend it enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2013"}

My wife and I purchased this title, and we were amazed at how much fun it can be. There are a few glitches here and there, and I have noticed them with both single player and two player local games, but they are not deal breakers.The boxing portion has a hard time recognizing movements, even with multiple calibrations of the Kinect. I can be a technical as I want, and it just won't pick up on certain movements of the hands, which can be frustrating when you are getting your butt kicked.A few other games, like the Javelin and Soccer can be frustrating as well, but I think with practice at how the Kinect picks up your body movements can help. Bowling is fun, it feels better than any Wii bowling game. The other games, like ping pong, volleyball, track and field, and so on are all fun, and respond very, very well.This game can be a heck of a workout. I spent the first three days with it just playing all the different games, and I have lost about 10 pounds in the process. My arms and legs are sore from doing exercises I don't normally do while playing video games, but I feel great, honestly.One other note I would like to add, make sure to check on the stability of your floors, and if you live above neighbors, see if you are bothering them. The track and field has running and jumping involved, and can lead to a lot of punishment on the floor. The long jump in particular has you running in place, and then jumping as high as you can, which can be noisy, or, if you are a large person like me, punishing on the floorboards.All in all, I feel this is one of the best of the Kinect launch titles, albeit with its few flaws. I have had more fun with this than any other game in a long time. My wife has very, VERY, limited video game skills, and she hopped on in, and was able to play instantly. And beat one more than one occasion.Thank you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

(repeat)","reviewText":"I just want to say that in two to three days of moderate playing, I've already killed something like seven thousand zombies. No, that number is not an exaggeration as there's a kill count up in the corner to let me know just how many of the living dead I've taken care of. Then again, it's easy to do that when you're driving an insane vehicle created by combining a steamroller and a motorcycle and using it to plow through their rotted bodies. And boy, is it fun.Dead Rising 3 is a good, brainless time and an excellent way to kill time. The story is easily forgettable but its the experience that makes the game, not the silly tale that makes absolutely no sense at times. The controls are good but do get a little wonky at times, especially in situations that require a little finesse. The graphics are a slight step up from last gen but the draw here is the number of zombies that appear onscreen which is just outright ridiculous. No lie, you'll see literal herds of zombies, numbering in the low hundreds in most cases. The variation in the zombies is also cause to be impressed as you rarely ever find two that look alike, unless they're of a specific type like firemen or cops for instance. Improvements over past Dead Rising games include better AI for the survivors who join you, timed trials, a much larger map and even more weapons to make crazy combinations with. There's also co-op and the ability to use Xbox Smartglass, which allows you extra content. Gotta admit that it's kind of cool to get an actual phone call from an in-game character and get sent on a mission. Kinect integration allows you to bark out commands and even get the attention of zombies by yelling at them.Dead Rising 3 is a perfect game to kill time with and even if the story reeks, that won't take away from the sheer novelty of butchering zombies by the boatload and using literally everything including the kitchen sink to do it. As far as Xbox One launch titles go, this is definitely one to pick up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003DNLDUC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"The War in the North is BROKEN and FULL OF GAME-BREAKING BUGS","reviewText":"EDIT: You can read my former review (below) but I feel obligated to edit my review for the following reason: It is broken.  There are game-breaking bugs stopping people from finishing this game (like myself).  While many people have reported these bugs and glitches on the LOTR:WITN website, developers and paid-fanboys defend the game continuing the assure us that a patch is coming soon to fix this game.  I know some PS3 owners have had game-breaking bugs with Skyrim (though personally I have not experienced any of these Skyrim game-breaking bugs, I feel for those who have) yet Bethesda has made effort to fix those bugs.  Yet this game has been out longer than Skyrim and still no effort has been made to release a patch for it.  I find this unacceptable.  I've had it for nearly a month and no patch was released and I could not continue playing this game from my broken save point.  I refuse to start over.  I am extremely disappointed WB Games and in Snowblind Studios for releasing this game untested and unfinished.  Please do not support this game until a patch is released.  I returned the game to Amazon because it was broken and unplayable.Presentation:I have to get this out of the way.  The menus in this game suck.  They look like something for a beta game.  They just plain look like no thought went into them.  There are also a lot of loading screens that feature the same artistic piece based on the game's charters.  You end up looking at this loading screen a lot, so it's noteworthy that they could have at least had a couple of different art pieces for you to look at.Graphics:The graphics in this game look pretty good.  The environments are quite good, and believable, the overall art direction of this game fits very well into the Tolkien universe of Middle Earth.  The character models look fine, there are a few things here and there that stand out as odd (such as eyes and the like) but overall they look quite good.  The animations in this game are very rigid and aren't varied enough to make the characters believable.  It's unfortunate really, because if this game had been released even 2-4 years ago, it would probably be considered to look quite good.Storyline:I actually like the storyline in this game.  You know you're getting into a Lord of the Rings game, so you know what to expect particularly if you've seen the trailers.  I like the idea that some unsung heroes go north to fight a threat in the north.  This idea is great, and is presented well in the trailers to the game.  However, it feels like the developers felt that these trailers/opening cutscenes were enough to excite you about the game.  Many of the game's cutscenes play out like RPG dialog pieces and while the voice acting is good, the charcters feel flat and underdeveloped.  The reason for the War in the North is there, but it's not often emphasized.Gameplay:This is a hack-n-slash game with some light RPG elements.  First it shuffles you down narrow corridors (with lots of invisible walls).  This is unsettling, because the game encourages you to search for stuff and you end up constantly hacking containers and looking for loot to pick up (coins, arrows, jewelry you can sell, elf stones, swords, etc.  The main meat of this game is the hack-n-slash of the enemies.  This works well, at first.  You fight a few enemies here and few enemies there and you begin to level up your character.  You end up realizing that you only have a limited number of moves (2 attacks to be exact).  No matter how much you level up your character you end up watching the same boring animations as you deal out light and heavy attacks.  Let me make it clear:  there are no combos and nothings else interesting for you to level up aside from some skills and armor/weapons you just end up doing the same thing over and over.  I find this disturbing, not because I don't like hack-n-slash games but because hack-n-slash (LOTR none the less) from the last generation were more fluid in animation, more varied and more interesting to say the least.  Even with this major gripe, all of this wouldn't be so bad IF this game threw hordes and hordes of enemies at you allowing you to feel like a real kick-butt hero.  Which it does-but doesn't do.  The enemy hordes feel light and thin for such a game as this, but then you realize why.  Each enemy take numerous hits to bring down.  This adds to the monotony of the game making you feel in capable of bringing simple Orcs down.  Better swords help lessen these sponge enemies, but I can't help but wonder why Lord of the Rings Return of the King still is the best Lord of the Rings video game I have ever played-oh that's right, because it was fun, varied animations, combos, you killed hordes of Orcs quickly and with style.  Those were the days.  Snowblind Studios should have been taking notes from EA's LOTR games from the last generation, I had hoped this is what that game would be-a better version of those games.  But sadly it's not.Sound:The game sounds great.  The quality orchestra-pieces remind you of the Howard Shore score and the horn calls send chills down your spine.  The dwarf's crys to fight the hordes of enemies reminds me of Gimli and really does a great job making me feel like I'm in middle earth.  The orcs and the metal and metal sound great and overall the game just sounds right, not amazing but good none-the-less.Conclusion:This game is not without some minor errors as well.  Sometimes enemies/friends jumped from one side of the screen to the other without so much as an animation to shuffle them hither.  Occasionally, the game seems to studder under the weight of too many hordes of enemies on screen at once (but this is hardly noticeable).  There is an occasional glimpse of screen tearing or an ugly texture but the biggest glaring problem is the gameplay.  It has so much potential, I just feel if they had waited for a January release, they could have improved the combat system and animations a lot and ended up with a much better game.  The character development and storyline could have used with some style and flare to help deepen it also.  It just feels like there was so much potential going into this game, that I can't help but wonder what happened.  It's a fun game overall but if I were you, I'd rent it first or wait until it's cheaper before picking it up.  The only redeeming quality this game has is that it is a lot more fun if played with a friend.  I've just sunk 5 hours playing this game with a friend and I can attest that the game is twice as fun with another person sitting on the couch playing split screen.  I imagine that playing online would be a lot of fun as well.  It just feels empty in a single-player play-through.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"A fun online game, not MMORPG","reviewText":"When I first played Guild Wars I was absolutely extatic about it. I played one day for over eight hours. This was a few months ago and I have now since finished the game with one character and am currently on my 7th character. I wrote a review back then stating that Guild Wars was the best game ever and badmouthed people who played WOW. However, after the large update and countless trips to that new area the game absolutely bored me to death. In any case here are the pros and cons of Guild Wars:The single greatest aspect most would contend is the fact that online gameplay is free. This brings many to the table who had not experienced an online RPG (myself included) and other owners of MMORPG's who were tired of paying to keep these companies servers running. The most obvious question is how do the guilds work? Well, basically a guild can be formed and you can give it your own unique name as well as a cape both with fairly small fees. To the best of my knowledge you can have as many people as you want in your guild. Likewise you are allowed to purchase a guild hall where members of the guild can meet and from there do multiplayer called guild vs. guild or player vs. player.Guild Wars has stunning visuals in my opinion; given of course you have at least a fairly contemporary graphics card and the memory to back it up with. You are allowed four characters per account and of course the ability to creat the look and class of your player. The classes in this game are warrior, monk, necromancer, ranger, elementalist, and mesmer. Weapons and armor are greatly varied with armor sets ranging anywhere from 1500 gold to over 1 million gold. Another plus is that the makers of GW plan on bringing out Guild Wars: Chapter 2 in the middle of 2006 which is purported to contain a whole new class of character from which to chose and a new map. This is will be a full expansion pack, so those who are getting bored with the current game won't have to wait too long.Now the weapons will be discussed in detail. There are five different weapon types according to their value; these are white, blue, purple, green, and gold. These are listed in least to greatest value respectively. Certain gold weapons and focus items can go for millions of gold. Just to let you get an idea of how much that is--most players in guild wars have less than 10,000 gold in their accounts. Each class has only a few types of weapons that can be used ideally. Each type of weapon also has a maximum damage it can deal on a foe. Warriors can wield two general types of weapons that deal blunt damage or slashing damage. Blunt damage weapons are two handed and swords/sickles/axes are one handed. Rangers always use bows. The other four classes all use either a one handed magic rod or wand or a two handed staff. Any two handed weapon in Guild Wars can be upgraded. Weapons essentially are the driving force of the virtual economy of Guild Wars and at the same time one of the greatest downfalls in it.The folllowing negative parts of Guild Wars are seen through my eyes, but I played the game for some 625 hours over the course of four months. so the gripes I feel are very warranted. The first real problem I see is not the game itself, but the infrastructure and community is the number of children and supremely immature people playing the game. People will cuss you out because you didn't offer them the price they were looking for on a weapon or offhand item or others can get angry just because of the lack of teamwork. Most of the time these squabbles end in one person attempting to use as many four letter words as possible. I was actually called a f**ktard by someone. Fights over teamwork go on a lot because to beat the game you have to know how to work together very well. In fact, I would say at least half of the people that play Guild Wars have no idea how to work as a group. However, if you desire to play the game solo sometimes you are better off playing with the henchmen. They do attack what you attack as long as you call out your target. Playing with henchmen lends to the idea that it could just as easily have been turned into a completely offline game. Anyhow, this is most likely the greatest factor in my stopping playing the game.Another gargantuan downside to GW is the virtual market which is 99% people driven. Obviously those at Anet were going for this. Unfortunately, prices are driven up just because a certain weapon is rare and is not entirely based on the quality of the weapon. This creates great tension between those who claim to know how much a weapon is and those who are going off of what they believe to be the correct price. The real question is where do these values come from? Is there an Alan Greenspan within Guild wars who changes the prices from day to day? My suggested solution to this is to have a true value weapons shop so there would be no debate. Along with this, some people end up paying real money to buy these \"rare\" weapons or items on websites.A terribly large controversy within the community of this game is the level cap, which is placed at level 20. Some will say this allows for more interesting multiplayer and you don't have to spend years building up your character just to fight in the arenas. The counter-argument is that once you have reached level 20 (which isn't very difficult) you have nothing left to achieve other than gaining new skills. I'm not even going to go into the \"powerleveling\" argument, because that's all a matter of opinion if you would rather be rewarded for countless hours you have spent playing this game or essentially gain nothing past level 20. Since there is a level cap, certain areas of the game are nearly impossible or completely impossible to reach without the use of a warrior with many defensive and speed skills (referred to as a runner).Lastly here are some smaller things that bother me about the game: The game is not very interactive for a supposed MMORPG. Essentially you have eight slots in which you can put your various skills and you can change your weapons and armor. A true MMORPG allows you to be in the same place as any other player anywhere on the map, not just in cities. The landscape is downright annoying at times. You cannot walk up mountains or even larger hills, so some parts resemble more of a labyrinth. Overall gameplay can get tedious especially after playing as much as I have. In conclusion, is Guild Wars worth buying? In short-yes, but only if you really want to play an online rpg for free. I must warn you it is very addictive for a while and will keep you from sleep and people. There are other role-playing games out there that I believe are superior to Guild Wars. Guild Wars is revolutionary, but flawed. Overall I give Guild Wars a 7 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ9YB0","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"More of the same great WarioWare fun.","reviewText":"Who hasn't played a WarioWare game at this point? There's been at least one WW title for every Nintendo system since the GameBoy Advance now, and they're still selling strong. These games are not only perfect pick up and play games, but they're so easily accessible to all ages that they're great choices to have on standby at a party. Smooth Moves is more of the same WW gameplay that fans of the series love, and while normally I'd be getting tired of the same old material, they somehow manage to keep things pretty fresh for the 6th time (I played the other WW games before this one). Simply put, if you need something fun that isn't going to require a lot of time, or want a game your whole family can play, regardless of age gaps, this is one that you definitely need to get.There's not much of a plot to the game, just a bunch of different characters with quick, short stories explaining what their problem is. These can range from one person giving a cat an umbrella when it's raining, only to be followed by a bunch of them when he goes to the disco club...to one friend being mad at another after he accidentally breaks their Game & Watch handheld. Yeah, it's just like how it was in the GBA and DS WarioWare titles, but I don't think anyone ever played those for the story either. I got a kick out of seeing cats and dogs disco dancing as a team. It's just plain cute fun!So if you haven't played a WarioWare game before, what do you do here? Well, it's hard to explain everything, but this is a huge collection of mini-games that have more variety than you can imagine. Most of the mini-games are a couple of seconds long and just require you to read what's on the screen, but having fast enough reflexes to do the task before time's up. One mini-game will have you shave part of a mustache off someone's face, another will have you fan brown clouds away from someone's face [only to reveal Wario bent down behind the person], and another has you make someone do squats. That's not enough variety? Another mini-game has you wack an old man's hand when he's trying to steal food, one has you throwing shuriken at a ninja as it dashes between bamboo reeds, and another requires you to pick fruit from a tree with an elephant's trunk. How you do these tasks is explained with different ways of holding the Wii remote through calm, yet still funny instruction screens. Pointing the remote like you would a tv remote, holding it like a mop, putting it on your head like a mohawk, holding it in front of your face like an elephant's trunk, holding it down at one of your hips for hula-hoop mini-games, and more. You definitely can't say that Smooth Moves doesn't deliver just that- smooth moves.The graphics are the usual WarioWare fare, with tons of different art styles. Some are rough drawings that look like they were done in MS Paint, others use low quality 3D models (this is intentional of course), other mini-games are actually new takes on old Nintendo games like StarFox and Super Mario Bros with the same visuals but smoother and faster. As a result, there's never any slowdown, and I can't really say that the game looks bad when this is how WarioWare games always look. The sounds are limited too, but still keep the WW charm. I guess when it comes down to it, this is basically the DS games but with controls for the Wii. But I don't mean that in a bad way.As you can see, I gave the game 5 stars for fun, because it's always fun playing this by yourself or with other people. But once you've done everything, there probably won't be many times you put the game back in your Wii aside from parties or to show people who've never played a WW game before. This is the same problem I had with the previous games, but don't get me wrong- the fun lasts for a good amount of time. I just wish they would've put a lot more onto the disc, as there's no way they could've filled the whole thing with what's here. But as it is, you should track down a copy of Smooth Moves immediately before the price goes up even more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003TIVSM4","description":"","reviewerName":"Xyooj","summary":"Decent 3rd person shooter","reviewText":"I've never played any of the Warhammer series.  Not a big fan of RTS games, but this game is fun; albeit a little repetitive.  I think you have to know the Warhammer lore to fully understand the caveat of the setting and story, but it's not hard to comprehend. You are the good guys, Orks are the bad ones.This review is based on the single-player experience.Space Marine is a basic 3rd person-shooter with the ability to melee mixed in.  You are equipped with a pistol & machine, grenades and are able to switch out two other weapon slots with more powerful weapons (shotgun, sniper rifle, etc).  Melee weapons include the chain-sword, battle-axe, and a hammer (you can only use pistol & machine gun with the hammer). The Space Marine is equipped with armor/shield that regenerates and when it depletes you start losing health.  The only way to gain health in this game is to perform an execution move using the melee weapons (no health packs).  This is my biggest complaint with this game because you continue to take damage will performing the execution and will die if health is too low.Space Marine also has some on-rail shooting segments and sections were you can you a jet pack.  Controls are responsive either with keyboard/mouse combo or a Xbox 360 controller.  The game does not have a cover base system so don't expect it to be similar to Gears of War.  Co-Op mode is coming soon as a free download.  Don't be too concern about the pre-order bonuses.  They only offer different weapon re-skins and costumes in the multi-player section.  It adds no stat bonuses so you're not missing much.Technically, the game performs fine on my system (Core i7 930, SLI Geforce 480, 18GB) and has the bare minimum of video customization options available. The game only allows one session, so if someone else wants to play, it will overwrite the current session, which is a bummer.  I would recommend you to wait for the price to drop or rent it on one of the game consoles if you are looking for some distractions until the next big game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

The fact that this game was made at all is an oddity.  While the first Force Unleashed was the fastest-selling Star Wars game of all time, it didn't particularly review well, and a staggering number of gamers quickly voiced their frustrations with the game's broken controls, cheesy force graphics and its detrimentally short length.  Still, that game did boast a phenomenal (and canonical) story that fit in perfectly with George Lucas' Star Wars lore.  The game shows the birth of the Rebellion against the Empire at the hands of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, codenamed Starkiller.  Beware of spoilers ahead, if you haven't finished the first game.  There were two outcomes possible...you could kill Vader and end up a mindless slave of the Emperor, or Vader would kill you, effectively making you a martyr and giving strength to the Rebellion.  The Force Unleashed II begins under the assumption that you chose the latter path.  That is its first problem...With that ending in mind, the story of The Force Unleashed ended...for good.  Lucasarts, however, were put on the spot to create a sequel, and to do that they had to deal with the pesky problem of continuity.  The result is a bland, contrived story that comes nowhere near the splendor of the first game.  Starkiller has been cloned, though it's never quite revealed if he is in face one of the clones.  Once he escapes imprisonment by Vader, the game begins as Starkiller's #1 priority is to find Juno Eclipse, his love interest and former pilot from the first game.  This motivation is played up too often, but comes off as whiny and selfish.  Moreover, the plot never moves on from that, making it fall flat on its face as it basically goes nowhere.  The end of the game features a similar \"light side\" or \"dark side\" ending, so we'll see how that ends up in the hinted-at sequel.  Ah well, the gameplay...Right off, The Force Unleashed II makes a fantastic first impression!  You're thrust into a thrilling fight to escape the planet of Kamino, with some impressive combat and a couple of awe-inspiring sequences where you're falling down to a platform far below...rain and obstacles coming at you while you use the force to dispose of them.  The combat in this game is ultra-tight and a vast improvement from the first game.  Starkiller is POWERFUL here...almost too powerful.  At your disposal you have twin light sabers (which can also dismember your opponents), the force lightning and the force push.  Soon after, you're given the force repulse, Jedi mind trick and light saber throw ability.  The result is an astonishing array of options for you to wreak havoc at your foes.  New kinds of enemies are introduced at regular intervals in this first level, and you have to figure out how to best defeat them.  Some are immune to force powers, others block all physical attacks.  By the time you finish this first level, it's not hard to feel exhilarated by the action in this game.  Then you hit the second level and do it all again...and again in the third...etc.  You'll fight wave after wave of enemies, but they're all the exact same enemies you fought in the first level.  It never introduces anything new.  After a short while, the game quickly becomes a chore until quite suddenly...it ends.  Yes, this game is short.  So short in fact, it's downright insulting.  You will not get sixty dollars' worth of content here.  On normal, you're looking at 4-5 hours...3 on easy.  There is basically no reason to pay full price for this game...at all.  I would highly recommend giving it a rental instead.The game's graphics are light years ahead of its predecessor.  I was frequently very impressed with the level of detail and how well the game runs.  You will occasionally run into some minor glitches and see enemies or obstacles floating in mid-air, but it doesn't happen too often.  The pre-rendered cutscenes are immaculate.  Unfortunately the same level of detail wasn't given to level design.  Each level really only has 2 or 3 different \"rooms\", which are repeated ad nauseum until you reach the boss.  Oh yeah...there's only 3 bosses in this game, and only one (the end of level 2) that's really great.  Also, speaking of levels, there's only about 6 of them and most get really boring.  This is because the majority of the game is spent on Kamino (which is grey and rainy) or an orbiting spaceship (which is grey and dark).  There's also a very very brief level on Dagobah (which is grey and jungle-y)...you see where I'm going with this.  Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but the locales chosen for the game are so bland!  Why not follow the example of the first game and give us some variety?  The game's second level is gorgeous...why couldn't we get more of that?So yes, this is The Force Unleashed II.  It's a fun game at times, but the horrendously short length keeps me from recommending that anyone fork over full price for this game.  It's a shame because the game has so much potential!  But in the end, it comes off as a rushed product.  Whereas the first Force Unleashed had a great story to make up for the poor gameplay, the exact opposite is true of the second game.  Unfortunately, there are many more games in this genre that feature great gameplay AND good stories (see Dante's Inferno, God of War III, Enslaved), so you decide if a sub-par Star Wars tale is worth it to you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

Part of the issue was that, yes, it's really, really hard.  I went in knowing this, so I don't know that I can criticize the game on that basis.  However, I there are a bunch of game design choices that I didn't agree with.  Basically it comes down to the fact that Demon's Souls hides the ball too much.  You want to make a really hard game?  Fine.  But don't also make it really hard to figure out what is going on, where to go, how to get better gear, etc.  Don't make an interface filled with symbols that I need to have the manual in front of me to even interpret.  This game would basically be unplayable without using the internet for help.My first big problem is why, in 2011, make me replay the entire level every time I die?  I don't know about you, but after I get home from work I don't want to torture myself by replaying the same level 20 or 30 times to try to kill a boss whose patterns can only be learned through trial and error.  I'm happy to just fight the boss 30 times in a row, and I did just that in God of War III.  I knew about the replaying the whole level thing before I got the game, but I underestimated how annoying it would be.I realize that even the recent Mario games have the same mechanic, but Mario is different because the levels are MUCH shorter and because you could, in theory, get through most of the levels in a few tries.  Mario doesn't have so much trial and error and is more about having good reflexes.Demon's Souls has a lot of trial and error. Yes, I realize that it's also very much about reflexes and definitely skill, but there's stuff in the game that's going to kill you no matter what the first time you face it (especially bosses)...and when it does you have to replay the whole level to try again.  And get killed again.  In my opinion, that's not fun, and it's bad game design. If you have good gear maybe this isn't true--and that leads me to my second problem.The game is completely obtuse about telling you anything.  It doesn't explain where or how to get better gear, learn spells, or do anything else.  It doesn't even really give you any hints.  You could only find better gear or progress by going through a horrific amount of trial and error or by looking it up online (which I did before I even put the disk in).  I would bet 99.9 % of people look stuff up, but I'm judging the game based on the idea that it should stand on its own.  I don't think it's really hand holding to at least suggest to you where you might find decent gear or that you might want to save those Demon's Souls (I saved them because I looked it up first, but what if I hadn't?).Last, and I doubt that anyone could really disagree with this point, the interface absolutely sucks.  It's harder than it needs to be tell whether one weapon is better than another, what the stat modifiers do, or really much of anything about the gear you are using. Why make me memorize all these little symbols on the inventory screen? You can't just write \"this weapon adds + 10 to strength?\" like every game I can remember playing in my life?  There are probably 20 year old games with a better, more intuitive interface. Diablo 1 is like 15 years old and is 100 times better. Same thing goes for world tendency--what person would actually figure this out on their own?  Nobody.  This game would be unplayable without the internet.Oh yeah, the inability to pause is completely stupid.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

I love what the pork bun guy says, but it seems lots of people from vendors to people you just bump into on the street have something to say.Bad1. Lots and lots of cutscenes at first.  Probably too many and some of them go on a little long.  Sometimes I feel as though I'm watching a movie, not playing a game, especially in the beginning.  It does get better later in the game, so maybe they just used a lot of cutscenes to establish things but I think they went a little overboard on it.2. You're playing out a story, but there's really no decisions or choices here.  This doesn't make this game any different from any others in the genre such as Saints Row or GTA, but given the type of story it is and the conflicts that the main character is dealing with, it may have actually made sense to force some choices.  Not in a blatant do you choose to do this or that way but in a more subtle, if you go here and take this action you're making a choice vs. if you went to a different spot and took a different action.  This doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game, it just limits the possibilities of it.3. There's a good amount of glitches, bugs and other issues.  They can interfere sometimes and require you to restart a mission like if your car or character gets stuck.  I also noticed other minor glitches here and there, but none were enough to really lower my impression of the game.Overall I definitely enjoyed the game and the story.

{"product_name":"B00DHF39KS","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"Best Shooter on PlayStation 4","reviewText":"Wolfenstein: a nostalgic title for gamers the world over, just not for me. I seem to be one of the few people in existence that has never played a Wolfenstein game. In fact, I had never even heard of Wolfenstein until this one was announced last year. But I was excited when I found out that it is an alternate history first person shooter. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: I don&#8217;t deserve the right to review a game with such a rich history since this will only be my first in the line; well I did anyways. So did Wolfenstein: The New Order quench my thirst for a good alternate history game?Yes, Wolfenstein: The New Order has an over-the-top story. But that is what it is trying to achieve. It&#8217;s not just trying to act like Germany won the war, it wants to make it fun by imagining what it would be like if they had giant robot guard dogs, AT-AT (Star Wars) like robots, and exoskeleton suits during the 1940s-60s. And boy does it accomplish what it set out to do. For some reason I thought that Wolfenstein was going to be funny, and instead found out that it is a very serious game, to the point that it was actually really touching during some scenes.I found myself caring far more for characters than I thought I would as well. I believe that Machine Games achieved this by the way they told the story. It is not your typical first person shooter where the story is told in a two minute cutscene between missions. Wolfenstein: The New Order had cutscenes before, during, and after each mission and there was almost always a familiar voice on the other end of a radio during each mission as well. The story may have been a little crazy at times, but it was so fun that it was worth it.Wolfenstein: The New Order looked absolutely fantastic on PlayStation 4. Well okay, most of the time it did. Character models, views from a distance, and important objects (robots) were beautiful on screen. That being said, Machine Games really took the easy way out with just about everything insignificant. Textures for the less important objects in the game were either 2D or just not up to date with what you would expect on a current generation console. The example I have in mind is when you are in the resistance&#8217;s home base exploring, all of the kitchenware, boxes, books, folders, etc. laying around look horrible compared to everything else. This happens all over the place in the game. It is easy to look past because, like I said, it is all very insignificant stuff; but in the end it silly that we still have things like this. One more texture issue I had happen quite a bit is that new levels, areas, etc. would often have texture popping. It&#8217;s as if the PlayStation 4 couldn't load the textures fast enough or something. This is just another thing that seems silly to me. If this was a problem on PlayStation 4, I can&#8217;t imagine how bad it was on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. If you are considering Wolfenstein as a last gen purchase, you might want to research it a little first.As good as the story is, the gameplay is even better. It starts off as a typical first person shooter to get your acclimated, but slowly introduces you to the different ways to play the game, such as dual wielding heavy machine guns or using stealth abilities. If all you care about is a tightly controlled first person shooter, then you found your game.However, it can be so much more than that if you give it a chance. Do you want to run-and-gun from one end of the map to the other with two assault rifles? Go for it. Do you want to crouch in the shadows, sneak up behind enemies and kill them by throwing a knife at them, using a silenced weapon, or just slitting their throat? Go for it. Just about every level in the game gives you the ability to choose how you want to approach it.And what makes this even more fun is that you have four sets of challenges to unlock, depending on your play style. Each set will unlock new perks that will apply to your character, such as the your gun holding more ammo or the ability to throw knives. Honestly, I found this the most fun because it gave me something else other than the story to work for in each level. I loved leveling up each challenge tree to try and unlock the next perk.One more thing that makes the gameplay in Wolfenstein: The New Order better than most average first person shooters is the collectibles. Each level is filled with several different kinds of collectibles; from gold items, to letters, to soundtracks, to enigma codes. The enigma codes are cool because if you get enough of them to make the full set, you will be able to decode them at the main menu to unlock new modes for game. For a little hint at what kind of modes they unlock, the first code unlocks 999 mode; you have 999 health, unlimited ammo, but are on the hardest difficulty.But even with all of the great things Wolfenstein does, there are still a few hiccups. Glitches are a part of every game, but I haven&#8217;t had a problem with them in years it feels like. I ran into several glitches in Wolfenstein during my 15-hour playthrough. One time I got stuck on a loading screen that just never ended. Another time I got stuck on a piece of wood sticking out in the middle of a map and could no longer move. Those are just a few of the annoying glitches I found, so I hope it doesn't get too much worse than them.The other issue I had is that the checkpoint system is by far the worst I have seen in a game in the half decade or so. We live in a time when games auto save just about every 30 seconds or so. Machine Games must have missed that memo because when you die in Wolfenstein, more often than not you will have to restart 5-10 minutes before that, and sometimes ever farther depending on how you approached that level. This is not really a problem with the game, because it doesn't break it, but it sure is annoying to lose all of the progress you made in a level each time you die. This may have also been done to appeal to the older generation of gamers who grew up with this design technique.The Verdict: 8.5 out of 10If you like first person shooters and can handle a little over-the-top storytelling, this is the game for you. When I compare the amount of fun I have had with first person shooters on PlayStation 4, Wolfenstein: The New Order stands far above the rest. Sure, it doesn't have multiplayer, but that shouldn't hinder your experience. The textures can be an issue if you are a stickler for that kind of thing, and the glitches/checkpoints can be extremely annoying from time to time, but overall The New Order has a fun and engaging story line with even better gameplay. Even if the lack of multiplayer is the problem for you, this is a game I encourage you not to skip. Wolfenstein: The New Order is a solid first person shooter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47TE","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"a surprising technical improvement","reviewText":"A sequel to the PSP's earlier \"Portable Ops\", MGS: Peace Walker is a surprising technical improvement when compared against earlier games. Focusing on the management of a larger mercenary organization, \"Peace Walker\" still has its share of stealth-based tactical action.Peace Walker returns to the world of Big Boss, rather than the series' usual protagonist, Solid Snake. In the period between Portable Ops and now, Big Boss has left the US government and assembled his own mercenary team, the MSF. Peace Walker centers around managing the MSF by carrying out missions, recruiting new members, developing new technologies, and building up the off-shore platform used as the MSF's main base.Gameplay is divided into story missions (main ops) and side missions (extra ops). The main ops constitute normal gameplay, broken up into segments. The extra ops are closer to the VR missions from MGS2 - short, timed scenarios with some twist or quirk to them, like \"rescue the hostage\" or \"find the mines\". Mission maps are wider and more detailed than in Portable Ops, and many missions take place in an area consisting of several connected maps, which makes the world seem larger. There are a lot of areas that are wooded or swampy, which calls back to MGS3 and its more natural environments. Another MGS3-like feature is the lack of a \"standard\" radar - items like sonar must be equipped in the item slot and have limited battery life, making players more reliant on their own senses to spot enemies.Managing the MSF is one of the game's major features. New recruits can be captured in the field either by subduing enemies or rescuing hostages. These recruits have a diverse set of stats, and can be assigned to different units, like combat, R&D;, or intelligence in a manner similar to Portable Ops. Unlike Portable Ops, every recruit wears the basic MSF uniforms; there's no difference between capturing a guard or a sniper. Characters are instead distinguished by portraits and codenames, both of which are randomly assigned. This allows for some level of identification, although it unfortunately doesn't carry over to actual gameplay. Every character is now represented by a generic masked figure (male or female) except for Snake himself. However, there are different costumes and camouflage uniforms (all of which have masks), and the uniforms have different stealth values and inventory slots. This allows for different types of gameplay depending on the uniform selected.Bosses come in two main types: vehicles and mechs. Vehicles consist of things like tanks and helicopters. Vehicle fights often involve supporting troops - if they're out of the way, the vehicle's commander can be incapacitated or killed and the vehicle can be captured for MSF's usage. Mech fights are more traditional MGS boss fare; instead of capturing them, however, it's possible to salvage parts and AI cores to build your own mech. Both vehicles and mechs can be sent off (along with troops) to missions in other parts of the world. These \"Outer Ops\" are automatically resolved, but provide a way for the majority of your combat forces to get experience (since only one person can sneak at a time).Peace Walker focuses a lot on multiplayer, as well. There's a fairly standard versus mode, but the main attraction of multiplayer is a cooperative mode. This allows for players to attempt missions, or even fight bosses, in groups of up to four. However, multiplayer is limited to nearby PSPs - there's no online match-making mode or anything of the sort, despite the presence of pre-written communication (which should only really be useful if you can't talk to the person in real life). The relative rarity of the PSP means that this feature will most likely go unused.Overall, Peace Walker does a lot of things right that Metal Gear should do right. The bosses are fun, the environments are detailed, and the controls are tight enough to not be a problem. It's not quite the second coming of MGS3, detail-wise, but it's definitely a worthy successor, considering its handheld status. The management aspect is fun and addictive, though the actual logistics of the whole thing could have used some fleshing out. Peace Walker is a solid game both for fans of the series and for those who aren't usually interested in it.Rating: 9/10.Game purchased through Playstation Network.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

The DS feature (outside of the ability to have a map on a screen at all times which was damn near essential) is the 'sealing' of bosses. You fight a boss and when its health is extremely low you are prompted to draw a symbol on the screen.Imagine you masterfully fighting a boss, then you see the seal prompt and frantically grab the stylus, but before you can draw it, time runs out. You get angry, put the stylus down, and continue fighting the boss (even though you beat it). You then beat it down to the seal part, and try again, but mess it up. You get angry again, throw the stylus somewhere, and repeat the process until you draw with your finger.Literally that is the one and only bad thing about the game. In every other way it is either equivalent or better than the gameboy advance Aria game.PS if you beat the game you can play as a Belmont with whip, the magical Mina, as well as my retro favorite, Alucard","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2005"}
{"product_name":"B008GEH9HO","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Big Screen = Big 3D Difference","reviewText":"I liked the idea of the original Nintendo 3DS, but I could not wrap my eyes around the 3D effects on its smaller screen--my eyes just felt crossed and strained. I'm happy to say that the 3DS XL is the perfect solution: each screen is nearly double the size of the original 3DS and the feel of peering into it isn't as eye-crossing and difficult.If you're new to the idea of the 3DS, it is Nintendo's excellent follow-up to their handheld DS, DS Lite, and DSi consoles, with one huge difference: the top screen produces 3D visual effects without the need for any special glasses. This feature works very well, but there are some very important considerations when using the unit:- You shouldn't play more than an hour at a time without taking a break: this technology really can strain your eyes- While the American Optometrists Association has cleared the 3DS sceen for everyday continuous use, Nintendo of America strongly urges that children limit the time they spend using the unit to short sessions, and that children under 7 not use the 3D aspect at all.- The effect really only works when your eyes and the screen are properly balanced.This last part is really the only drawback to the 3DS technology, and the reason I tend to waver between full-on 3D and fully off:  when it works, it's worth getting the full experience, but if it doesn't, pulling the slider back doesn't change the fact that your eyes have dropped out of the 3D 'sweet spot'. When you play a game with 3D aspects to it, tilting the screen screws up the effect. This doesn't sound like a big deal until you try to play a game like Starfox 3D 64, which is best flown by tilting the unit to steer the spaceship; or Kid Icarus, which flies you around on the screen but expects you to hold the unit, bang the shoulder buttons, and still manage to hold the stylus and work it across the touchscreen constantly throughout gameplay. When 3D is completely off, you can better see, but of course you don't get to see any depth to the game. When it's completely on, I find myself having to hold very still in order to keep my focus.  More passive gameplay titles like Mario work better because it's easier to keep the unit fairly fixed while you play.While 3D is the showcase of the unit, there are a LOT more added features that aren't immediately obvious. For example, if you choose to close the lid of the unit and have it standby rather than power it down, Nintendo have given the 3DS and 3DS XL a technology called \"StreetPass\" that will cause you to swap data with other people who happen to walk by with a 3DS in standby mode.  You can also earn gold coins by walking--the unit acts as a pedometer and with every 100 steps will award you a gold coin, which can be redeemed in some games for various goodies. Wi-fi is integrated into the 3DS so you can play with friends over the Internet, or you can play locally with friends nearby using this technology. The 3DS offers Netflix (available as a separate download) for watching movies. The Nintendo Store is integrated into the unit so that you can download games or other content (such as videos) onto the unit. The 3DS has a slot for an SDHC memory card (4GB, included) and you can load one or more cards with games or content. Last, the 3DS boasts a camera that can take 3D pictures: its twin lenses snap images that pop right out of your 3D screen.If you have an older DSi or 3DS, there's good news:  you can transfer your old files--pictures, videos, and game saves--to your new unit fairly simply.  Like the 3DS, it contains a 3D Camera that can shoot 3D pictures and video, which has been tremendous fun to play with.  There are several more apps on the unit, such as:- 3D Sound:  record and play pack sounds- Mii Maker:  like the Wii, you can make one or more Miis (avatars of your player)- StreetPass Mii Plaza:  congregate with other Nintendo gamers, collecting Miis, trading items, and even co-oping your Miis with other players in little battles- AR Games:  for those of you new to the idea, there is an amazing 3D technology that involves laying out special \"AR Cards\" on a flat surface and interacting with them through the camera and controls.  This is probably the greatest showcase of the 3D technology I've seen so far.  I took the main card, placed it on the table, and so long as the camera could see the card, it created all sorts of 3D games to play.  The unit visually warped the tablecloth into a mini-golf course, made it look like a fish pond that I could fish from, and as I walked around the table plinking arrows into pop-up targets, I even got to fight a dragon that I could move behind or to the side of...all appearing to be happening on the tabletop in front of me.  It blew me away.- Nintendo Zone:  allows you to pull down unique content \"at participating locations\"...I'm thinking the best example of this is my daughter getting to download a special Pokemon at her local GameStop.  In this case, SpotPass lets you walk through an area and automatically receive goodies of various sorts.There are some people who are unhappy with the sound quality of the 3DS XL.  While I found the speakers to be plenty loud for one person playing at arm's length, others may be experiencing poor quality.  If you're using headphones, which type can make a difference--for example, 3D sound over-the-head headphones will have noticeably better quality than cheap earbuds.  However, there are also multiple options for sound in the Settings section of the 3DS XL:  \"Stereo\", \"Mono\", and \"Surround\".  You might find Surround to work better or worse than Stereo, depending on how you're listening to the unit.  I've also noticed sound adjustments in the music player that only apply to playback of music and not to the system as a whole.If you're looking for a fun new hi-tech handheld, the 3DS fits the bill. It has a lot of extra features beyond being just a game device. The 3D technology is fairly impressive, but more to the point you will get more enjoyment of 3D out of the XL's bigger screen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2012"}

Where characters in other games often only get a couple of upgrades, Kirby can literally change into dozens of different forms. If you come across a guy wielding a sword or a guy spitting out flames, you can choose to absorb either of them and have that power. The levels in \"Squeak Squad\" wisely play to the advantage of Kirby's ability and provide lots secrets and alternate paths that are accessed depending on who you absorb. For instance, you can absorb an animal enemy and be able to dig through certain surfaces. Absorbing fire-breathing enemies allow you to melt snow, while breathing ice freezes lava. The joy comes from figuring out which to use and when. There are 8 worlds (5-6 levels each), with every world having its own theme (jungle, clouds, etc.). The levels themselves are typically fairly easy, but there's challenge in finding all 120 hidden chests scattered throughout the game, and in the boss fights. \"Kirby Squeak Squad\" doesn't stray too far like \"Mass Attack\" or \"Canvas Curse.\" Sometimes being a straightforward 2D platformer is enough when you're Kirby.--- 4 STARS ---","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}

The graphics are okay but not the modern day war game and in third person, and the sound glitches up allot but not as much if it is brand new. As i saw how hard this game was i just went on the quick battle and battled on it to get allot better and i decided just to do that unstead of continuing the story mode. As i got pretty good i started to use cheats on the quick battle so i would enjoy it better. It is very fun to go on multiplayer because you can battle in a big arena against each other or on the same team or just by yourself.

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platformsChains of Olympusbinds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.Combat Moves, Both Old and NewNearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes allGod of Wargames andChains of Olympusis no exception.Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"The Gods Get Tiny","reviewText":"Having played the other two God of War titles, I still didn't expect much from a small-screen PSP game.  I have to say I've been incredibly impressed with Chains of Olympus for the PSP:  the game looks and plays 99% identical to its big-screen counterparts.(For kicks, you *can* grab an A/V cable and play it on your TV...but I digress)Just as with other titles in the series, Chains of Olympus provides you with an ongoing storyline, heaps of slaughter, and many different combinations to produce the right effect in battle.  It also gives you the ability to choose which skill areas to \"level\" as you collect orbs, and how far you want to raise them.  Last, we have the in-game plot sequences and the unusual puzzles (reader beware:  your sexual skills will be put to the test shortly into the first chapter).There are differences, but thus far I see only minor ones:  for example, camera rotation can be a bit difficult, and dodge-rolls require tapping both shoulder buttons.  These are still somewhat easily worked around: with a little time and practice, a player can adapt pretty easily.Overall, if you're a fan of the God of War games and want the same experience on the go, you won't be disappointed.  If you're new to God of War, this is what you'll get on the big screen, too--you will enjoy Chains of Olympus as much as you'd enjoy the others.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previousMidnight Clubreleases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories. At the time of publishing only a fraction of the total list has been announced, but a good sampling of what players can expect at launch can be seen below. Click the links in each category to see screen shots of the cars:Muscle Cars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saleen S302 Extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chevrolet Corvette Z06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodge Challenger Concept CarBikes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kawasaki Ninja ZX14Exotics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aston Martin V8 Vantage Roadster&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford GT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamborghini Gallardo SpyderTuners&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volkswagen R32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pontiac Solstice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXExtreme CustomizationMidnight Club Los Angelescontinues the tradition of offering some of the deepest vehicle customization you will find in any video game. The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

So i started playing it and i notice there's a little video error on the bottom right corner of my screen. i'm not sure how to explain it. there's bunch of small little boxes over there. Its like the cd (or blu-ray) been scratched or something, but the cd is in perfect condition since its new. i don't know what it is.The next error i got was when i used nitro in one of the races and my game froze! It only happened once... hopefully there's no more problems in the future. I don't know if its the PS3 or the game that is causing these minor problems. Both are brand new and I bought both of them from Amazon. So I'm going to send this game back to Amazon to get a new one and hopefully there's no more of those boxes on my screen.As for the game itself, I wish they make it with more realistic crashes and the ability to run people over. If I'm driving over 100mph and I crash into a wall or into another car, I expect my car to be totaled. I also wish I can turn the music off (*edit 11/12/08 I realize you can turn music and other sounds off by pushing start while you are on the road to get to the menu.

A teenager Juliet does her usual stint as a Zombie killer,which hardly perpetuates into an engrossing and gripping game play.Most of your time is spent running in a straight line,with an occasional fork on the side,to battle hordes of Zombies,a la Dynasty Warrior fashion.The problem with this mechanic is that the game play becomes placid and prosaic just minutes into the game.Both the Enemy placement and AI is atrocious.These surfeit of enemies just wait to be dispatched via quick button mashing,and do not provide any feasible challenge.You can purchase moves and health with Coins collected from killing enemies.These moves hardly come handy,because most of your time is spent quickly getting rid of your opponents,by mashing the attack button.Adding to the misery is that after you press an attack button,you have to wait for the subsequent animation to finish.You cannot break animation by successively pressing attack buttons to change animation in the vein of BAYONETTA. Also Juliet faces the other way around if the enemies shift their positions.As a result your character cannot turn quickly to retaliate.The Level design is also underwhelming where you are mostly running in a straight path through under detailed and unimpressive environs.There is an occasional fork or a boxy environment on the side,which is not particularly exciting to enter,because you will be doing the same thing.That is mashing the attack button to get rid of another group of stupid enemies.This is what you will be doing in the whole game.Later on you get the ability to use your weapon as a gun to shoot enemies,instead of hacking and slashing.These shooting excursions are also generic and totally lackluster.It feels the same as hacking.This minor advantage in shooting is that you can empty the bigger heath bar of a slightly stronger enemy,from a distance.The amount of strategy in firing,added to an already paper thin fighting mechanic,is negligible.There are also some mini games,interspersed between levels to break a modicum of boredom.Retro mini games between levels are annoying instead of entertaining.Developers should focus more on making their games tighter,challenging and more fulfilling.These gimmicky intrusions,just don't cut it.The graphics in cut scenes are okay,but the in game graphics are terrible.You will not be ably to see clearly the faces of the foes you fight against,90% of the time.levels are lacking and are devoid of any grandeur or magnificent architecture.Think of Tomb Raider II's superior level design.The only positive accolade that i can shower on this game,is its rich pulsating soundtrack .Akira Yamaoka shines once again.I will not talk much about the story,because there is nothing to talk about.This is one more D level storytelling with obtuse and offensive dialogues,that are sometimes gross and misplaced.None of the characters have any weight or personality.Lollipop Chainsaw is a below average game and an inherently mediocre one in whatever it tries to accomplish.With no credible staying power,this piece of software is reduced to a bargain bin status.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2013"}

Both Halo and Morrowind prove that XBox is the dreaded dumping ground for PC type games. Depending on your perspective this can be either good or bad.I have mixed feelings about Morrowind. It has some interesting elements to it, but its mouse &amp; keybord style controls (similar to Halo) are a serious annoyance, as are its overly complex character creation and game play mechanics. I think this is as close as it gets to a perfect translation of a pen and paper RPG to a console game as it gets. This strength is also a weakness. It can take hours to generate a character. I'm also upset that we have so few options with how the character would look. Our options are hideous, to ugly. There are not enough options, and no matter what you do your character will be pretty darn unattractive. For as elaborate as the rest of the game is, this aspect of the game is a sore disappointment. I had no problem establishing a character as a &quot;hottie&quot; in Sega's Phantasy Star Online.The game is unusual for a &quot;console&quot; RPG. It takes place in a first person perspective, something I'm not sure I like. It's interesting, and bearable, but maybe I'm just used to playing console RPGs in the vein of Final Fantasy.The graphics of this game vary. The water in this game is simply amazing, the scenery is intricate and detailed, the character models are mediocre, however, and there is one major complaint I have with the title, horrendous load time. I thought the XBox was supposed to be the fastest. This game will show you why Nintendo's data streaming technique and mini-DVD is a much smarter choice. I'd like to see this game using data streaming technology because it would drastically cut down the seemingly hours of load time. However, unlike past PC-like console RPGS (Summoner for PS 2 come to mind) this game makes it worth it to sit through the loading, and actually has game play tips and hits which are very helpful during loading sequences.As a hardcore RPG fan I found this game to be quite enjoyable despite my complaints, and would definitely recommend this game for console players wanting to test the waters of a more PC oriented game, or hardcore RPG fans who want something that is unnecessarily overly complex. The game's complexity will woo some gamers, but will surely scare others. I strongly suggest renting the game before you buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"awesome Halo1 goodness in a fresh package with new features","reviewText":"If you ever loved the original Halo game or if you were curious about the Master Chief, you have to get this game!  The new graphics and sounds are just awe-inspiring.  Everybody has heard that you can easily switch graphics back and forth but until you try it out, you don't realize how amazing the new graphics are and how quaint the original graphics were.  You can either use the controller to switch graphics via the Back button or use Kinect by saying \"remastered\" or \"classic\".  It's not just Halo at a higher resolution like the PC version was.  This version has all new textures, new skeletal models, more polygons, more color, etc.  For example, some wall may have a flat gray surface in the original graphics but then in the new graphics, it's a wall with textures, cylindrical tubes (looking like industrial piping), more color, etc.  All the sound effects and music were redone (you can check the comparison videos on youtube from the developers to hear).I won't go into describing the entire game and will rather cover the stuff that most people are glancing over.A feature I always wanted to do online but couldn't before is the co-op campaign.  Now you can do the co-op campaign over Xbox Live or via system link.  In the original Halo game, you could only do splitscreen co-op campaign which means you had to have your friend come over and you had to split the screen in half.  They didn't even allow co-op over system link back then.  Also, the multiplayer in the original Halo was extremely barebones (you basically had deathmatch and capture the flag).They've added skulls to find around the map and it's pretty cool searching for them.They've added terminals into the game to tie Halo1 into the other Halo games and to give hints at Halo 4.  These terminals are advanced versions of what was seen in Halo 3 and are only available when playing in the Remastered graphics.  When you play with the original graphics, the terminals are static backgrounds.The Kinect features are very very cool. There are ZERO INSTRUCTIONS FOR KINECT which is kind of sad. Luckily, the game uses controls from Dance Central but it took me awhile to realize this.  In addition, you have to be connected to the Internet in order to download the update to get the Kinect features.  The Kinect features do not come on the disc.  Once you have installed the Kinect update from Xbox Live, the Kinect features are always available such as when you're offline.  Unfortunately, the Library and the Analyze feature are Kinect only but if you really want this information, there are other ways to get it (just not within the Halo game).As indicated in the video (but not described completely), when you say \"analyze\" you enter an analyze mode where the screen turns blue. anything that shows up as orange can be scanned. Analyze mode looks cool and looks like the thermal sensors of the Predator. so you point your reticle on the orange object and say \"scan\". it will then be put into the library for you to browse and read information about the object. You'll be scanning multiple weapons, characters, various types of enemies, ships, vehicles, etc.When you're at the main menu, you can go into extras and then select Library. Once in the library, you can enable Kinect mode. At which point, you navigate the objects just like Dance Central. you raise your right arm up and down to go up and down the list of items you scanned. Then you swipe across your body to load the object description. you can rotate the object around, scroll text, etc. To get back to the list of scanned objects, you swipe your left hand just like in Dance Central.Apparently, you can go to the library directly from within the game but I didn't try that.For the voice commands, they're really cool.The first benefit is you can change your settings inside the game without having to go to the menu/settings page. So if the level is too dark, you can say \"brighter\" and immediately see the changes. If you want more contrast, you can say \"more contrast\". If you want to turn off subtitles, you can say \"subtitles off\". Note that the settings has to be enabled before the cutscene begins so you can't say \"subtitles on\" once the cutscene has already started an expect to see the subtitles while in mid playback.Saying \"reload\" is not useful. mainly because when you are shooting your gun, it won't reload with the voice command. You have to stop shooting for it to reload as far as I can tell.\"Grenade\" is also not really useful but it's neat and more responsive than \"reload\".Now the useful voice commands are things like \"flashlight\" and \"change weapon\". I actually much prefer saying it than pressing Y for changing the weapon. It's very responsive and just as responsive as pressing Y (in contrast to \"reload\" which has a little lag and the stupid have-to-stop-shooting) in my opinion.I didn't try commands like \"pause\" but that seems useful (though I think I'll stick to hitting the start button for that).The \"Analyze\" feature is uber cool. Even in the heat of battle, I was turning the feature on and scanning things as I was fighting. It makes it like an adventure game or RPG.In the box, you get a single Anniversary disc which contains everything.  So you do not need any other Halo disc to have a full experience.  In addition, the game comes with a code so you can download the Anniversary maps into Halo Reach.  That way, if you own Halo Reach, you can have all your maps with 1 disc.  Similar to importing your Rock Band songs all into one collection so that you don't have to worry about multiple discs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

Okay, I really wanted to like this game. There were things I did like but the killer for me were the checkpoints. I don't mind difficult games and the controls were not that difficult. Yes the pistol is a pea shooter but that didn't bother me that much because there is generally plenty of ammo. The grappling can be fun and this was the main draw for me. I made it to the second part of the game--the industrial complex. There is a part where you have to jump to a building and kill the five guys there. No big deal. Then you have to jump across to another building. Once there, you kill 16 guys and then have to jump to another building. THis is all one checkpoint. The fights are not hard. I was never killed by the moron AI in this game. The platforming is just way too unforgiving. The game starts off by saying that you can fall off a building. Sure, as long as there is no water as this idiot drowns in 5 seconds flat. Even considering the fact that the Bionic arm weighs him down, he should be able to hold his breath for at least 15 second. Long enough to find a grappling point to get out of the water. Nope--5 freaking seconds. So if you fall in water, you are dead. If you go the wrong way and hit some radiation, you are dead. In other words, I killed those same 21 guys four times just because I missed a jump and fell into the water. Linear? Hell yes. There is only one way to get to the destination. Some person mentioned that Killzone was linear. Duh, it is a standard first person shooter. You never get the feeling in that game that you can explore the entire area. Bionic Commando fools you with the wide open landscapes and makes you thing that you can go all over the place. Radiation everywhere and water makes sure that this is not the case. When it comes right down to it, this game is not fun and I returned it to Gamestop in one day. I will take a straight linear shooter any day over this crap...EDIT: Actually I ended up giving this game another chance and made it all the way to the second to last level. I didn't finish the game(that part jumping from jet to jet just frustrated the hell out of me) but is is worth the price once you get used to the grappling. Mastering the grappling skill in this game is essential!! The boss battle with the gigantic robotic worm alone is worth giving this game a chance.

I will cover the different modes of the game in their respective sections below.Campaign:In my opinion, the campaign of BO is one of the best I have played and is very well written! I won't spoil it for you, but this is the basic story. It is set in the 1970's. You start as Alex Mason, an American soldier being interrogated about information concerning the location of a numbers station. You play through flashbacks of what happened to Mason and other members of his squad during the Cold War and Vietnam War leading up to when he was being interrogated. You play through many different enviornments such as jungles in Vietnam, military outposts in the snowy Ural Mountains, and even in a Soviet cosmodrome. The game loosely follows real history, including dates of events, famous political figures, and battles. It is very entertaining, providing many hours of gameplay. The campaign on Veteran difficulty is not too hard, but brutally hard on some points of the game. There are lots of vehicles to drive or fly, and many cool sequences. There are also intel items to find during the game, and each piece of intel reveals a cool feature in the menu. The game has very talented voice actors, such as Ice Cube, Gary Oldman, and Sam Worthington.Multiplayer/Combat Training:The multiplayer of this game is very fun. There are 50 levels to progress through, and there is a different system of how you unlock different weapons. In Black Ops, you use a currency called Call of Duty Points, and they can be used to purchase Weapons, Attachments, Perks, Emblems, Titles, and Equipment. After every game that you play, you earn a specific number of Call of Duty Points, varying on how well you did or if you completed a Contract (challenges that reward you with XP and CODPoints). I personally like this system better then the ragular system because when I unlock a weapon, I can get whatever Attachment I want for it right away instead of having to use it for a long time before I can. You can also buy Lethal and Tactical Grenades, Equipment, and Perks whenever you want, as long as you have enough money. CODPoints can also be used to buy different symbols for customizable emblems and titles for your online profile. Unfortunately, CODPoints cannot be shared with friends, so if you're low on cash, you'll just have to earn it. Another great feature is Wager Matches, where you gamble CODPoints with other players. There are many game modes, such as the Gun Game, where if you get 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place, you earn some of the winnings from the bets. It is a very fun way to earn CODPoints if you do well. Another feature is called Combat Training, where you fight offline against AI enemies either alone or with friends. It's just like regular multiplayer, except you can play with AI players on your team and on the enemy team. You also rank up in Combat Training, but it's a different rank then in Multiplayer. It's very fun because you can choose what map and what gametype you play. You can even choose the difficulty of the AI, so you can play against terrible Recruits or lethal Veterans. It also very useful for sampling different perks, guns, and attachments so you're not wasting your money in real Multiplayer.Zombies:Zombies mode is back, and it's bigger and better. If you're not familiar, Zombies mode is where you fend off endless waves of zombies, which progressively get harder. Up to 4 people can play via Xbox LIVE or Split-Sceen. You earn points for each Zombie killed and each barricade fixed. You use those points to open doors and buy Perks and Weapons. If a player gets killed by the zombies, his teammates can revive him to get him back up, or if he dies, he respawns the next round. Zombies mode is very addicting and I recommend you get the map packs for Zombie maps.Overview:I would definitely recommend this game to a friend because it has a great Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies mode.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2012"}
