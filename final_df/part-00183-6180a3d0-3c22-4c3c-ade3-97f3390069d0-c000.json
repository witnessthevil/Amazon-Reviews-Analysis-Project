{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"ffootballguru27","summary":"Blows away Madden, falls short of 2K2","reviewText":"Microsoft's NFL Fever is one of the best games for the newest system availible and is way betetr than msot of the competition...that is except for NFL 2K2.

{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Nice!","reviewText":"This game reminded me pretty much of SOCOM. Similar graphics, the guys look the same, except SOCOM didn't have vehicles, a great arsenal of weapons, or a great story. Mercenaries has it all. Mercenaries is involved with ExOps, and you take the role of one of 3 characters. You do basic military missions; basically seek and destroy, or seek and capture. And since you are a mercenary, you get money for all the missions you do, which are mainly capturing terrorists. This is an action filled game, and it's a heck of a lot of fun, but there is a bug i found so far, and that's when you are in a vehicle and you are under a very narrow bridge or maybe ceiling of a building, you can't see anything but the inside of the building, and it's kinda frustrating. That and the camera angles are a hastle. Anyways like i said, this is a fantastic game, but like most games, it would be an awesome game if it had multiplayer and/or online play! But it doesn't matter; with the action in this game you don't care if it's online or multiplayer...the only thing you're concerned about is your current mission.~One of the best games of 04/05~~Best shooter~","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2005"}

{"product_name":"B001YI0Z2U","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"The first great game of 2010 has arrived!","reviewText":"Having never been a fan of the Devil May Cry games, I was apprehensive about getting Beyonetta because I assumed it would be a mindless button-masher. Fortunately, the game offers more immersive gameplay and plenty of strategy in it's fighting mechanic, and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. The insanely fast pace of the game and beautiful graphics make this the first great game of 2010.The story of the game is interesting enough, but it merely serves as a set-up for the various fights. In a nutshell, you are a femme fatale who wakes up in a tomb with little memory of who she is and how she got there. She discovers her importance as the game progresses, and what we get is some fun, occasionally hilarious and sometimes dirty storytelling. But the story comes second to the action in the game. During the battles, you are able to pull of some impressive combos which consist of pressing the right button at the right time, as well as pressing a combination of buttons to enhance your attacks. Stringing together combos results in more damage and some nifty cinematics, and you will get better weapons and learn new combos as you progress through the game. Overall, it's exactly what you would expect. A slick, sexy and totally over the top beat-'em'-up.The gameplay is easy enough for novice gamers to grasp, although it is recommended that you spend adequate time in the tutorial as you will need to commit the button combos to muscle memory, especially when the battles intensify. A casual button-mashing gamer can survive most battles, but there is enough strategy to satisfy the more hardcore gamers who want to be challenged. The graphics in the game are gorgeous and lively, and the soundtrack is also highly enjoyable. The only flaw I would pick out is the camera, which sometimes has a mind of it's own and this can be a nuisance during battle. However, it's hardly a deal breaker. The rest of the game is slick and polished, so genre fans and action gamers will definitely find much to like here.With 2010 already shaping up to be a great year for gaming, Bayonetta is a great way to start the year off with a bang. The game may be more style than substance, but it's a great time and definitely a game worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000RZPW9W","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"This would have been a vastly different review, a few months ago","reviewText":"The funny thing about expectations is just how much it can ruin or promote a game.  As an example, I was one of those annoying people who ended up not liking Fable as much as I'd hope to (and complained about it to deaf ears) because I had followed it from its first announcement to its eventual birth.  In the same way, I have followed Age of Conan far longer than I should have.  Four years.  Longer than most engagements.Well, after finally \"marrying\" Age of Conan (and buying it a \"fancy\" ring by not only purchasing it, but dropping $90 on its shinier Collector's Edition), I can understand why the divorce rate in America is so high.  It all falls back to expectations.  For me, things started out wonderfully.  We had our honeymoon in Tortage and for the first weekend or so, I was in complete heaven.  The first twenty levels of the game are perfectly plotted and staged, with wonderment occuring around every bend.  The story that plays out is small and self-contained but feels epic and truly feels like the start of something great.Then the honeymoon ends.Leaving Tortage, things start to sour.  The story takes a complete backseat, with story-centered quests popping up every 10-20 levels or so, and instead you're treated to relatively empty environments that are stocked with creatures, sometimes with incredibly long respawn counters.  So, you think...\"wow, this is a huge change from the first twenty levels\" but you keep on keeping on because new shiny skills keep popping up.Undoubtedly, you'll start to run into problems.  Instances won't work as they should and some won't even let you in (half of my guild couldn't access the 40-80 level resource instances like Frost Swamp where some of the epic gear starts to drop).  The ones that do let you in, you realize, oftentimes have quests that only one person per instance can complete.  There you go, having to repeat a not-too-inspired zone five or six times just to complete a quest.  This wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem, if the zones were interesting.  But they're not; some of them are simply windy small passages resembling mazes that open into larger, empty rooms.  Very boring.At about the level 60 mark, you start to realize that maybe you rushed into this relationship a bit quick.  Maybe your friends were right and this person you find yourself waking up next to is a complete mystery.  From here until the end, you start to wonder if the developers (Funcom, a group I have/had the upmost respect for--look at my reviews for Dreamfall and The Longest Journey) spent their four+ years of development on creating Tortage.I divorced Age of Conan last night.  It wasn't as messy as I was expecting.  There are some good ideas here.  Tortage is amazing (the first few times you go through it, at least) and a lot of kudos should be given to the team as they crafted a story that could be told from four different perspectives.  The combat system is an interesting take on a stagnant genre and I've discovered that it makes other MMOs feel slow by comparison.  And the graphics are unmistakeably beautiful.  But like that dumb model, once you strip away the beautiful exterior and the assets, you start to realize that there's not much depth underneath.I loved Age of Conan in the beginning.  Now, I just feel annoyed.  There's a lot more I could have discussed (the lack of customer support, petitioning for issues that took days to be resolved, the horrible online community, the horrible lack of community outreach, the boring zones, the broken content, the content that was originally promised then silently scrapped, etc.), but the point is that Age of Conan isn't what I was expecting.  Some people might enjoy it, but there's not enough content here to keep me coming back.In the meantime, I'm getting back in the saddle.  There's another one I have my eye on.  I've seen Warhammer Online slyly making eyes at me from across the room.  I've been thinking that maybe I'll saunter over and say hi.  But this time, I'm going to take it slowly and get to know the game beforehand.  This time, hopefully, I won't be burned.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"N E 1 4 Hotdish?","summary":"Better than Expected","reviewText":"Usually my gaming opinions fall right in line with those of critics.  I set myself up for heartbreak on this one, purchasing Medal of Honor based on commercials and my fond memories of very past installments.  Before I even had the chance to open it, the Metacritic scores started to plummet.  I was furious.  Return it unopened or give it a shot?  I'm glad I gambled.First and foremost, I know I might be stuck in the past, but I live for single-player offline modes in FPS.  I bring my PS3 to places without internet access, therefore having a few good single-player games are very important.  This mode in Medal of Honor did not disappoint me.  Judging story and overall experience, here's how I'd rank it:1.  Modern Warfare 12.  Battlefield Bad Co 13.  MEDAL OF HONOR4.  Battlefield Bad Co 25.  Modern Warfare 2The plot is much more serious and true.  As a military vet I can usually tell which game designers did their homework, and which make it up as they go along.  This was definitely heavily researched.  Of course no video game is without it's unrealistic elements, which is why we play them I guess.  But this does an excellent job of showing the gritty, no-nonsense business of Special Ops. I think it took me right around 6-7 hours to complete.  While that isn't ground breaking in length, it's about what you get with the other franchises nowadays.  Also, I found it refreshing that even on \"easy\" mode, two or three shots from the enemy and you die.  If you stand out of cover for even a second or two, you will be killed.As for multiplayer, my experience is limited to a lot of MW1, some MW2, and a little BC2.  When I gave this a try I had no idea what to expect.  Would I be shot from across the map 100 times with a grenade launcher or SHOTGUN??!!  Would camping snipers guard spawn points?  Would a-holes sprint across the field like leprechauns, knifing hundreds while miraculously never taking a hit?  Unbelievably, none of this took place.  I play exclusively on the hardcore mode, mostly to ensure none of that ridiculousness is experienced. My first round, I had a really enjoyable time.  My kill/death ratio was 2:1 (which is pretty good for me), and hit detection was fantastic.  Just like in Battlefield, there were times when I and an enemy would shoot simultaneously.  Fairly enough, we would both die.  There aren't idiotic perks like gunships hovering over head, mowing down hoardes the second they respawn.  There are missile/mortar/air strikes, but from my experience, they are a crap shoot.  The controls are extremely responsive, and everything just seems to work.  Just like Bad Company, there is no \"lay prone\" ability, but the sniper would be quite imbalanced if it was an option. I've now got about 10 hours into multiplayer and still love it.  It brings me back to the enjoyment I had when I first discovered MW 1.  Although honestly, the lack of cheap deaths in this one almost make it slightly more fun (blasphemy I know).So to summarize, I'm very happy I made this purchase.  I'll probably buy the new Call of Duty as well just because I really enjoy FPS.  I don't see why we must pledge allegiance to one game and write poor reviews against it's competitors.  If you're a fan of the genre, you'll enjoy this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"CJC","summary":"A great addition to the Star Wars titles","reviewText":"I heard this game was good, but found it to be pretty freaking awesome.  If you like Fable, you'll like this.  The game incorporates the whole choice based alignment of the character but in a more RPG format.  I've been playing this on my XBOX 360, and although the emulation is far from perfect, the graphics are still fairly decent and the game plays pretty well.  Some sound bugs and FPS bugs will result when playing on the 360; however, but the game is still more than worthwhile to play.In my opinion, the choice based system of this game is what makes the game.  The ability to choose everything from, what your character looks like, to whether you will sneak past enemies or fight them is what makes this game rock.The story line is well put together too.  The player has a lot of control over how the story goes, which affects the characters alignment throughout the game (good or evil).If I had to sum this game up with one simple description, I'd have to say it is like Fable crossed with Septerra Core crossed with Star Wars.  All  3 already rock, put them into one game and you have this masterpiece...bugs and loading time aside.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"I Loved It For Awhile At Least","reviewText":"I have always been a fan of pretty much anything WWII and this game grabbed me from the start.  When I 1st stuck in Call of Duty World at War I was totally blown away by the single player campaign.  I found the graphics were awesome and the sound was even better.  I felt the music though repeating a lot was well done and it really added to the action when the music got more aggressive during big action sequences.  I was totally blown away in the 1st level that takes place at night when all of a sudden there is a flare shot up in the air and a surprise awaits you even though these surprises are not often it was nice.  One thing I did notice that the hiding attackers or when someone rushes you it feels kind of overdone so you come to expect it but it was satisfying to rush them.  I guess maybe the Japanese attackers were really this aggressive in WWII but even with that said it feels overdone.  I also found myself getting blown up by so many grenades and dying that it became very annoying. Something else that annoyed me was enemies coming up behind me or out of my field of vision and giving me a quick death. It kept me on my toes and on edge but even that felt annoying.  I did find the AI to rather weak to the point where I killed a room full of people with a knife and one time I ran through a mission with just a flamethrower.  The game lacks depth when it comes to story or character development and it would of been nice to actually feel for the characters like BIA Hells Highway.  I guess by the amount of content out there a lot of knowledge of WWII exists so people know what WWII was about and Call of Duty games are usually just straight forward war games.  I wouldn't say this is as good as when I 1st played Call of Duty 1 or two a few years ago but it still does WWII games justice in my mind.I really did enjoy this game all the way through its just the second time I went through I began to notice the problems with it.  I try to enjoy WWII games b/c one day I believe there will be no more made since the genre is overused so I enjoy them while I can.  I really enjoyed Call of Duty 4 and I think I enjoyed this one even more since I guess I like WWII over modern combat.  I found the blood effects to add to the gameplay but I am not saying it satisfied me to blow someones brains out or stab someone charging me ,but the overall depth feels better with these extras.  I guess my biggest problem is this game doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done.The problems I ran into like going through the entire campaign in one sitting that took me about six or seven hours b/c I couldn't bring myself to put it down.  This was not a good thing since most games I like always have a strong single player experience.  Then again WWII games are kind of hard to keep you coming back to single player since you can't really add to the experience you already had.  I didn't buy the game for this reason so I rented it.  I think this game is a five star rental in a heartbeat but sinking 50 or 60 bucks in another game it just really isn't worth it.  If you are more into multiplayer than have at it and buy it but for me its just a rental.Multiplayer on the other hand was fun while I had the game at least at 1st.  I ran through the entire game before trying multiplayer so I already unlocked zombie mode and plus I already had a hang of the controls.  I absolutely didn't like deathmatch which I am sure its for some people I just couldn't get into it.  For some reason it reminded me more of Counter Strike since its more about who has the quicker trigger finger.  Odds are if you get on there with a veteran you will get owned though. Even though I loved Counter Strike I didn't care for this as much.  I enjoyed zombie mode most of all for some reason.  I liked the idea of being stuck in a house with 3 other people fending off nazi zombies.  I grew tired after a while of even this since the gameplay is basically repetitive and if you play with the wrong people you will have it even harder.  Co-Op was probably my favorite part be it competitive or campaign co-op.  Going along side someone and saving them about time they are gonna get stabbed in the back was a nice feeling.  This also goes along with playing with the right people b/c some will try to speed through and usually die.  I enjoy games even more when they put co-op campaigns in the mix of multiplayer either online or off.  By the time I took the game back I was kind of tired of it but it was fun believe me it just wasn't for me.  I couldn't really justify a sixty dollar purchase of the game just for this.  I know some people will get a absolute kick out of the multiplayer but it just couldn't keep me.  Even though the co-op was nice I guess the variety wasn't really there for me since all the multiplayer modes have already been done and I felt like I had played it before.  If you are an absolute multiplayer person with a passion for it I would probably say buy it but if you are picky about what you buy like me than its probably more of a rental.  I only own about three or four games all together and usually a game I buy is five star for me after a rental but anything I don't buy is usually less.  Though there are plenty of people who love this game it just wasn't for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2008"}

They reuse environments so frequently that I would enter an area and wonder if I had already been there before. Then they'll send you to quest in those same areas dozens of times. The game is like a series of poor sidequests back-to-back. They overload the game with fetch quests and act like those are major moments. The epic feel of the original game is gone. The companions are either extremely boring or oversexualized to the point of being annoying and be forewarned that if a gross amount of homosexual content makes you uncomfortable then this game isn't for you. The homosexual content in DAO was minimal and not overwhelming like it is here - you've been warned.Overall this is a rental at best.

Hanson","summary":"Joystick-breaking action!","reviewText":"Burnout Revenge takes whatever setbacks there were about Burnout 3: Takedown and tweaks them to perfection. In many ways, it is the same game, but adds a lot more to the experience.Burnout 3 was more about \"Takedowns\", which are the result of your causing your AI opponents to crash in spectacular fashion. The premise of this game is the \"Revenge\" factor. Your goal here is still to cause Takedowns, and win gold medals in every possible event, but now you score points for \"getting revenge\" at those that cause your crash. You go through a rating system starting at \"Harmless\" ending with \"Elite\". By the time you get to Elite mode, you may need a new joystick because the one you were using will probably end up a broken chunk of plastic with wires hanging out of it from throwing it on the ground.One of the major improvements in Burnout Revenge is you can finally crash into traffic, as long as it isn't an oversized (semi truck or bus) or oncoming vehicle. Another big change is you can now activate the \"Crash Breaker\" in races later on in the game.Since you can crash into traffic, one of the events you must take part in is \"Traffic Attack\" which is a timed event, where you must speed along and keep the clock moving by hitting vehicles and performing \"trick shots\" by causing vehicles to ricochet into larger oncoming vehicles...etc. The goal here is to rack up enough cash to win a gold medal.Of course the goal in this whole game is to win gold medals in every event, which will help you advance up the charts and access the further stages. There are 10 stages to complete, each stage has varying tasks of varying difficulty.This game can be frustrating, as there is no way in real life that half the courses in this game would be allowed to exist on current roads today. Then again, neither would 3/4 of the vehicles you get to drive. The \"Burning Lap\" stages are particularly difficult, as you cannot crash even once if you want a gold medal.It's a fun game, but not without it's glitches. Your car will sometimes (and frustratingly) drop off the board and into a large white void, much like the \"Loading Program\" where Morpheus explains The Matrix to Neo in the movie. This eats up a lot of precious time. Also, oncoming traffic or opponents will sometimes appear, or disappear out of thin air.All that aside, it's a very fun and time consuming game, and if you like racing and action games, you will love this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"J. Mendoza","summary":"Don't be a stranger, Bats!","reviewText":"Well, finally we have a game worthy of Batman. I'm sure you've seen the constant media storm on this game, and if you haven't, well then you don't have internet and you wouldn't be reading this right now.Yes, this game is a must have for any Batman fan. Its a must have for any comic book fan, action/adventure game fan, anyone that likes video games should have or at least play this game.So many things were done perfectly with this game. The story is excellent. Its not just the Joker taking over Arkham. Lots of good elements thrown in, but I won't spoil anything. The graphics are excellent, with the combat flowing smoothly as you pound thug after thug. The gadgets that put James Bond to shame are way cool. Every time Batman takes one out I always hear Jack Nicholson's Joker saying \"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\" Speaking of hearing the Joker, the voice acting in this game is excellent, with both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill coming back and giving voice to the iconic characters, just like they did in the animated series many of us grew up with.Like many games, there are some flaws, but they are minor and in no way get in the way of enjoying this game. Too much, anyway. The camera will sometimes be hard to control, and the game the game does drag in a few sections, but again, overall they do little to hurt this great game.Also, I got the Collector's edition of this game, so I'll add a little about that. A bit disappointed with the batarang. Sure, I know that for legal reasons they went with a plastic toy that cannot be detached from the stand without breaking it. The journal included, as well as the small comic book (both in size and content), were nice additions. Haven't seen the behind the scenes dvd but I'm sure it will probably contain some if not all of the footage already available on the internet. So is the Collector's edition worth it? If you have the cash, then go for it. Otherwise stick with the regular edition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

Nicholson","summary":"Far Cry... FPS game of the year","reviewText":"Having played and finished all three of the most system demanding FPSs  of this year, that being Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Far Cry,  I have to give FAR CRY my unequivocal vote for the best of the best award.Why this game over the rest you ask? Fair question, let me explain...There is one thing they all have in common and that's outstanding graphics: on that point there is no  question. Where Far Cry has a slight advantage is in its enemy AI that makes it a challenge to play against and to defeat (maybe a little too hard towards the end, even on easy). However the one thing Far Cry has over the other two notable candidates is its nonlinear game play. You can, in this game get directly from point \"A\" to point \"B\" if you want to, but you may be able to accomplish the same task easier and at less risk by getting to point \"B\" by going to point \"C\" or point \"D\" first. There is just so much more choice and in turn just so much more fun. It simply has a replay value that the other don't have.That is not to say that Doom 3 and Half Life 2 aren't great games; they are and then some.The other thing besides the linear game play that took some of the edge off Doom 3 for me, was the relentless darkness and gloom. True, this initially added to the super scary atmosphere, but I found that this effect started to wear off about 1/3 of the way through.To some extent the same held true with Half Life 2. The facial features and lip sync were fabulously done.  The air-propeller driven water buggy and the dune buggy episodes were really fun, but I found the long segments through bombed out apartment buildings and parking garages somewhat repetitive and tedious after a while.All in all a great year for the FPSs if you have the hardware and the system to play any of these three games as they should be seen. Far Cry just has that little bit extra that makes it my choice for game of the year..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2004"}

The racing is fun but a bit harder than it first appears.  You see, you have to drift for boost (no surprise there) but you lose considerable control when drifting so you have to balance throttle with drifting.  That means slowing down in a race.  When you figure it all out, it is fine but I wouldnt call it \"fun\" either. The racing AI is throwing bombs at you while you are trying to boost.  Note that the initial easy level of difficulty is crazy super easy.  After that the difficulty jumps considerably.  Basically this is a gentle warning that this game is more difficult than the typical Kart Racing game.Level is design is completely impressive.  No fault there. Loading times for each and every course is 30 seconds on the PS3 and you are also waiting every time you do to the main menu.  All of that gets old.

This game is a mess. An absolute piece of garbage. How can a game that had been delayed a half a year turn out to be this unfinished, and why did they push up the release? I have a feeling they just wanted to get this lost cause out the door and recoup as much money as they could. It's obvious they didn't test this game at all outside their own offices.The game has horrible texture pop in. Sometimes just leaving a room and coming back a second later and it still takes 4 or 5 seconds for the texture to load. The shooting, it just feels off. It's like the gun is unable to aim and hit a running target at all. You can get tko'd in 1 or 2 hits and have to wait to respawn up to 20 seconds. Another problem with this game is the respawns. They give you command posts to capture throughout the game, but yet you can't spawn on them? TSK TSK whoever came up with the bright idea for you to always spawn at the starting point of the level. Not only do you have to wait 20 seconds, but run another minute or so to the objective only to get killed again.This game is very unbalanced. The attacking team almost has no chance on any objective. I sat back one game as defender online and our team literally mowed down the offensive team for 10 straight minutes. Getting an objective done while in offense online is practically a miracle. Most people don't even adjust their character to meet the class needed to complete the objective, so your mostly going it alone on a team of 7 other people. That's if you get a lag free game...The lag. It's horrible. No excuse for this kind of lag. I've never experienced this in any game I've played. I'm talking slideshow at some points. It's not just me, but everyone is complaining about the lag. Still, Bethesda/Splash Damage have done nothing to fix it, but add matches with less people. Which means you get to play in games with 2 or 3 people facing off with 2 or 3 people. Real fun! Huge maps with just 2 people per team running around. I wish they would of just canned this game. It's not a game, but an open retail beta copy right now, and Splash Damage has not done one thing to fix it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"SoulCalibur done right and it is going down in price!","reviewText":"Of all the 3D fighters Soul Calibur is pretty high up there. It has only occasionally been outclassed by certain iterations of Tekken by a small margin. Soul Calibur 4 is a \"brave attempt\" at doing some things better and changing up the formula. I suppose how well it succeeds and how abysmally it fails depends on the tastes of each gamer. Personally shameless \"Star Wars marketing\" aside I have not been happier with the franchise since Soul calibur 2.With Soul Calibur 4 you definitely get bang for your buck. There are many characters to unlock and now certain participants are not quite as \"cheap\" and \"broken\" this time around. For example I hated Tira in SC 3 but she is oddly endearing in SC 4 both because of her new voice and more balanced less unfair tweaked attack moves. Whereas she is still quick with her lethal metal ring of doom at least she cannot dish out damage on a ludicrous scale.It would take me a long time to go into each character individually. Rest assured the veterans from the other games return accept perhaps the oddities such as Charade and Necrid. There is a new boss (Isn't there always?) and overall though he is not amazing from a design perspective at least he is not completely unfair and grudgingly unlikable.Questions you may have\"Does character creation make a return?\" Yes it does. As before you can unlock accessories, garments, and gear which will effect the stats of your custom hero. You can even purchase new moves! From what I've seen the \"make a character\" feature is just as good here as it was in SC 3. You can even re-dress the main heroes, villains, and heroines!\"Is there a quest for souls mode?\" No, but there is the tower of souls in which you beat conditions and meet requirements to unlock more stuff. It is a more simplistic mode like the one in SC 2 which I like. Those that liked the complexities in SC3's somewhat strategic conquest mode may feel left out however. Once again it is a matter of taste.\"Are the controls easy to learn?\" Yes which is Soul Calibur's biggest draw. Even beginners can jump right in! It should be noted things have been changed a bit. Characters now all have \"finishers\" though none of these are gory. As before Soul Calibur 4 gets the bad reputation of a button masher but in frank honesty is takes skill and finesse to truly be good at mastering each character.  In any fighting game someone can get lucky by exploiting ring outs and button tapping but I find skilled players can more often than not defeat inexperienced players.\"Are there still cheap characters?\" In any fighter there are characters that are harder to use or the power houses who seem to have the 1-up. While SC 4 is more balanced than SC 3 Yoda and Raphael's sister Amy are complete Hellions.  You also have Rock (returning from Soul Edge, the very first game) who is very slow thus it is hard to be good with him. Let's just say even Asteroth is quicker. But before you lament keep it in perspective every fighter devised under the sun and moon has this problem. Even it Street fighter well rounded characters such as Akuma, Chun Li, and M Bison have an advantage over less conventional more difficult to figure out characters such as Zagnief, Dhalism, and E Honda.\"Is there a story?\" Sad to say the branching endings in SC 3 that would unfold in different ways depending on whether or not you would hit the right buttons in time have been cut out. Every character has only 1 signature ending and the quality of each plot progression ranges between mildly decent to plain mediocre. If you have played SC 2 and SC 3 everything makes coherent sense but the game is very unforgiving to newcomers who know nothing about the series including the intricate odd relationship of Knightmare and Siegfried. Still when all is said in done at least a story exists. I've played fighters that completely gutted any semblance of a plot and the end results were usually crappy. (Such as the USA version of Samurai Shodown 5, the first release of Guilty Gear accent core, or Mortal Kombat Armageddon)\"Are the new characters worth while?\" Undoubtedly yes! Hildegard is my favorite newcomer because she is a female knight fully decked out in armor who uses a dagger for short range and a halberd for long range. A bundle of neat mythological and anime influenced characters was also done by the artist that worked on the anime series Gantz. Believe it or not their stories were actually well thought out and they did not feel \"odd\" amongst the regular veterans. Sultry Shura is a guilty pleasure and I also thought the oni ogre girl wearing beads was simply adorable!\"Why do fighting games degrade teh wimmens??\" For those of a feminist bent it's true there are bouncy boob physics and scantily clad female protagonists in SC 4. But whereas you can cut up their clothes or armor to reveal more you can do the same to the guy characters. Tell me that a shirtless Raphael or shirtless Mitsurugi do not objectify men as fantasies of desire? Let us also not forget the most  kinky hip thrusting cod piece wearing scantily clad super freak is none other than Voldo himself! (a \"male\" character)Pros+ Many characters to purchase and unlock.+Controls are easy to learn.+ While not deep at least a story line does exist+Create a character mode returns+Each character now has a signature finish move+Graphics are truly amazing+Voice acting and music are not great but definitely good enough.Cons- A few cheap characters exist despite SC 4's attempt to be better balanced.-Newcomers entering the arena for the first time are going to be confused unless they wiki the back story.-The Star Wars gimmick feels like a shallow marketing ploy. Admittedly however playing as Yoda or Darth Vader is rewarding in a guilty sort of way. If you have the 360 version like me you will have to buy vader with X-box points because he is the PS-3 exclusive character. You can however unlock Vader's apprentice.-Females that detest scantily clad bouncy protagonist girls are likely going to crucify SC 4 without taking into account the men in SC 4 are not portrayed realistically either. All I can say is that it is a game. Have fun with the fantasies provided and do not take it seriously! Besides Hildegard is very respectful as a heroine. It's personal choice to focus on the positive or negative aspects in anything. Always opt for being an optimist!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"Hernany","summary":"Great","reviewText":"Every year there are always good games that come out and that get swept under the rug for one reason or another. They go by being missed by gamers who will only hear about them later on down the line. Rayman Origins is one of those games. It is a game that executes everything well. It's a tightly put together package that's fun and rewarding based entirely on the merits of gameplay. For those who enjoyed the platforming games such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers... Rayman Origins is a must play game. It is by far one of the most encompassing 2D side scrollers you'll ever play.As you can imagine there's pretty much no plot to Rayman Origins. And beyond that, Origins isn't really about any origin whatsoever. Rather the &#34;origin&#34; refers to how Rayman used to be. A 2D Side Scrolling Platformer. In other words, Rayman gets back to its roots. There are no raving rabbids here. Just pure amazing level design. The game is incredibly simple in its mechanics and that's part of what really makes it work. Just about anyone can pick up the game and learn the basics of the mechanics. Mastering the game, however, is another story entirely.The game begins simple. The first level is inviting. And when you first begin you'll soon earn the ability to punch before later on getting other abilities such as the ability to fly or shrink later on. The game paces itself well by holding back on most of your abilities. Only giving them to you when you rescue certain characters. And mostly making sure you utilize them well in the environment they introduce them in. The learning curve in Rayman is almost non-existent. You'll slip right into the game real easy and the game gives you ample time to practice your new abilities. There are four different characters to choose from, but choosing one over another doesn't really make much of a difference. Rather, there seem to be four mainly to bring out the multiplayer. You and three of your friends can hop on at the same time and it can be quite fun to do so... or frustrating depending on how you play. Like LittleBigPlanet and New Super Mario Bros., less is more when it comes to conquering the campaign. Your friends can easily mess you up or something, but it's actually not too menacing, given that it does allow for more risks when there are four instead of one. A character can make a sacrifice for rare items. Or you can tag in other characters when you need to.It's a good thing that Rayman Origins doesn't punish the player when things are grim, however. The game is challenging. It begins quite simple enough, but before you know it the game ramps up in difficulty rather fast. You won't even be halfway through before you realize just what's being thrown at you in each level. And some are going to require some good pattern recognition or some trial and error to get down just right. Regardless of this, however, you rarely feel like the game is being unfair. Most enemies are easy to take out. It's not the enemies that'll be a problem, however, it'll mostly boil down to the environmental hazards mixed in with the well tuned level designs. Each failure doesn't really feel like failure either, because the game isn't out to punish you. There are a decent amount of checkpoints scattered throughout, and there isn't a limit to how many times you can fail.This is also good because Rayman Origins has A LOT of levels to traverse. It's about as robust as a 2D platformer can get. Each level ends when you rescue a bunch critters (called Electoons) but the game demands replay because you'll be tallied up at the end of the level. Rescuing Electoons isn't just how you complete stages, it's how you unlock more. And if you manage to go through a level collecting all the &#34;Lums&#34; (basically coins) then you'll rescue more Electoons. There are also cages of captured Electoons hidden in every level. If you want to master Rayman Origins and explore everything it has to offer, you'll need to find them all. And this is going to require replaying some levels over and over again. Sometimes with a friend.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about Rayman Origins is by far it's presentation. The game has an incredible sense of humor and some great tunes. The introduction is funny, and so are some of the levels (who would've thought using weenies as platforms wouldn't be such a bad idea?). But perhaps where the presentation shines most is in the graphical and aesthetic capacity. This is where Rayman truly comes alive. The graphics opt for style more so than anything. Certainly Rayman Origins fails to live up to the photorealistic quality of other games such as Uncharted 3 or Gears of War. But what makes this game so important is that it showcases that style is just as important as the actual graphical output. Rayman Origins doesn't have a lot of POWER behind it, but it has a visual flair that you just don't see too much in games these days. The aesthetics are what make Rayman Origins so easy on the eyes. The environments are just amazing looking. And this is because Rayman Origins has character. And art design that helps separate the game from everything else out there. A lot of games look pretty based on the actual power behind them, but it's nice to see a game that treats its visuals as though they were on a canvas for an artist to paint. It goes beyond being something shiny and something that actually exemplifies what gaming can do when developers try a stylistic approach rather than just an all out powerful one. Every frame of Rayman Origins is brimming with visual flair and style. It is easily one of the prettiest games I've ever seen. The fact that it plays well makes it that much more rewarding. At some point when playing through the levels the design just clicks and everything flows well.This, of course, brings about the issue some gamers have with the game. Rayman Origins is a totally 2D side scroller. All the way down to the last pixel. The graphical power that the game DOESN'T have has caused some gamers to wonder if sixty dollars is really worth it. This is actually much more dependent on how much gameplay you want. Rayman Origins offers a surprisingly large amount of gameplay and depth. It'll take you a while to do everything the game asks of you. Primarily because in order to do it, you'll need to play through it a second time.If anything, the quality of the game speaks volumes. The levels are incredible, it's a great looking game and it can be enjoyed with friends. It's a game that doesn't throw in too much and manages to hit a sweet spot because of how it is stylistically constructed. It's easy to think that EVERY game has to innovate in some ways, but gaming has come to a point where we no longer needs to try so hard to be good. Sometimes mastering the techniques we've learned through the years is better than coming up with a new thing that fails. It's the execution that makes the game work so well, not the standalone mechanics themselves. Rayman Origins will surely be an underplayed game... but it most certainly won't be under appreciated.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Sometimes in life, less is more.","reviewText":"Rayman Origins piqued my interest because I was looking for a platformer that reminded me of the original Super Mario Bros. for NES. Although I often peruse Amazon, I guess you could say that Rayman was hiding in plain sight because I had no idea it even existed, regardless of the fact that it was right there on Amazon the whole time.I'm not sure that fighting/defeating enemies in Rayman Origins could have been anymore simplistic. But keep in mind, less is more. Weaponry? Nope, who needs it, weapons are overrated anyway. In Rayman, you can defeat your enemies by either jumping on top of them (think Mario Bros) or punching/kicking them. This was really a breath of fresh air because sometimes I get tired of worrying about trying to upgrade 100,000 different weapon types when you only need 1 weapon to get through most of today's games. Simply bouncing on enemies may seem easy enough, but as you progress through the game, those enemies are strategically placed so that you'll die if you make one false move. Although you don't have weapons, you will gain pretty cool powers/abilities throughout the game. The first power is the power to punch/kick. Without it, you'll have to stomp on everyone which will get harder to do as you move along. Another power you'll pick up is the ability to float or glide through the air. This is helpful for those difficult long jumps you'll have to do. You'll also gain the ability to run, which will come in handy when you have to speed through a world just to survive. My favorite abilities that you'll acquire are the wall run and the ability to swim. The wall run enables you to run up walls at full speed, while the swimming ability will let you deep sea dive wherever water is available. One of the last 'powers' you'll get allows you to shrink and get through some of those tight spaces. (think Alice in wonderland, kinda).One thing about Rayman that really surprised me was the variety of enemies. With each new world, you'll see new enemy types. This will not be a game that recycles the same two or three enemy types throughout the entire game *COUGHS Ultimate Alliance 2 COUGH*, sorry about that, I had something caught in my throat...But the enemies you face, are pretty basic for the most part and nothing too over the top. But don't forget, less is more. I thoroughly enjoyed every single boss battle!!! Each boss has a unique way to beat her/him, and once you figure it out, you're good to go. I love this because it was a nice balance of challenging you, but not making you feel angry enough to use your beautiful Rayman Origins disk as target practice for your brand new gun.Please don't fall into the trap that I almost fell into. I almost over looked this game because I thought it was just some baby game, well, it's not. If played correctly, this game will take north of 20 hours to beat. You can unlock a ton of playable characters as you progress through the game. Sure, it starts off easy, but it gets hard pretty quickly! It took me about 2 hours to get through the final world. But as many reviewers have already stated, this game has a certain charm to it that doesn't allow you to get mad, no matter how many times you die. Some might not be a fan of the cartoon like graphics, but like I keep telling you, less is more. If I were forced to pick out one negative thing about this game, I guess it would be the playable characters. Although you can unlock many characters throughout the game, they all look similar, except for maybe a different color. For example, I unlocked another version of Rayman, same guy, just a different color. Not a big enough deal for me to deduct a star though.If you're reading this review, you're probably interested in this game. If you HATE all things platformer, skip this, it's not for you. But, if you grew up on games like Mario Bros and Donkey Kong, please do your due diligence and at least rent this game. Give games like Madden and COD a break, they'll still be there once you're done playing Rayman Origins ;) If you're still in doubt, just like Amazon reviewer extraordinaire D.G.M. once told me, \"Everybody loves Rayman\"!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

You can go normal speed, fast, stop, or reverse which is all you can do with your train. You get a cannon later on which makes the train portion even worse than it already is and you have a gimmicky horn to use for the sake of being a gimmick. You cant actually enjoy a peaceful stroll down the countryside and are instead forced to shoot and kill the various pigs, birds, pirates, snowmen, etc. that attack you and your given 4 measly hits. Sure you can always get more health for your train, but you cant actually do that until the mid-point and even then, the chances of you having the rare treasure it requires to get new parts is slim to none.

Anytime you have a passenger riding with you is annoying as well and if they get mad enough, they simply get off and your forced to pick them back up again and start the whole process over again. Didnt honk your horn? They get angry. Went to fast? They get angry. Went to slow? They get angry. These people will get angry about anything which makes the train portions even more boring, gimmicky, and pointless.The dungeons and bosses themselves are simply pathetic. There is a reason why this is rated for 10-year-olds, because these dungeons were catered to 10-year-olds. Whatever happened to the reasonably difficult dungeons from the previous games that actually made you think? In this game your brain really isnt required, especially when you can write down anything you need to know because God-forbid you cant remeber something for a few seconds.This game is also more repetitive than Phantom Hourglass was. Go do a few floors in the spirit tower, go to the main dungeon, get side tracked because you have to solve everyones problems, learn a pointless song you will never use, get inside dungeon, kill boss, rinse and repeated another 6 times and the game is over. Whoever decided that this was ever a good idea to begin with and thought it would be ingenious to bring it back again should be shot. The only redeeming quality about it being repetitive is that the primary dungeon doesnt have a timer and you dont have to repeat floors that you already cleared.The controls are also horrible. Say for instance you wanted to use the whirlwind item. You would have to open up the menu, select it, tap the icon in the corner, point in the direction you want to use it, and blow into the mic. In other words, plenty of free hits for the enemies. The same directions are the same things you have to do for the other items as well. Not the mention, the pan flute is annoying and pointless. I got tired of having the blow into the mic to use it after the first time, and than I got annoyed with it after the 30th time. The constant mic use is just annoying, gimmicky, and pointless. It would have not hindered this game to add in D-Pad controls, but no, Nintendo had to make this game for the crowd of casual gamers that think its revolutionary to have touch-screen controls that make a bad game worse than it already is.Simply put, this game was trash. It was the same un-enjoyable experience I had with Phantom Hourglass years ago and little to nothing was improved. In fact, they managed to take the same game and make it worse. Skip this garbage and go find something decent to play.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005B70Y","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"fun but repetitive","reviewText":"Crazy Taxi was originally a very popular arcade game, and first made a console appearance on the now-defunct Sega Dreamcast.  In 2001 Crazy Taxi arrived on the Playstation 2 and sold enough copies to make it onto the Greatest Hits line.  It was only a couple of months ago that I finally picked up a copy of the game.The premise of the game is that you are a cab driver and it is your job to pick up fares and deliver them to their destination in the allotted amount of time.  There are no rules, only that you get to the destination as fast as possible.  You can drive in whichever lane you want (or the sidewalks), and hit as many cars as you need to if it helps you get to where you are going.  It is a fast paced game and is a lot of fun.There are two game modes, Arcade and Original.  Arcade Mode has the San Francisco level that you may have played in the arcade.  Original is a brand new level created just for this game.  While the streets are different, there is no difference in the gameplay, and after a short time of playing, I didn't really notice any difference between the two.  On each of the two levels, you have the option to play by arcade rules (limited amount of time with time bonuses for delivering passengers quickly), or to select a specific time limit.  There is another game mode called Crazy Box.  Crazy Box is essentially a training mode where you get to perfect your skills.  There are initially 9 different challenges (and some of them are quite difficult), but as you complete the challenges, a couple more open up (and these are exceedingly more difficult).  The good thing about Crazy Box is that it is something different from the regular game, and as an added bonus, I probably would not have learned some of the skills/tricks in the game without Crazy Box.The game is fun, but it is awfully repetitive.  After playing for a week or two, I started quickly getting bored because there is very little variety in the gameplay and you'll find that you are just bringing the same customers to the same locations and the fun begins to wear off.  Rather than purchasing this game, it might be best to be a weekend rental with some friends.  Even though it is only a 1-player game, it does have the sort of party game feel to it.The four star rating is for the initial fun, but it wears off too quickly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001B5U80K","description":"This hack-and-slash adventure is set in the mining settlement of Torchlight, a town founded on the discovery of a rare and mysterious ore called Ember. This valuable ore has the power to enchant and corrupt but its value is such that many are willing to risk their lives for it. Now, miners have uncovered Torchlight&#x2019;s buried past: a dangerous labyrinth of caverns, monsters, and ruined civilizations beneath the ground that have been corrupted by Ember&#x2019;s dark influence. As Evil threatens to overrun the town, a Champion is needed. Players will have the opportunity to save the town of Torchlight, battling through rock and fire, through lost cities, and across ancient tombs on a perilous journey to cleanse the mines. As one of three Character Classes, Players will explore randomly generated dungeon levels, battle a huge variety of monsters, and pursue endless variations of fame and fortune.","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An addictive, enjoyable \"loot & level\" action RPG/dungeon crawler from the creators of Diablo","reviewText":"Torchlight, which includes the developers of the first two Diablo games on its core design team, is very much in the spirit of that storied franchise.  A single, 35 floor randomly-generated dungeon, a hub town named Torchlight, 3 character classes to choose from (tank, ranged, and magic user) and a bunch of great enemies to slaughter and loot, and you have a very charming, addictive and easy to play game for a great price.Given the pedigree of the team over at Runic, the core gameplay of Torchlight works brilliantly and will keep you coming back for more.  The combat, loot drops, level progression and character development are very well done and quite satisfying.  One thing I must mention and give kudos to the creative team for, is the overall simplicity of all the user interfaces.  Menus, inventory screens, skill trees, character equip screens, maps, HUD, and pretty much everything else related to the interface is extremely streamlined and works well in a way that makes it very easy to use.  Of course, once you get into the game and discover more of its secrets, there is a satisfying level of depth added to the proceedings, but even then, handling it is never complex or overwhelming.  Torchlight is a perfect game for someone new to this genre, yet at the same time, will satisfy the veteran gamer too.  The art style is very pleasant and the music is excellent.  And finally, the most brilliant touch is your pet, who not only aids you in battle (and who can transform into a variety of powerful creatures by eating fish), but who can carry unused loot on its back, and even run back to town to sell stuff for you!  It's a slice of gaming brilliance that makes the game even more difficult to put down, since you no longer have to go back to town to offload your excess inventory.If I had to nitpick a few things that could use improvement, it would be that the game could use a bit more environmental variety.  This is not a problem to the degree it was in a game like Dragon Age II, but still, having the game take place in a single dungeon puts a restriction on the artists that I imagine is difficult to overcome for even the most talented of the bunch.  And also, why in the world does this game not have co-op?!  That would have really been icing on the cake....the game begs to be played with a friend.Torchlight is an easy game to recommend to everyone who wants a satisfying action RPG lootfest at a modest price.  The main quest will take you around 20 hours, and there are huge numbers of side quests and infinite end-game content to keep you busy for a long time.  This is an exciting first project from this studio and makes me eager to see what not only Torchlight's sequels will be like, but their other projects as well.  Fans of the genre and newcomers alike should definitely give this very enjoyable game a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2012"}

But the difficulty of it comes from what you really control: The floor. That is right!! You have to move the floor to be able to move the monkey. In other words, you move the floor not the monkey.Now the sequel will arrive on august 29, 2002 (yep, the same day of Super Mario Sunshine) and it is looking awesome. First of all, the game has now a great story mode in which you will have to roll your monkey to defeat the bad Dr. Bad Boon. The game will also feature the old mini-games (the old mini-games with new features and options) plus 6 new ones (Dog fight, Monkey Tennis, Monkey Soccer, Monkey Rafting, Monkey Baseball, and Monkey Shoot out). It is a complete party game!!A game for babies? Think again!! This game will start easly enough for you to practice for the real challenge. The more you advance, the more difficult the game gets (just as any other game would). But sometimes the difficulty will be so high that you will NOT pass it without enough practice.

The best multiplayer out there is Counter-Strike: Source with the HL2 engine but CS is not a blast `em up and is extremely tactical with a `one death and you are out' type gaming experience in small maps. Since HL2 is totally devoid of another multiplayer then what is the next best frag? Answer - UT2004 of course!UT2004 is multiplayer all the way. Like UT2003 it has a single player/team co-op that spans the course of what is close to 120 + maps. 120 HUGE MAPS! So basically the single player mode is one big frag-a-thon on some fantastic maps of your choice. The bots have all preset AI or configurable ones meaning that having 30 bots chasing after you on GOD mode is quite possible - not that you will win or anything. So the AI is well up there in single player mode which, although has a massive number of maps, lacks one thing - a story.A story however is not what UT is all about. UT is about fragging and team play - i.e., LAN parties and INTERNET gaming is the main reason to own UT2004. Did you ever want to fight in that huge battle like at the end of Episode II? Well there is a game mode called ONSALUGHT that lets 18 vs. 18 pit it out against each other taking down node points so that they can be king of the other's castle by blasting up the core. It really does play like that battle scenes of EP II with tanks on the ground, 30+ characters to choose from, several aircraft, ground vehicle, all can be piloted by you, with up to 10 weapons of your choice, each with alternative fire buttons. In the vast maps there are a million ways to die and a million strategies to choose from. There are also some nice new movements like double tap quick strafe and double jumping.What of the graphics? STUNNING! The graphics in the trailer or screenshots do not do the game any justice. Watch the end of Episode II. It is more like that. Run this game on a Radeon 9800 and you will not stop playing multiplayer for the next 12 months... that is until UT2005 comes out. Realistically enough you can actually fight this first person shooter in 3rd person mode!In short this game is like it says on the box - UNREAL.Pros:- Awesome maps.- Vehicles!- Outstanding graphics.- A fast game engine with nice crash physics.- 100% Blast `em up.- Internet 32 player Games!- Onslaught game type.Cons:- Huge 6 CD install.- Learning curve is high for 1st person shooter.- Character movement is bit too fast.- You need the internet to experience UT2004 fully.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Sensational hack n slash action!","reviewText":"Visceral Games' Dante's Inferno is a fantastic game.  This is one of those rare moments for me where I started a game and played nothing else until it was finished...and even then I want to play it over again right away!  No, it's not a perfect game, but above all else Dante's Inferno is just plain FUN!It's a hack 'n' slash game, and to say it's similar to Sony's God of War is the understatement of the century.  Let's get this out of the way, it is a God of War clone down to the tiniest detail.  If you've played (and enjoyed) the God of War games, you will be right at home here as there is almost NO learning curve whatsoever.  Therefore, if you're looking for original gameplay, then stay far away from this one.  But hey, God of War I & II were two of the finest video games ever created, so if you really enjoyed those two, you should get Dante's Inferno straight away!  The level design is just as innovative since it was designed by the person who actually DID the God of War games.  Several time throughout the game I knew what I had to do because I recognized the situation in GoW, so yeah, many parts of this game are pretty familiar.  However, this is also what makes it such a good game.  I simply could not put the controller down.  In addition, there are a good bit of collectibles to find and abilities to power up.This game takes place in the nine circles of Hell, and boy, Visceral Games did not shy away from creating a hellish atmosphere.  Straight out of Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy, the imagery of the poem's Hell truly comes to life.  Souls constantly scream in agony, demons and other grotesquely deformed semblances of humanity are thrown at you, and as you descend into the lower circles the ominous forboding feeling of Hell itself is always felt.  The circles are all distinctly different.  For example, Lust is shown as a whirling windstorm around a demonically sexualized tower, Gluttony is a realm of digestion and all the bodily functions that accompany it, Violence is a trip through a river of boiling blood, and the final circle of Treachery is an icy void that ends in front of a towering Lucifer.  The scenery is incredibly impressive, and to me, THIS is what makes this game work.The story isn't the breakthrough that God of War's is, however.  The Divine Comedy serves as a benchmark to begin this tale, but many liberties were taken for obvious reasons.  Dante is not a poet, he's a warrior from the Crusades.  Characters such as Cleopatra and King Minos became bosses, etc, but the basic framework of Aligheri's Inferno are there.  I didn't expect to see Lucifer as described in the poem, but alas there he was.  In this game, Dante travels through Hell to rescue his Beatrice.  Flashbacks occur that showcase the events that formed Dante's past, but for the most part they are nonsensical.  The character of Virgil acts as a ghostly guide for Dante, and through this character we learn about Hell and why it is how it is.  Not until the last three or four circles does the story come together, but when it does it's really good.  The ending of the game is downright epic, and after seeing it I'm hoping this game sells well enough for the potential sequel.Technically, the game is merely competent.  The scenery, as I mentioned, is wonderful...however the character models could definitely have used some polish. Some of the special effects also seem somewhat last-generation.  However, the game does run silky smooth at a constant 60 fps with no screen tear or aliasing.  The movie cutscenes (of which there are only four), are superb and fortunately you can view them at any time once you reach them.  Lengthwise, this game is on the short side.  Ten levels in all, roughly 7 or 8 hours on easy.  However, there will be downloadable content released in April that will add multiplayer co-op and user-created content.  Plus getting all trophies/achievements will require more than one playthrough as it's difficult to obtain all upgrades (a second playthrough will include all the upgrades you had when you finished).If you're even a casual fan of the hack 'n' slash genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.  It's fun and it's engrossing, and at the end of the day that's what gaming is all about!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}

Ever since the first game, i have been hopelessly addicted to lionhead's real-life action simulators.I won't call them RPG's because they aren't really. That's besides the point, Fable III treads on ground rarely traveled, a seamless experience, based in Albion, the world they have made and evolved as time went on. Only this time, you literally are in control of everything, not just battle.Fable 3 talks about revolution, in fact, its the entire conflict of the game. Your brother, Logan, is a ruthless tyrant, slaying all who oppose his rule, levying heavy taxes, putting children to work. All those nice things your mom would probably disown you for. Well, you and the people have had it, and its time to kick his butt off the throne, take over and run this kingdom like any sensible citizen would,(whether your sensible is tyrannical, or wondrous) But, there's a small hitch, since you're only human, and Logan has an entire army, you're rather screwed trying to overthrow the guy alone, you need an army. But really is all this stuff worth doing at all?What's Good:Graphics:The graphics are improved from Fable 2, though not like i thought they would be, environments look much better in my opinion, but it seems a large amount of detail is missing from the actual characters. Mouths don't behave like a lot of comparable games, and though facial expression is there, i just thought that with all the effort that went onto lifelike movements, the faces just lacked real emotion.All the prettiness comes with a price, though. Fable 3 stutters in frame rate often (without install) bringing the game into slow motion. These hiccups mess up jobs you're doing, things you're fighting, and remove you quite effectively from the game world (immersion).Hit Detection and Movement:From the last Fable, i was introduced into \"grass skating\" a wonderful sport that takes place when you run on grass and turn a bit. Rather than refining the intricate run to change the way the run looks in relation to the ground, they left the run animation the same, as such it looked like the character was on ice all of the time. Thankfully this was fixed, all of the animations in Fable 3 are quite realistic and very fluid. In addition, Fable is still one of the only series that puts hit detection in walls and objects, if you strike a wall with a sword you will be rewarded with a glance back as the metal twangs off the wall and vibrates all over the place, effectively ending your follow through. Just like in real life, the same happens here in Fable 3, not only that but animations change near a wall to prevent you from accidentally hitting a wall with a swing, turning what would have normally been a swooping side strike, into a overhead stab.Combat:As I explained earlier, the hit detection is excellent, this makes combat a breeze to learn and it works excellently. X is attack, Y is shoot, B is magic, Hold any button and point to do a targeted charge up strike, or hold X to block, and use A to dodge. All seamless. Unfortunately, there is literally no challenge in Fable 3 whatsoever, so the impressive combat system is more wasted than anything, the only enemies that provide any sort of challenge are Balverines, but any spell or gun that can stun them will easily allow you to kite them and take them out with little harm to you. As great as the combat works, its very sad to see it not meet its true potential.Menus:Or lack thereof, replacing the menu is a 3D world dubbed \"The Sanctuary\" and guided by John Cleese (Whoo!) Essentially this is the menu it has Armaments, Achievements, Status, Options, Dog, Clothes, and Items/Live areas, with a Map at the center of it all. Simply walk up to anything in the Sanctuary and use it or change it the way you see fit. All this with no load screen. Was pretty impressed with it. Though i think I'd have preferred the Save/Load be mapped to the \"&lt;| Back Button\" for convenience. Sure there are sub menus in the midst of the Sanctuary, but it feels much less like say, an RPG status/equip screen. It was a welcome release to the tried and true of something like Final Fantasy where text is paramount and essential, it also eliminates the majority of the navigational issues found in menus, its very very hard to get lost in fable 3's Sanctuary, and better yet even easier to figure out how to use it. The Sanctuary is the most intuitive menu i've used in a video game, if its excessive so be it, its still really nice.Story:Overall, though a bit too straightforward, Fable 3's story is a cut above the other two, its action-y and i cared about its players. I Especially cared about Walter, who provided a large amount of comic relief, and seriousness to the title. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and thought things went the way they should have, I wouldn't have changed things, and the story ended, its not a cliffhanger. It ends, its satisfying too.Weapons:Morphing weapons is cool, Spell weaving is cool. All of the weapons in fable look excellent and morph into even greater excellence. Your friends, even yourself in different playthroughs will have drastically different weapons.Now what i thought needed improvement, or things i just don't understand.Property:Since properties are instrumental in making money (they are pretty much the best way to make money), i don't understand the methods they took in implementing the ways to get them. Properties can be bought in the map, i figured this out, but i REALLY wish the game told me, if it did, it wasn't too obvious. Still i figured it out, from fable 2 however, they added a new handicap, houses now deteriorate, as in they have \"health\" when health hits zero, tenants in owned buildings withhold rent. Well that's just dandy, so you have to repair all your houses, houses in \"need\" of repair are marked by a yellow key flag in your map, \"good\" houses in functional standing are marked with a blue key flag. The thing is, its tedious and a mechanic that's kind of annoying, i mean in a few game days these houses deteriorate to zero. I don't know about you, but I've never seen someone destroy a house regularly in like 4 days. Its unrealistic, tedious, boring,and really just makes making money from real estate harder than it needs to be, so just buy businesses instead. Speaking of businesses, for some reason, tenants of businesses do not require you to fix their properties, which is nice, but it doesn't make any sense, if you have to fix homes, why don't you have to repair your businesses? Maybe I'm nitpicking but this entire repair mechanic is just pointless.Tedium to win the way you want:The final quest is kind of ridiculous, it demands you have a lot of currency in your treasury, you'll need the amount the game requires plus the amount required to do anything else you need to to avoid being a lying jerk like your brother. But in reality, when you think about it, all of the options are there for you to do what you need to, without funding from your own pockets, the game will net you everything you need to hit the amount it needs for you to be protective, if cruel. But gives you the ability to sacrifice protection to give everyone what they want. But as a player and as a person, you have to think, is what they want best? Or is survival paramount? if you want both, then you MUST raise the dough for it yourself. As far as warning, i began saving the moment they said they needed money, i invested in properties and when i had enough, i dropped in in the treasury for my promises and the final quest. Though it took some time, it was easy, when the finality happened, i was glad i had saved the money up.Dog:I'm sure my dog is quite handicapped. He'll bark, run into walls, say treasure is there and fox point at nothing, do circles for a minute or two before finding a dig site and in general be useless. All the while making all kinds of noise. The Fable 2 dog worked really well, what happened?The Emotions:You can get more emotions in this game than in Fable 2, or at least i think so. But the interaction with people is heavily simplified and in my opinion completely broken. you can instigate conversation with any villager or shopkeeper with the A button, and then using Y, X, or A, emote. This can be dance, tickle, etc. Except you don't get a choice in the matter. Gone is the Emote-a Wheel, replaced by a simplistic Good, Bad or Neutral system. each with its own random emote that you know. Now that's all well and good i guess, except that if i really want to fart in a dude's face, i have to either not talk and go back in until i get the emote i want, or spam the Bad emote until i do. Removed a lot of fun, plus they took away the ability to mess up emotes. In fable 2, you could hold an emote and if you missed its sweet spot, you'd mess up comically, like pooping your pants. I thought it was funny when you'd go to stand like a hero and throw out your back. It was funny, and an actual reason to use the system. But as it is now, its kind of dumbed down and more useless than anything, which is a shame because i really like some of the emotes. Plus you met this guy 3 seconds ago and you can tickle him? Odd, wy would he let you do that?The Fabled \"Touch System\":Prime dislike for this title, it ended up being buggy, and weird. Why am I leading this 50 year old by the hand? Why am i leading a criminal by the hand and and him only fighting me for the last few steps? In addition, why did i bug out and be unable to move at even 10% of my normal speed making this quest really long because I was infused with snail DNA that only activates when i touch this guy? Who knows, i did not appreciate this mechanic at all. I liked it when it made sense, like on a date, but a hollow man filled cave with a librarian, a male librarian? Come on.All in all, Fable 3 is a really good game with a few shortcomings, those shortcomings are quite harsh however. It is likely you'll need to power through again after you get to the end armed with knowledge on how to beat the game the way you want to. But, like i said, the game does give you fair warning and the tools you need to get the job done.Fable is not the longest game, but to beat it with the ultimate good ending, it will take time to save enough money to buy your way out, with all of the properties to make money with you should be able to pull together a decent amount of money in 24 real time hours. I'd recommend a rent, but a purchase when its 30 dollars will net you your money's worth in my opinion, its shortcomings aren't worth $60.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2011"}

I did not expect UC3 to top UC2 but I did not expect a step back. I put about 8 days of time online and have the platinum trophy for UC2 so I feel I am qualified to offer a fair comparison of the two games.I have not yet completed UC3's campaign which in itself is a sign right there I'm at chapter 9. UC2's campaign I completed in acouple days and had no urge to play any other game. I have been playing this and Infamous 2's new DLC Festival of Blood and Gears of War 3, about the same amount of time since getting my UC3 delivery.It seems like through the first 5 levels or so they were still doing like tutorials of gameplay mechanics. The game is taking too long for the real story action set pieces to begin. Sort of surprising for the the 3rd game in a series.The beefed up melee is nice in theory but uses almost the exact same mechanics as the Batman Arkham games, but they are not as polished. A nice touch though are some context specific attacks like for example I pushed a guy up against a kitchen counter and Drake picked up the pot an bashed the guy on the head.The game seems slightly glitchy. My first game of co-op adventure I glitched throught the floor and had to quit. I also have gotten stuck on the ring spinning screen and, gotten stuck in a wall during single player. I never had any of this happen in part 2 even though I know some glitches in multiplayer could be exploited it never happened to me during regular play.I have about 8 hours total in multiplayer so far in UC3 and it has some nice modes and I like the customization of the characters which is awesome. The actual gameplay itself though does not seem as fun. The shooting seem slightly less accurate even after I tweeked the sensitivity settings. In co-op survival I miss the heavies that appear with the gatling gun they have been replaced with beefed up versions of the guys who grab you till they break your neck, and you have to shoot the helmet off and they still cannot be melee'd. The objective based games are much better and more balanced the switching objectives works very well, but the co-op survival has taken a step back.I dont want to be overly critical of the game cause it is still awesome and def a good purchase, also I just might need to go through an adjustment period but I am slightly disapointed so far. I will be updating this review once I complete the campaign.UPDATE: I completed the campaign acouple days ago and have played more multiplayer. I did not change my 4 star rating, and still feel the game is a slight step down from UC2. The campaign has some jaw dropping moments and is a good campaign but something felt off the pacing or the action but just didnt seem to flow as well as UC2 hard to explain and dont let that stop you from buying this game. Just a preference thing not a knock against this game.Multiplayer overall is a better package in UC3 there is improved matchmaking, and more modes. Team Objective is my favorite it consists of team games of king of the hill deathmatch and others which change mid match and team that get gets three victories in those modes wins the match and Co-Op adventure is awesome fun playing though short campaign snippets with two other players and which get very very very challenging on crushing difficulty.Co-Op Survival and Team deathmatch have taken a step back IMHO, Survival's enemies are not as fun to take down as they were in UC2. Team deathmatch now is kinda cheap with power plays which punish a winning team and give advantages to the losing team. I just play hardcore now which has no kick backs or power plays.Overall UC3 is a great game. Must buy if you own a PS3, but make sure you play UC2 as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

It has the best story out of any other game and surpasses any movie or t.v. show I've ever watched. The gameplay is also great. The first game was classic and revolutionized stealth action games. The second game improved on the graphics and the gameplay, while keeping the story as complex and addicting as ever, although it did kind of make it a little weirder too. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater changed some of the core gameplay by introducing the use of camouflage to hide in plain sight of your enemies in more open environments. I'll admit it, at first I hated this new form of stealth gameplay, but I eventually got used to it; unfortunately it takes a LONG time to get used to it. In this game you play as Solid Snake's predecessor Naked Snake, the man who will one day become known as Big Boss. During the Cold War, Snake has to sneak into the jungles of Russia to ensure that rebel soldiers are not allowed to use a deadly new weapon that could destroy the already delicate relationship between America and Russia, which would surely lead to an all-out war between the two countries. At this point, any Metal Gear fan would know that the true intentions of the enemies Snake faces, as well as the intentions of those he serves, will ultimately surface and complicate matters in ways that can only be done in a Hideo Kojima game: in short, expect a lot of revelations and plot twists that will have you hooked on this game. Like in the other games, some cutscenes tend to drag on, and since the story paces itself more slowly in this game, the dragging of the scenes is a bit more noticeable. The controls to this game are basically identical to those in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, so no surprises there for veterans. However, there are plenty of things that have changed, and not all necessarily for the better. When you aim with your weapon in third-person perspective you don't automatically lock on to your enemy; in first-person view you have to look down the sights of your weapon to get a good shot at your enemies, since most of your weapons aren't equipped with the same laser sights that were so popular in the first two games. This makes sense though, since this game takes place in the sixties. Another inherent loss to the gameplay due to the time period is access to an all-purpose gps radar that shows the positions and field of view of nearby enemies. You do have access to some old fashioned sonar and active radar, but both of these have their limits in usefulness, including limited battery life.Now let's get to the topic of camouflage. You have access to a wide variety of camo suits and face paint that each match with specific types of terrain, whether it be grass, dirt, snow, water, and concrete. Wearing the right combination of camouflage and face paint in the right terrain could make you next to invisible and allow you to surprise enemies as they pass right by you...assuming you're lying flat on the ground. In the first two games, moving quickly through corridors, hiding behind walls, and zipping by your enemies the second they looked away from you was the way to play it sneaky. However, this game severely punishes this form of stealth: any time you stand up or even crouch above the ground you're putting yourself in danger of being spotted by enemies who can now see you from clear across the map, even if you don't see them, which can easily happen since the camera remains in the classic top-down view of the previous games and doesn't give you a proper lay of the land unless you're using first-person perspective. But since you can't move from where you're standing in first-person view, you're still at great risk of being spotted if you decide to pop up from the ground to take a look around. The dated camera really has you at a distinct disadvantage in this game and could lead you to getting caught a lot, which is a pain since the amount of time it takes for your enemies to go from alert mode to the end of caution mode lasts for an insanely long two to three minutes. Also, enemies can now hear you if you're running within five feet of them, so you'll normally have to walk slowly to grab them from behind without them hearing you. Between trying to get past your enemies by crawling around everywhere to avoid being spotted and hiding for long periods of time should you actually get spotted, this game definitely has a much slower pace to it than I would have preferred. Thankfully the game's combat is still a lot of fun, especially the boss battles. One of the boss battles where you and an enemy sniper known as The End are stalking each other in a large, dense forest definitely stands as one of the game's most memorable and pulse-pounding moments. The game emphasizes use of a menu system where you can use bandages and ointments to treat bullet wounds, cuts, burns, etc., and you are required to hunt for wildlife (including snakes) and feed on your prey in order to keep up your stamina, since letting it get too low negatively affects Snake's combat performance. These new gameplay elements were a bit gimmicky, but are still fun and add some element of realism to the gameplay. The game's tight controls, incredible story, great graphics, and fitting music (including some awesome James Bond references) give this game high scores. The gameplay and camera had their noticeable flaws, but they're not serious enough to detract much from this game's awesomeness. Metal Gear fans would be foolish to miss out on this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A fun but un-memorable game...","reviewText":"Final Fantasy XIII looks amazing, handles smooth and attempts to bridge the gap between  total free form combat and turn based.The combat system the game decided to go with I actually enjoyed.  It blended strategy with real time, and let you come up with some rather creative methods to attack or defend against enemies.  However this game really doesn't stand up to the past juggernauts of Final Fantasy.The game is linear,  beyond linear in fact walk a straight line for 20 hours linear.  You get a sample of free-roam before the game goes back to being linear all over again until the end.  This is done on purpose though as it keeps the storyline flowing and allows you to experience all the beauty this game has to offer visually.  I wouldn't of had a problem with the linearity of the game, if when it did open up, the game became a total blast.  FFX for example was fairly linear but once you got the airship you could revisit areas to find secrets, find hidden dungeons, capture monsters, grind to take on that uber boss you unlocked etc.Problems I found with FF13 during the Linear storyline- Linear character progression.  Grind all you want.  After a certain point you simply won't be able to level up and I actually would max out my characters before even moving and now had to play 30+mins of grinding though the map and didn't gain a single level up.  You just \"store\" your CP until you somehow gain the ability to move another 10 steps on the grid.  I understand they wanted boss fights to be epic and make you have to use strategy instead of over leveling and 2 hitting the boss -- but still.  Just adjust CP values to make leveling past a certain point incredibly tedious don't just flat out shut the leveling down.  Imagine say , Final Fantasy 7  1/3 through a cave just goes \"sorry you gain XP but can't level up until you get to _____\"- Save points were more abundant than items it seemed.  Every other screen was a savepoint/healing spot.  It almost made things to easy.- You have to actually beat the game to experience 'non-linear' play if you even could call it non-linear.  After beating the game you will unlock the final Crystarium grid, and get to explore about 1/2 the world free form.  This would be fun if you still didn't have to \"walk\" to spots.  You'd warp in and then could spend 5-10mins just having to run where you have to go.. revisiting the same linear paths all over again just to touch some object. Then you get to run all the way back.- I gave up grinding.  It was horrible.  The CP grid becomes unbearable after a short while, especially once you go into the \"secondary\" classes of characters and some moves cost 60,000 - 100,000 CP .  Money was nearly impossible to come across unless you wow imagine that.. GRIND some more on the same mobs to get rare drops.  Want an Ultimate weapon,  enjoy gathering 2 million credits just to buy the synth item.  Now have fun spending 2 + mil again just to level it up.  This was the first Final Fantasy game ever that I was unable to get an ultimate weapon.  I maxed out the 2nd transformation at least but the 3rd required something like 4-5 million credits PER weapon to create/level- The only reward for actually doing all the optional stuff after you beat the game was well.. unlock achievements/trophies and eventually work your way to 3 hard extra bosses.  I did this often in other FF games yet, it just seemed FF13 gave you no reason to actually progress; there was no sense of accomplishment that the previous Final Fantasy games had.  I'm not the only one to feel this as most of my friends just beat the game and put it down (we're all big FF fans and often strive for 100% completion) , some didn't even beat the game and just returned it** Now I am not saying this is a bad game.  There is just a lot of things this game did \"wrong\" in my opinion.  The storyline was great and the game puts you on an amazing ride.  Perhaps the best ride since Final Fantasy 6 when it comes to storyline.  The \"pros\" this game brings, such as creativity, graphics, storyline, character development, voice acting etc  tend to be balanced out by the \"cons\" of  linearity, no real reward for actually grinding or doing extra content, terrible item/leveling system, and virtually no reason to ever pick the game up again.  Because of this I have to really dock the game.If this was a new series, a brand new RPG that came out of no where.. It would be amazing, ground breaking, perhaps a future final fantasy killer.  However this isn't. This is Final Fantasy, a genre that has honestly lost itself in past renditions.  With each game the storyline gets better, but the gameplay starts to suffer and re-playability goes down and they begin to reuse ideas that didn't fly to well to begin with  (end game optional content feels almost like I'm playing FF12 again with having to go all over the world finding 'monsters' to fight but instead of calling them HUNTS you do it to free trapped souls 0_o )You expect more from Final Fantasy.  I've said it to my friends time and time again.  Square-Enix needs to dump the \"final fantasy\" name.  Keep the Final Fantasy formula but start making stand alone games.  Stop calling things Final Fantasy it isn't working anymore and just makes people expect more and more.  Or perhaps take more of a MGS4 approach and turn it into more of a cinematic story with limited interaction where you control the progression/advancement of the character.**Overall: Final Fantasy 13, if you are into RPG's and especially JRPG storylines  this game will not disappoint in the graphics, voice and storyline category.  Even the battle system is actually a lot of fun to use.  The overall picture however is cloudy and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth when the credits begin to roll with sort of a \"that's it?\" feel.68% (2 stars) is my overall rating for the game.  It only gets 3 stars for fun because honestly... At first the game is fun to play, creative and unique -- as the game drags on it becomes less fun to play due to just how incredibly linear it is, and once you beat the game there is virtually no reason to even touch it again unless you want trophies/achievements.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"Hardware is Not the Vita's Problem","reviewText":"Pros:Excellent gaming engine with the graphical capability to play pretty advanced gamesHigh-quality OLED touchscreenDual analog sticksEasy PSN functionality and download supportBackwards compatible with PSP and PS1 gamesRegion free gamesCons:Lack of good gamesNo internal memory and expensive proprietary memory cardsPortability issuesBackwards compatibility only applies on digital games purchased through the PSNThe PS Vita is an excellent system marred by only a few design flaws. The best part of the hardware for me is the dual analog sticks. These are a major bonus since fpss basically require them nowadays. Not only are there two of them, they are also of excellent quality. One of the things I always disliked about the PSP was the analog stick that was flat to the surface and rather difficult to use. The 3DS has copied this design, although they made it more ergonomically comfortable. The Vita however, has two that stick out from the system, just like on the PS3 remote, allowing much greater control and ease of movement. There are sensitivity issues since the sticks are smaller than their PS3 equivalents, but once you adapt to it the controls are almost as easy to use.The second best thing about the Vita is the OLED touchscreen. This touchscreen is absolutely beautiful and has excellent resolution. I thought the touchscreen aspect was just a gimmick, but some of the games have made excellent use of it allowing them to compensate for not having back bumpers (L2/R2 buttons). Well, technically they do have those in the rear touchpad, but it is so touchy and difficult to use that it might as well not exist. The big plus of this touchscreen is that it is much more sensitive and reliable than the 3DS's. You can type with fair accuracy using only your finger, and responses on one section of the screen rarely result in unexpected reactions from another. It does tend to make the screen oily, but that's the price you pay for all touchscreens.The graphics on the system are amazing, although all that talk of them being almost as good as the PS3 is garbage. They fit comfortably between the PS2 and PS3 level of graphics, with the result probably being a bit closer to the Wii than the PS3. With the smaller screen it is easier to hide bad texture maps and glitches. That doesn't take anything away from the system. On the small screen those graphics look amazing. I'm not sure where these graphics fit when compared to the 3DS, but they are definitely an improvement. It's hard to think of any 3DS games with high graphical requirements since they tend to aim for cartoony and exaggerated worlds, but I can't remember any that even come close to pulling off Uncharted: Golden Abyss. At a guess, I'd say that the 3DS reproduces approximately the same graphics as a PS2 (as can be seen by their virtually unchanged ports of PS2 games) while the Vita is a bit higher (as seen by their improved ports of PS2 games). The difference is more one of style than capability, with Sony focusing on realistic games that show off their graphics engine while Nintendo does what they usually do and try to create fun, cartoony games. The graphics leap between the 3DS and the Vita just isn't that high. Certainly not enough to recommend getting a Vita on that score alone. The biggest advantage they have graphically is that their screen is just better quality, and doesn't waste energy on 3D that nobody uses.I've heard some complaints about battery life but I don't know what all the fuss is about. My Vita plays for about five hours without recharging, which is a good hour or two longer than my 3DS does. I appreciate that the older systems lasted longer but that was because they had less graphics-intensive games. You can still play those games so it isn't a problem. A DS game on the 3DS can last all day, and playing a PSP game on the Vita is likewise. The Vita also has an excellent sleep mode. I found that the system drains far less quickly when asleep than the 3DS does. Besides, it was really only the DS generation of games that worked like that. Previous systems often had terrible battery life (see the two-hour long Game Gear).The layout of the Vita is basically that of a Playstation controller with a big screen in the middle. The two analog sticks are in the proper places and are reasonably sensitive. The PS button has been moved to the left corner and glows when the game is on. The start and select buttons have become a bit crummy since you have to push at quite a difficult angle to get them to go down. The two bumper bars are very responsive, and look quite stylish. The rear touchpad is useless. Comfort-wise the system is very nice, fitting neatly into your hand with some nice pads at the back to support your grip. The system is somewhat heavy, but that's never been a problem for me. The game does suffer dramatically in portability when compared to its competition. Not only is it larger than the 3DS-XL (or the PSP for that matter), it is also bumpier and less protected. With no DS clamshell front to protect it the Vita's screen is dangerously exposed to sharp knocks. I can also assure you that the two analog sticks, despite making gameplay amazing, mean that the Vita will never comfortably fit into anyone's pocket. There are cases for it that will alleviate the protection issue, but the best that you can do is carry it in your jacket. And for some people that just isn't enough. It all depends how you use it.Software-wise the Vita comes preinstalled with some basic programs of varied utility. The main screen is an ugly series of icons accessed by the touchscreen. Sony is trying to make their system into a phone and I don't understand why. Still, it functions well enough. The browser still sucks and the maps app isn't particularly helpful. Due to the presence of a touchscreen the messages app has become functional. The PSN is extremely useful. In terms of new software the main addition is Near. It's trying to do what Streetpass does, but it does it badly. All you can do with it is see what people in your city are playing. It needs wifi to function, is particularly unintuitive, and doesn't seem to actually provide any shared gaming experience. No, it doesn't continue to sync with other devices when you put it on sleep mode. That'd just be silly. It isn't like the 3DS which communicates with other consoles via wifi.Hardware-wise the only major problem is the proprietary memory cards, which are so obviously money-grabbing as to be insulting. Especially given the Vita's emphasis on downloadable content this is just a kick in the teeth for gamers. After all, some of their games aren't even available in physical copies. And if you want to download any PS1 or PSP games (which look amazing on the new screen btw) then you're equally screwed. Worst of all, since there is no internal memory you need to buy one of these cards to play any game, whether or not you intend to download games. And a good card can cost half as much as the system itself. It's disgraceful.To be perfectly honest, even this isn't enough to prevent people from buying the system. What might serve as more of a deterrent is the games catalog. The Vita has been out for two years but is still suffering from a lack of truly great games. The best new games to come out thus far areUncharted: Golden AbyssandAssassin's Creed III: Liberation. They also gave Persona 4 an awesome port calledPersona 4: Golden. All of these games came out in the first year, when enthusiasm for the new system was still fresh. There has been little since. The 3DS was suffering from this too until fairly recently, with the most popular games being ports from older systems likeThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Tales of the Abyss, andStar Fox 64. Now the 3DS is picking up steam withFire Emblem: Awakening,Pok&eacute;mon X and Y,The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, andShin Megami Tensei IV, but the Vita seems stalled.One of the major pluses of the system though is its easy access to the PSN. A gigantic library of PS1 and PSP games are available for download. Yes, these were available before, but only for the PSP. Now you can access them on the Vita's high def screen and use dual analog sticks for control. This can be really helpful even on PSP games that have replaced the right analog stick with the top bumpers. There are also demos and free content that adds greatly to the experience. Much better than Nintendo's eShop. Or maybe that's just the opinion of someone used to the PSN. Like the PS3 games are region-free, though DLC is region locked. You can also have only one account connected to your Vita which means no more copying games from different accounts. You have to reformat the card every time you change.To sum up: I really like the Vita. On a strictly hardware level the Vita is clearly superior to its closest competitor (the 3DS), even if that system has advantages when it comes to portability and convenience. Its biggest problem is the lack of good games, and that's hardly the fault of the hardware. Like the 3DS it's had a slow start, but hopefully it will pick up now that the price has gone down and a new and cheaper model has been released. PS4 functionality should also help them. If you're willing to bet on future successes then this system is well worth it and the backlog of PS1/PSP games should keep you occupied for quite a while. If you're waiting for that one brilliant game that makes the system worth buying... it hasn't come yet. But hopefully it will soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

Including the design which I was not sure I was going to like at first because I did like the look of the PS3 but when it comes down to the inside of it the UI of the PS4 has tons of improvements over the PS3 or Xbox ( really live tiles ? I dont like windows 8 so why would I want it on my tv ?) the PS4 is fluid and functional while looking great also. Downloads are so much  faster on the PS4 I dreaded downloading a game on the PS3 or xbox 360 because it was just slow, but that has all changed I can download a complete game in minutes on the PS4.Matter of fact just to put it to the test I downloaded and installed 6 full games at the same time within 15 minutes, Try that on your PS3 or Xbox Bone !One of my all time favorite things about the Playstation is that I can still use Netflix or Hulu without a subscription even a lot of the RPG games do not require a sub to the online Playstation+ though not all of them are like that. the point is Sony gives you options unlike Microsoft who flat out aims to dime you to death with micro purchases and subscription fee's !I opted for Playstation + simply because its $50 bucks a year and within the first week I got 2 games for free that cost $60 bucks each alone. so I have already got my money's worth !The controller is a great improvement it feels great in your hand, not bulky and it is simple to use during game play. I am glad I decided to go with sony. I don't need a power sucking vampire spy machine like Xbox one in my house because in all reality it is about the game and streaming and not cable tv in my house. plus who needs gimmicks, like yelling at your tv over kids or commercials on TV while paying for a over priced machine !Fact is Sony has proven it is about the customer and not the bottom line, I can support that and I do !Edit: 3/12/14I turned on the PS4 a couple days ago and nothing would show up on the TV I freaked out I called up sony and they told me that some cheaper HDMI cords have been causing issues and I should change the HDMI cord to test it out before sending it in.I pulled another one off my Blu-Ray Player and connected it then restarted the PS4 and guess what ? It worked !The HDMI cord I was using was one I picked up here off Amazon for about $6 now I like a lot of people buy cheaper HDMI cords because who really wants to spend $50-$100 bucks for one ? but in this case it might be something to think about.....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004QEWVLC","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"An interesting experience","reviewText":"I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to review this game. Let me begin, by saying that I had never played the saints row games before. However, I saw some screenshots for Saints Row: The Third, and really wanted to check it out! Being the completionist that I am, I didn&#8217;t want to play the third, until I had completed the first 2.I picked up all three games, and sat down for a huge Saints Row gaming marathon. The first one, I was quite impressed with, despite it being an xbox360 exclusive(I am not a huge fan of Xbox 360 anymore) It reminded me a little of San Andreas, except with better controls. The plot was good, it was long, and fulfilling, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected, in fact: I loved it!Now, onto Saints Row 2, I played this one on the PS3, since as I said before, I am no longer a huge fan of Xbox360. The game looked a million times better than the original, the amount of customization was incredible, and while slightly over the top and ridiculous, it was still a good play! It retained the whole urban street gang aspect that I loved in the first one, and the over the topness was kind of cool in some respects, I finished it, quite pleased with it, and moved onto the Third!The graphics in this one was so much better than the second that it blew me away! The customisation was vastly improved as well, at least in terms of character creation. True, the game lacked any good hairstyles, but other than that? Aces! In fact, I spent a good 40 mins just creating my character!Once you get in the game, though you see right away how different the game is. It doesn&#8217;t FEEL like the past 2 chapters. It&#8217;s moved away from urban street gangs, and seems more like organised crime. As such, most of the clothes are flashy and suit like. In fact, your homies wear silk suits, and shaundi looks more like a model instead of the stoner she was in the second.The game basically leaves the street gang behind, but keeps the slightly over the top feeling of the second and takes it to a whole new level! The game has absolutely NO shred of realism to it, in fact at one point you battle zombies! True, Zombies were present in the first and second game, but they weren&#8217;t major plot points, and unless you did certain things to bring dead people to life, you never even knew about it!So, like I began this post saying, I am not exactly sure how to review this game. If I view the game as a sequel, it&#8217;s bad! It tears too far away from past games, it loses what little realism existed in the game, and turns the whole franchise into a joke.However, if I review it on its own merits, and force myself to forget that it&#8217;s part of the Saints Row franchise, then it&#8217;s actually quite good! The over the topness is fun, and makes it difficult to know what&#8217;s going to happen next!Basically, if you are expecting something similar to the previous games, then don&#8217;t bother with Saints Row: The Third. If you just want to have fun, doing some insane crazy stuff, then this is the game for you!Interestingly enough, this is the first game that I would give an overall rating of both 1 Star(Poor) and 5 stars(Best) to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

I'm rather disapointed with this game. At first this felt like a good game, but after playing it through, I've decided it's really rather mediocre and inferior to its predecessors.Graphics (9/10): Excellent.  The graphics are pleasing to the eye. The only negative in this department is that while the graphics are good, some of the landscapes were dull and boring.  Imagine slogging through a desert wasteland full of dirt and sparse plants for a good long while. While there were some really interesting places to look at(like the Forest where Viera live), other places were very large and boring. One of the most interesting places was outside Giruvegan (the reflective fog effect was awesome).Music (7/10): Well, the music wasn't so bad that it made my ears bleed, but neither can I remember any of the tunes.  I'm not sure exactly what this implies for the music rating; probably that the music is rather mediocre.  Not really bad, not really outstanding either.  Voice acting was good also, with the exception of a certain female lead who sighs alot in an irritating manner.Characters (5/10): Yawn.  Just the sheer boringness of these characters is mind-numbing.  Vaan might as well have not even been there.  Was he even the main character of this game?  It's just so hard to tell.  He plays no major roles in the story really, other than to narrate.  Penelo serves no purpose either.  I find Ashe to be very unlikeable, which is too bad because the main story focuses on her a great deal.  She sighs and wines alot, and I found it difficult to feel bad for her or want to help her regain her kingdom.  Her personality just wasn't really endearing in any way.  Basch is okay, but not really well developed.  Fran has very little dialogue and little personality too.  Balthier is really this game's saving grace.  He is witty and humorous.  If only the backstory between him and Fran had been explored at all.  I kept waiting for interesting character development and backstories on these people, but it never really happened to the degree that was needed to make these people interesting.Story (7/10): The story is rather lackluster.  At times, it felt like a giant fetch-quest.  My biggest complaint is the introduction of an extremely interesting plot twist involving some glowy spirit/god things that never went anywhere.  I kept expecting more to happen involving these.  But no, the game just ends without resolving much about them.  I was so shocked when the game ended just like that.  I kept thinking to myself \"shouldn't there be more here?\"Battle System (8/10): Unlike other reviewers, I didn't hate the battle system.  I prefer the regular turn-based games more, but I adapted to the AI controlled team members. Basically, you control your characters with gambits, which are simple if-then type statements.  For example, you could set up a \"hp&lt;70%, then cast cure\" gambit, which makes the team member it's set on cast cure on anyone who's hp is below 70% of their total.  So, it's pretty intuitive.  The battle system is kind of fun, but also a bit hands-off, which made me a little sleepy after awhile.  Overall, though, it was enjoyable.****Gameplay (8/10): The controls were not bad, the menu system wasn't to annoying.  The only thing that keeps this from a perfect score was the fact that being chased down through extremely large environments by a pack of wolves while trying to desperately escape was not too fun. I'm not against having no random battles, it just would've been nice if they'd given you a better escape option.  Maybe a \"run\" command that'd keep the enemies off your back for a little while... Another item to add under gameplay is the number of sidquests and minigames-which is excellent.  I only wish there were more sidequests that didn't involve battling enemies.  It gets tedious after awhile.  Something nice like the Chocobo Hot & Cold game from FF9 or the card game of FF8 would've been nice here.Overall (7/10): Note, this is not an average, it is my subjective score of this game.  Overall, this isn't a terrible game, it's just not the best either.  I would easily recommend FF7, FF8, FF9, and FF10 over this game, as each of those is definitely better.  However, if you've already played those and are looking for something new you could buy this game. It IS worth owning, but if you're fast at completing RPG's, you may want to rent this one instead.****The battle section has been edited from it's previous state, since a commenter pointed out how harsh and unfair it was.  I think the new battle section score is more fair now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2008"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Back in its day, a great game","reviewText":"I came very late to the Halo experience, mostly because I didn't have the capabilities of investing in Xbox live.  My TV and Xbox is upstairs, my cable is downstairs, and plugging the Xbox into the cable box downstairs would require me to drill holes in the floor, yadda, yadda.Well, along came wireless networks.  I finally decided to convert my computer, Tivo, and Xbox to wireless, thereby skipping the awkward problem of cables between floors.  My wife surprised me the Halo collection one day (I love my wife), and just like that I was playing Halo 2 online.  But this review is about the campaign, which I just finished yesterday.Halo follows the story of Master Chief (Steve Downes), a cyborg awakened for the sole purpose of kicking alien butt.  He is ordered around by Captain Jacob Keyes (Pete Stacker) and the sassy artificial intelligence hologram, Cortana (Jen Taylor). We never get to see what Master Chief looks like, because he always wears a helmet.  This makes him alternately customizable (that could be YOU under that helmet!) and strangely impersonal.Master Chief is part of an ongoing war against the aliens known as The Covenant.  Who exactly they've made a covenant with is uncertain. These aliens range from squat comical Grunts to the dog-like Jackals, from the predatory Elites to the behemoth Hunters.  The Covenant ambushes Master Chief's ship, the Pillar of Autumn, and it ultimately crash lands on the ancient ring world known as Halo.  But that ring is there for more than decoration, and both the Covenant and the human forces are in for a nasty surprise.Halo has it all, from a veritable geekgasm of detailed human weapons torn right from the Aliens Space Marine playbook, to ground and air vehicles that can inflict even more destruction.  Marines shout orders and follow Master Chief's lead, just like Starship Troopers.  To paraphrase Hell Comes to Frogtown, everyone is there to kick alien posterior and chew bubblegum...and they're all out of bubblegum.Halo is drenched with testosterone, a product so perfectly targeted to adolescent boys that I actually created Master Chief as a comic book (that I published, incidentally) long before the Xbox even existed.  That's right, Brenkin Kree wore a featureless helmet, carried a rocket launcher on his shoulder, and had a wristwatch computer named Babe who bossed him around.  Just like Master Chief, he was bred specifically for war.Did Halo rip me off? As much as my ego would like to think otherwise, I sincerely doubt it.  Halo is merely the distilled perfection of every boy's dream; the biggest badass in town, thrust into an Aliens flick and armed with all the military might of the future.In retrospect, Halo is surprisingly mundane.  Mostly, Cortana comes up with new missions and tells Master Chief what to do.  There's very few twists, but plenty of old standbys: kill this target, rescue this person, flip a switch and kill lots of aliens while doing it.  The vehicle missions tweak this paradigm a bit, but not by much.  Mostly, I survived by having Master Chief smash his vehicle into the bad guys, jump out, and run for his life while spraying the countryside with hellfire.  Shake well and repeat.The character scripts are well done, but good scripts are now standard fare for most first-person shooters.  We expect the marines to act intelligently, the bad guys to act even more intelligently, and the drones to act like morons.  As my wife is fond of pointing out, the Grunts are funny and stupid-looking so it makes it okay to kill them.The voice acting is passable.  Taylor's voice acting in particular is uneven; she ranges from sedately reading her lines to infusing them with far too much enthusiasm, sometimes in the same breath.  Since she's critical to the plot, this is a major flaw in the game.  Because her commentary is only loosely tied to what's actually going on in the game, I often had difficulty understanding what she wanted me to do.  Sorry, Cortana, did you say \"that's an awfully big pit, don't fall in it\" or \"that's an awfully big pit, JUMP in it\"? This led to several frustrating moments where I didn't know what the hell was going on and just ran around until either Cortana flat out told me or I figured it out myself.There's a few things that make Halo different.  For one, Master Chief has a personal shield that regenerates quickly over time.  This means that, barring a series of sudden attacks, Master Chief will always survive (this is a difficult adjustment for someone new to the multi-player...there's no slow sniping, it's either one-shot one-kill or nothing). Master Chief can apparently leap tall buildings in a single bound, but the jumping mechanism isn't particularly precise...which can be deadly in the wrong situation.  Finally, the same mechanics that give air vehicles a weightless feeling also applies to ground vehicles, making them maneuver more like gliding hovercraft than actually 3.25 ton road hogs.Compared to today's standards, Halo's merely a good game.  But back when it first debuted, it was a great game. I enjoyed experiencing a bit of gaming history.  We'll see how Halo 2's campaign stacks up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2006"}

Abraham \"Abe\"","summary":"A Game That Must Be Purchased With The PS3","reviewText":"This is one for the record books my friends. I have had my PS3 for some time now and a friend of mine recommended that I get Uncharted. Now at first I was skeptic becuase I don't like to play certain games that have you run around for a long time. Now after talking with my friend about it for a while I caved and thought what the heck let's give it a shot. Well after purchasing this game and after popping it into the PS3 let me tell you I did not put the game down until I had to go to work. This game grabs you by the head and holds you in place as the game takes you through numerous twists and turns to uncover treasures. Now all and all this game is a must have for any user of the PS3 if you don't have it I strongly suggest you save up for it becasue your collection will be lost without it. This is a game for the ages.Graphics...The graphics in this game simply blow my mind. I mean when you sit back and watch some of these cut scense or regualr gameplay for that matter you can actually make yourself believe you are watching a movie. All the characters have there own look and they look fantastic. This is a game that can double as a movie. The only little thing that I have a problem with is that all the enemies have three diffrent looks to them with the exception of the bosses but that's not a huge problem to me. I give the graphics a 5/5Gameplay...The gameplay is very fast and easy to pick up. Once you have learned all the moves it becomes quicker to do certain objectives like punching and shooting and things like that. The climbibg is an awesome feature that is made very smotthly and there is little to no hesitation with this feature. I give the gameplay 5/5Sound/Audio...I believe this is one of the best game in this department.The music that is played throughout the game and the character dialoge is ingenious. I mean the way that Drake talkes is fantastic how they make it like a regualr everyday guy with his dialoug. The heroic music thoughtout the game adds to the fun and mkaes you feel like you are watching a Good Guy Bad Guy movie. I give this feature 5/5Final Thought...I can't stress it enough that if you don't have this game order it now becuase with such a low price you just can't beat it. It is fun for hours and it delivers something that gamers have been yearning for for a long time. With the gameplay and graphics and sound and everything working as one you can trick someone into thinking you are watching a movie. I know everything sounds so repetitive but I am trying to drive home the point that this game is one in a million and it something every gamer should own. Face the facts if you don't own it you don't call yourself a gamer. My final thought it this game is fantastic has everything you expect out of a great game and is a game you can play for hours and hours just to play it. My final Rateing for this game is a 4.8/5Enjoy this game, I sure did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

The pacing was perfect.  Following another reviewer's comments, I started out playing it on \"hard\".  Yes, I kept getting killed and doubting my decision until I realized, ya gotta use the flashlight to completely remove the darkness from the Taken BEFORE you start shooting them.  lol  Seriously, for the first few \"attacks\", i kept running out of bullets.  Too funny.  There is a section at the very beginning of the game where they instruct you to \"first remove the darkness with your light before trying to kill the Taken\", but I was in the kitchen grabbing a drink when that part played.  Anyhow, use the light properly and starting on hard is no problem for a seasoned gamer.  Also, it doesn't hurt to read the manuscripts as you collect them for little tid bits of how to handle certain situations.I loved this game through and through.  The rock stage part was my favorite.  The soundtrack of the entire game is awesome.  The storyline is intriguing and I'm still not sure what happened.  lol  But I loved it!  A very different kind of game that I hope to see more of.Another bit of advice, don't be afraid to use up your ammo, flares or whatever when you think you really need it because ammo supplies are always there when you really need them.

The landscape of True Crime, set in Los Angeles, is a full 250 square miles. That's 10 times bigger than Vice City!Unlike the GTA series, this time you're on the side of the good guys. You are Nick Kang, an Asian-American who is part of an elite cop unit. You're a rough and tumble police officer who can easily shoot, fight or drive his way out of any situation.The 'fake' maps of the GTA series and the 'real' map of London in the Getaway were mere training grounds for the HUGE map of Los Angeles and all its suburbs. Drive from Santa Monica into Hollywood, grabbing up to 50 different types of cars along the way. You're not carjacking them - you're commandeering them for police activities.You have a good/bad rating and are penalized if you take out too many innocents in your quest to get the bad guys. You can find training centers to improve your skills, and take on a variety of missions. I liked this game MUCH more than the Getaway in that sense - instead of being stuck on missions in a single thread, you have much more freedom of exploring the city and deciding what to do next.The navigation is also great. The streets actually have SIGNS on them - what a concept! You also are told on-screen where you are both in suburb, a mini-map and a street sign indicator. It always drove me crazy in The Getaway that a guy who LIVES in this town wouldn't even know where he was. True Crime handles that issue quite nicely.The graphics on the XBox are extremely impressive. Car windows reflect light and can be shattered. When you run into a sign, it crumples. There are tattoo shops and fancy botiques along the streets. And even on the massive scale they cover, the trees have branches and the Japanese sports cars have legible kanji on the back.I didn't like the default set of music - I was much more impressed with the GTA3/Vice City radio station selection which was just AMAZINGLY fun. But on the up side, the XBox lets you load your hard drive full of music and play it randomly. Build your own radio stations and enjoy them!There are a good selection of sub-missions from hand-to-hand fighting, to shoot-outs, to car chases, to secret tails, to stealth infiltration and much more. There are slow-mo bullet time attacks, a fun sense of humor and destructable objects in your environments. On the down side, the game does get a little ... bizarre ... near the end, but I'll let you find that twist out for yourself.Highly recommended for any GTAVC/Getaway fan!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2003"}

Mercenaries 2 appears on both of those lists.I went out of my way to get Mercenaries 2 for the same reason 9 out of 10 people did... the freaking commercial! Right? Come on, pretend that song wasn't in your head for days.  Pretend you didn't love it!  Oh, and Mercenaries 1 was groundbreaking and inovative and brilliant.  But mostly it was that SONG!!!Mercenaries 1 kicked all sorts of ass: even and heavy tone, awesome vehicles and vehicle control, a wide open map, edgy story-line (you can literally kill North Korean soldiers with no reprecusions.  Infact, it's encouraged; you get a bounty on their vehicles.  Edgy stuff, man).  All I wanted was more of the same.  And what did you give me, Pandemic, huh?  What did you give me?!Nonsense, fluff story line (you're not murder for hire any-more, now it's revenge!  Now it's PERSONAL!), broken gameplay (pop-in is so flawed it makes sniping absolutely useless: if you can see them, they can see you, and there's a LOT more of them than you) and the constant, inane, repetitive chatter by EVERY CHARACTER!  What happened to the stark, drab, engaging and intimidating bombed out Korean DMZ?  Now i'm in a damn Sandal's resort!  But you know what did it?  You know what finally made me grab my keys, my receipt and truck on down to GameTown to give it back and demand the money be transfered to a reserve of Fable 2 instead?  I'm talking with the pirates in the game (modern pirates!  Awesome! Edgy!) but, before I can work with them I have to... what?  Eliminate their enemies?  Steal oil or drugs?  Car bomb some dignitaries?  No, no, none of that, i just have to...Beat them in a boat race.A BOAT RACE!?  Are you kidding me?  Why?  Why are we racing boats with each other?  What's next, dance off?  Rap battle?  What? Why bother?How about \"help me and I'll pay you\", \"help me and I'll get rid of your enemies\", \"help me or I'll level your outpost with ordinance from SPACE!\"?  How about litterally ANYTHING else?  In one quest I've gone from lawless warmonger to Sonic the freaking Hedgehog.  It was like they were buying rejected GTA San Andreas quests from Rockstar to meet a deadline on a game they forgot they were making.  Unreal, man, unreal.But... it's not like there's no fun to be had here.  There's some good ol'fashioned run'n'gun.  And if the only think you liked about the 1st Mercenaries was blowing stuff up (and that is a COMPLETELY valid reason to like that game:  who spent half-an-hour placing luxury cars on a bridge before carpet bombing the whole structure just because it was awesome?  This guy, that's who...) then you may get a good time out of the sequel.  Things explode pretty well, bad guys shoot at you with many different types of weapons.  Did I mention ordinance from SPACE?!That said, if you liked the 1st Mercenaries for any other reason, any other reason at all (tone, characters, gameplay, etc.) you're only going to be dissapointed here.Oh no they didn't... except, yeah, they did.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}

But Odin Sphere is kind of special.  It's been the object of a media campaign, and a number of excited commercial reviews.  So I think I'm doing a public service to alert potential buyers that this is one of the most over-rated games I've ever played.  In plain language, it's not worth the money, even if it was free.Those of us who have played Valkyrie Profile (1 or 2) will recognize that the ploy is borrowed.  This is the story of the end of the world as told in the old Norse legends.  Well, not quite as they were told.  More like what would happen if you put some scraps of Norse legend, a dash of bible, and some other random tidbits in a blender.  Think twisted fairytales without the glitter.  But the problem isn't really the story line.  I've enjoyed many games where the narrative was even more mindless.  The problem is that the gameplay is horrendous.There are five primary characters in the game, each playing under some form of curse.  All with abusive parents, and dysfunctional enough to fill a library of self-help books.  You get to play each one, one at a time, through the same exact settings with slightly different scenarios.  There is a story section that shows how these paths interrelate, But from the player's viewpoint what you get is an unending supply of sameness.  Add in a fairly simple minded set of attacks, stiff animation and balky controls and you have a pretty clear idea of the experience.  In battle you also are likely to get hit with something out of the blue, so add arbitrary outcomes to the list.Money is hard to find and desperately needed, since you level up by overeating.  If you ever want to be more than a complete wimp you will find yourself gathering seeds, planting them, and feeding them by killing opponents.  And you get to do this for five separate characters.  All to the sound of a minimal music track and a slew of rude noises.  Your greatest pleasure may turn out to be those accidentally humorous scenes where a character defeats a monster by repeatedly stabbing it in the crotch.Atlus usually does a better job than this.  I find it hard to believe some of the ratings I've seen in some of the gaming magazines.  Curiously, fan boards are much more negative, noting the pretty graphics and the poor gameplay.

One thing I've noticed over those 2 and a half decades of console gaming is that almost always the best games for all of the systems come out at the end of the systems' life cycle. Look at the games the SNES had in its last year of life. Chrono Trigger anyone? And other games like Donkey Kong Country were displaying graphics that seemed inpossible for the SNES. I also remember playing a Batman game on the NES (forget the title)that came out as the NES was dying, it too had graphics that seemed impossible for the NES. One big reason this is is that by the time a system is about to be taken off the market, developers have had a lot of time to get to know the system's hardware and know all the ins and outs when developing games for it. Games have gotten more involved as years have passed, especially RPG's, so now the games that come out at the end of the newer system's life not only have the best graphics seen yet on the system, the developes have also had years to flesh out the story, combat and item systems. You'll understand this when you play the awesome Odin Sphere.At its core, the game is an action/adventure RPG. You wander through areas going left to right and attack enemies in real time. It's a bit like the first Valkyrie Profile that came out for the PS1, but way more fine tuned. When enemies are defeated, they release spirits called Phozons that you can magically absorb into your weapon making it more powerful. All areas are set up in \"Stages\". When you get tot he end of a stage, Odin will drop a treasure chest from the heavens you can open to collect rewards. The cool thing here is, the faster you complete a stage, the better items the treasure chest will have. Also, the less damage you take within that stage will also grant you better items.Speaking of items, you can get them in a variety of ways. There are vendors scattered throughout castles and battlefields, and you can also grow them. You find seeds all over the place, as well as sheep seeds and more. What you do is plant the seeds near some enemies, and defeat the enemies. Instead of absorbing into your weapong, the phozons will absorb into the seeds making a plant grow that will have various items hanging off of them depending on what seed you planted. It's a very unique concept. You can also cook in the game, and there's a fairly easy alchemy system you can use.The story is all about Norse mythology, and the graphics that are hand painted reflect that. You have the option to play the game with English voiceovers or in the original Japanese with English subtitles. I selected the English option, and the voice acting is actually pretty good.If you're a fan of RPG's at all, especially if you're looking for something that's different from anything else out there right now, Odin Sphere should be a game you should pick up as soon as you can. The game seems very involved, and it is, but the game also lets you select from three different difficulty levels at any time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2007"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

{"product_name":"B0001NJHH8","description":"Combining the best parts of role playing games and first-person action games, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines plunges players into the dark and gritty vampire underworld of modern day L.A. as a recently embraced fledgling vampire in the service of the city's dark Prince.","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"Excellent game with a few rough edges","reviewText":"Hey, this has got to be one of the best RPG's (maybe the best) to come out recently.  Excellent atmosphere and well conceived characters -- especially your vampire avatar (you're given everything you need to build a unique, interesting and powerful character).  The NPC's and exteriors of various sections of LA are beautifully done.  And what could be hotter than to have your own human female \"blood doll\" living in your \"haven\", ready to give money, gifts and her blood anytime you need it (this is the closest thing to sex I've seen in a video game -- humans go into a state of ecstasy when vampires take their blood).  You can also pick up girls at nightclubs (or prostitutes on the street) and do the same thing.  And if your \"seduction\" feat is high enough you can have an incredibly erotic friendship (hot dialog, valuable photo+poster, email poems and love letters) with a beautiful stripper/kindred (Velvet \"VV\" Velour) in Hollywood.The combat is great (and realistic -- you've got to learn how to shoot a gun with some XP's, lessons from NPC's or even reading books before you can really hit anything -- just like in \"real life\").  Same thing with melee combat -- you need to build up some strength, moves and skill (and acquire decent weapons) to do much damage. And then, above all, there are your vampiric \"powers\" or disciplines (different for each clan or \"bloodline\").  I chose to be a member of the Tremere clan.  My Thaumaturgy (\"blood magic\") discipline is a force to behold.  I especially like the way XP's are used in Bloodlines.  You don't \"level up\"; rather, you use your earned XP's to increase individual skills of your choosing.  I think this allows for much greater character customization than the D&D; type RPG's.The quests are usually very involving/interesting -- with some very challenging boss fights against quite unique characters.  Bloodlines is a very good game, and, with this in mind, it's truly a shame that a better developer or, perhaps more talented programmers didn't handle it.  There are some annoying bugs and some parts simply have a rough, unfinished quality to them.  (A minor example: There's an important scene in Santa Monica where two wacked out Malkavian \"sisters\" in the same body -- a split personality --  argue about killing each other, but the sound keeps stuttering.  Very annoying -- especially when your handling this unusual situation just right gives you the most XP's).  Other times people arbitrarily wink out and wink back in during cut scenes (or there are other distracting problems).  No excuse for this.The game has generally run quite well on my computer with no crashes or serious problems.  This is largely due to an official patch (Version 1.2) which seems to fix most major problems.  It's widely available for download (about 15MB); make sure you install it.  Scenes load pretty often, but it doesn't take long, and I hardly notice it anymore.  And just consider the incredible replay value of this game:  There are males and females of several different vampire clans (\"bloodlines\") -- all with different characteristics and powers. Additionally, I understand there are 4-5 completely different endings (your access to each ending -- or all of them -- depends upon how you played the game).  This can keep you busy for a while, so if you want an interesting, involving, truly different ADULT game experience, try Vampire: Bloodlines.  It really does rock.(I've heard that many people are upset about dialog spelling mistakes.  I've had no problem with this, probably because I don't have the NPC's portion of the dialog appear on screen -- only my response choices.  My hearing's okay, so why do I need to see the text?  This also gives most first-person RPG's a more \"cinematic\" quality -- as recommended by Bioware re KOTOR.)  I guess I should add that this is not a game for people who freak easily when everything's not exactly perfect or who are hyper-critical or detail oriented.  To me, the overall game experience is what counts, and this one is well worth overlooking a few bugs or working around them -- if it becomes necessary.  I was SO into this game, I was truly sorry when it ended (replays are great but never quite as good as the first play-through).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003O6N266","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Surine \"Stanley\"","summary":"A let down if you've played \"NFS: Hot Pursuit\"","reviewText":"After being extremely impressed with Hot Pursuit, I picked up this game thinking it would be a step up from that.  Not true.Don't get me wrong, this is a great game.  The graphics are fairly good and overall it's a fun game, but compared to previous NFS games, it's nothing to brag about.  Ironically, the aspect of this game that's the most boring and tedious is the running part.  At certain points in the game, the police will surround your car and you will be forced to run on foot.  In order to jump fences and avoid getting caught, you have to hit certain buttons on the controller.  Mess up, and you have to try it again.  These feel more like cut-scenes with a little audience participation than any type of challenge.  I can understand that the hope was to give the game a little variety so it's not strictly a racing game, but if that was their intent, they should have allowed the player to control where they run and where to hide.Also, NFS is known for having the police in the game.  Sadly, the cops are only a small part of this game and many races won't even include them.  This may not bother you, but if you're buying a game in the NFS series, chances are, you'll be missing that.The game does have a lot going for it.  Visually the game looks good and the selection of cars is nice and grows as the game progresses.  The storyline is a nice element in a racing game, but it's referenced so infrequently that you'll often forget about it.  Plus, you goal in each leg of the race is usually to just progress a few spots, so you'll wonder why you needed the story at all.Overall, the game is still a lot of fun and I have a feeling that most of the negative reviews are from those who just expected more from the NFS series and were a little let down.  But used for a few bucks, it might be worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

First let me say this game DOES NOT SUCK as some people say.  It does have its cons but its not a bad game at all.  Now that I've played through it I think this game is VERY good!Most of the arguments against it usually have to do with character development and escort mission and going back to the room, etc.  Or some just say, \"oh this wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game\".  Well that still doesn't mean they didn't make a good game and a story line to fit it into the Silent Hill series.  Also, if you really pay attention, they do develop the characters and everything, even the ghosts fit into place.This was the first Silent Hill game I played and let me say, I had to put it down for a while because it just freaked me out too much.  Then I got Silent Hill 2 and was addicted to playing it til I beat it.  I loved that game and still do but then I saw what people meant when they said SH4 veered away from the SH formula.I then went on to get SH3 and SH1 and Origins.  After playing them all now, I must say that though I absolutely LOVE SH1 and SH2, SH4 is definitely one of the most scariest to me.  I think they really managed to make a very creepy atmosphere and story that is hard to get out of your mind.  This game is full of \"WTF was THAT!\" moments.The graphics are good in this game.  But again, I believe the reason we play these games is not so much for the graphics but for the atmosphere it creates and to get scared or freaked out.  Resident Evil doesn't do that for me (ie RE4), but Silent Hill does and Silent Hill 4 has a lot of PSYCHO moments.Also, the ghosts that some complain about can get annoying if you don't know how to handle them or have a weapon to pin them down.  But once you know what to do, then they are not an issue.The only thing I didn't like was the need to keep going back to the Room to change weapons, but at the same time that gave you an opportunity to see some freaky stuff happening... I don't want to give any spoilers!  XDAlso the escort mission is not that bad, in fact, it is a WHOLE lot better than Resident Evil 4 where Ashley, the president's daughter, doesn't even help you fight!  In this one Eileen HELPS you fight even though she is injured!  Also you watch her from the very beginning through a hole in the wall which helps you start to actually care for her.Everything fits together well in this game if you let it and give it a chance.  It gives some background to SH2 and the history of Silent Hill as a whole.  Anyway, I suggest if you want a good scare then pick this up used.  It is an awesome game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX0UY","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Short but sweet. Tearaway is the Vita's killer app","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous visuals, fantastic gameplay, fun platforming, utilizes every one of the Vita&#8217;s hardware feature in a unique way, printing out papercraft models is fun, lots of hidden things to findThe Bad: Too short, not much content, can be too easy, combat is way too simpleMedia Molecule is known for innovation. LittleBigPlanet was a huge revolution in creative sandbox gameplay and platforming. Tearaway does the same thing for the Vita, but for the platforming genre. The game is the best looking game for Vita and is the only game out that uses all of the hardware&#8217;s features in a very unique and original way.You play as the messenger Atoi who must reach the sun where a You (the player) has ripped a whole in and are letting Scraps inside the world of Tearaway. The game uses the front facing camera to show you in the sun. You can then control Atoi and guide him using the rear touch pad and touchscreen. There really aren&#8217;t complicated puzzles but challenging platforming sections. When you see gray areas with the PS buttons on it (like the rear touch pad) you can poke your finger through in the game. The first time I did this it made me giddy and smile. You can do this to fight off scraps, push blocks around, and bounce drum pads to help Atoi along. You can also use the touch screen to roll out paper and interact with dozens and dozens of various papercraft items.Just these two major features alone are enough to call Tearaway the best game for Vita, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there. You can customize Atoi and characters in the world kind of like LBP. There&#8217;s no Pop-It but you can buy items using Confetti you find in the world. There aren&#8217;t as many items as LBP, but because it&#8217;s a straight up platformer you won&#8217;t really need that many items. Tearaway also has a unique papercraft origami collection you can find and print out online to create your own Tearaway world. To acquire these blueprints you need to find pure white objects in the world and take pictures of them. This adds to the creativity on a whole new level and helps build on this &#8220;real world leaking into the virtual world&#8221; theme.Outside of platforming and customizing things there is combat, but it&#8217;s very simple and easy. You can&#8217;t die in the game and combat never varies from jumping on Scraps or picking them up and throwing them. Some involve jumping in their springpad and tapping them to kill them. I wish the combat were a little deeper, but what&#8217;s here at least works and is fun. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff to find in the world like hidden presents, and side objectives where you help out various animals. After you beat the game the only thing you can do is complete the game 100%, but the game is well worth multiple play throughs.Let&#8217;s talk about graphics. I have no idea how MM got this game to look like a PS3 game bu they did. There&#8217;s no jaggies, no ugly low resolution textures, the lighting is great, and the animations are gorgeous. Wrinkled paper on the ground and be stepped on and you can watch it depress and raise back up when you walk off of it. All effects are done by paper and no other game looks like it. This is truly the best game on Vita right now and every owner needs to play this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

I've grown up with his games and continue to support Nintendo, however, I will start to write this review.Beware, I will be brutally HONEST about this game. Super Mario Kart, as you should know, is Mario's debut in a racing game. He along with Peach, Luigi, Yoshi, DK Jr., Bowser, Koopa and Toad, will race to the finish line.This game is very fun if you are playing with another player say for instance, in battle. I honestly found that to be the most fun part of the game. However, being me, (note I don't have the game, I've played it several times though) I usually am stuck playing a game by myself because my little bro doesn't play with me and my older bro usually doesn't have any taste whatsoever in gaming like I do! It [is too bad] but that's life. Sorry about giving you a little TOO much backround but, I indeed had a point. That point is playing alone is fun too, but the CPU AI is quite unbelievable and may leave you trying over and over to beat the Star Cup (if you can even get there), or wanting to break the damn game.Overall, it's an approachable game, BUT i warn you now, if you are looking for a easier racing game, don't bother with this one!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2003"}

In a nutshell, this is a pretty solid single player campaign, but it absolutely could have been and should have been a co-op campaign.I bought this because it promised a co-op mode, which was mysteriously not ready at launch. I thought, cool, they are really putting some work into it to make it a solid add-on for the game. I played it today and I was VERY let down. It only has two--yes two missions, although each does have four different phases or maps to it. Still, it falls drastically short of expectations. On top of that, you can't even do the fantastic grapple kills that make the game so fun to play.With the incredible co-op options for games like Gears 3, these guys should have really put more effort into this because as it stands it just won't compete with the big boys. I'm very dissappointed and have been a huge fan of all the computer games and novels for years. I had hoped this would be the start of a great new franchise for the xbox, but unless they put in some more effort, it just won't be able to compete.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2EM","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"A love letter to the fans","reviewText":"I've been a fan of saints row almost from the beginning. I missed the first game, butSaints Row 2 - Xbox 360still ranks among my absolute favorite games of all time. It was fast, fun, funny, violent, but had a tense, engaging story with likeable characters, rounding out the experience. It is that last element that was missing from the third iteration. WhileSaint's Row: The Third - Xbox 360was still fast, fun, and violent, it was missing a lot of the funny. Worse yet, the vibrant engaging characters from the second seemed muted and generic. I am beyond happy to say that has been addressed with Saints Row 4.Right off the bat, the over the top feel of the game hits you hard and never lets up. You are the president of the United States and it is your job to stop evil aliens from taking over the world. You fail; spectacularly at that. You and all of your friends are imprisoned in a virtual prison, and this is where the fun begins. Because the world is virtual, you now have access to super powers, the two most prevalent among them being super speed and hulk jumping, for lack of a better term. This, unfortunately, is also where the games biggest problem comes in.Saints Row 4 is a big, ambitious game, and I respect what they were trying to do. The super powers are cool and well implemented, but the overall structure of the game remains unchanged from past iterations. Sections of the virtual city are still called \"Hoods\", your friends, now politicians, celebrities, and secret agents, are still referred to as your \"homies\". You still have access to your \"gang\", despite the fact that they become all but useless against most enemies in the game half way through. Despite having super speed and, thanks to the glide ability, practically being able to fly, too many missions find reasons for you to be in vehicles, which are not nearly as enjoyable to use as your powers are. Unfortunately, at least with my copy, lag was a huge issue when jumping, because the game autosaved every five seconds, making platforming far more difficult that it needed to be, and marring the overall immersion of the game.Worse yet, the game is still littered with mini games, many of them hit or miss. Racing through cramped side streets, terribly unenjoyable platforming sections, insurance fraud (ugh), mayhem sections (UGH), and terrifyingly enough vehicle mayhem sections (WHY!?), are among the many mini games that dangle valuable upgrades in front of you, that are only unlockable after getting difficult to earn gold medals. To add insult to injury all of these mini games are saddled with an arbitrary time limit, ensuring that, if by some miracle, you actually enjoy any of these diversions, the extra stress of having to do it quickly will sap that enjoyment right out.This game could have been great but Volition wasn't willing to shake conventional staples to the genre. Thankfully however, the rest of the game is fantastic. The story related missions are all quite engaging and the story is absolutely crazy, made all the better by the triumphant of the characters that you knew and loved from the first two games. Volition even went as far as to address issues such as \"Why did Shandi go from fun to frumpy between games 2 &3?\" and \"What's Pierce's problem?\". Incredible dialogue, tons of character development, and a metric ton of call backs, inside jokes, and awesome sing a longs of the radio remind you why you fell in love with these characters in the first place.By now, you'll have noticed that the positive points of my review revolve around knowing about the past games. To fully enjoy this game, it is best to have played the games that came before. If you've at least played through, and beaten, the second game though, that should suffice. This final game in the series is an excellent cap to a strange series, loaded with generous heaps of fan service for long time players. While it is totally possible to enjoy it without having played what came before, you will be lacking valuable context, and the lions share of the jokes and in game dialogue will go totally over your head. My favorite moment in the game was when the playa and Pierce are driving along and begin to sing along with one of their favorite songs. A certain person does something that doesn't sit well with them, and it was one of the funniest moments in any game I've ever played, mostly because I recognized the callback from the second game.Saints Row is a fun game, with great ideas, serviceable execution, and brilliant story and dialogue. While having played the past three games aren't required, I would strongly suggest completing the second game for the much needed context, and also because it is the best game in the series. All in all, Saints Row 4 is an enjoyable, if technically flawed, gem of a game that is fun for most, but sensational for fans. If you like the series, this is a must buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2014"}

Not only is this game one of best games on the DS its also very very original and unique(Plus it takes advantage of the DS stylus and touch screen).  The Visuals in the game are simply beautiful and very Colorful.  Nintendo hit the mark on that one.  Its such a treat how every world is so different and unique on its own(especially the last few worlds).  Speaking of worlds, you'll be playing in abunch trying to get your way from point a to point b.  The first few ones are CAKE but the last few ones will get you frustraited at times especially the last 2 worlds(there not really worlds i just like to call em' that).  The musc/sound in the game is also gos with the atmosphere of the game.  Some times it will be joyus and childesh and then sometimes it will be like.....the same?  but with a techno like beats to it.  As for the control?.....Sylus,touch screen(im not gonna go into detail about it cause the rest of the reviews probably tell it better then me),nuff said.  The only gripe I have is that the game could have been longer not to mention...DARE I SAY IT....it gets a bit repetitive and boring near the end.  NOW i know i said how fun this game is(believe me i was having a blast the first hours i purchased this game)but after awhile the game really does get stale....But the short and somewhat easy/gets abig hard at the end games storymode is also made up for COLLECTING MEDALS which is an awesome treat.  I've gotten almost 119 but gave up(hey i got other things to do!).  But for you die hard Kirby Fans out there you'll eat this one up in seconds, sure there are times when getting medals will be a peace of cake but also times when you'll be tearing out your hair wondering how you have to get that.  Besides the Storymode, and collecting coins there are some really awesome sub games such as one where you have to match the same drawing as the boss youre fighting(and boy is it fun!)..ill just get this done quick for you folksThe Good-Beautiful Animation-Takes full advantage of the DS touch screen and Stylus-Collecting Medals is fun-Great story mode and really fun-Good music-Awesome things to unlock like levels, music, ect-The sub games are really fun and a treat to play-If you add the everything to do together you'll get a decent 20-50 hours of gameplayingThe bad-Last 2 worlds go from being pretty easy to just plain frustraiting(atleast for me)-Short Story mode(then again i was kina getting tired of it :/ )-some medals are a pain to get-Getting an A in those sub games can be a little frustraitingOverall Kirby is a great game to have and is an excellent edition to the DS library.

The auto aim was awful, the graphics didn't immediatly impress me, and the overall gameplay was just boring. But I kept playing, and soon I found myself on the second mission, kicking butt, and realized 2 hours had passed. I had to stop and tell the world! \"Why?\" THIS GAME IS AWSOME!...1. Gameplay: First off, if you're an expierienced gamer, shut the auto-aim OFF in preferences. It really kills the gameplay. Second, realize how cool the gameplay is. There are dozens of guns to try out, the graphics are awsome, and your enemies actually use their brain. That's what made this game such a challenge. To begin the game, you see a little movie about an Alien race called the \"TimeSplitters\" . They travel through time, and are here to take over the world. So Earth sends out a last hope with a group of Marines. They send 2 (you and if you have a friend, a second person) marines on to the Alien's ship. They battle their way to the bridge, where 9 Aliens have already disapeared into a time warp. Each is in a different time with a time crystal you have to retrieve. So you follow these Aliens through each time period, shooting your way through anything from zombies, guards, aliens, other marines, spies, robots, etc...it's really cool. Once you finish the game, the world is saved. The thing is, once you beat a game on the hardest level, u unlock an even harder difficulty setting. Can u beat it on a harder level, than the next? Really cool, and you can re-do any level on any setting, at any time. And you can do all these levels in one player, or 2 player. So me and my best friends could go through the story as a team. What a blast!You have anything from grenades, snipers, shotguns, pistols, machine guns, etc... and it just gets better. This is just the story. Should I move on?2. The graphics: Not the greatest we've ever seen, but still quite good. You see gun shells fall to the ground, watch water spray down from a waterfall, see heads fall off and roll to the floor (only from zombies, no gore here!). When u shoot at wall, the gun marks appear and stay for the game. Glass shatters, people fall back when u shoot. Good explosions, etc... It gets the job done and a little bit more. Graphics here are good, but don't expect Grand Theft Auto.3. Sound: Very good. Each gun makes it's own sound, voice acting is pretty good, the alarms make u jump with the realistic screech. Unfortunantly, you don't here the people walk. Little things like that aren't here, but once again, it gets the job done. 3.5 out of 5 stars in sound. But u don't really notice anything bad during the awsome gameplay. As for the menu music, FANTASTIC! Very good game, and the music really gets u excited for the games. I love this game, and the sound was part of it!4. Multiplayer: AWSOME! 4 player, 3 player, and 2 player. You can play through the story through 2 player, and have 4 player fighting frenzy after that. You can do a deathmatech (where your 4 players fight off impossible odds working together), challenge (where you make a challenge and face it), campaining (where you have 2 teams with dozens of people going through all out war! Players pick their side), and the good 'ole 4-player killing spree. You all face each other, battling for kills, points, and the right to stay alive and call yourself the champ! These are just a few (to give you an idea). And with over a 100 characters to choose from, dozens of levels to fight in, and a ton of game types, this game will keep you entertained...for awhile!Overall, this game rocked. I wasn't expecting such a fun game when I picked it up. Definantly worth the buy. And if you share an XBOX with good friends, room mates, brothers and sisters, etc.. you can work as a team in multiple ways, including going throug EVERY singlr mission in story mode, guarding each other's back.It wasn't Grand Theft Auto, or SOCOM: NAVY Seals, but it was a great game. No gore, and a ton of awsome fun, TimeSplitter's 2 (the sequel to the classic TimeSplitter's for the PlayStation) lives up to the hype, and can be compared to games like Perfect Dark, Golden Eye, and even SOCOM in some terms.Hope this helped, now I gotta go play TimeSplitter's 2!...Thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2003"}

The graphics are also really good especially when you're going hand-to-face with a few Trandoshans. :D Give it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2006"}

Yet, they definitely brought so many wonderful kinds of add-ons to this great system. Unfortunately, when I heard so much hype about their wireless controller, I felt a little bit stoned. The Wavebird controller for the Nintendo Gamecube fairs as a very accurate controller through many different channels. However, there are a couple of downsides to owning a wavebird. One of them is that you lose the vibration feel that the corded version has in itself by Nintendo. That remains unfortunate. Another downside is that sometimes, your controller doesn't work very well, when you have another remote beam in the middle of the way from a different device like the VCR, or television. All in all, I honestly suggest you buy the Wired version of the Gamecube controller, if you want a better time with the games you play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Not quite KOTOR","reviewText":"I loved KOTOR and couldn't get enough, so I bought KOTOR 2. It's a fine game, but can't match the epic scale of its predecessors. The biggest problem is bugs and what seems like an incomplete plot. Here are some thoughts:STORYKOTOR was renowned for its epic story. KOTOR 2's story by contrast is a bit vague and never really fulfills its potential. Basically, several Sith Lords are assassinating the Jedi and you have to gather the last of the Jedi masters. However, unlike in KOTOR, you barely see the main villains (well, except for one of the Sith...). The individual levels have some fun plots, particularly the civil wars, but some like Korriban seem empty. You see a surprisingly small number of Sith along the way.There are also a few potentially interesting plot twists, particularly the HK-50 droids, that seem unresolved. Indeed, there are developer files for further levels and cinematics that weren't included in the final game due to time pressures. All I can say is there is a mod available online that reincorporates some of these elements.CHARACTERSAnother downside is that KOTOR 2's cast is simply weaker overall. The characters tend to have more subdued personalities and there's a lot less dialogue. There is a new game mechanic of building influence with other characters, depending on your gender and Light/Dark Side actions. It's a good idea, but sometimes this only means that it's more difficult to talk with them. You'll probably find that there are at least a few characters whom you'll simply have no desire to play. There are a few gems, such as Kreia, whose cynicism and creepiness are an awesome touch. However, you won't see any action figures of them anytime soon.GAMEPLAYPretty much KOTOR plus a few additional mechanics, such as greater Force powers and lightsaber fighting forms. It works pretty well overall.GRAPHICSAgain, like KOTOR but better. Some of the main characters look really good with more polygons and detailed rendering. This game came out only a year after KOTOR, so it's not surprising that they look so similar.MUSICAgain, not as epic as KOTOR. There aren't any blood-pumping themes like the KOTOR intro or Star Forge battle. It's not memorable and tends to be dark and subdued. Sadly, I think it was a mistake to put Mark Griskey on this game as opposed to Jeremy Soule, the compose for KOTOR. I'm also not a fan of Griskey's work on The Force Unleashed.Overall, KOTOR 2 is more KOTOR and it works reasonably well. It's a shame that Obsidian didn't spend the extra few months or so that would have made this game great. In the end, given the price of the game nowadays, it's certainly a decent way to get your KOTOR fix until The Old Republic comes out later this year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00113T0VA","reviewerName":"smullins","summary":"Rent dont buy","reviewText":"I was really excited about this title.  I'm a star wars nerd and what better way to act out childhood fantasies then wielding a plastic control pretending to be a powerful sith.Unfortunately, this title falls short for several reasons:1.  The graphics are horrible.  I have played plenty of games on the wii, some look amazing like Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros Brawl.  Force Unleashed has very bad polygon rendering and at times reminded me of past games on N64!  The presentation is just poor; this is not because of the Wii, plenty of games look great on the Wii - this is just a bad port.2.  There are a lot of combos you can learn for fighting with the light saber.  However, they require voodoo like memorization to pull off.  I can remember button sequences really easily (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a) but trying to remember A, wiimote forward, nunchuck up, Z, Z, wiimote left to right, nunchuck down C - that's more than I bargained for.  As a result, I tended to use the force powers instead of melee combat.  I think the force powers were way over powered, especially force lighting with force push.  The game lost its challenge with using these powers.3.  The game was supposed to tout a highly specialized physics engine and AI decision engine.  There were supposed to be all these interactions with the environment and enemies would react to the environment differently each time.  What was actually delivered was a couple boxes scattered throughout each room that you can force grab to throw at enemies to instantly kill them.  Some wall panels could come off but that was about it.  The environment interaction was just not there.I'm giving this three stars because it is always fun to play as a jedi/sith, even if the rest of the game is lame.  Fans of star wars will appreciate the game a little more than indifferent players.  Had I not been a fan, I would have given this 2 stars and said to skip it altogether.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2009"}

Animations have been slightly tweaked for the better from last year's title and, in many cases, players look completely realistic.

WITH GUNS","reviewText":"For me, that sums up this game rather nicely. Both games have sprawling sandbox worlds, offer tons of hours of gameplay and feature great graphics.You would think that all that would guarantee this to be a 5 star game, but alas, that is not the case. So on to the pros and cons . . .PROS:MOSTLY SOLID GAMEPLAY: Walking, running, shooting and operating vehicles is all very smooth and seamless. The controls are set up very well, as is.LOTS OF GAMETIME: Like Oblivion and the original Farcry, you can spend countless hours roaming the world doing real missions, side missions, or just doing your own thing. A complex landscape guarantees that no two firefights will be the same.NICE WEAPON VARIETY: You get several types of handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, rocket/grenade launchers and other explosives. Personally, I found the Sniper Rifle (primary), Mac-10 or Uzi (secondary) and RPG (special) combination to work really well.JAMMING WEAPONS: Finally! A game that actually adds the realism of jamming weapons. To make it more realistic, the weapons of your enemies are more prone to jam compared to your freshly-purchased weapons at the store.GRAPHICS: The least important to me, and although I've never been there, it definitely looks like Africa. This game does for fire what Bioshock did for water. And some of the sunsets are truly breathtaking.CONS:GLITCHY SAVE SYSTEM: I often noticed that sometimes I wouldn't start off where I last saved. Sometimes one or two saves back, even. Fortunately I kept 3 saves on file in case something like this happened so I could roll forward to the correct one.TEDIOUS GAMEPLAY: This game is very nonlinear, meaning you can approach your target from different directions or even take alternative missions, but in the end, you'll find yourself having to take out at least one or two guard posts along the way. The times you bypass the guardposts you'll more than like run across a gun truck/boat.MALARIA: Like Oblivion had the Vampire sickness, Farcry2 has Malaria. The difference is that while Oblivion's Vampire sickness was conditional (you only got it if you got bitten), in Farcry2 you START the game with Malaria. So what does the Malaria do? It makes the scene go blurry, but if it happens X amount of times, it ultimately warps you back to the doctor who tells you that you need to get medicine. Unfortunately, sometimes these Underground shacks with Malaria medication are far away, meaning that you might get sick once or twice along the way, which then automatically transports you back to the doctor if you don't get to your destination in time.If you do get the Malaria medication, it's only a few pills and doesn't last very long. Also, there is no counter to tell you how many pills you have in stock. Sometimes when you rattle your prescription bottle it might sound like you have 3-5 pills in there when you really only have 1.BUGS: This following bug prevented me from beating the game (I was at 62% completion). I had to get some more Malaria medication. Sounds easy enough. But every time I went to this shack I killed all the enemies . . . yet the door wouldn't open--an indication that there was still an enemy out there that I had to kill to trigger the script to open the door. I thoroughly decimated this little shack and the surrounding area, making double and triple sure that my enemies were dead, yet the game still bugged out, telling me that there was at least one more bad guy out there which is why the door wouldn't open.So I figured I'd just try and finish the game without the Malaria medication. No can do. After two or three instances of sickness, you get automatically sent back to the hospital. Not enough time to finish some missions.OVERALL: If it weren't for some of these bugs, this would easily be a 4 star game. But as it is, I was unable to complete it. So my rating stands at 3.5 stars. Hope you fair better in the wilderness of Africa than I did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

Despite the fact that slight gameplay imperfections might preclude it from being labeled a true \"masterpiece,\" it remains a 50+ hour FPS (with RPG tendencies) spectacle that truly raises the bar and re-establishes what is possible within the tired genre.  If you haven't played it yet, you simply don't know what you're missing, and you *must* buy it (forget renting it, unless you plan on devoting every waking minute of your life for the next week to it) now.To begin, as others have reported, the game is not a \"true\" sequel to the original \"Far Cry,\" but in no way is that something that should be seen as a drawback, as \"Far Cry 2\" is a brilliant game in its own right.  The game's setting provides for a remarkable, unique experience; this game truly brings Africa to life, and it's nothing short of breathtaking.  The landscape is *incredibly* vast; each \"world\" map is 25 square kilometers (if you thought the \"world\" map was *huge* upon starting the game, you'll be astonished to find that there is a *second* map to explore, of equal size to the first (you'll be transported to it at around 45-50% completion (it's past the huge desert at the southwest corner of the first map))).  The game encompasses rocky hills, grassy savannas, deserts, lakes, ponds, waterfalls, and basically every other rural African setting you could imagine, and it's all among the most beautiful and realistic scenery I've ever seen in a game.  If you admire it as much as I do, you might find yourself opting to walk the terrain, rather than drive, simply to take it all in.  You'll see (and hear) freely roaming animals that can impact gameplay, start wildfires if you choose (surrounding enemies with fire (which you can start with RPGs, Molotov Cocktails, frag grenades, and more) is a major part of the game's strategy), and swim to the depths of ponds and rivers in order to surprise your enemies on the shore.  Old, dirty weapons taken from enemies will frequently jam and even explode in your hands (when you see an ignited rocket fall from your RPG, run), an angle of realism I've never seen before in a game.  These are but a few examples of what makes this game's presentation so suberb; it all feels real, and raises the \"absorption\" bar to a level we haven't yet witnessed.Secondly, the game contains some of the best graphics you're ever likely to see via XBOX 360, which surpass those seen in the original (PC gamers have stated that their version surpasses even \"Crysis,\" the longstanding graphical benchmark).  Despite the fact that the console version runs at only 30 fps, the fact that it maintains this rate @ 720p with so much going on is remarkable, and it simply embarasses other games with similar statistics.  The HDR lighting is masterful (best seen on this console), and despite the absurd number of polygons on screen at any given time, draw distance is incredible, and pop-in is very infrequent.  A simple glance is all you need to quickly find that it's one of the most richly-filled environments yet to be seen in any console game.  Regarding the game's equally impressive sound, the first half of \"Far Cry 2\" contains some of the most elegantly serene African-themed music I've ever heard, and it fits the pace and rhythm of the game flawlessly, relaxing the game's flow when freely roaming and building necessary tension only when enemies approach.  The voice acting is generally good, using (apparently) authentic Africans to do the job properly, though you'll hear precisely the same chit-chat muttered by enemies more than once frequently throughout the game.  The DD 5.1 (trust me, you need 5.1 for this game) soundscape is nearly flawless, with proper direction and focus.  The only issue I have with the sound, overall, is that some sounds (talking enemies, e.g.) are far louder than they should be relative to your position and the environment.  Minor gripe, though, considering how effectively it's all been designed and assembled.Taking you out of the realism, however, are a couple of issues that should have been resolved before the game's release; the most obvious is the much-loathed respawing of enemies only minutes after you've decimated them all (at a particular location).  There's no excuse for it; it's simply idiotic.  One of the game's producers tries to account for it in an interview on the game's website, and stumbles around the question before finally settling on \"technical reasons,\" and that \"it's a non-linear game.\"  Right.  It's terrible and completely illogical, and it should be amended in an updated future re-release to prevent it from hapenning, as it does nothing but hurt the game (and it is nearly a dealbreaker for some gamers).Secondly, the game's storyline is less than cohesive; each and every mission is virtually unrelated to the one before it until you approach the end of the game, and you'll simply be playing both factions until you reach that point.  I personally, however, couldn't care less about games' stories (they're almost universally terrible and/or impossible to decipher anyway), but for many people, this is a major problem that prevents their enjoyment of the game.Looking past these issues, however, this game is truly unique, and brilliantly executed, being the culmination of 3.5 years of hard work (including two weeks in which Ubi staff actually traveled to Kenya for research).  I simply can't recommend it strongly enough, despite its inadequecies, and you won't find a better or more innovative FPS released in 2008.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

It was the first game I can think of that had any kind of blood & gore, and boy oh boy did it get its fair share of flack from parents and the government alike.I was a MK \"fanboy\" I even bought a Sega Genesis just to have MK with the blood & fatalities in tact (The Super Nintendo version had grey \"sweat\" and less than fatal \"fatalities\"). However when MK went to 3D graphics & fighting plain, it lost something to me, and each new game became more and more complicated to play, almost to the point where I felt I needed a PhD to play it effectively. I had all but given up on MK...Then along comes MK9, or simply Mortal Kombat. A reboot, that has gone back to it's 2D roots, and kept the dazzeling 3D graphics! I was excited for a MK release for the first time in a long time, and my excitement was well placed. This IS Mortal Kombat! It is everything the old games were and much, much, more! The fighting engine is deep, but not overly complicated. Combos are easy to pull off, but not so easy as to do \"button mashers\" any good. The blood is there, but toned down a little bit, to make it more realistic. Fatalities are also not overly difficult to execute (pun intended lol) and are a plenty (each character has at least 3). So many modes I doubt I'll ever unlock everything. Online is easy to set up matches, and offers unlimited re-playability.All of these things together makes for an A+ title, but the thing that impressed me most, is the Story Mode. The Story Mode is the best of any fighting game I have ever played. It seamlessly blends the story with the Kombat, and every fight has a reason. The story covers at least all 3 original games (I'm still working on it and that's as far as I've gotten so far), and really fleshes out the MK story way more than the original games ever did. Most story modes in fighting games can be completed in an hour or two, but I have been working on MK's story mode for 3 nights straight, and still don't think it's coming to an end anytime soon. MK's Story Mode could be a game all by itself, and I would buy it!All-in-all, if you don't have Mortal Kombat yet, what are you waiting for? Pick this gem of a fighting game up now, you won't be disappointed!FYI: If you intend to play MK online (which I highly recommend), make sure you buy a new copy. If you buy used, chances are you will have to buy a Kombat Pass, unless for some reason the previous owner didn't use theirs. It will just save you money & aggravation in the long run to buy new. Which honestly you should do anyway. Support your game developers folks!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

It was a 8bit gaming system, that helped re-vamp the troubled gaming industry in the mid 80's. The NES had various accessories to use with it. One of which was the Nintendo Zapper. It was a gun that came with the system & a Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt cartridge. You could use the gun to hunt ducks or use it to shoot clay discs in a different mode. Also the Turbo Pad, a big pad you lay on the floor. And you use it for games like track & field,ect....There we're wireless controllers (that didn't work good),a robot (Robby) that was made to play with or against you. He would sometimes just randomly reset the game on you (not cool). And then there was the Power Glove! It was a glove that would supposedly allow you to punch towards the TV, and it'd do it in the game. It also had a control pad on it too! The system has 2 control ports, and comes with a RF adapter to hook up to the TV. It does however, have AV inputs on the side of the system. The NES is truly a classic console. And really could be the reason us gamers are able to enjoy the systems of today. It was a huge success and got kids,teens, and even adults into gaming again. Nintendo did a great job providing awesome games! For those of you that like old school games/systems I recommend this! I actually had my son play this first, when he started gaming @ age 2.

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"More of the same fun, more of the same monotony","reviewText":"For a solid decade or so (about 1996 to 2007, to be precise), everyone's favorite turtle-stomping plumber had a rather experimental phase and went on a nice handful of decidedly different adventures. There was the epic Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars that all but redefined what people could expect from a Mario game, and of course Super Mario 64 that did the exact same thing all over again. Although Super Mario Sunshine was released on Nintendo's least commercially successful console and received a rather mixed consumer response, it was a nice divergence in tone, theme, and gameplay, even featuring fully voice acted cutscenes and other major rarities in the franchise. Additionally, I'm sure every platforming addict fondly remembers the more recent Super Mario Galaxy with its gravity-defying planetoids, thrilling intergalactic air rides and cast of endearing new characters. That was about where the Mario Innovation Train came to a screeching halt, however, as pretty much every installment that followed was based almost exclusively on throwback nostalgia and slight expansions of the overly familiar, whether it be New Super Mario Bros. Wii or Super Mario Galaxy 2. The Mario franchise hasn't seen any particularly notable innovations or changeups since 2007's Galaxy, which is a shame given how many new opportunities have arisen technologically and otherwise. New Super Mario Bros. 2, the first 2D Mario platformer on the 3DS, decidedly continues the trend with this bazillionth side-scrolling, Goomba-stomping quest to save Peach from Bowser.While I understand that a massive portion of Mario's appeal has always been his nostalgia factor (and am absolutely a self-admitted Mario addict myself), I for one am growing tired of Nintendo's recent recurring trend of trying to recapture the 90's glory days in the form of lazy rehashes that feature pitifully low quantities of anything wholeheartedly new. I agree that traditional Mario platformers will never grow old, but a big part of what made them so appealing to begin with was their consistent trailblazing within the genre and even the industry as a whole. The original Super Mario Bros. games were each very different from one another in different ways, and although the big picture remained similar, each installment introduced dramatic shifts in design and gameplay (particularly given the hardware limitations at the time). As of right now, however, I don't feel that there's much difference at all between the New Super Mario Bros. titles, already in their third overall installment (with a fourth on the way, which looks incredibly samey as well). There are differentiations between the level of multiplayer emphasis and one or two new(ish) power-ups, but beyond that it's a patterned sequence of monotony. This is a particularly glaring issue when you realize that the exact same music, sound bites and 3D models are all being routinely reused. The soundtrack of New Super Mario Bros. 2 is ripped directly from previous installments, and veterans will find the desert, plains and title screen themes all too familiar.The good news is, as it always has been, Mario platforming is pretty much 2D platforming at its very best; players will still be delighted by the intuitively responsive control scheme and whimsical stage design, ideally crafted for exploration and crawling with equally well-designed baddies. You'll still be wall-jumping, ground-pounding and pipe-plunging your way to the princess, and for the most part it's still a great deal of carefree fun, particularly when teaming up with a friend.As most of you have surely heard by now, the big overarching theme this time around is coin collecting, something that has technically always been a staple in pretty much every Mario game. In this installment, however, it's pushed to the forefront as you'll literally be showered in coins at every corner; enemies cough them up, they spout from pipes and blocks, and there's even a power-up that gives Mario the Midas touch, i.e. the ability to transform the enemies and environments around him into shimmering gold coins. The big supposed goal is to ultimately collect a million of them throughout the course of the game, as you continuously add to your ever-growing coin count while you gather them in each stage. There doesn't seem to be any particular reward for achieving any of this, however, because you'll receive little more than congratulatory screens for each quantitative goal you reach. Additionally, 100 coins still earns you an extra life, and since they're literally everywhere in this game, most players will have hundreds of lives within a matter of hours. This means the once-coveted 1-Up doesn't add up to much of anything, and unless you're truly, truly terrible at this game, it's quite easy to play through the whole campaign without ever once seeing the Game Over screen. This definitely doesn't mean the game itself is a total cakewalk or that you can expect to never die, but it's much less devastating when you have an endless pool of lives to prevent any Game Overs.Coin Rush is the new mode that utilizes the 3DS's StreetPass feature, allowing you to dash through a series of three randomly selected stages while collecting as many coins as you possibly can. You can share your best times and totals with other 3DS owners, but this all comes off to me like a rather self-contained mini-game (it doesn't affect your in-game progress and I'm not even sure the coins collected in this mode are added to your base total), so I haven't spent much time with it. The big golden coin motif sounds gimmicky because it is, but at its best it adds a nice thematic sheen to the design and gameplay (the golden ring that transforms all enemies and parts of the surrounding environment into sparkling gold is a particularly nice touch).Many of Mario's most familiar power-ups return in NSMB2, including the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Tanooki Leaf, the latter of which finally once again grants the power of flight, a welcome addition to most any game. The shrinking Mini Mushroom and environment-crushing Mega Mushroom also make occasional appearances, but they're unfortunately rarely seen. The only actual \"new\" power-up is the Gold Flower, which turns Mario's entire body into gold and allows him to hurl enormous golden fireballs that explode on impact, transforming any enemies or blocks in their path into coins. Despite what it looks like, this power-up does not grant invincibility, and Mario is still vulnerable to attacks in this form. This is admittedly a pretty exciting ability, but unfortunately it's a tad under-utilized and only lasts the duration of a level or until Mario gets hit, at which point it vanishes. There is also the pseudo-power-up Golden Block that functions similarly, attaching itself to Mario's head and spouting more and more coins depending on how quickly he's moving.The multiplayer mode in NSMB2 is fun, albeit less successful than the one featured in New Super Mario Bros. Wii for a handful of reasons. For one, it is limited to two players, both of whom must have a 3DS *and* their own copy of the game to play. The camera is also a bit wonky in this mode, swapping back and forth between a single \"focus\" character, meaning Mario and Luigi can't go off to explore on their own (ironic, give the separate screens) or even stray too far from the focal character without risking sudden death from traveling too far off-screen. There is no online compatibility (yet another sadly missed opportunity), only local wireless, meaning the person you play with has to be physically near you. The progress can also only be tracked on one player's save file (unless you start an entirely separate one for multiplayer, which can still only be saved to the first player's game), meaning all progress in multiplayer is meaningless for whoever plays as Luigi (the guy just can't get a break). The coins collected, however, are transferable. Although this sounds like a lot of griping, the mode still makes for quite a bit of silly multiplayer madness and is worth trying out, but it's not a defining feature like it was with NSMBW.The 3D capability of the console is pretty much wholeheartedly wasted on this title, as NSMB2 is easily the worst and weakest use of the feature I have yet to see on the 3DS. It wouldn't be fantastically far-fetched to say this could have probably been a regular DS port. This doesn't mean it looks terrible, but beyond a slight sense of depth between forefront and background, there's little actual 3D to be seen here (and you may flat out prefer to turn the slider completely off to reduce the unfortunate blurring of scenery that occurs otherwise).New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a quaintly entertaining game, and anyone ravenous for Mario platforming should get a decent fix from it; unfortunately, it doesn't offer anything truly new, and if you were bored with any of the previous New Super Mario titles, steer clear of this one because it's absolutely no different. Although sandy deserts, lava-flowing castles and puzzling ghost houses will always have their charm, here's hoping Nintendo spices things up next time around, because nostalgia can only be stretched so thin.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2012"}

I had already paid for the 12-month gold xbox live card and already have a headset so why bother buying another pair and the 60 gig hard drive for the same price as the 120 gig hard drive, at least that had help make up my mind on the purchase of this hard drive.  I am amazed at the sheer capacity of this drive though as up to now I had just been using a 512MB memory card, and now having this much space to download,save games, movies , or music was astounding and now I have no fear of running out of space for my games and the like.  The biggest thing I felt and I know many other reviewers feel is the price of the hard drive and the question in many peoples heads \"Do I really need this for my console?\",  \"Is the price for this hard drive worth getting for my Xbox 360?\",  \"If I only use this Xbox for games and not any big downloads do I really need this hard drive?\", and at the end the answer can only fall on the person who is deciding on this themselves.  The one pro I feel to most of those questions is that you won't have to worry about buying a $20-50 dollar memory card in two months or less if you buy a ton of games and need the space to save your games and the like plus the demos you might decide to download from Xbox live.  So at the end is this really worth the price and for myself I say yes considering that a 512MB memory card cost $50 dollars and this 120GB hard drive cost $140 so if you do a little math and consider the space size of the hard drive you'll see that it's probably the best choice for your wallet...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2009"}

Smoke grenades look like real smoke for once. The detail of the weapons and the soldiers uniform are sweet eye candy. Players fight to the sounds of shouting, dying men, sounds of gunfire in the distance, and a Hollywood quality music. Each game is separated by a cut scene from the military channel, describing the desperate situation you will soon find yourself in. In the 2nd Russian mission you will find yourself fighting off a horde of Nazi's who are charging your line. You can get a sense of nervousness and desperation as you find yourself fighting a superior German army. They really get your adrenaline pumping. Nothing can compare to the feeling you get when charging a Nazi line. You can tell that the developers of the game are fans of Enemy at the Gate and Band of Brothers type movies.The single player........What I don't like about the game is it seems to be exactly like the first call of duty. Just with more action and British tank missions that are over too soon. The tank missions are extremely easy as well. I was getting highly annoyed with the AI of both friends and enemy troops. Your buddies in this game will hurl themselves in front of machine gun nest. Sometimes they don't move if a grenade lands next to them. AND THEY GET IN YOUR WAY!!! This was my problem in one of the British missions where I found myself in the trenches being blocked by my own troops. The enemy throws a grenade and BOOM! I'm died. This because the game's AI goes by the \"follow directly behind the player\" thinking. Sometimes they won't even cover you. Their can be a Nazi standing right next to you bashing you with his Rifle. And your fellow soldiers will just stand there and do nothing. I can understand the  idea of having friends die all around you but this just gets repetitiveSpeaking of grenades, the Germans seem to love them it to death. Every time you get in an encounter, the first thing the enemy will do is throw a grenade. THEY ALWAYS THROW A GRENADE FIRST. So you got to move back and run from the grenade sometimes into enemy fire. This gets frustrated, especially when your trying to aim your rifle on an enemy headThe multi-player......Logged on to see a plethora of servers. Most of them empty with very few players playing online. If your looking for a multi-player shooter get Battlefield 2. This is not a worthy multi player. And it's a good reason why they are empty. The types of games you can play DM, Team DM, Headquarters, CTF, and Search and Destroy are the same thing as COD. I do admit however that same of the games are pretty fun. I love the Search and Destroy and Headquarters the most. Most of these maps are simply just old maps with improved graphics. I haven't played COD in 2 years yet when I got into these maps I had no trouble finding my away around the map. In HQ you find yourself fighting for turf and defending or capturing it from enemy players in typical Battlefield like tradition. My biggest beef with MP is that when it comes down to it, machine guns overpower everything. I played games just where I was using rifles and games where I was just using machine guns and you can guess that the games where I used the Thompson and the German assault rifle were games where I was always getting a higher score then usual. The trench-gun (Shotgun) is the most noob gun I ever shot. You don't even have to aim to hit your opponent with it. You find yourself getting killed with one or two hits from this gun.Having said all this i have no idea why this game is winning awards from Gamespy and IGN...when its clearly just an average run of the mill shooterBasically if you want to sum up my review in one line. COD 2 is more of an expansion pack then an actual sequel. Come on Activision, you can do better then this!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Wears thin fast","reviewText":"I loved Resident Evil (the Gamecube remake) and I thought that Zero was quite a lot of fun too (I never did play 2 or 3 as they were just ported onto the Gamecube straight from the PS1) but while Resident Evil 4 is an improvement in terms of graphics and hardware it doesn't have any atmosphere or the overwhelming sensation of dread and fear. This is basically down to the style of gameplay.Gone are the spooky camera angles for a start. Instead, this time the camera is constantly behind Leon, following him in whatever direction he goes. It's a bit tricky at first but after a few minutes you'll get the hang of it. Also, the game is not really about exploration and mystery solving and you never really go back to the same place twice. Okay, this is a good thing in some ways as it did get a little annoying before (the 'door-opening' cutscenes are also gone) and I understand the gameplay of the franchise had to evolve but, the way it is, RE 4 just feels like a shoot-em-up.In your long, long journey (the game is absolutely MASSIVE) Leon visits a rickety European village that seems stuck in the dark ages, onto an old castle, then to a creepy island and on into a huge fortress and laboratory. In this respect it feels a LOT like a Dungeon Siege game in regards to the constant running around in torchlit catacombs, killing big insects, collecting treasures, trading/building up your stats and weapons and looking for that way out which seems to be miles away through endless, labyrinthine corridors.All you really do in this game is go forward and shoot. And it gets quite boring after the halfway mark. There is some very slight puzzle-solving but I suspect this was only put in to satisfy hardcore RE fans.There are plenty of pros, like the brilliant graphics, the sheer size of the game is impressive, the cool extras and mini-games awarded after finishing (I did it in 15 hours and I WON'T be going through it again) and faster loading times. But the boredom of killing the zillionth evil henchman and his twin really gets mind-numbingly dull after hour 10.I finished this in 6 days (the original and Zero took me much longer) so I suggest you rent this if your not the obsessive RE collector type. While it is a great-looking game and very slick, it just didn't keep me as thrilled (or as scared) as it could have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2005"}

After knowing the problems overheating could cause, I decided to make a small investment and get one. I was skeptical at first, after hearing bad things about the previous Nyko cooler, but this one seems to be the good one.This fan just attaches right onto the back of the console, and the good thing is that it has its own power source, which you can plug into a power strip or any power outlet etc. The fan has two big fans and one small one. The cool thing about this fan is that you don't have to turn it on or off. Once you turn on your 360, about 10-20 seconds later it will turn on by itself, then once you turn off your 360 it will turn off anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute.After having my 360 on for at least an hour, I felt the back, and felt the top and bottom and I noticed a pretty good difference in how hot it was. I will tell you right now, it is definitely not a drastic change, but hey, 5 degrees cooler in one part of the console is better than nothing right?! Getting this is a good investment and I recommend this to anyone who plays hours on end a day, and wants to make sure they're 360 stays as cool as possible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"John","summary":"My Favorite Game of All Time!","reviewText":"Kingdom hearts was my favorite game to play on the ps2 growing up and is still my all time favorite game ever! I was never a fan of final fantasy but KH had a little taste of it with some final fantasy characters mixed with Disney, quite the combination. And being able too play a game that had Disney characters was very fun and I did not feel stupid playing it.This is no ordinary Disney related game though. KH has everything, story, characters, and gameplay which all get a perfect score of 10 out of 10. How you become emotionally involved in the main character's life Sora is amazing which no other game has ever really done for me. Playing from world to world as Sora along with his friends Donald and Goofy, exploring different classic Disney worlds based on the Disney movies going through the amazing story with each unique Disney character. All along in the story Sora is trying to find his childhood friends and King Mickey and trying to stop the heartless from taking over the worlds and by defeating Ansem who wanted to control kingdom hearts using darkness. But most of all Sora really was trying to find and save the girl he loves, Kairi, from the heartless that stole her heart.I remember never being able to beat the game when I was little, but now when I recently got a new ps2 slim and got Kingdom hearts again, I was finally able to beat the game and watch the ending, I was so happy! Then after you beat the game then you can go back and find the missing items and beat the different coliseum trials to be able to get 100% completion of the game to unlock the secret ending at the end. Plus you will feel like a badass getting the Ultima Keyblade and beating the platinum match at the coliseum.Looking back I realized this game really is not meant for little kids. I loved playing it when I was little but it was a lot harder for me and I did not take the game a seriously as I did now. For the haters that say the game is meant for little kids to play, it really is not. I would say for older teenagers and adults, plus to be even able to understand the entire story. I will always cherish this game and am very happy it was part of my childhood. If you have never played this game before I do not know how you are even functioning at all.Plus Kingdom Hearts is my favorite game soundtrack, so beautiful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}

Soul Calibur II really is a marvel to behold; fluid animation, beautiful scenery, orchestrated music, perfect sound effects, and deep gameplay.The X-Box version, for my money, is the best one.  It has the best graphics, the shortest load times, and the coolest character.  Yeah, Link has a bigger fan base but Spawn is just more of a badass, and that's the kind of character I want in Soul Calibur II.When all is said and done however, what you have here is more of the same from the previous game.  There are a few new characters but only three of them are fundamentally unique, including Spawn.  The arenas now have walls which the fighters can be slammed up against.  A new Weapon Master Mode replaces the Adventure Mode from Soul Calibur in which most of the hidden stuff can be unlocked (Weapon Master is a little easier than Adventure was, thank God).  There's a larger variety in costumes and weapons for the characters, overall.  Inexplicably, the Gallery pictures in Soul Calibur II are actually far fewer than in Soul Calibur!  And that's it for differences between the two games.  I would have liked to see more innovation in Soul Calibur II but I had too much fun playing to care.The only real problem I have with the game is the females.  Their costumes show way too much skin and certain body parts \"jiggle\" if you know what I mean.  If I want to see that kind of thing I'll play Dead Or Alive.  There's enough sexual suggestiveness everywhere else, I don't need it in Soul Calibur II, thanks.Fortunately the pros far outweigh the cons.

I checked the ratings and was not sure we would like this game. Unlike many other Sonic games, this game was full of gunplay violence and offensive language. It's more like Grand Theft Auto.However, I'm glad we did play this game. Despite the violence and the offensive language, it's neat to meet Black Doom, the leader of the jet black and crimson aliens. Shadow is brought back to life, but can't remember his past, so Black Doom tells him, \"Shadow, find the seven chaos emeralds, and bring them to me as promised.\" Shadow is not sure whom he trusts, so it's up to you to decide.

Single player campaign was nothing more than a your typical Hollywood action flick with all action all the time. Needless to say, it got old very quick and the story was impossible to follow with your typical unbelievable ending. Multiplayer while better than single player suffered from lame perks that people abused and required no skill to use. Commando/lightweight (i.e. teleport) was possibly the cheapest perk combo in that game. The game also suffered from bullets curving around the corner a horrible spawn system that just turned this game into a camp fest. I really didn't mind the camping because I understood why people did it. I mean who wants to have someone spawn right behind and shoot them in the back every 3 seconds?Enter Call of Duty Black Ops, a game that looked good on TV but based on my previous experience, I was not sure about the game and after having this game for about a week, I can honestly say my apprehensions about this game were valid but not in the areas I expected.The goodCampaign mode is much improved this time around. While it seemed like it would end up just being a non-stop action fest during the first few missions, things really started getting good after getting to the Vietnam missions. The story is written better and is easier to follow for the most part, but the flashbacks can be a little distracting. But I can say for a fact that I really got addicted to the single player mode.Online play has many improvements; first of all many of the lame and cheap perks from MW2 are GONE! This means no more commando/lightweight users, no excessive noob tube damage, and no impossible kills from all the way across the screen. In addition there is no more stacking of kill streaks, meaning any kills you get from your kill streak rewards will NOT count towards your kill streak. Because of this you can no longer sit back and let your kill streaks do all the work if you want to get your higher rewards. I was guilty of this in MW2 but I welcome this change in BO and should help to cut down on camping. This also ensures that the more powerful kill streaks rewards (11 is the highest you can get now) will be a rare occurrence which makes for good balance. The spawning system has little improvement but still people will spawn right behind you, but from what I experienced this game is not as bad as MW2. (ummm, scratch this, see my update at the end of this review)New system for weapon upgrades. Instead of having to get 6 million headshots to get a new camo for your gun or attachment, you now have to buy your upgrades with money you earn during your matches. I love this change as in MW2 I became too caught up on completing challenges to get weapon upgrades which in turn forced me to use a particular weapon for all of my matches and it became more of a chore than anything. There are many ways to earn money, but I won't go into them here.Combat training mode is an excellent way for you to practice multiplayer with computer controlled opponents and teammates with customizable game options like time limit and score. You can select the difficulty level and compete in either TDM or FFA on all online maps. In addition you earn upgrades, ranking promotions just like you would online except they don't carry over to online play. I didn't think this mode would be much fun, but it is and is also a good way to try out and practice all the kill streak rewards (if you stay alive long enough) without the pressure or frustration online.The badWith all the improvements in both single player and multiplayer mode the negatives greatly hurt the overall quality of this game.The graphics and sound are a noticeable huge step back from MW2 and even COD4. This does not look like a current gen game, and people who both like and dislike this game all agree the graphics are not up to par with what is currently out on the next gen systems. Many times I have found myself comparing this game's visuals to the graphics of my XBOX (the first one) wondering which one was better. Sound also takes a step back from the previous COD titles, as I have said in many of my comments, all explosive devices sound exactly the same, and the guns themselves just sound a little bit underpowered. While the graphics and sound issues didn't bother me too much on single player they did distract me on online play when it was coupled with the number 1 problem with this game.....ONLINE LAG.While MW2 had MANY problems with online play, LAG was rarely an issue I encountered, this is no longer the cause with BO. Out of all the time I had this game, I only had two or three matches that lag was minimal and this was at 2 in the morning. The rest of my many matches suffered debilitating lag so much that many times I would just quit the game in frustration because it's impossible to kill someone when they are teleporting all over the screen. Even the menu to get to online play is quirky; many times I had to press the \"Playstation Network\" option on the multiplayer screen multiple times JUST to get into the lobby. Then when I get there the only thing that is guaranteed is a laggy online experience. After the second day of putting up with this, I gave up online play altogether and played Combat training, because I just found online play well....unplayable. All of the great improvements to multiplayer are completely ruined by the lag which is a shame.Single player is much improved but multi-player overall is a huge step back even with the improvements that were implemented. I am glad I rented this game, because multiplayer is what makes games like these worth the cost. But when I can't even play multi-player why would I pay full price for it? I may end up getting this game eventually, but not until the price comes down considerably because unless they find a fix for their online mode, there is no way I'm playing this game online.My suggestion RENT before you buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

There are a multitude of one player and multiplayer modes, including a team battle mode, arcade mode, Weapons master (story) mode, time battle mode (same as arcade mode, except without continues), and a practice mode.While playing the game, you will rapidly aquire new characters (usually through weapons master mode), new weapons (bought with gold from any mode), new outfits (bought), arenas (Weapons Master), character profiles (complete arcade mode with each character), and more.  This adds a little incentive to play each mode many times, something that many fighting games don't have.Each character has a different fighting style which is easy to learn but hard to master (how cliche), such as Nightmare, who uses huge swords, Raphael, the fencer, Voldo, who uses claws, and even Necrid, who manifests the weapons and attacks of other characters, and Charade, who takes the form of a random character at the start of battle (great for keeping a human opponent on their toes).If you're a fan of fighting games, you should definately give this one a 'stab', especially now, with its great price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2004"}

Super Mario All-Stars will blow you away-that is if you can find it anywhere. This game includes 4 awesome games...Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 2, Super Mario Brothers 3, and the Lost Levels.Super Mario Brothers is the same as the debut Mario game on the Nintendo. It is the easiest of the Mario games, but is certainly still fun.Super Mario Brothers 2 is a lot more fun and enhanced. You chose to be Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess. Unlike the other Mario games the enemies aren't koopa's and you don't pick get mushrooms, feathers, or fireballs, but instead you get cherries and hearts to get your health back. You still can get mushrooms, but you need to jump on them and pick them up.Super Mario 3 is even more advances and is personally my favorite of the Mario games. You play as Mario and Luigi in a really cool game. The only problem is after you lose a life they send you all the way back to the beginning of the world then you have to walk all the way back using just one path. The game is a lot better in a few ways. There are several bosses on pirate ships and many cool bonuses like playing card games or memory to get frog suits, feathers, beaver furs and more. You also open up treasure chests a few times every level to get the stuff you need.The Lost Levels are extra levels that were never included in any Mario game. This is the hardest game on Super Mario All-Stars, but will prove to be a fun challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000JLIYLC","reviewerName":"Bobby  W.","summary":"Old game, but still looks good and it's fun to play","reviewText":"Been picking up some older PS3 games lately, and I only had one racing game (GT5), and saw that this one got good reviews.Motorstorm has an off-road theme, and though there are a limited number of tracks, there are multiple ways to navigate each one, and different routes are optimized for the different vehicle types available to you. In addition to this you are competing against other drivers, and they don't have nearly the same manners as the drivers in GT5, i.e., mayhem is encouraged.Even though this game dates back to 2007, the graphics are very nice looking (crashing has never been so enjoyable), and the vehicle controls are pretty easy to get the hang of, though you only have two configurations to choose from (accelerator is either R2 in the standard configuration, or the X button in the alternate configuration - would have been nice to have more controller configurations or customization, because I keep wanting to use R1 for acceleration). I really do like the steering options in this game though - you can use the left stick, the direction buttons, or the controller's motion sensors to steer, and your vehicle responds well in all cases.The main issues people seem to have with this game are load times and smallish number of tracks (courses)available.  Yes, the game does take a while to load up. As for variety, there may only be a few tracks, but the conditions of a track will not be the same twice - a track can deteriorate over time, as a race progresses - spots can get muddier, parts can fall off vehicles, and other debris can get in your way. Actually, I like getting to know my way around a track really well, yet not knowing if a favorite spot will have a sudden challenge due to a wreck/rolling barrel.There are some interesting songs on the playlist (they even have a Reverend Horton Heat tune in there), and you can mute the music if it's not to your taste.Anyway, this game is a blast to play and you can pick it up for a good price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"An amazingly brilliant dystopian role playing shooter","reviewText":"Published in 2007 by 2K Games and Developed by Irrational Games (formerly 2K Boston), Bioshock is a first-person role-playing shooter with survival horror elements in which you play as an oceanic plane crash survivor named Jack.  Set in an alternate and fictional 1960, Jack finds himself in a dystopian underwater city called Rapture where political turmoil, smuggling and genetic experimentation has caused the society to collapse into madness.  The cities environment is overrun with insane genetically altered humans, robotic drones, projectile turrets and hostile camera systems. Jack must survive long enough and discover the mysteries of Rapture in order to escape with his life.  Here are my thoughts on the incredibly unique and engaging masterpiece that is Bioshock;Pros+ Extremely original and engaging story.+ Gorgeous graphics, especially for a 2007 title.+ Amazingly well done voice acting across the board.+ Plenty of different weapon types, ammo and upgrades to choose from.+ Hauntingly eerie score by Garry Schyman fits the game like a glove.+ Ability to freely travel back to any previously explored areas.+ Emotional choices (right or wrong) really give a sense of feeling while playing.+ Beautiful art deco designed environments.+ Numerous and unique spell-like (plasmids) RPG upgrades. Natural Camouflage and Enrage were two of my favorites.+ Enemy/Item research and crafting system.+ Fast paced, frantic and well balanced combat system.+ Grim and foreboding setting.+ Vendor machine hacking system to get lower prices and other benefits.+ Ability to change the games difficulty setting at any time.+ 40+ hours of gameplay with good replay value.+ Non-linear gameplay for a FPS.+ Simple quest arrow always points you in the proper direction of your next objective.+ Save anywhere, anytime (with only a few cut-scene storyline exceptions).+ Randomly respawning enemies help in replenishing money, items and ammo.+ 30+ vintage music recordings from the 1940's and 1950's that lend themselves perfectly to the atmosphere of the game.Cons- Controls can take some getting used to.- Scripted enemies often made things too foreseeable.- Photography research should have been available from the beginning in order maximize your skill bonuses.- Ending was a bit too easy and rather predictable.- Vita Chambers gave you no penalty for death. (Note - you can turn them off in the options menu.)- A few technical issues to tackle after installation (no sound and resolution save issues).- Retail versions of the game use DRM/SecureRom.- Maps can be a bit confusing to read and navigate.- Environment of being at the bottom of the ocean in a dangerously collapsing city wasn't utilized nearly enough.  Huge potential wasted in my opinion.- A lot of NPC story dialogue to keep track of.  This can be confusing at times.- No Sprint key.Bioshock was easily one of the most original, artistic and entertaining games I've played in years.  The levels and environments were beautifully designed which really brought the watery city of Rapture to life.  The city itself is populated with unique and sinister enemies who consistently provide challenging combat sequences.  All characters, enemies and testimonial recordings are accompanied by flawless voice acting.  The storyline hooks you quickly and leaves you eager to discover both the history of mysteries of Rapture as well as wanting to uncover your past.  Bioshock stands as a shining example of combining of all the right elements to provide a gaming experience like no other.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}

Online activation requirement and limited installs... the whole shebang. They keep on released these rental equivalents even though we, the customers, complain about it constantly here on Amazon and other places. This anti-customer attitude is appalling. In a few words, you don't get to actually own your copy of the game, but instead you get an install/time limited rental.Second, this game does not have a save-anywhere feature. Instead, it uses with a checkpoint based system. This is quite peculiar because the PC version of the first Riddick game did, in fact, have this feature (and I didn't see anyone complain about it for them to remove it. Instead, devs were praised for it.).Save anywhere is an essential feature to any first-person adventure (and also RPG or RTS games), and the lack of it here simply portrays the laziness of the developers. There is no excuse for not incorporating a save anywhere function on the PC.Stay away from this game. Instead please buy the original Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay (PC version).

Lethal","summary":"good story telling, flawed controls","reviewText":"I have completed the game once and enjoyed it enough to play it again to make different choices and see how things change.The graphics in this game are far from impressive but good enough to convey everything clearly and still be immersive.  The voice acting is above average and the sound effects are merely decent, in particular gunshots sound very fake.  There are plenty of reminders that it's a budget title but nothing game breaking.The control scheme is where this game needlessly hurts itself.  Whenever it's time to do something a reticle appears onscreen with the four directional buttons to choose an action (most of the time you only have one or two options to choose from).  You have to use the right analog stick to move the reticle over something and you routinely get only a few seconds to do so before something bad triggers.  On numerous occasions I died just because it's hard to aim, and because it's inherently awkward to aim with the right stick and push a button on the d-pad rather than use the left stick and face buttons.  You can use the face buttons instead but that obviously means moving your thumb off the right stick and being unable to aim.  It's awkward and inexcusable and it leads to a lot of frustration that never had to happen.The game asks you to look around the room a lot yet is actually very linear.  I repeatedly got stuck for a bit trying to figure out what the game wanted me to do to push things forward.  Half the time when you choose what to say it doesn't seem apparent that it makes an actual difference.  There are these little notices in the corner of the screen like \"Kenny will remember you said that\" but several times in the game I had decided who I did or didn't trust yet couldn't act on it.  You're always waiting for the game to prompt you and then choosing from a limited set of reactions rather than ever having the option to take control and just confront someone when you want to.  I will say they do a good job giving you at least some reason to doubt you can rely on anyone around you, forcing tough choices on who to side with when group members bicker, and they bicker a lot.Overall this game is worth the $20 I paid to download, but definitely has its flaws.  You shouldn't be afraid to buy it but I do think it has been overhyped a bit considering the number of times the controls got me killed (at least you never have to replay much when you die, the game reloading no more than a couple minutes earlier).  BTW, you can shoot with the R1 button, something they don't even bother to tell you until about two thirds through the game.  I'd easily give this 4 stars if the controls had been better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

Graphics, sound, story, and gameplay were all very well done. When I first read about the VATS targeting system I thought it might bring the game down but I'm happy to say VATS works very well and is a crucial part of surviving the Wasteland. As far as character growth goes, there's a decent selection. You can decide if you want your character to be melee (spiked knuckles, iron bars, baseball bats), big guns (missile launchers, mini guns, flamethrowers), or small guns (AKs, sniper rifles, shotguns), and choose different skills such as lockpicking, sneaking, hacking (Science), speech. Character creation is fun and pretty diverse.My only beef with this game is the low level cap. You can only take your character to level 20 unless you get the \"Broken Steel\" downloadable content which will allow you to take your character up to level 30. Still pretty low but I have to give this five stars now. The amount and quality of downloadable content is incredible and there's even more coming!

Well, get ready to do them again, only this time through the eyes of a stapled on rookie-new-guy. Basically the entire plot of both movies is rehammered into the mold of a video game, with a sufficient amount of entertaining banter and filler material to make a decent sized game.The story line, if you haven't guessed from my barely concealed sarcasm, is rather unimagniative and pedantic, and feels more like a massive fan service than an attempt to do something new. This is offset by entertaining levels, enemies and sub-text that's good for a chuckle and combat, that, while on easy at least, is just hard enough to not feel like  a cop-out, but fast enough to not be overly grindy. Combat is a fairly generic rinse and repeat with regards to ghosts, but the game manages to mix it up enough that you're still kept somewhat on your toes rather than just hitting the same buttom combination over and over.There are quite a few annoying nits. You're constantly reminded to not cross the streams, but no matter how many times you do, nothing happens. The characters helpful hints are at times to rapid fire to pay attention to, and not appropriately timed when your trying to dodge a golem made of burning coals. The bloom from your beams can make seeing much of anything next to impossible, especially when your two teammates are focused on the same target. Moving in combat is hard and unwieldy at times, and makes many enemy attacks hard to spot, let alone dodge.But, as my heading says, the game is competent, and most importantly, fun. While I'm still scratching my head that they just didn't cycle you through the actual characters rather than have you in a suit marked \"Occupant #5,\" the separation from the storyline is only as deep as you let it be. The finding sub-mission and the ghost analysis compliment the normal pace and flow of the game, and serve as nice side tidbits between ghost wranglings.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Uncreative, repetative, waves of enemies and lame run and gun","reviewText":"Resistance 2 is the sequel to Resistance: Fall of Man.  It takes place, I think, in the future where an alien race has assaulted planet Earth.  Apparently they have the ability to make people into their race, or something.  I don't really know, as the plot is very uninteresting and mostly inconsequential.  You play some guy, a \"Sentinel\", which means something special, but I don't know what.  As you can tell I didn't play the first one, so maybe this is all stuff I should already know.  Regardless, it all seems very generic and super thin on plot.  I have not played in multi-player, as I have no interest.  Apparently this is where the game shines, or so I'm told.  I'll never know because it is unlikely I'll ever put it back in the tray.The environments are pretty stunning in some places, the graphics pretty good, and the sound very rich.  The gun variety is lacking...  most of the time you will have the same weapon, or whatever weapon you have ammo for.  Since you can only carry two weapons at a time you'll be forced to dump weapons in trade for whatever you can find that has ammo.  Apparently this passes as strategy.There have definitely been a few fun parts, here and there.  Some parts where the chaos of battle is thick and you are running around, immersed.  Most of the time the game involves cheap one-hit kills or times of nothing followed by a massive wave of enemies.  Rinse, dry, repeat.  While there is variety in enemies, there isn't much variety in game play.  Yes, the game hits all the standard FPS style levels:  Open space with big combat, open space with big bad guy, enclosed space with low lights and is kind of spooky, enclosed space with lots of bad guys, one on one \"big boss\" battles, desolate towns, and alien spaceships.  All very generic.My biggest complaint with the game is that it devolves into \"Serious Sam\" style game play.  You'll, essentially, round the corner to find a gigantic pile of bad guys who want nothing more than to kick-start your face with their massive arsenal of weaponry.  You'll do lots of running in circles trying to track and kill waves of spidery things, packs of flying drones, waves of zombie-like-rip-off things, and big dudes with player-seeking missiles.  It gets old, and in my opinion is the mark of poor level design.  Checkpoint, walk a bit, massive swam of bad guys, checkpoint.I'm not entirely sure what I expected when I got this game, but I was certainly surprised at the poor quality of this game.  Graphics only go so far, and a good concept isn't worth anything if it is executed poorly.  Resistance 2 wouldn't be a bad rental, or even on discount -- but at full pop, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2009"}

I've only been playing it for a week or so.  I love westerns.  I love shooters.  I love poker.  I love open world games.This is the most fun game I've played so far.  It is not a great shooter.  Hell no.  Modern Warfare 2 still holds that title.  I would say that this is like GTA on horse-back, but I really didn't like GTA, so I can't say that.  It's not an intense game, it's a fun game that you play as fast & intense or as slow and laid back as you want.You can pretty much play it however you like.  And I do.  Yea, try that with \"Modern Warfare\" or \"Gears\".  I tend to go kill enough stuff to make enough money to be able to play more poker.The controls are typical Rockstar - Meaning: they ARE NOT smooth and balanced.  Typical GTA style - weird and unbalanced.  I keep thinking that if Rockstar could combine their open world with a great first person shooter like \"Modern Warfare 2\" or \"Frontlines : Fuel of War\" or \"Rainbow Six: Vegas\" or \"Gears of War\" then WOW, that would be the game of all games.Like I said, so far so good.  And so far, the funnest game yet.  I have played far more intense games and games that required a lot more attention.  This game is just plane fun.  Many times I just play a few missions, make some money and then give the controller to my wife so she can go play poker for awhile.  Wow, a game that you and your wife can both play....and not necessarily at the same time ;-)UPDATE Dec, 2010:  Finished the campaign.  Fantastic game.  Tried a little of the on-line play; can't locate other players.  No biggie as I hardly play on-line, but am surprised at the lack of on-line players.  The campaign is awesome.

I did play through the original Half Life, and its difficulty (especially in the later stages) was a bit of a turn-off. Personally, I think that when the game practically necessitates cheating to complete it, it's a bit too much. That said, seeing this bundle on the store shelf was a bit too good of a deal to pass up, so I picked it up.First impressions on the game design- the physics is more heavily involved in gameplay than in any other shooter before or since. In fact, in many cases the gameplay seems to FOCUS on the physics, not on killing enemies. To underscore this, you can actually finish most of the game with only the gravity gun, which (except in rare cases) can't kill anything directly but can pick up objects to throw at enemies. This is an interesting departure from the norm, but there are times when I think they took it a bit too far. Typically, you'll start off killing enemies and will have the normal frantic bursts of action, but you'll eventually run into a puzzle. These are usually something as simple as a locked door or elevator, and you simply (or not) have to open it or turn it on. Most of the puzzles can be figured out given a reasonable amount of effort on the player's part, but there are a few that will undoubtedly frustrate to the point where you simply look it up. I guess this is fine, so long as you aren't highly averse to cheating in such a fashion. I will say, when you do get where you're going, you do feel a sense of accomplishment at having figured it out.The game's graphics are pretty good even for now, and voice acting is well done. The environments are well made and look realistic in a sort of grim alien/post-apocalyptic style. It's nothing that will blow you away after seeing next-gen titles, but it's none too shabby either. Additionally, the episodes feature graphic improvements. If you have bought a machine anytime in the last 3-4 years, chances are it'll run smoothly at max settings. The game is quite stable as well, though it doesn't seem to like being minimized. One thing to note is that the game does take quite a while to start up and has occasional- and sometimes rather jarring- load pauses. These usually take place in a featureless corridor, and I found that after a while I could tell when it was about to stop to load.The original HL2 is generally a good story and great pace, save for one glaring thing. There are two sequences where you're driving a vehicle around, and it's my opinion (and most I've mentioned it to agree) that these are just WAY too long. It's almost as if the developers were justifying the time they spent making the vehicles work by stretching out these sequences to a ridiculous length. Some other interesting notes are that allies are somewhat useful now, and the variety of enemies is enough that they don't get overly repetitive. Particularly, there is a point where you get to command an endless horde of weak critters to overwhelm a horde of enemies (fortunately, not endless), which is one of the highlights of the game.The episodes (1 and 2) more or less follow the same style of the original. You lose all your weapons at the start of each one, which is rather irritating, and they aren't especially long installments. They largely serve to drive the plot along, which is actually getting interesting enough that I'm looking forward to the finale. You spend most of your time with Alyx backing you up, which is good if you hate being lonely, but somewhat of a shift in gears from the core game where you're largely solo. There are a few surprises and new enemies along the way, and enough new environments to make things fun.Additionally, this package comes with Team Fortress and Portal, which are a multiplay shooter and puzzle game respectively. I haven't looked into either extensively since I largely bought this pack to get the Half Life content, but it's a nice bonus.The only big gripe I have about the Orange Box is something that a lot of other people have complained about- specifically, Steam and the Valve DRM. If you don't have a live internet connection you CANNOT play any of the games since it needs to connect to Steam to authenticate you. Steam also performs updates whenever you launch, so patching is not optional and can eat into your game time when you don't particularly want it to. There were times when I was playing some online game, my internet died, and I figured to just play some HL2 instead... and after a few minutes sitting on the 'Now loading...' prompt I remembered it wasn't going to work either. This, like many other aspects of Half Life 2, is different from any other shooter out there- but not in a pleasant way. Personally, I don't see why it can't authenticate once in 3 launches, or even every other launch. Even that would be preferable to the way it is now.All in all, the Orange Box is a great value if you haven't already bought HL2 or Episode 1. I'd hesitate to say it's a 'great' value for Episode 2 alone, but this is also available separately on Steam if you already have the rest. For those who haven't tried the core game, it's a lot of fun and good game time for the price, and unlike most new shooter releases you probably won't have to upgrade your PC to run it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Kiplerr \"Kill first, ask questions never\"","summary":"Dinoslaughter","reviewText":"Dinosaurs, Weapons and annoying side characters.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A great story that spans across the universe","reviewText":"After taking on the \"Star Wars\" universe with the Xbox game \"Knights of the Old Republic\", seems developer Bioware wanted to get in on the space-faring, race-conversing, quest-taking type with their own universe and they went all out as their next big project, \"Mass Effect\" has a long-reaching mythos and detail that is quite impressive. Bioware has always been known for being excellent storytellers and this game is one of the top stories on the next-gen consoles not because it's rather simplistic but because it's so compellingly written that it does have a \"wonder what'll happen next?\" feeling about it. The gameplay on the other hand works but then it could've needed refinement and is one of those games that works despite the flaws it has.Story: In the year 2183, Mankind has been able to get further into space exploration thanks to a cache of technology discovered on Mars. Now able to land on other planets and encounter other races, they mainly work out of the massive space station known as the Citadel which houses the Council, the main governing force of known citadel space and Spectres,  elite agents who can get through government red tape and rules to get the job done. But when Saren, one of the top Spectres, goes rogue and allies himself with the malevolent synthetic race known as the geth, it's up to Commander Shepard to travel all over the galaxy to bring him to justice and stop what he's planning.Graphics: Here's where it gets dodgy since graphics can be divided into 2 categories: the look, or aesthetic, and the performance which is framerate, slowdown, screen tearing and such.  On the looks side, Mass Effect is incredibly detailed, great cinematics and photorealistic characters. But then again the framerate gets very chuggy when more than several enemies and powers are on-screen, areas load in the middle of play and textures will arrive seemingly one at a time but then again the Unreal Engine usually has this problem. From a looks standpoint, this game is very impressive but there are quite a few performance details that knock it down.Sound/Music: The soundtrack to Mass Effect largely consists of space-y synth music, akin to what you'd hear in 80's sci-fi movie soundtracks. It's not that the music is bad mind you it's just that it's somewhat forgettable, working fine in-game but disappearing from your head in the next area. However the voice acting is top-notch with actors such as Family Guy's Seth Green, Star Trek TNG's Marina Sirtis, Lance Henrikson and the Arbiter himself, Keith David. The male and female Shepard's also do a good job with their roles and it does avoid the Bethesda problem of having soundalikes for NPC's.Gameplay: The bulk of Mass Effect is conversations where you'll talk to almost everybody. Responses can range from helpful and appreciative to downright beligerant and nasty. This can affect parts of the game as diffusing a situation can add some paragon, or good, points whereas being confrontational but actually lead to a full blown fight. Though they are times where the good side has a strange end to the conversation and you're like \"this is supposed to be a good thing?\" Some of the sidequests also follow this such as one you'll run into where you have to save a crazy woman from killing herself. To be helpful, you have to gain her trust, step closer to her and give her a sedative so she can use it on herself. However if you want to get rough, you can just force it on her or if you're particularly brutal, just ask a sniper to shoot her. It helps to have the choice too unlike say Fallout 3 where it was really \"be the softiest saint in the wasteland or the most evil son of a ***** ever\", you can be nice to one person and tell somebody else to shut their mouth. Got to love a system that does that.For the actual gameplay aspect of the game, it's a 3rd-person shooter RPG where you and 2 others run through different terrains and buildings and fight enemy soldiers. The d-pad gives you the option to tell your teammates to take cover, regroup, advance to a specific location or concentrate fire on a target you select. Sometimes I'll press regroup repeatedly and they're nowhere to be seen but generally they're quite helpful. Guns in the game work differently in that you don't have ammo but rather the gun overheats, requiring a few seconds to cool down. Keep firing and it's no good but it's good we don't have to search everywhere just to find that one clip of ammo for that one gun we need to use. It's decent shooting and slightly fun though continuously pausing the game to press LB (weapon changes for the team) or RB (biotics...magic, if you will) kind of breaks the game's flow.One other part that is unfortunately my least favorite is when you pilot a vehicle called a Mako and travel a planet's surface to get somewhere, find things to salvage or shoot either small geth soldiers and turrets or massive worms. These sidequests are frequently short, repetitive and the Mako drives incredibly poorly but to fully explore the Mass Effect universe you have to drive these things so it's one of those \"if I have to\" type of deals. That being said there's quite a few planets, some good incentives to look all over the galaxy and they're quite brief so they're not that bad.Mass Effect's achievements encourage multiple playthroughs which is a good thing because this is a fun game to go through more than once. If you can get past the nagging graphical issues, you'll see Mass Effect is one of the best games you can own for the 360.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"Epic would be insignificant in comparison.","reviewText":"\"Mass Effect\" is not a video game.  Football is a game, checkers is a game, ping pong is a game, \"Pac-man\" is a game, and yes \"Halo\" is a game.  But this is nothing less than pure, cinematic, interactive fiction containing all of the depth, detail, lore, discovery, and character of the greatest science fiction epics of all time.  \"Star Wars\", \"Star Trek\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Blade Runner\"; this is a story that nearly dwarfs them all in sheer size, scope, and enjoyment while paying homage to them along the way.  \"Mass Effect\" is not an action-based game but a massive story that you help write as you go along based on your personal choices.  Sure, there is plenty of very satisfying gunplay along the way, but it is mostly a means to an end rather than the primary focus.The story of \"Mass Effect\" is quite possibly the most amazing ever written for a video game, recalling many of the best elements from some of the greatest works of the sci-fi genre and putting you in an almost \"Oblivion\"-like level of control over the world. You could spend dozens of hours simply exploring unknown worlds and building your fortune that way while shirking the main story altogether if you choose.  But if you don't have all the time in the universe to enjoy this one, the main story is not too long.  In fact, I honestly wish it were much longer, but that was the sacrifice made for the open-ended freedom of exploration the player is given.  One will most likely spend upwards of 50 hours just exploring the galaxies and discovering all of the tiny stories within the story that really flesh this universe out.  Plus, there are many different ways to play the game which will command you to replay it over again just to see all of the what-if's and enjoy mastering all of the various class skills.  \"Mass Effect\" also revels in making you face the tough decisions, forcing you to use you own personal morality to make choices that will effect the way characters in the game will look at you.  And the many races of the intergalactic Council are watching you closely as a representative of humanity adn this will impact the game.  What are the ethics behind genocide of a species that may, in time, become a real threat to civilized life?  You decide.  How about murder for revenge?  Taking bribes?  The safety of the intergalactic community against human lives?  These are just a few of the issues you may face and have to think about before you press that button and possibly change the universe forever.Gameplay could not be better.  The combat is real-time and apes the realistic feel \"Gears of War\" while retaining the skill system used in Bioware's previous classic \"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\".  Speaking of KOTOR, this game plays very closely to that previously untouchable work.  All of the familiar gameplay and story elements are present, but almost all are improved, especially the combat.  The real time shooting is a little hectic at first, but as you and your character gain experience, you will soon have the skills and savvy to utilize the system and dominate rooms full of enemies.  The superhuman abilities include biotics, which are sort of like The Force, and tech skills which can include hacking an enemy's AI to attack it's teammates or overheating an opponent's weapon or shields.  The implementation of these skills can be key since many of the enemies are quite resourceful and strong.  Shall you use biotics to lift a foe from behind his cover so you can ventilate him at your leisure or just create a vortex to suck them all up into one whirling shooting gallery?  Maybe I'll just terrorize the lot of them with my one-shot-one-kill sniping skills while my teammates provide cover.  The options are only as limited as your imagination.  The only complaints from me is that your squadmates can't be controlled individually (you can't send your heavy gunner forward while keeping your tech expert behind cover; both respond to the same command) and the grenades (while awesome and upgradable) are kind of clunky to use.  The characters of KOTOR and Bioware's last game \"Jade Empire\" also had a lot more charm and humor to them and a lot more to say in between missions, it seems.  I guess that's the price to pay for a less linear game. But then again, there is a lot of random dialogue between all of the combinations of characters here that help make up for it.  For example, while your party waits in an elevator they will often have brief but personal conversations with one another.  The dialogue for cutscenes and missions also changes based on who you brought along.  This is a very nice touch.  Exploring planets in your Mako ATV is also a blast, reminiscent of driving a Warthog in \"Halo\" but with much rougher terrain and jet boosters that can send you flying.  Awesome.I could go on and on about the hundreds of things that make this \"game\" the greatest of it's kind.  It's nearly as large but more accessible than \"Oblivion\", more action-packed than \"Knights of the Old Republic\", and has an even better story than \"Halo\" and stands on it's own not as a game but as a definitive sci-fi experience.  In my book, that makes this the best next-gen single-player game there is and one of the greatest things I've ever played.  The best part?  It's the first of a trilogy.  The mind boggles at the possibilities.  Buy it.  Now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"\"neomurtle\"","summary":"Foggy atmosphere and storyline, but a great game altogether","reviewText":"The Silent Hill series has been often thought of as Konami's answer to Capcom's Resident Evil games. While it is true that they share many similarities, Silent Hill has surpassed Resident Evil in it's disturbing environments and character design in my opinion. Silent Hill 2 has the same foggy, dingy, rust-filled atmosphere as the original, but with much clearer graphics and a different story. You play as James Sunderland, who receives a letter from his supposedly dead wife beckoning him to return to Silent Hill. The events that follow will pit you against bizarre enemies, puzzles, and confusing plot twists worthy of a Stephen King novel. The gameplay is still a bit slow and stiff, but Silent Hill 2 is more about delivering a terrifing experience than about action packed gameplay. The weapon roster remains realistic but formidable, ranging from a wooden board to a hunting rifle. The only obvious drawback is the multiple endings...none of them ever give a clear explanation as to what was really going on in the town (perhaps the player is intended to make their own conclusion). Other than that, Silent Hill 2 is a must buy for those who love the survival horror genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2002"}

E Jackson","summary":"excellent and so underrated- yes that's right, a popular game CAN be underrated","reviewText":"All the negative reviews are wrong.  There, I said it!I'm one of the few people who believes Echoes is significantly better than both the first AND third Metroid Prime games.  This is because -to name one reason- in Echoes the environments are more beautiful compared to the other games in the series.You see, in Echoes, you explore through light AND dark world themes (similar to the Super NES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past).  This is the concept of the entire game.To me this is absolutely fascinating.  It elevates the gameplay to greater and more interesting heights.  It honestly makes the game feel twice as big!  The only downside is that it's much easier to get lost this time around, but you have maps to help you along the way, so it's no big deal at all.In the original Metroid Prime, even though the envionments are obviously more varied with snow, fire and water themes, they aren't actually more fun.  It feels more like a brief teaser leading to the more interesting, lengthier, and better utilized environments featured in Echoes.I just want to say I absolutely LOVE the dark world areas in Echoes.  Every single area was created perfectly.  Great job Nintendo!You explore the same areas that you do in the light world (for the most part) however the atmosphere is incredibly creepier and lonelier in the dark world.  You really feel like you're all alone and can't escape.  It's awesome.  I never got the feeling of loneliness in the first and third Metroid Prime games (at least, 90% of the time I didn't).  I can't believe more people don't agree with me, come on!!In the dark world, you will frequently encounter these slithery black leach-like enemies that slide around on walls, floors and ceilings.  Their animations are beautifully created.  What makes them so spooky is the way you can see them sliding around and then suddenly APPEAR out of nowhere, catching you off-guard quite often.You can't attack them during the sliding around stage, so you have to wait for their bodies to become visible.The number one reason Echoes is such an incredibly addicting game (and in my opinion, significantly better than the other two in the series) is because of the boss fights.I've NEVER EVER experienced boss fights in a huge 3D world that continuously keep me completely entertained the entire way through.  From the moment a boss fight begins, you will be entirely addicted to the strategy of taking them down, I guarantee it.  Oh wait, people don't like this game.  Sorry, I can't guarantee it.Anyway, you WANT to search for their weak point because each time you face a boss, it's so addicting you want to learn more.  This is definitely a game where you make improvements each time you play it.  A perfect game to master.Anyway, the boss fights in Echoes completely blow away the ones from the other two Prime games, and they do so *very* easily.  The ones in this game provide challenge, interesting strategy, and total excitement every single time.  No inconsistency.  For every good boss fight in the other two Prime games, you get a mediocre one.  I love them to bits in Echoes.Another really scary and cool part of the gameplay (and the environments, for that matter) is when you encounter invisible space pirates!  You won't know WHERE they'll appear the first time around, and you're actually LOCKED in the room until they decide to go away on their own (or until you kill them, either one).Oh, and guess what?  Collecting energy tanks, missile expansions, and all the other items isn't nearly as frustrating this time around.  Collecting the same items in the first Metroid Prime nearly had me pulling my face off!Why so many people believe Echoes is the worst in the series will continue to baffle me until the day I die.  I seriously don't get it.  I'm not saying Echoes is flawless, but it's definitely less flawed than the other Prime games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Merryjuice \"Bukkake Boy\"","summary":"Three Months After Release: A Critical Review","reviewText":"Many MMOs are hyped the day of release by motivated players who are looking for a unique experience from World of Warcraft and will gladly point out the strengths of a title. Unfortunately, these are the same players who destroy content within a week only to complain there isn't enough content to keep them interested. My review looks at the game from the perspective of playing three months past release, in order to give a more balanced perspective of the different aspects of the game.- Graphics -If you played the first Guild Wars, the art style remains similar with about the same amount of graphical hiccups. The back end of the game isn't optimized, relying heavily on your video memory, with no SLI optimization. The beautiful graphics are stunning in town and certain areas, but the utility of this wears off in large scale battles which will tax your card to single fps numbers. There is no MSAA or after effects support beyond FXAA, and post processing will drop your frames by 20-30. Since release there hasn't been much of an update to what was initially offered, and town areas are incredibly taxing to your video card.- Classes -The original pitch of the class system in GW2 was that it eliminated the healer and tank requirements from the game. No matter what class you play in GW2, you have a heal. You can specialize your character to play a support role, which is basically a healer based on gear, however it isn't necessary. The irony of not having a healer wears off in instanced situations, where higher level content requires people to play \"support\" roles and others to soak up damage in a \"tank\" role. GW2 does a good job of hiding the need for class early on, but end game ends up requiring it later.  Thankfully, any class can play a support role, however, the usefulness of that support role depends on gearing. You will have to set up gear sets to remain an effective player.- Quest /Leveling -The game's unique feature is that it doesn't have a personal quest system. You simply run into an area with a \"heart\" icon on the map to fill up a meter to complete a quest. Its quite a novel system to use, however, the uniqueness wears off around the level 40 mark where these hearts are sparingly difficult to find. Thankfully there are mini-boss fights you and your friends can join in, and yield very decent rewards. Quest areas are also level capped, so going back through areas which are lower level wont garnish your experience too much.-PvP-There are options of traditional PvP which starts you at level 80 with items, or a World vs. World vs. World system which is a mosh pit of playing from your server that fight against others in node-capturing style play. The WvW can be daunting to play, especially if a server is incredibly good at capturing nodes. Thankfully server groups are switched every two weeks. Traditional PvP is done in an 8v8 format, and has a leveling system. The biggest annoying PvP feature is the \"kill system\" Guild Wars 2 has. If a player goes down, they can still attack players, until the opponent plants a flag on the downed character. The downed player can be resurrected as well. Planting a flag on the downed player takes three seconds. Matches which sometimes take seconds to finish can become long wars of attrition in larger World vs World matches because of this feature.- Social-While Guild Wars 2 seems like a fairly social game to play, playing with friends is poorly implemented. Friends cannot be spotted on the world map, and can easily be lost even in close proximity. This is partly due to the heavy phasing system the game implements. You can play with friends from other servers, however, it must be done on an overflow server. There is no quest queue either, leaving high-level daily quests and chat riddled with looking for group requests. Guilds which were originally the top-rated on servers are now mostly abandoned by their leaders, leaving players with over 300+ players, and 7 active members.- End Game-Probably the most disappointing feature of Guild Wars 2 is the lasting appeal of a max leveled character. Beyond the PvP aspects Guild Wars is famous for, there is little to no end-game content. Most is best described as dull and uninspiring. The lack of a healing class really shines in high-level content. Many times it ends up being corpse runs and trial-and-error mechanics rather than actual strategic movements and features. The end game ends up being a mash-up of World vs. World and PvP level grinding. If you enjoy these features, Guild Wars 2 will be fun for a while. For those that don't like button mashing and face rolling their keyboard over World battles, there is no long lasting appeal.-Overall-The lack of subscription fee makes up for some of the game's shortcoming, but it also doesn't excuse the poor social mechanics and end game which plague the true beauty of this game. While the servers originally teemed with players upon release, the release of the new World of Warcraft expansion has left those players who committed to the game with empty friend lists, and trying to structure new social scenes that carry active characters. This can be frustrating in of itself, as MMOs thrive on a good community that hosts events. Guild Wars 2 is fun at first, and does a good job at alternatively handling PvE leveling mechanics, but it doesn't offer a strong end game, which killed the large community it initially had. The item mall it carries gives true testament to how it plans on milking money from its small player base. Hopefully as months pass, a strong update and content drops will bring players back to explore the lands of Tyria, but months after the initial release, it remains to be seen.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

I think this is the only one that I have actually enjoyed. The Godfather does a pretty good job of emulating GTA, but has enough different aspects to keep it from being a complete copy-cat. You play as a no-name member of the Corleone family who has to work his way up through the ranks to eventually become the Don of New York. You have to extort businesses for protection money, carry out hit contracts, bribe cops, buy safehouses, rob banks, and take over rackets, warehouses, and other family compounds. In between all this, you get to carry out missions that brilliantly blend into the original Godfather movie. For example, you're assigned the job of beating up the two guys who assaulted the undertaker Bonasera's daughter. You're the guy who plants the gun behind the toilet for Michael Corleone and then drives his getaway car after he kills Solozzo and McCluskey.Driving control is pretty decent. Targeting is much better than the system used in GTA, although it still has a few glitches. The fighting controls were done very well. You can grab your enemy and use various combinations of the analog sticks to punch him, slam him against a wall, throw him across a room, or choke him to death.My biggest complaint about the game is that it is way too repetitive. One thing that was always nice about GTA is that the game world was so diverse. Not so in The Godfather. You never really feel like you know your way around the city because everything looks the same. Interiors are used over and over and over again, and the enemies are almost always in the same place, so it becomes fairly predictable. The five family compounds have the exact same layout. It would have been nice to see them put some more work into creating more original environments.Having said all this, there's about 30-40 hours worth of gameplay here. Granted, it starts to get pretty repetitive after 5-10 hours, but if you don't mind that, it is a pretty fun game otherwise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"A Lot Of Fun","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat is a game then upon it's birth became one of the main reasons for the teen rating system we have today. Its pure violence as you pummelled shocked the gaming world and sent parents into outrage. The violent scenes as you ommitted your characters specific fatality move on your oponent had those uptight parents fainting with shock. Because of this, it almost makes me sad to see how much this games violence has been toned down. If anything, the violence should have been pushed to even more brutal heights to make the experience more gruesome and fun. Over the past few years, preceding this particular edition MK much like other classic button mashing fighter games, they adopted the 3D platform with more complicated controls. Many old school fans didn't like this, which has led to a big change into the control system of this particular chapter.This instalment, as you can probably tell by the title pits MK legends against DC universe' finest. Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Captain Marvel, The Flash, Joker, Catwoman, Darkseid, Wonder Woman, Deathstroke & Lex Luthor for Team DC. Raiden, Liu Kang, Shang Tsung, Shao Khan, Baraka, Scorpion, Sub Zero, Kitana, Jax, Kano and Sonia for team Mortal Kombat. In regards to characters, if your favourite isn't there then don't fret as it's been confirmed that we should expect downloadable content which would include new characters, so there's a possibility your favourite may show up there. I'm personally hoping for Doomsday so I can kill Superman, in a classic comic book way and hopefully Bain.This isn't full of different modes, it's 3 very simple prospects to get your head around. There's the classic arcade mode where you take one character and fight your way through the ranks, ending with a really tough character who you will have to have a few goes at before you get that win. Kombo Challenge which is possibly the most difficult thing I've ever played on a game of this kind. Basically every character has the ability to perform a massive attack combo chain and this challenges you to perform that. Keep in mind the difficulty is due to the fact that it needs precise timing and accuracy in your movements, which can get a bit frustrating. Story Mode is the main aspect of this game and I'm sure is the main thing all fans will play first. It's split into two seperate stories, one being from the MK perspective and the other from the DC perspective. You enter into a number of different battles while the story explains exactly how the universes came together.I mentioned the game mechanics earlier and it's something I need to touch upon in more detail. This installment has gone a step back from the newly created 3D style of movement and gone back to it's 2D platform routes. Moving in a 3D fashion is still available making use of the analogue stick. They have now also introduced a number of minigames within a match such as Klose Kombat, Test your Might and free fall. Test your might enters you into a little test as you force your opponent through a number of walls and button mash to increase the damage level. Free Fallin is on the same level as that but you throw your opponent off an edge and jump after them, punching and kicking them as you both fall. I've not tried Klose Kombat so can't really comment on that particular feature just yet, but my review will be updated when I have.The effects are absolutely amazing and manage to effectively give both a cartoon feel and a realistic look to both MK and DC characters. Superman and Green Lantern looking most like their page counterparts and remaining loyal to their specific traits. Flash's moves are easily the coolest as you move at almost the speed of light to batter your opponent from every angle. The only problem I have with this is that Flash uses it to his advantage when he's your opponent and basically gives you no chance to get a hit in and before you know it you're dead. There are no real extra features and the online is pretty simple as you enter chatrooms and challenge people to a bout.All in all this is a very good game with a lot of fun to be had, though with very minimal unlockables it's already gotten tired for me and I'm now looking for the next best game which is unlikely to arrive until the new year. Probably the only reason I'll touch this again is when the DLC is available. Don't get me wrong it's a great game, it just gets really old really quickly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Great production, mixed execution","reviewText":"'Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword' has all the makings of a classic: a whimsical story, stylish graphics, item-customization and innovative uses of the wii motion controls. Unfortunately the execution of all these ideas is an equally fun and frustrating experience that falls short of Skyward Sword's ambitions.The plot of 'Skyward Sword' has some fun mixing and matching elements from previous Zelda games: Link (or whatever you want to name him) is training to become a knight in the cloud-land of Skyloft. He and his childhood friend, the princess Zelda get caught in a storm which knocks both unconscious and crashes Zelda in the land of Hyrule (the monster-infested \"ground\" world). Link, with the help of the sword-spirit Fi must go through trials in order to fulfill a prophecy, save his childhood friend and fight off the villain Ghirahim. 'Skyward Sword' is definitely epic (took me around 50 hours) with some great moments and plot-twists but it's also horribly over-written with a lot of text to click through whenever there's a conversation. Fi's dialogue was especially useless (and annoying).To be fair a big reason I don't like the dialogue in 'Skyward Sword' is because the graphics and animations are so expressive it renders conversations pointless! Their are some generic areas and unappealing uses of color (making Skyloft look like a bland version of Candyland then somewhere I'd want to explore) but there's so much personality given to the character designs and motions that I found the silent nods, smiles, blinking and general body-language more compelling than anything the characters were saying. This really should've been a dialogue-free game. The floaty, rounded designs of the graphics are also a nice touch, making up for the Wii's limited hardware.The controls, much like 'Skyward Sword's graphics and story are filled with good ideas that are hit-and-miss. Flying on Link's Loftwing is easily the most fun using the flapping motion of the wii-control to gain altitude. Combat-wise Link's right-arm is now in synch with the wii-remote whenever his sword is drawn. There's a slight-delay when swiping at enemies that requires a bit of trial and error (and more then a few recalibrations on my play-through)but was pretty satisfying once I adjusted (enemies themselves have a slight-delay too). Same goes for aiming the slingshot and bow. Using the Nunchuck for shield motions was a bit less successful (if it wasn't so useful I would've played with just a sword) and rolling and dodging felt twitchy. Again, none of this is anything that can't be adjusted to but in the later levels you really have to pay attention to your motions which became more of a chore than anything fun.Obviously I don't think 'Skyward Sword' is the classic Zelda game it wants to be but it's hard not to feel enthusiastic about it's ambitions. The music is beautiful, the graphics are (mostly) appealing, the characters are (mostly) charming and the creative use of the motion controls make it an experience unlike most on the Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2012"}

Shatto","summary":"Depends what you call fun I guess","reviewText":"Well, I'll get right to the point. The game's strong point is the sense of accomlishment you get from new equipment and levels, the game's weak point is the fact that to get these things you have to wade through the most mundane tasks like a brainless drone.Like most fantasy-based MMORPGs the heart of the game lies in the quests. Unfortunately, quests in WoW can quickly go from engaging to boring to frustrating. The general forumla is very basic: kill a certain number of monsters, or gather a certain number of a specific item, usually by killing monsters. There is some variation beyond that such as killing or talking to specific creatures or escorting an NPC, but they're the exception, and they're even less fun.This wouldn't really be that bad if it weren't for the simple fact that beyond about level 25, quest-related items seem to drop at a decreased rate and I often found myself enraged at the fact that I was killing thirty or more of a certain kind of monster to get five items from them. Another problem is quests where you have to kill a certain type of monster, but that monster type will occur at a rate of around 1 for every 5 unrelated monsters around it, meaning you wind up having to kill a half dozen creatures you don't need just to get to one you do. A quest that only requires you to kill or collect five monsters or items can easily wind up taking an hour or more, and I often wound up simply abandoning quests because even to get to the location where the quest is done was taking me ten minutes. As if that weren't bad enough, if you take too long to kill your targets (usually because you can't find any) things you killed before will start to respawn right next to you and proceed to attack (on a delay), further complicating the quest and dragging it out. All this even assumes you're on a low population server and not fighting for the same resources as fifteen other people at the same time.Beyond that, the trade and grouping systems are excellent - FAR better than that offered by competitors like Guild Wars (admittedly, Guild Wars having one of the worst examples of each). Items are diverse and there is a certain sense of accomplishment as you collect them and level up. Combat doesn't really require any brains, but it is still fun, and there are worse examples in other games.If the game offered more diversity I might be inclined to continue to play it, but, as it is, the sense of accomplishment in moving up the ladder is simply dwarfed by the massive and unentertaining time sink required. I'm certainly not willing to continue to pay month after month for it.If you don't mind grinding mindlessly and just enjoy finding and equipping new things, this game is for you. In that sense, it's very similar to Diablo - very little actual skill is required and you're constantly finding new stuff. However, if you look for a little depth in your gaming, you're probably going to find WoW frustrating and dull. Try a game like Guild Wars instead where there's not as much focus on advancement and more focus on player skill.It's fun at first, but it really does get old after while.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2006"}

Unfortunately, I think they simply made the game too hard.  Although you can significantly ratchet down the difficulty on \"Skirmish\" mode, the difficulty on campaign mode is infernal, even if you set it to \"Easy,\" a setting that seems to have no effect.  I'm not sure if the game originally came out this way, but at least as of the 1.09 patch, some of the campaign missions are now simply impossible to do, even if you attempt them several times.Yes, those people at EA are idiots.  It's the easiest thing in the world to program a computer game that can swiftly slay human players.  What would be impressive is making a game that is balanced and which your average player has a fair shot of winning.  As it is, the computer never makes a mistake and never wastes any resources.  It has no problem micromanaging a zillion soldiers and using all their special abilities at precisely the right moments.  Unlike humans, it knows which of its structures have been damaged and sets about repairing them with never a delay.  No forces are accidentally forgotten about, the wrong unit is never ordered, units are never mistakenly sent anywhere, and in general all resources are being used to their fullest possible extent.  Efficiency of this type for a human is impossible since you're dealing with dozen and dozens of units and probably several bases.  And you're not permitted to slow the game down in campaign mode.I'm sure there are some people out there who have managed to get through the three campaigns without cheating, but we're talking about the kind of nerds who dedicate their lives to these games and play them for hundreds of hours.  For the average Joe, you will not be able to get through the campaign missions starting at about missions #8-10 of the GDI.There's another problem, too.  This game is one of those new ones that installs spyware and monitorware on your computer to make sure you don't have certain programs installed, that everything you're doing with your burner drives is kosher, and that your game is an original copy.The problem is that EA doesn't answer the phone when the game tries to call in to register itself, which it does the first time you try to play it.  It took me days to get it to work, since I kept getting \"This game is not available right now.  Please try again at a later time,\" or \"We're sorry.  EA's servers are busy.  Please try again at a later time.\"You'd think if EA were going to do this with all their games, they'd have the foresight to set up servers that can handle the load of all their customers, but I guess not.I would also strongly caution against buying this used or downloading it.  In the first case, the serial number will not work since the previous user will have of course registered it (he wouldn't have been able to play the game if he hadn't), meaning that you will have bought a useless plastic disk that can be installed but not played.  In the case of downloads, they don't give you a manual -- and this is one of those highly elaborate strategy games that definitely require one.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

I banked it all on Crysis 2.  Ever since E3 I was most impressed by the gameplay vids of this game over all the others.  Few were on board with Crysis 2, now it seems they see what I saw.  Complaints about the first version were that it was just graphics and the plats wouldn't be able to handle the power of the game as effectively that the PC version would; well it handles it quite well actually.The single player is a blast, and I usually rush through the single player not giving it much attention.  However, Crysis 2 is different.  They call it an open sandbox.  You can attack levels like a sandbox, but the common objectives remain it's not all done on tracks you can choose your route through the levels.  It's not easy.  The levels start easy and get increasingly harder as you move on throughout the level, there's so much replayability.The MP is fantastic as well.  You're going to hate it at first because it takes time to get down, and you'll get pawned, so I'm adjusting.  EDIT; honestly you max out at level 50 that's when i got it down.That's about it.  It's just a fantastic game SP & MP, a great package deal, both clearly worth your money and time.  On MP once you level up past 10 you jump into a fire of rank 11 to infinity ranked players it will take some hard lessons, but in due time you'll get it right.Caution:  I had to fool with my TV controls to get the picture just right.  I changed my Sony Bravia to Vivid, and Full Screen and the brightness turned down to 25 or below.  I don't remember a game being this sensitive to picture adjusting, but it looks like night and day.  I've never really fooled with it before Crysis 2 but the levels were so dark otherwise.  I remember I wasn't as jazzed about U2 as everyone else was, I wish I would have thought to adjust my TV, Doh!*Trick to mastering this game is to steath around without going max speed using cover, and switch to armor while firing.  If you fire while in steath it drains your stealth so use your suit wisely, eventually it will become second hand.This is a GOTY nominee to me, it's a 10/10.

Shortly after the game starts you find yourself being guided by a voice on a radio. This voice provides relatively linear missions to accomplish and move the plot along, since merely \"surviving\" would simply require boarding up in the safe house.ZombiU has one hard rule: if you get bitten, you die. End of sentence. Your character has a very short \"health bar\" to reflect swipes and grabs, but a full-on bite is the death of your character. Rather than \"restarting\", you're assigned a new survivor, who starts at a safe point and has to press on (stopping at some point to recover the gear of the now-zombified former protagonist). This low-health system provides the entire basis for the game's surprising amount of tension. Every nook and cranny, every shadow, could be hiding a zombie or worse. Combat is fast and frantic as you attempt to maintain control of crowds of zombies while dealing with limited ammunition and items. Bashing desperately at a zombie's skull while another creeps up on your right is the kind of scenario that's breezed past in many zombie games, but in ZombiU it's realistically lethal.The game's inventory system is designed to support this sense of paranoia. The Wii U pad is used to access your inventory, with six quick-select slots and ten slots in your backpack. The quick-select slots can be tapped without even looking down in most cases, but the backpack has to be unlimbered, which quite notably forces you to look away from the TV. This is reflected in the fact that your character in the game drops and looks in their bag on the screen when you do. It's surprisingly immersive, definitely more so than just pausing the game and grabbing whatever you need.To balance this all out, you also have a sort of sonar-ping to detect zombies in your vicinity. You can also hack cameras to provide map layouts for each area (which will also show up on your Wii U pad). But the game definitely creates a sense of constant fear & dread that every mechanic & new innovation works towards. The only complaint I had about the game was that death after a while becomes an annoyance rather than a true \"fear\" - since it means you just have to work your way back to where you were - but it's still a better job of trying to evoke a consistent tone than many games. The story is also sort of lackluster, providing very little motivation for venturing out into the dangerous world over and over. Despite these quibbles, ZombiU is an admirable use of new technology as a core gameplay component and not just a weird gimmick.Rating: 9/10.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2013"}

It's larger than pretty much all other mice on the market today, and if you have small hands that could be a big downfall. Also, I've found myself accidentally bumping the buttons on the left side at times, which could be inconvenient depending on what you have them programmed to do.Overall, this is a worthy purchase at a decent price. If you're looking for a mouse specifically for online gaming, however, I would go with the Logitech G9. A little more expensive but alot more versatile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"mkllby","summary":"It's OK","reviewText":"I am a little upset. I was really hoping that this game would keep me entertained for little while until Mass Effect is released. I agree with some of the reviews already written that this game isn't bad but it isn't great either. Personally, I found the fighting concept of the dragons interesting at first but it quickly became tiresome and quite frankly boring...as every fight seemed to be the same. I even tried changing my dragons' class but that didn't make it any more interesting. This I could have dealt with though if the story would have captured my attention but honestly after about 10 hours of play I gave up realizing the story was just never going to get that interesting. I must be honest, that over the past few years (especially after playing the KOTOR games, Jade Empire, Fable), games like this one where I feel like a by-stander watching a story unfold rather than shaping it just don't hold my attention for long at all. I think if I would have played this game 5 years ago I would've been blown away but things change and now I expect more from a game...especially an RPG. I mean how is it a \"Role-Playing\" game when I have no control at all over who my character is, where they go or how they react to people and situations. Here you kill some enemies till you get to a cut scene then run around kill some more enemies until you get to a cut scene.....repeat....repeat....repeat. To be fair though, it might have changed some after the first 10 hours though I doubt it. Again, since I feel like I am being a little too hard on such a \"cute\" game, it really isn't that bad of a game but I would highly recommend renting before committing to purchasing this one. Maybe I missed the point though and it was intended to be for the 13 and under crowd as this game really seems to be rather kiddish without much depth at all to the story or characters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}

So these have to be redeemed either on the PS3 or MAYBE the Vita (will try that later).2. You CAN use an Amazon gift card to buy this: I had a virtual gift card that I earned from doing daily searches with Bing. (FREE GIFT CARDS FTW!) So I added my gift card to my account, then I bought this for $5 off since I had a $5 gift card.

I also remember watching the trailers and thinking \"this game's loaded with realism\". (well, as much realism that a video game can deliver anyhow)What I got instead was a game that could've been better in every sense.Here's my review-Graphics.I don't know why every one was crazy about the graphics in this game; because I personally thought the textures were flat and muddy. The game was way too dark; and the fact that you're barely able to see your enemies says loads. There's also a glare effect used in this game; but it's overdone to the point of being annoying.You do get the option of installing an HD textures pack that requires 1.5 GB's, but to be honest, the difference was not that big to keep it installed.The maps are really big. Unfortunately, you don't get the freedom to explore it unlike the Bad Company series. Overall, the graphics were just ok.Sound.I much preferred the sound effects in Bad Company rather than BF3. The sound was good however and each gun sounds accurate enough, while some actually sound really low. The cutscenes were done nicely as well. Not bad.Gameplay.BF3 pretty much rips the lock on system of Call of Duty, some of it's story, bad graphics, some exciting but poorly executed QTE fights and smushes it into a big ball of game engine.It does not compare to COD being that it aims for so-called realism rather than the arcade style gameplay in COD. Some levels are glitchy (there's a tank level and the first level), the control's the same as COD. Your melee attack is damn near useless. There are some stealth missions to offer variety and you get the usual escort missions or tank missions. The missions I did not like at all were the Jet levels. It was all in first person and it was clunky.I'd of preferred another Battlefield- Bad Company than this game. It is worth playing through though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Hooray! Another corridor shooter!","reviewText":"Sadly, it's over. It's all over. The beloved Ratchet and Clank series is in its death throes. What was once a charming and inventive platformer has now become a mind-numbing and creativity-crippled generic corridor shooter. It was bound to happen though, right? Gamers are drowning in a sea of console shooters these days, from Call of Duty and Killzone to Gears of War and Halo, so is it really so surprising that even games that started out as platformers are becoming more like current shooters?Gone is the feeling of exploration that dominated the previous R&C; games. You no longer have planets and moons to discover and pilfer as you see fit, as the game progression is startlingly linear. There's no exploration allowed within each level either, as you're funneled from one corridor or floating rock to the next and to the next and to the next. You won't be searching high and low for gold bolts, as they're pretty much sitting out in the open right in front of you. Skill points tell you exactly what to do to unlock them so you don't have to worry about taxing your brain.The weapons just don't have the same level of ingenuity or excitement as in previous R&C; games. A lot of the weapons are similar or identical to weapons from previous games, and those that aren't just don't seem to belong. In any case, the utility of many of the weapons doesn't really exist. You can run through the entire game using the standard cannon, the rocket launcher, Mr. Zurkon, and maybe one more weapon without resorting to using any of the others. (Sidenote: This game gets 2 stars instead of 1 solely on account of Mr. Zurkon, who is still incredibly awesome). Still, the gunplay (once a staple of R&C;) is not addictive or exciting in this outing.Controls are also odd. Since the game is meant to be played with multiple people, no one has control over the camera angle except the computer. If you're keenly used to using the right analog stick to control the camera as in previous R&C; games, then you'll find yourself irritatingly changing weapons by accident, which is now managed by  moving the R stick. It's something that people can get used to, I guess, but I never did, and it was like a sharp pebble in my boxers throughout the entire game.The gameplay basically revolves around running from one battle to the next, shooting up waves after waves of enemies, running through the reload ammo checkpoint, and doing it all over again. By the time you hit the halfway point of the game, you will notice that each battle has become eerily reminiscent of one you already fought. It'll start out with about 8 rotating laser drones, then 2-3 standing/bomb drones show up, then like 8 boxing drones, then a flying gravity drone, etc. The enemy variety just isn't there, and it becomes painfully obvious early on and throughout the game. The last two levels in particular are a tedious exercise in the limits of human patience as you're literally fighting the same five waves over and over again as you move toward the final endpoint. Wait until you fight the final boss. It. just. never. seems. to. end.If you're not planning on playing this game with human teammates, then just go ahead and take this advice: Don't play this game. Playing by yourself pairs you up with a near-retarded AI teammate who brings to the combat table the uncanny ability to read your mind and do exactly what you hope he doesn't do. Clank, I need you to activate that switch once I open this panel. Well, Clank was planning on opening the panel instead of activating the switch and now he's all confused and is stuck moving back and forth like a moving paper target. Clank, I need you to shoot this boss with me so we can create a more damaging attack. Too bad, Clank is inexplicably bolting to the edge of the floating platform and leaping to his death over and over again. Time to reload the checkpoint. Again *sigh*. These problems are obviously avoided by playing with a human friend (unless your friend is near-retarded too), but if a game is not adjusted appropriately by a development studio to be played as a single player game, then the option shouldn't be available. It just makes the project look messy.When playing the game in coop form, hopefully with humans, the main draw (and purpose) of this game is to make everyone work together to beat levels. This always sounds great on paper as with most coop games, but the vast majority of developers cannot for the life of them figure out how to implement co-op tactics well (and Insomniac is no exception). Well, here's the dirty secret: levels should be designed so that they are essentially unbeatable unless the coop-ers work together and each fill a separate and mandatory responsibility, ideally one that is not glaringly obvious or limited to one sole strategy. This rarely happens in practice, unfortunately. What usually suffices for the co-op experience is one of the following watered-down events:1. You cannot exit a level unless both players press X at the door, and a cutscene follows of one player holding the door open for the other player to walk through. Thanks, bro.2. Both players are funneled toward a deadend that requires each player to hit x so that one gives the other a helpful boost to the ledge. That player then hits X so he can help the other player up. Thanks, bro.3. One player activates and holds a switch so the other player can walk through the newly opened door and activate and hold an identical switch on the other side, allowing the first player to walk through or activate another, previously blocked switch. Thanks, bro.4. You and a friend basically empty round after round of your ammunition into seemingly endless hordes of enemies until they're all dead, with no real focus or strategy. Keep shooting, bro.#3 and #4 make up 95% of R&C; All4One.Hooray for co-op!!!--------Ok, I'm done. This game sucks in general and sucks even more for dragging an otherwise great series into the dark, fecaline depths of generic gaming. We don't need another mindless corridor shooter and certainly don't need a once-non-mindless-corridor shooter turning into one.Let's all hope Insomniac returns to form with the next game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2011"}

I felt Nintendo deserved the sales, being I've had no problem with Nintendo before. Anywhom, when we got home, we checked it out.So the little booklet we got was actually pretty informative with Mario's major selling platforming games, however I think they should've included Super Mario Land 1 & 2, I thought they sold quite well. I also enjoyed looking at the artwork in the back. The music CD could've been better. You get the main/most memorable track from the games listed in the booklet, and sounds from Super Mario Bros, such as getting a 1up. I think they could've done better. So without further ado, we review the games.So it's Super Mario All Stars in its glory. However, it's pretty much a straight SNES port, with changed physics (more on this later). I can see why they would market this at $30, and not just because of the CD and booklet. Buying SMB 1-3 and the lost levels on the virtual console would cost $21, 500 for 1-3, and I think 600 for the lost levels (forgive me if I'm wrong, but you get the point) You're pretty much getting the SNES versions, so if they were all put on the VC, they'd probably cost 800 points each. However, I think the price could've been cut at least 5 bucks.Now, about the physics. I have played all the SMB games not only on the NES, but I played the SNES All Stars. 2 and 3 seemed to be working perfectly fine. 1 and lost levels, however, seemed to change. The jumping feels very awkward compared to the other versions. Sometimes the game gets too sensitive, or not sensitive at all, and we've had a few cheap deaths. It seems the fireballs shooting from the lava is completely random now, while as before it was time-able. As well, the collision detection seems to have changed for the worse. I didn't touch one of the flame sticks in one of Bowser's castles, but it registered it as a hit because I was close to it. Another time, my dad (yes, he likes Mario games too) got hit by a Koopa when he was a step above it (it was on the stairway to the exit)I do love the SMB series, but I think they could've put more work into fixing up the games to make it seem less like a direct SNES port (or add more games, personally) and they could've added a few more memorable songs to the CD.My final verdict: If you love Super Mario, just buy the VC versions. You'll save $9. However, if you're looking for a challenge or if you're a Super Mario collector, as I am, definitely get this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you.

The year is 1912.For those of you who have played the original Bioshock, you will see some familiar elements.  Vigors replace plasmids and powering your vigors require \"salts\" rather than Eve.  Another familiar element is that--like Rapture--Columbia is intended to be a utopia away from earthbound imperfections...and, of course, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  Unlike Rapture, however, you get to see how things go to hell first-hand.Bioshock Infinite is not for the timid.  You'll see racism.  You'll see the horrible treatment of workers at the turn of the Industrial Revolution.  You'll be treated to some of the ugliest parts of American History and how the \"norm\" of these subjects would appall our modern sensibilities.  Keep in mind, however, that Bioshock Infinite doesn't do this merely for shock value, but rather to immerse yourself in a timeframe and period where \"utopia\" for someone living in 1912 would be extremely DIFFERENT from what you and I have in mind.  Bioshock Infinite is fantastic in its socio-political treatise as well as its treatment of an alternate religion that worships our founding fathers.The highlight of this game, as you may have seen in numerous reviews, centers on Elizabeth who is the crux of this story and our emotional axis of rotation.  She keeps us grounded and her book-smart (but world-naivet&eacute;) behavior is voiced to excellent perfection and you will wind up caring about her welfare as you go through thick and thin.  I can't remember the last time where a video game character made me forget that I was playing a GAME so much because of the emotional investment that her character generates.Gameplay wise, Bioshock Infinite is a very solid shooter.  Elizabeth's ability to open \"tears\" in space-time fabric helps you obtain support in the form of cover, weapons, med kits, ammunition, etc.  She will occasionally come across money and toss you some cash as you scrounge around for supplies...or even toss you the much-needed ammunition clip as you get low on multiple rounds...or the occasional salt to supply your Vigors.  She's not a \"cheat\", however, and will get you whatever she can find - she is not a bottomless reservoir and her occasional help is more deeply appreciated as a result.  Vigors are fun, too, with my favorite being \"Murder Of Crows\" which allows you to unleash a horde of crows at your foes to relentlessly peck at them to either give you time to escape or whittle your enemies down as they thrash about.That said, as fantastic as a shooter as Bioshock Infinite is, there will be several moments in the game where violence does come into question and Elizabeth once again becomes an excellent foil in that regard.  I don't want to ruin the plot any further along these lines, but the dialog during these moments is phenomenal and does throw light on the subject rather than completely hide it away, especially during moments where Booker begins to show his own regrets and misgivings.  Booker's development is subtle and does not devolve into Hollywood-esque depths of \"and then he became a new man\" cliche.And the end to this game...wow, what an end.  I will say this much - everything will make sense in the end and there are no plot holes or loose ends to speak of.  The entire story arc is very complicated, but the revelations will numb you and completely spend your emotional reserve.  IGN said something along the lines of, \"Ok ... so this is Bioshock...where's the plot twist?  I'm ready for the plot twist.  Where is it?\"  I guarantee you that you won't see it coming...but once you do experience it, the entire story arc makes resounding sense...and it'll make you want to play it again to catch every nuance and \"the evidence is right in front of you\" moment to appreciate the experience that much more.Game of the year?  Hell, I'd say Game of the Past Two Decades.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I08RR8","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Hawkinson","summary":"A very good game, but new gameplay take away from the awesome open world feel","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Assassin's Creed and will most likely buy all of them on release day.  I didn't really know what to expect with this one, the third and final of the trilogy, but if they stuck to the core mechanics and good graphics then it wouldn't disappoint.  Revelations meets many of my expectations, , if not exceed, but then some other areas fell short.The bulk of the game is, of course, Ezio as he traverses Constantinople in search of five keys that will get him in to Altair's library.  Each key spawns an Altair mission.  Additionally, there are Abstergo fragments (think feathers) littered about and as you collect them to a certain milestone it releases a Desmond sequence (I believe 5 in total).  Altair's is to see where he's been, Desmond's is to remember his past.  Just as in Brotherhood you free Templar towers and you train assassins.  The difference here is that once you free an area of Templars you may have to go back and defend it from the Templars moving back in to the area.  As with any Assassin's Creed game you will certainly get your money's worth with hour upon hour of game play.Pros: The graphics are great.  I thought running around Rome was great, but running around Constantinople, where East meets West, is just a blast with every building you climb to the top of.  Maybe it is because the buildings are a bit more alien than the European buildings I am used to, but everything looks amazing.  There are more set pieces and cut scenes than in past installments and they look phenomenal.  The sound gives a great feel, both the voice acting and the soundtrack.  The addition of the hook and bombs add a lot to the combat mechanics.  I love zipping from rooftop to rooftop, occasionally assassinating as I go.  Constantinople is huge and there is a ton to explore, so this is a huge plus in my book.Cons: There seem to be a ton of loading screens interspersed between really short cut scenes.  Not sure why they couldn't transition better and eliminate going to the black screen with a little white rectangle in the center so often, but it feels like a lot more than before.  Not sure I care for the tower defense.  It feels arcady and pointless.  Ezio stands on a rooftop (can't move) and you position your leaders and your troops to attack the wave after wave of Templar agents that come to attack your den.  After a while you just start filling every spot with archers and rifles and roadblocks and just wait for it to be done so you can get back to the real game.  Feels out of place and should never have been included.  Finally, the Desmond sequences.  Although they have a semi cool feel to them, there really isn't any reason for them to be there.  It feels a lot like Portal (without the gun transporter) where you move through a puzzle like maze pushing buttons and using building blocks (pre-determined shapes) to walk to your destination.  Unique at first, but than seems out of place.Multiplayer: I love the multiplayer.  It shines in Revelations.  If you didn't like it before you may very well not like it now, although the two new game modes may make it more interesting.  I haven't found where I choose what game mode to play yet, so I've been stuck with whatever quick match I've been thrown in to.  The new deathmatch (?) mode is fun, where there isn't a compass and you have to find the one person that looks like the person you are hunting.  More skill based.  When the match is done it will throw up three different match types and you vote on which you want.  Most votes wins.  I like this aspect a lot, letting the players decide what map and game mode they will play.  The maps are 5 new maps and 4 maps from Brotherhood.  A good assortment but I would have liked to have seen more original maps.  Maybe these will be free DLCs like they did before.All in all I am impressed with Revelations.  I can't say that it is better than Brotherhood.  I've felt Ubisoft has always improved the series from AC to AC2 to ACB, but with ACR it feels like a sidestep or a small step back, which wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Tower defense and the loading screens lessen the impact of the Assassin's Creed world some.  In the end it is still a very good game, and if you like the parkour aspects of an open world game there is nothing better than Assassin's Creed.  A recommend.4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"Improvements are offset by exclusions, but still insanely fun.","reviewText":"Marvel Ultimate Allianceis still among the titles that spring to mind when I think about my very favorite games of the last 10 years.  It took the extraordinarily fun and detail-oriented action-RPG gameplay of  the X-Men Legends series and took it to new heights with dozens of playable characters from every corner of the Marvel Universe with unique abilities and powers and a story that was not only epic enough to fit them all in, but had several possible endings depending on your actions, a customizable superteam option that allowed you to handpick your favorite characters and form a grouping of heroes with their own identity, and much more of the stuff that comic fanboys dream about such as multiple costumes for each character that had varying ability boosts.  Surely a sequel would offer even more awesomeness while keeping everything we loved about the previous game.  Surely.Or not.  \"Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2\" takes a whole lot from us and offers us precious little in return.  It's still awesomely fun to play, but the little things that are missing really hurt.  Thankfully, the massive Civil War storyline that split the Marvel Universe down the middle over the Superhuman Registration Act translates extremely well to video game form and this title still kicks loads of ass.So what's missing?  Well, there's only one unlockable alternate costume for each character whereas the first had 4.  Petty, I know; but how about  the over 30 playable characters (on theGold Edition, that is) being whittled down to 24?  25 total if you got the pre-order code allowing you to unlock The Juggernaut (and I did).  Among the MIA are Ghost Rider,Blade, Elektra, Moon Knight, Dr Strange, and Silver Surfer.  And not only are they not playable, they aren't even in the game at all. Spider-Woman, Black Panther, and Colossus are present but not playable. And this list of omissions is not counting the amazingly great extra downloadable characters from the last game that were included in the \"Gold Edition\" re-release of MUA.  But at least you get to play as Penance.  Because I know everybody thinks \"Penance\" when they think of the ultimate Marvel superteam of their dreams.  Speaking of superteams, that option is completely gone as well.  And still no Namor, Vision, or Punisher (yes I know about the licensing thing).  And each of the fewer characters only has 4 powers total compared to the original's 6 or so.  Also, the totally killer individualized grappling attacks are replaced with generic throws in the new game.  As if The Invisible Woman would lift a robot above her head and throw it across the screen.  Ugh.  In the first game she'd turn invisible and pull a sweet judo move on a confused enemy.  That sort of thing was great. Speaking of Sue Storm, I was also sorely disappointed that you can no longer control telekinesis-type attacks the way you used to. Those were my favorite, jerks!  And whereas before you could equip each hero with their own set of \"medals\"  which would boost their powers in various ways, this time you may have only 3 equipped.  And there are over 200 to choose from.  How likely are you exactly to equip a medal that increases your team's fire damage when The Human Torch is pretty much the only character who'd benefit from such a thing?  THINK, DAMN YOU! It would make perfect sense if you could equip characters individually, but you can't so what the hell? Lastly, while there are still simulator mission you can play, they amount to little more then time trials.  The last game had personalized missions for every character where you had to go solo which was a great feature for learning each character's strengths outside of the chaotic group combat.  Those are sadly gone as well as are the multiple endings. A lot to be ticked off about here.Now I know that is a mighty big list of grievances, but I'm here to tell you that this game is still loads of fun.  Here are some improvements.  First off, the in-game graphics are amazing.  Each character's textures are very lifelike so they look much more realistic as opposed to the comic bookish look of the last game.  Second, the voice acting is much improved in that the game doesn't mix text-only and spoken bits as sloppily as the first game.  However, in the base sections prior to each mission your character is annoyingly silent when conversing with your allies.  However, you do get to choose from one of three responses on any given topic of conversation (one aggressive, one diplomatic, and one defensive) which is a great idea.  Also, every character has individualized dialog, which is great.  For example, when I was asked to either register my identity and become a dog of the state or escape and fight for freedom for all people, I was controlling Deadpool (my favorite comic character ever) who broke the 4th wall in hilarious fashion by explaining my non-fascist choice of non-registration to the confused SHIELD director by stating that he can always register on the second playthrough.  That was killer.  Every character seems to have their own personalized reaction to these scenarios which is actually really impressive.  You'd have to play through this game dozens of times to see all of the dialogue for every character.  I don't see that happening, but it's a nice thought.  The Stan Lee cameo is fun.  New playable characters include the much-aligned previously-mentioned Penance, Songbird (who is awesome),  Jean Grey, Iron Fist, Green Goblin (surprisingly awesome), Gambit,  and an all-new version of Nick Fury that does not impress me in the slightest.  Hulk and Venom also made it from the Gold Edition, which is good.Then there are the \"fusions\".  This is the premiere new feature of the game  and it allows any combination of two characters to do a team-up attack that combines their powers.  For example, Storm might summon a tornado you can steer  to suck up enemies while Deadpool tosses grenades into the vortex, Gambit can embed charged playing cards into a chunk of concrete that The Hulk rips out of the ground and then then smashes onto a spot of your choice, or Iron Man can reflect a beam off of Captain America's shield to create a prism effect that takes out all enemies in the vicinity.  This is really a great feature.  Problem is, there are a large percentage of \"stock\" fusions that are repeated with numerous character combos.  For example, Juggernaut and Thor's fusion is the same as Ms. Marvel and Hulk's fusion and Venom and Luke Cage's fusion and so on.  It doesn't exactly ruin the fun, but more creativity would be in order considering they pointed at all the individualized power fusions as being a reason there were less characters in this game.So basically, if you thought MUA was game of the year material, you are still going to have a great time with this.  It's essentially the same gameplay and concept.  The story is excellent and being able to choose your path (and allies) makes for good replayability.  And can you say \"4 player co-op\"?  Sure to be a crowd-pleaser.  Plus whooping Hank Pym is something I've wanted to do for a long time now.  Busting a Spidey/Wolverine webbing fastball special into his gut and seeing the giant stumble back clutching his boo-boo was mucho gratifying.  Like I said, it's the little things.  Sadly, to many of those little things are missing for this to compete with it's predecessor.  It's still a great game and if the first one had never come out, I'd rate it 5 stars in a second; but I just cannot abide the massive amount of great features and characters that were dropped from this game.  That just should not happen.  Ever.  Less is never more in a game like this one.  I'm definitely playing through it again, but I'm going to wait for the inevitable downloadable character pack.  There'd better be Bullseye, Magneto, and Nightcrawler too. And Psylocke.  And Emma Frost.  Yeah, so I'm an X-Men fan; sue me.Final verdict: MUA2 is a must-play for Marvel maniacs, but it pales in terms of fanboy wealth compared to the previous game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2009"}

Garrelts","summary":"An Amazing Price for Two Great Games","reviewText":"I originally played God of War 1 & 2 on my PS2 several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed both games. For people not familiar with the series, God of War places you in control of the fictional character named Kratos. The games are set in Greek Mythology, though they do deviate heavily and take several liberties with accepted mythology. As a work of fiction, the games are fantastic! Anyone looking for a history lesson in Greek Mythology is going to be disappointed.The PS3 version combines both God of War 1 & 2 on one Blu-ray Disc with all the extras and special features from the original games. The graphics have been polished up and are anti-aliased (rough edges smoothed out) and presented in 720p at 60 frames per second. Both games feature their own respect trophy set. The results are spectacular given the original material. I'll state though that the games are definitely not up to the standards set by most top-tier PS3 games. Also GoW 2 is clearly the better looking game. Though for anyone who has ever played the games on the PS2, you'll be seeing the series better than you ever thought possible.The two games in this collection take Kratos from humble beginnings all the way to Olympian deity. The journey along the way is fraught with screen-filling bosses, amble amounts of gore and dismemberment and some of the best voice-acting ever heard in a video game. Gameplay is probably best described as a hack-n-slash platformer. Think Devil May Cry but with more forgiving controls and combos and a much better camera system.I've read a few reviews that claim the games are not for \"casual\" gamers and that the difficulty is turned to high. I disagree and offer that the games each have multiple selectable difficulty levels. Both games also offer the player the ability to switch to easy mode at any point in the game without having to start over. In easy mode you can rest assured that you'll have a leisurely stroll through the game.One area of disappointment that I have with this collection are that the original CG cutscenes haven't been redone and in most cases look worse than the actual gameplay. It's understand given the price of the set but still a bit of a letdown. Otherwise this is an amazing deal for two of the best PS2 games ever released. Also, if you're new to the series and are interested in playing God of War 3 I would highly recommend playing GoW 1 & 2 first as each game is a direct sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

Released a little over a year ago on the XBOX360,Ninja Gaiden IIcomes to the PS3 as Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.After a lengthy 8 minute install, you begin the game. The wait is made a little better (or worse, depending on your perspective) by a series of comic book stills with cheesy voices and sound effects while it's copying. The improvements are vast and numerous, starting with the graphics. As good as the 360 version was, Sigma 2 is better. Enemies are lavishly detailed, moves are flashy and spectacular with terrific lighting effects, and bosses are absolutely HUGE. Some levels, gameplay mechanics and enemies received small tweaks, and some are completely revamped. I beat the 360 version and now having completed Sigma 2, I can say that playing the PS3 version is almost like a new experience, especially because of the introduction of several new bosses, online play, mission mode, and 3 new playable characters: Momiji, Rachael, and Ayane. There are a total of 17 levels, 2 or 3 of which are totally new (1 level each for the playable characters). There is none of the slowdown that plagued the 360 version, although I noticed that some bodies now vaporize in order to save processing power. Story is pretty much nonsense and a lot less focused than Ninja Gaiden/Sigma, having you jump around the world, so just ignore it.First of the changes is the oft-mentioned easier difficulty. I played on \"Path of the Warrior\" (\"Path of the Acolyte\" is the other starting difficulty) and found it very easy to defeat many of the bosses. You can just brute-force attack many of them and spam with the same moves over and over. This is how I defeated most of the bosses, even the later ones in the game. The last 3 bosses are especially easy. Arrows and projectiles are on auto-aim. Often you can just jump up and shoot blindly while facing in the direction of opponents. Pushing L1 also snaps to targets, making it very easy to kill attackers from a distance, especially those annoying archers or rocket launcher soldiers. Arrows (and all projectile weapons, including Ayane's exploding shuriken and Rachel's sub-machine gun) are now unlimited, removing a lot of the tactical decision-making and conserving you need to do. You can also move now while aiming, which is a plus. Gone are Ryu's windmill shuriken and incendiary shuriken. I miss the windmill shuriken.Powering up your Ultimate Technique now is a lot faster it seems. The controls are very forgiving and don't require precise timing as they did in the past. Many of the combos also seem easier to execute and often times, I wonder if I've been triggering combo fatalities by accident. Items and save points are much more numerous. This is the first game in the series where I've actually had a problem with too many items. You can only carry a max of 3 of each of the restore items (small health restore, big health restore, magic restore). Items don't increase in price each time you buy them from Muramasa like they did before. Also, a big change is that he now upgrades your weapons for free. There is usually one or two upgrade statue per level. You can upgrade one weapon once per shop. Previous versions allowed you to upgrade whenever you wanted, as long as you had the money (very expensive), forcing you to save up and strive for more ultimate technique kills because they rewarded you with more essence. The abundance of items and the free upgrades makes collecting essence now rather pointless, because you'll have all this money but nothing to buy. Lastly, load times after dying have been greatly reduced to a few seconds, removing a lot of frustration experienced by players in previous NG games. The downside is that menu load times are inordinately long. If you find a magic scroll or technique scroll, it can take several seconds for the demo video to load, and several seconds after pushing X to close the screen.Next is the toned-down violence. The menu system is now painted blue instead of red blood splatters. Arms, legs and heads can get chopped off, but they disappear in a wisp of blue ether instead of rolling onto the floor. In the 360 version, heads rolled everywhere and buckets of blood sprayed out from severed limbs. It's all gone here.New bosses include a giant Buddhist statue at the end of the first level, a pair of tengu, and even the Statue of Fricking Liberty! Some of the bosses have their special attacks removed and made a lot less aggressive about attacking and blocking. You no longer have to time attacks perfectly. Just button mash.Thankfully, a lot of the \"cheap\" moments players complained about from Sigma are gone. The piranha ghost fish are still here though, but those extremely annoying exploding jellyfish are gone. Gone also is the ridiculous ability to swim in lava. \"Invisible walls\" are also a lot less apparent. In the previous game, areas that looked like you could walk around are unreachable, destroying the illusion of depth. In Sigma 2, it's not as noticeable.Weapons are fun to use, with some being very flashy and cool to see in action, like the tonfa, which turns Ryu into a lethal whirlwind of skull and limb cracking goodness. I don't ever get tired of powering up Ryu and seeing him go berserk on a group of bad guys. Locales include a futuristic Tokyo, NYC, Venice, South America, Mt. Fuji, some non-descript sewers and tunnels of hell or some other demonic dimensional warp. Sky City Tokyo is beautiful and lovingly rendered. NYC is less so. Times Square, Brooklyn, and Liberty Island look bland and inauthentic (because I live here). Some of the levels feel recycled directlty from Sigma (Airship Daedalus = airship stage from previous, Draga Dai = Vigoor city, sewers, lava levels).Verdict:Are all the gameplay changes good? No. Is Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 fun? Yes, without a doubt. I enjoyed playing the new sexy female characters and the mission mode. It's a shame you can't play the entire game as one of the girls and you lose all your weapons when you begin a new game. One of the weirdest, most juvenile and sexist things you can do is jiggle the girls' goodies with the SIXAXIS.Replaying on Path of the Mentor (unlocked by beating the game), I found it a lot harder and I got killed several times on level 1 by even minor enemies. They are a lot more lethal and harder to kill. Too bad this difficulty wasn't available at the very beginning to choose from. Chapter Mode also opens up, which lets you choose any chapter to replay.All in all, a fun game with good replay value, and I'm glad I bought it. It's a stunning display of the PS3's capabilities and a blast to play as everyone's favorite ninja.My rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2009"}

And I agree with them 100%.  The game was incrediably fun to play.  It is a children's game i mus say.  The comedy used in cutscenes tended to be a little slapstick and there was a lack of mature humor.  But i still laughed.  The game utilizes its the lego half of the game very well, using the Force to manipulate lego blocks, build bridges and such.  But one of the coolest parts of the game is that you can play the game with so many unlockable characters regardless of how the scene in the movie actually went.  Want to have clone troopers fight in Thead or perhaps have Yoda fight Darth Maul in Episode 1?  Go for it!  You can unlock players with the games money system and go back to a free play mode where you can access any cleared stages and play with any unlocked characters (any!).  Cool thing is that you can do more now with the unlocked characters and take advantage of their cool stuff (Like jango's jet pack)  I just loved seeing who was the best to fight against Darth Maul at the end if the Ep 1 part of the game.  I must say that using Amidala was a pretty nifty challenge, but Darth Maul turned out to be his own worst enemy.  The game covers the first 3 movies.  Though the game is short, its got a lot of replay value.  And there's even a great multiplayer.  It's kinda like Sonic games where player 2 could come in anytime and play as Tails.  If player 2 wants to leave he can and the AI picks up after a few seconds.I wouldn't rate this up in the Kotor quality of a Star Wars game, but then again it's Lego!  It's quirky, fun and great for all ages.  Just blasting a battle droid or an obstacle and watching it fall apart into Lego bricks was enough to hook me in.  This game fall under one of those types that's just fun to play.  I rank it up there with Katamari and R-Type final for just vast and easy fun to pick up on the spur of the moment.

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled.

Many people consider the original game to be the best, in regards to storyline, originality, and etcetera. The new game includes improved graphics, sound, and enemy AI, along with some new missions after the point where the normal game would be completed.The storyline will be familiar to all fans of the series, seeing as it's the same as \"Metroid\". The bounty hunter Samus Aran has been hired to go to the planet Zebes and destroy a race of energy-draining creatures known as Metroids. She must also destroy an evil entity known as Mother Brain. Samus herself was orphaned on this planet by the evil Space Pirates (that's actually the name of their species, at least to the humans) and was rescued and raised by a race known as the Chozo. These highly-advanced creatures gave her the power suit that she wears, so that she may destroy the Space Pirates (as Zebes was also at one time a Chozo colony). Now, using the power of her suit and her natural skills, Samus must destroy this threat to the galaxy.The graphics in this game are very well done, and are a little bit better than the graphics in Metroid Fusion. They are beautiful and immersive. Samus has her original suit, not the bizarre blue punk-style suit she had in Metroid Fusion. Samus gets multiple suits during the course of the game; the basic power suit (which is dark orange), the heat-and-cold resistant Varia suit (which is bulkier and light orange), and the water-pressure resistant Gravity suit (which is like the Varia suit, but purple). There is also a part where Samus loses her power suit and runs around in a jumpsuit, armed only with a pistol (this is a sequence that wasn't in the original game).The sound in the game is not really impressive. Even though it's better than the NES game, it's still basically blips and bleeps. The music isn't bad, and sets the tone more than the sound effects. There is also a very annoying \"low health\" sound, which is a little siren that sounds if your health is less than 10% of its maximum. So basically, if you're really hurt, you just hear \"beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep\" over and over again until you get some health, which isn't always easy. The same problem occurs in the \"Legend of Zelda\" games, too. Of course, if it's really annoying, the sound can be turned off, but then you miss out on other sound effects.The gameplay is satisfying. Bosses are often of the \"hit its weak spot with a particular weapon\" variety, though they still look pretty cool. Samus can perform all sorts of maneuvers, such as her morph ball form, in which she can roll around, her freeze missiles, which can freeze enemies and make them into stepping blocks, and her grapple beam, which she can use to swing around on hooks. There is also a good variety of locations, from ancient Chozo ruins to volcanoes.Overall, this game is very, very good. It's a nice way of introducing newer gamers to the beginning of the Metroid series. For old-school gamers, beating the game will get you the original NES Metroid game to play.9/10 (I'm taking one point of for the Low Health Beeps).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2004"}
{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"I Teach Typing","summary":"A new direction for the franchise","reviewText":"Disregarding the fact the series is a total clone of other games in the same genre (a la GTA), the Saints Row series TOTALLY reinvented itself from previous games in the franchise, replacing the heavy, mature storytelling of Saints Row 2 with completely random gameplay only a team of psychopaths could have dreamed. While some of it is well thought out, other parts of it feel generic or otherwise poorly designed.One of the big things changed in SR3 is the story. After creating your character (with LOTS of different options) the Third Street Saints are kicked out of their own city and are forced to move to Steelport, a fairly big but monotonous playground for you and your crew. What follows is one of the most immature-yet-original plots I have ever played. Unfortunately, the new characters and your custom built protagonist feel one dimensional. The story progresses through missions similar to the GTA series, with side missions scattered about. The problem is, the game FORCES some of these side missions, to the point where I was thinking the developers were just trying to pad their game play time. The ending is CLEARLY designed to set up future DLCs.Gameplay is the same as any other open world game with the camera behind your character as you point and shoot at waves and waves of boring henchmen. Some of the weapons are completely fun (rocket propelled shark guts?!?), while others like the starting pistol and rifle are generic. Driving is okay and you still have the ability to drive and shoot, though making it around corners at high speeds can be really hard. While the animations are smooth and are fun the first few times you see them, these will get old quickly as you see your character do the same body slam over and over again.Saints Row the Third is an alright game with some highs and just as many lows. It is worth renting if you enjoy open world crime games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2014"}

Think of it as a movie that lasts 10 or so hours and you're the director of it. I just completed the game for the first time a few minuets ago and I can't wait to start it over again. The entire game is made up of making choices and there are countless choices to make. Your choices will change the outcome of the game so you can play through multiple times and get a different result each time. That is the game's greatest strength.I thought the storyline was excellent. Without giving anything away, there is a killer who has a guy's son. You play as four characters: The father, a private detective, a reporter and an FBI agent who has some really cool glasses. Several times throughout the game I thought I had it all figured out only to find out that I didn't. The ending totally for a loop. Maybe some people will figure it all out at the start but I sure didn't.The game is not perfect. The graphics, while amazing at times, aren't as strong as Uncharted 2 but they're still better than many games out there. The character models are just a tiny bit stiff but not enough to hurt the game. The voice acting, while very good, has some problems when it comes to the actor's foreign accent showing through. The biggest flaw I see in the game, and the only reason why I wouldn't give this a perfect score, is that I experienced game freezing three times so far. That's a shame for a game this good.Overall, this is a must have game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"michael","summary":"best game on the wii","reviewText":"this is by far the best game on the wii great graphics could pass as a ps3/360 game and a great storyline i never played the other games in the series but i understood everthing fine and boy what a shocking ending but i won't spoil it its an on the rails shooter which means you have no control over your characers movment but everything else is up to youfor 20$ new you can't beat it best game on the wii now what are you waiting for go out and buy the game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

Some of the changes, like a clearer tutorial section which explains the controls and various game mechanics , and the ability to warp from bonfires from the start are a welcome addition&#8230;the fact that leveling is only available from a specific NPC is not such a good idea, since the constant warping affects the flow of the game. One new mechanic is good for the game balance but bad for the old school RPG gamer is limited respawns which force you to keep on moving forward and limit level grinding.The combat is slower and more brutal, and it (not so gently) forces you to adapt to several mechanics  like dodging, rolling, jumping and using the environments to your advantage to stay alive; this is not a game for the button mashing fans of God of War, only careful planning and balancing will let you succeed here.The graphics are not so hot anymore, which is understandable for a game running on 8 year old console tech, but the gameplay is a challenging and sweet as ever.If you are a Souls fan you won&#8217;t be disappointed and if you have never tried the Souls series don&#8217;t listen to all the &#8220;it&#8217;s so hard&#8221; comments; it is challenging but at the same time really rewarding when you manage to beat it and you won&#8217;t be disappointed","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Master Chief Comes Full Circle","reviewText":"There is no reason to state the amount of hype attached to this game, so I'm not going to. Let me say I've hardly ever seen a game that lived up to its hype completely. Many of the greatest games were sequels in an already polished series. The third and final installment of Halo (or so Bungie says) encompasses everything the game developers were looking to add to the second one. And in my opinion, they executed this very well. Here is a short mach up of the game's main parts:Gameplay 9 of 10: The mechanics feel very good and a lot of the game resembles Halo: Combat Evolved. Everything is intuitive, no drastic changes but many small beneficial additions. Many of the serious physics problems from Halo 2 were addressed. I will say it is my favorite of the three in terms of pure gameplay. There is constant action and variation. The Arbiter is taken out of the gameplay for the most part. Many people complained about ending Halo 2 as the Arbiter. Now, only as a cooperative partner can the Arbiter join in. My favorite feature of the game is a great deal of the enemies have changed. To begin with the Flood is only in two complete levels if I remember correctly.Nobody I know likes fighting them. The developers took this to heart. A few things I've noticed about them: if you shoot the Flood part of the \"infected\" they go down easier, they are now able to be beaten into their constituents and they're just quite simply not as difficult to kill. In fact the difficulty levels are a step down from the first two games. Normal seems like an enhanced easy. Brutes are considerably weaker. A few shots to the chest now destroy their armor. Skulls however, make the game more like the legendary setting of old.There are 13 skulls that can be found in various secret places in the game. They add things like: grunts throw many more grenades, all enemies have extra health, you have to hit enemies to get shields back etc. Four of the skulls allow you to change your armor on xbox live. These also add multipliers to the Meta-game. In the Meta-game you are given points based on how and who you kill. Brutes obviously net more points. This is a fun way to compete with others via xbox live. So many features have been added to this game, it is hard to list them all.Graphics 8 of 10: Very good visuals stand out even from other next generation games. Lighting and reflection is greatly superior to many other current games, weapons look more realistic than anything in the game. Much more time was spent on the textures and close up visuals. Colors are vibrant, everything has sharp and crisp lines as long as you have HD or I prefer S-video (because I'm lame and have a CRT). If you don't, Halo 3 will resemble an enhanced Halo 2 visually.Controls 8 of 10: Controls take an evolutionary step, with only a couple of buttons moved out of necessity for the special items. The basics are the same as first and second game and as always have little to no learning curve for a person familiar with FPS. There are more options on the personalization of the controls now. In my opinion Halo 3 has the best controls for a shooter game and has been copied before.Music / Sound Effects 7 of 10: The music is just brilliantly done, now with a full orchestra. And the original soundtrack has been considerably enhanced and expanded by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori (the composers for all three games). With an orchestra in the background, the game just feels more epic and gives a human quality to the story. The sound effects on the other hand are nothing new or really better than ok, even with the volume way up it is hard to get the full experience. Many of the weapons seem to be toned down literally.Weapons 8 of 10: Many, many weapons were added. Here is a full list: [...] There are probably more weapons in this game than the first two combined. Unfortunately, many go by the wayside because of there ineffectiveness against enemies-especially on multiplayer. If you remember those large energy shields you always see the covenant standing behind and always wished your own, Halo 3 gives you the option to do so along with a bunch of other new special items: energy drains, deployable cover, trip mines, bubble shields, flares, invincibility, incendiary grenades and a few more. The bubble shield is quite impressive-throw this out and a large sphere will encapsulate you and keep out any and all weapons fire including explosives. However, anyone can walk in.Vehicles 8 of 10: A very well done fleet of both human, covenant and brute vehicles, quite a few new vehicles on every side along with mostly improved versions of the old ones. There are multiple versions of the Warthog. The Mongoose--is a small non-armored ATV capable of very fast speeds. A new bunch of Brute vehicles such as the chopper enter the fray. And if you hadn't guessed, the Scarab is back. In fact you'll get to destroy four within the game. Phantoms are now destroyable. The tank now houses a separate gunner for the machine gun while some speed is added and evens out the slower rate of fire.A full list of the vehicles: [...]Story 6 of 10: I must say my views on the plot surrounding Halo 3 are blurry. I've played through the game a few times now and cannot understand where it is going. It seems to be overly complex without explain much. The story centers on the Master Chief losing Cortana. About halfway through I really lost interest in what was going on with Gravemind and the Flood and said forget it. Maybe a primer should have come with the game or it did and I failed to read it. Honestly, if someone can give me a synopsis of the storyline I'd really appreciate it. Unfortunately the Halo books have not progressed thus far and I'll have to wait to find out just exactly how the game ended.Multiplayer 6 of 10: And now for the thing that made Halo famous. Multiplayer has to be separated into two distinct parts: the gameplay and the matchmaking system. Let's discuss the bad first. Quite obviously the matchmaking system....which can be livable at best. In the past the worst parts about matchmaking was the wait times, constant restarts and even complete loss of games because people quit or lost their connection. In retrospect they weren't that bad compared to the most recent additions to the game. In fact getting into a match is now very fast (about 2 minutes on average) However, Bungie feels it is necessary to now change fundamental parts of multiplayer. Just last weekend I noticed that something was seriously off. While attacking a person I took his/her shield down and meleed only to find it wouldn't kill him/her. I was also getting killed by things that shouldn't have killed me. Plasma grenades would explode 5-10 feet away-killing me. It wasn't the case before. This wasn't a singular phenomenon. My friends noticed the same problems. Nothing is consistent anymore. Also supposedly less than 50,000 people were online.If you haven't played before these things might not bother you. To me it seems as if the programming is now favoring the weaker players. It's kind of like studying for a history exam and then somebody hands you a math test instead and takes it away halfway through the allotted time. I've really lost interest in the game since this occurred. Aside from that there are tons of maps and a decent amount of game variants. New map packs come out about every 3-4 months for a price. As is the case, they are made free months after they've come out. I'm not sure what to think about multiplayer now. There aren't superior multiplayer infrastructures in terms of scope for xbox live. But at the same time when you're not sure what the physical rules are, how can I feel anything but disillusioned.ConclusionA very well thought out and truly fun game-which is something lacking in these next gen games. \"Over-realism\" is not fun. Videogames are meant provide an escape. Halo has this in spades. A genetically enhanced super soldier that fights aliens in a half ton cybernetic suit of armor-brilliant. And you get to play as him. Overall this game is the best Halo for your money. If you own an Xbox 360 I wouldn't think twice about purchasing this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

The original was certainly fresh and fun, and this game holds that true. But now you have better graphics, the same and even more characters, and a rounup of new awesome levels to play in! New taunts and moves also add a touch more the already great game! The characters are even better with new greats like Bowser and the unstoppable Zelda/Sheik duo. If only the Ice Climbers would die!! New levels are back, and this time, there are more than just one level for each character. In the old version, it was hard to create sets of characters from each game. But now, you can have a slugfest with Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser in Peach's castle grounds! Or even add in D.K. or Yoshi to the Mario lineup! Create a wizardly lineup with Gannondorf, Zelda, and Link in Hyrule Temple! Even create a cute sense to the game with Pichu, Pikachu, Jigglypuff, my favorite character, or even that dumb...Mewtwo in the Pokemon Arena! There are hundreds of options to choose. Stock, time, team battle among others are back for game mode options, and now you have new SPECIAL game modes with such matches as hitting only the \"A\" button or even making your characters fight at lighting paces! One player can enjoy the game, but the fun comes with three or even better, four people! Two's good also. If you are a colorful, playful party gamer like me, then you'll love this game! If you worship Resident Evil or Fatal Frame, goths might freak! Above all, if you are not a hermit that's grumpy all day long or a sad person without buddies, then you'll find this game to be worth the investment and it will have a place in your Gamecube heart! By the way, get cheats off of the internet to find how to get all of the hidden characters. There are more than just the ones with question-marks on their mug!

Within about 10 minutes of playing the game and watching some scenes it becomes obvious the work and attention to detail that have been put into this game. The graphics, lighting and voice acting are everything we have come to expect from Naughty Dog and then some! The emotions and mannerisms displayed from the characters are so believable that it really makes you stop and think how you would respond if this scenario was unfolding around you. The character interactions are meaningful and entertaining...not just typical blah blah back and forth useless banter that you get in most games.The multiplayer is okay. It plays very similarly to Uncharted 3s multiplayer except there is much more depth and focus on the mode this time. It's not the reason I purchased The Last of Us, but I did have fun running around with my faction executing the opposition. Well, at least when I wasn't getting pummeled and having my head smashed by members of the opposing faction (did I mention this game has some graphic violence in it??).Overall, The Last of Us is quite possibly the best game to ever be released on current gen consoles. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I honestly can't see how anyone could rate this game less than 5/5. Yes, it's really that good! As you progress through the story mode, especially towards the middle portion...approximately 6-7 hours into it you will find yourself very emotionally invested into these characters. Just keep telling yourself it's just a game haha.

Where else can an average person have up to five dogs at once and still live a normal life?Once you get the hang of it the training for the dogs is a breeze, although I may just be picking the right dogs. The animation is fairly realistic as far as animal games go.The contest options are also fun. The disc competition is my favorite as it doesn't require you to speak perfectly, like the obedience competition, and the dogs seem to catch on quicker than they do with the agility competitions. Regardless, all three modes can be a fun way to earn more money to pamper your dogs and upgrade your living environment. I'm currently saving up for the most expensive home style.As you train your dogs, you also earn trainer points which unlock different dog breeds in the kennel. This is also a fun option, leaving you plenty of choices when choosing a new dog.My only dislike, however, is that Nintendogs runs on real time based on the clock option in your DS, making it a necessity to play every day if you want to keep your dogs happy while continuing to train them. If one's leisure time is limited, this could become an issue. Sometimes you have to neglect your dogs if you want/need to do other things, possibly leading to runaway dogs or who knows what else.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Silent Hill Fanatic Says: Hmmm...","reviewText":"To assume that the United States cannot do Horror as well as the Japanese is both inaccurate and snobbish: Stephen King, Wes Craven, \"The Shining\", \"It\", \"The Exorcist\", Stanley Kubrick, \"The Others\" and \"The Sixth Sense\" - Masters and Masterworks of the Genre, all straight out of the good old US of A.But to take something quintessentially Japanese and reinvent it a la Hollywood is simultaneously pointless and almost always unsuccessful: \"The Ring\" was pretty to look at but lost its creeping dread in an overblown, overexplained plot. \"Dark Water\" was brilliantly acted but lacked tension and punch.This change of development was my worry with \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\". In the wake of the abysmal (US-produced) Silent Hill movie, turning production of the fifth major installment of the franchise over to US Developers Foundation 9 and Double Helix made me think: Goodbye, Silent Hill, and hello, OMG Silent Hill LOL WTF??!?!??!I was wrong: overall, \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" is a mostly great game, and one definitely worthy of its heritage.GRAPHICS: 2.5/5Not good! In places (i.e. the Sewer level) the graphics of \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" are appalling: blocky textures, chunky modeling and some inexplicably sub-PS2 human characters (particularly wigs!) make for a major contrast to the beautifully-detailed and well-animated creatures inhabiting Shepherd's Glen. The PS3 is still a fairly new system, but there's been far better graphics on far older games so far (Uncharted, Ninja Gaiden, Condemned, Folklore and so forth) so there's really no excuse. Particularly not when many of the areas are highly detailed and well-designed. Silent Hill is a franchise known for stunning art direction and excellent character modeling - but this fifth entry in the series is no looker.That said, what's there is at least clear, and concise - it serves its purpose - and the bad guys are suitably chilling. Also, the real-time Otherworld changeover effects are pretty cool - though in short supply, I could have done with more of this - and many of the levels put across that classic, claustrophobic sense of the macabre that is so very Silent Hill. Overall, graphically speaking, this game is a real Plain Jane - parts are downright poor, parts are very effective: but it's certainly not up to scratch with other PS3 titles.SOUND: 4/5There's some excellent voice acting to behold in \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\", and this is complimented by some truly scary sound design. Remember in Silent Hill 2, where the occasional unexplained smashing of glass or scraping of a knife would send you into panic mode, only to intensify the fear a few rooms later when you discovered the source of the noise? Same here! Although it's better done: the ambient sounds and silences of \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" combine to make for an insanely tense aural experience.Music is standard Silent Hill fare: which means it's very, very good indeed. Akira Yamaoka once again comes up with the goods, supplying literal and conceptual tunes to unsettle the player and enhance the gaming experience - but for my money, Silent Hill 2 still rules the roost in this category. Still, \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" is a pleasure to hear.PLAYABILITY: 4/5Yes, the controls are sluggish. No, you can't invert the camera. Yes, it's old-school. Deal with it.I hate FPS games on console with a passion: I've lost out on Condemned and F.E.A.R. because my right analog stick aiming skills let me down every time, so I was dreading the control scheme in  \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\". Happily, it's uncluttered and easy to come to terms with, so even for an FPS luddite like me it's a simple task to get used to the player-controlled camera (click the R3 button twice and all resets itself with a minimum of fuss). Alex moves slowly and deliberately: get yourself chased by a Feral or a Lurker and you'll understand why - the tension this creates is worth the sluggish pace. Open spaces are not huge - there's no sense of boring plodding through endless streets because everywhere is so well-designed and populated with just enough baddies to negate boredom without creating frustration.Health items and ammo are in VERY short supply, so you will need to learn how to fight the various enemies properly using the melee weapons - but within this, there are several different strategies to come to grips with. For instance, the Needler needs to be handled with a fire axe and great caution, dodging and swinging only when you're sure he's not going to respond. But try this method out on an angry Siam and it won't be long before you're looking at a Game Over screen.With a deliberately limiting interface, utilitarian moves and a variety of melee fighting techniques to be mastered,  \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" is certainly the most whole and satisfying Silent Hill to date, in terms of controls. It's a huge improvement over the feeble \"Silent Hill: Origins\" PS2 port, and less anonymous and bland than \"Silent Hill 4: The Room\".LASTIBILITY: 3/5I go back to my Silent Hill games over and over again to experience the stories: the bleak and confusing terror of the original, the haunting melancholia of its sequel, the darkly gathering momentum of the third and the mysterious ambiguity of the fourth, I have played each title more times over the last ten years than I can count, like re-reading a favourite novel.And, sadly, this is one major area of importance where  \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" loses out: the plot is poor.Owing more to \"Jacob's Ladder\" than Silent Hill (in places the plagiarism is *very* blatant, particularly the opening scenes),  this tale of Alex Shepherd searching for his brother in the remains of what was once his hometown is fairly bog-standard: there are almost no references to the rich, detailed Silent Hill mythos that spawned the series' most memorable moments. This would even have been fine, had the writers tried to branch out and give us a new set of plot points, but they have not, and what we're left with having finished  \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" is a spun-out and too-thin retelling of other, better stories from other, better writers.That being said, while you're in the middle of it,  \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" is an engaging game: cutscenes and events come along in a timely and well-managed fashion, and do keep you engaged with the onscreen events - but shortly before the game's end you'll understand what I mean when I say the plot lets itself down with an easy way out.Replay value is severely hampered by this, too: sure, there are new weapons to use and multiple endings to see after the initial play-through - but it's nothing YouTube can't take care of.OVERALL: 3/5Disappointing in some areas and impressive in others,  \"Silent Hill: Homecoming\" is a real mixed bag. While it hasn't lost anything in the translation from East to West, it hasn't really gained anything, either. It's worth your while, though, particularly for fans of the series, and does give great hope for future sequels being produced outside of Konami Japan. It needed more horror, more story detail and a lot more Silent Hill, and it has failed to deliver these things - but what it does, it does mostly well.Make up your own mind: I enjoyed it and am not sorry I own it - but I can't call this a must-have.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZ49Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Joel McGee","summary":"So far so good","reviewText":"I've been looking at buying a new monitor for some time now. Nothing was particularly wrong with my old one, just thought it was time to get something more modern.I've spent some time on Amazon looking at the reviews, only find (much to my suprise) that this model has some considerable reliablity issues. People are complaining about black outs, and the unit not working within a month.Against my better judgement, I decided to take a chance on this diplay. The reason for my choice was that it was hard to find a display with that rich of a feature set for that low of a price ($180). Shopping around, I've had a lot of trouble finding a display that would be good for a LAN party. Most are simply monitors with no speakers (making it impractical) or be a TV with only 720p and a higher price to compensate for all the features that make it a TV. So apparently, it's pretty hard to find a TV/monitor that makes for a great display at a LAN party.So far I've had very few issues and am very happy with the display. Here's my take:PictureImpressive. I've upgraded from a 720p 23 in. Insignia monitor. My biggest gripe with the Insignia was the picture itsself. The PS display blows it out of the water, colors are much richer, the screen is brighter and the contrast is excellent. I have no issues with ghosting whatsoever. The 3D is impressive too. I would have preferred if the dispay used passive technology (for practically and affordability's sake) but it does look great regardless.SoundAcceptable. I say acceptable considering the size, they get the job done, but the speakers sound rather tinny and miss the highs and lows. I didn't expect much to be honest, but when I'm at a LAN party the speakers only have to function at a basic level, and when I'm using as a monitor, I have a much more impressive sounding 2.1 setup. My biggest issue is that there is no way to use both the computer speakers and the display speakers simultaneously. I have to manually switch as the computer doesn't support speakers in that fasion nor does the headphone jack, it mutes the sound when plugged in.PortsGood. There are 2 HDMI ports, 1 Component, and a headphone out port. This is perfect as I plan on occasionally hooking up a laptop or Xbox 360 when it's hooked up to my PC. The lack of VGA support may be a downer for some lacking a DVI or HDMI port on their device but there are adapters available if one were so inclined. There's a lack of audio ports for the HDMI if someone was adapting from DVI, so buyer beware. It's not an issue for me but it's worth noting. The component port works great (and has the audio jacks) but obviously doesn't look as good as HDMI, but it's great that I can hook up any last gen system provided I have the cables. One minor complaint, it would have been nice for the component input to double as a composite, as many of the newer televesions are doing, it would have made it more compatable across the board, but again, it really doesn't bother me. One thing to bear in mind, this is a \"display\", meaning, it's not a TV and not a monitor. TV's by definition have to have a tuner (amongst other things) and monitors have to have a VGA input, this has neither. There are work-arounds for both caveats but anyone looking to buy this should understand the term \"display\" before they puchase one.SetupGood. Its a fairly straghtforward setup. Three ports. HDTV's don't get much easier than that to set up the cables. I love that the ports are on the side and not underbelly or split into 2 groups. The menus are anther story. There easy to see and understand what settings are what, but the buttons are on the side rear, near the ports. You have a little on screen display to tell what's what, but it's a royal pain to navigate the menus. The lack of a remote makes this even more of a pain. You can buy a universal remote as the display supports it, but that is an extra cost.AppearanceSlick. I love the glossy black finish. The display is actually just about the right weight. It's heavy enought that it feels sturdy, but light enough to move it around. The speakers are well hidden, and the back is a metalic gray. It kinda looks like an oversized PSP to be honest.OverallI've only had the display for about a week now, but I've had no major issues as of yet. No black outs, not power loss. I still am watching it closely just because I know people have had issues. As of today I am generally pleased, but should anything arise I will update as needed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2012"}

The A.I. for the bad guys in the game is a little mixed,there will be times where they actually seem to think up new ways to outflank you and others where you could shoot one with an arrow and the guy standing beside him still doesn't notice anythings wrong.The storyplot is decent but overall generic too from the Tomb Raider series and one of the villains is pretty much the standard TR kind that's pretty cliche in pretty much any game.  The character designs were done very well looking extremely lifelike again especially when you compare the character designs from the previous three games.The game is an incredible action adventure game worth of the Tomb Raider name and while not perfect in some areas it's still one worth adding to your game library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

Big Brain Academy fit the bill relatively well--it features a total of 15 games and three difficulty levels that are great to relieve stress, take a quick break from something, or just sit down and enjoy.  The game does, however, have its limitations.The first, and most obvious, drawback to the game is that--well, there are only 15 games available.  While these are enjoyable it doesn't take too long to be craving something more, and I've found that this game plays well for short periods of time but isn't entertaining for more than about twenty to thirty minutes at a time.The inane chatter gets in the way sometimes too--I'd rather just focus on playing the games.  Does anyone really buy these things expecting a storyline or some sort of plot?  There are 3 modes of play--practice, test, and multiplayer--which provides some variety in the gameplay as well.  The test mode selects a game from each of the five categories and gives you an overall \"brain weight\"--basically a score you can work on improving--and draws a graph showing which areas you were strongest and weakest in.It's great to have a game like this for a handheld.  Big Brain is great for killing 15 minutes of time in a waiting room or while you're waiting for someone to arrive, etc, but I wouldn't plan on long stretches of entertainment (at least for me).

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Daneker","summary":"Limited games, low definition, unique control.","reviewText":"It's been more than 2 years and I finally walked into a store that had the Wii in stock, when I had enough cash. I remember back when it was first released going weekly to get one and leaving empty handed until I gave up, bought a PS3.So, what does a Wii do and is it worth it?Well, as you most likely know the Wii has taken motion sensor to the next level, meaning you can't play a Wii game sitting still. That's okay, playing Zelda there's a certain satisfaction in swinging your arm and hitting something on the screen, it's also hard after two or three hours of questing to keep feeling like doing it.I have three made-for-Wii games, Zelda, Fit & Sports. So far I enjoy all three (I have Metroid on the way) but we have limited room, so it's not always easy to play.Originally I wanted The Twilight Princess because I've been addicted to Zelda since the first game on the NES when I was in Jr. High School. I could have played on GC but I have a 42\" Widescreen and playing the 4:3 Game Cube version just wasn't satisfying on the big screen.I really like Twilight Princess, however, other than the Widescreen output I can't suggest the the Wii version is better than the GC, the graphics are only marginally clearer (I played the GC and Wii version on the Wii, which makes them both 16:9 and from 10 feet back they looked nearly identical.) Except, I actaully find the Wii version less challenging, swinging the controler is more responsive than button mashing, but you only swing it an inch or so, and it can wear on your arm over the hours most of us would play a game like this, even with breaks.Wii Sports looks like Super Nintendo graphics, it's that bad. The games are marginally fun, but repetitive, it's like playing demos at a trade show. The kids like them, but they do not have long lasting interest.Wii Fit is the real gem. The games are challenging, the graphics not much better than Wii Sports, but they are addicting challenges and after 30 - 40 minutes of really trying you get a decent stretch and resistance workout - but not hard and fast. It's a good tone and slowburn workout, it's engaging and it keeps you moving and balancing.And that's the three main uses of the Wii, albeit the adventure game side is lacking, most of the available games are excersise, sports and childrens.The graphics are only 480p, which is sad. The XBox 360 is not hi-def, but it does offer HD resolution output and HDMI on the high-end model. Having a PS3 for a year, the Wii is like a technology downstep. You can't compare the Wii graphics to games like Eternal Sonata or Uncharted. Plus, since I and many others now use an HDMI switch for all our Video/Audio, it's a pain to have to have the extra wires and switching. The only time I have to change the input on my TV is for the Wii, all my other componets are HDMI through my reciever.The sound is not dolby surround, not 5.1! That's equivelant to a Laser Disk from 20 years ago, it's the same as the GC and you can only use analog RCA output, no otpical or coax.The Wii comes with a composite video (1 yellow jack) that only supports 480i @ 4:3 aspect -- that's really bad! You have to but a component (EGB) cable seperate for $10 - $30 to get 480p 16:9, I was really made when I got home and realized I had not progresive output or widescreen.There are pros:The Wii outputs any progressive scan GC game in 16:9, so you have the Zeda Bonus disk? Play the first Zelda in Widescreen! I have to admit, Ocarena of Time & Windwaker never looked better! I tried every GC disk I have and they all played at 16:9 or 16:10 and looked and sounded better than the GC.Also you can download games from Nintendo from all previous systems but GC, including Saturn and Turbo Graphics 16 for $5 to $15 and save them to an SD card. However, you can only put up to a 2 gig SD card in because it doesn't handle SDHC.The next Wii will most likely be the one to buy. Hopefully, since it's unlikely Sony will licence Blu-Ray to Nintendo or Microsoft the next gen consoles will use Toshiba's HD-DVD for extra disk space and Wii-II will have 1080p output via HDMI with 5.1 LPCM sound -- like PS3 does already.Sure, the price is better than PS3 @ $250, it's the same as low-end XBox 360, but the games available don't include Action-Adventure or RPG (you have a total of 5 titles in 2+ years in those catagories) but it gives your GC library a facelift, offers the Wii Fit (an extra $100) and will entertain the kids. But the graphics are 5 years dated, the sound mediocre and the controller doesn't even come with a rechargable battery!All in all the Wii is one of a kind, but it's severly flawed and you have to ask yourself, what do I want it for and will I get real play and use from it. You also have to remember that an extra set of controllers will cost $60.00, Wii Fit will cost $100 and those Rock-Band instruments are expensive as well. there's no Hard Drive option and the most memory you can add to save downloaded games is 2 gigs.I like the Wii, but I don't love it. I'm only a casual gammer, a hard-core would likely laugh at it. It's good for a family if you have the money for extra controlers (3 complete controlers plus batteries and chargers will run $200 easy!!!) It has wireless networking but no MMOG's and for RPG fans it's a bust! It won't look great on a TV over 32\" and will look decent to terrible on a 50+\" set. There's no digital out, at all! And out of the box it only sets up at 480i @ 4:3 resolution.It's high-tech control, low-tech gaming. Not for everyone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2007"}

I'm not finished with the game, so I cannot give an expert, overall review.  What I can do is describe the game for what I've seen thus far.Graphically, the game on XBOX360 looks utterly amazing.  The landscapes, the NPCs, the birds flying in the sky and every being in the game look amazing.  The feel of the terrain and the light of the sun are perfect.  Nowadays, most \"next-gen\" games look very good anyhow, but the frame rate you get even with hundreds of characters on screen is simply breathtaking.  When you go into a viewpoint cut scene, which opens up map areas, you'll be simply stunned by the outlay of the world beneath you.  Even after doing it a twentieth or thirtieth time, it never gets old and always stuns.The gameplay itself is very good.  As an assassin in 1191AD, you must carry out orders and kill 9 people.  Each assassination requires an investigation to be performed and a city to be explored.  The cities, Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem are based on their real life counterparts throughout the years of the crusade.  As you conduct your investigqation you'll need to pickpocket people whom carry documents you need, eavesdrop on conversations and interrogate people in private where you cvan beat a confession out of them.  All of this takes place under the watchful eyes of the cities guards, whom will attack at the slightest criminal offense.  When you carry out your kills, a deep, dark story unravels and even incudes portions taking place 1,000 years in the future.  Yes, the future, as there is alot more to this story than anyone expected at release.The mechanics of the game are fluid and responsive.  Fighting is not difficult and certain assassination manuevers look very pleasing and satisfy your thirst for the revenge that you'll eventually seek on people such as guards, beggars and henchmen.  You'll acquire a bunch of moves each time you progress the story, try them out in the battleground and off you go to carry out your next order.The game has been fabulous for me thus far, and if the next half is anywhere near as good as the first half, I have a lot to look forward to.  Being that this game is supposedly part of a trilogy, I'm sure the anticipation for the next chapter is going to swell unbelievably as I get closer to completing it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2007"}

Fans of the original Star Wars Battlefront will also enjoy an all-new single-player experience that takes players through an epic story-based saga where every action the player takes impacts the battlefront and ultimately the fate of the Star Wars galaxy.Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game s single-player experience with open-ended mission-based objectives inspired from all six Star Wars films. The pelling storyline spans more than 16 new locations many from the Episode III movie including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments plete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia s blockade runner the Tantive IV as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition at certain key moments within the battles players can earn the opportunity to wield a lightsaber and use the Force as a Jedi.For the first time ever Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space bat and during the same battle board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship players can enter the starcraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there they can dock within the enemy s capital ship overtake the ship s mand posts man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within!

Players can locate their buddies and track their stats as they battle alongside more player","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A Must-Have for any PS2 Gamer","reviewText":"Star Wars Battlefront II is a great sequel to a wonderful game. Numerous game balance issues have been remedied, and new features bring interesting challenges.First, the basic premise. This game is all about massive scale battles on pretty much any location thought of in the Star Wars universe. You can run around the streets of Tattoine, jumping from sandstone building to building, mowing down rebel forces. You can explore Hoth, fighting off the snow. Even the meteorite featured for a few seconds when Padme gave birth is here.With this wealth of locations, you also get a huge selection of unit types. There are traditional stormtroopers, snowtroopers, sandtroopers. You get jawas and tuskan raiders.  You can even play as a jedi for a short period of time, to give your team an edge.There are all sorts of game modes to play in. There's Galactic Conquest which gives you a giant galaxy map of the planets, and you move fleets of ships across them, taking on one planet at a time. Your aim of course is to take them all over. There's cool games like capture the flag and hunt, for quick, fun gameplay.I love the fact that the world is so in depth. For example, you can be flying your shuttle in space, dodging laser bullets from other ships, with a planet spinning below. If you fly your shuttle into an enemy ship, you can actually hop out and start running around IN the ship, shooting out the troops. You can even attack the systems of the ship - like the shields and engines - to damage the ship. In the background you can see other battles going on, giving your actions an epic feel.It's important to note that this is not an EASY game. There is a lot to learn here. You can switch characters on the fly, earn points to unlock items, earn bonusses mid-game to upgrade weapons, and much more. It's really key to do the training missions and understand how this all works.The graphics are really stunning. The textures on the building, the character models, the general look and feel of each world, was clearly done with an eye to detail. The sound is equally good, providing the original sound styles from the Star Wars world to draw you in to the environment.Highly, highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2005"}

Best of all, they're backwards compatible with DS Lite, so the kids don't have to throw away their old games.Parents, do not worry about the children. Nintendo has thought about us. Strong parental control features are built right in. I can allow or deny every function the children can access.

Of course, I have to tell my kids to put me on that screen first, but it's pass code protected from them.

I really enjoy the free roam stuff in all the AC games and this one is no exception. Graphics are gorgeous. However, I do have a few beefs with the gameplay this time around. First - In Brotherhood, after trying a few, I avoided the TRON-like training sessions because \"hey\" they were ugly and zero fun. Now they have been dumbed down and integrated into the main storyline plus they take the place of the cool little Animus puzzles. Recovering Desmond's memories is enough to make me want to forget mine. Second - raised Templar Awareness triggers a Den Defense game. This little mini game is not something that I signed up for. Give me a sword and let me fight, I don't want to play some little tower defense game better suited as a mobile phone app. Next, the fighting is getting old - meaning, anyone who finished the first AC will have no problem kicking butt on any of the subsequent games. The only new things are bombs and a few ziplines (for getting around). The bombs are next to useless but apparently got all the developers pretty excited. 90% of the treasure is now some bomb ingredient that you don't need.

Final Fantasy encompasses everything that a final fantasy title should, and still manages to innovate, thus making the game completely different in every aspect from the last. It is impossible to truly explain all this game has to offer in the 1,000 word maximum, but here's my best shot.Since telling the storyline to all you readers would ruin the fun, I will tell you about some of the better features. there is a new method of leveling up your character, and there really are no levels at all. you are given sphere levels, which can then be traded for a move on the huge sphere grid. The grid is somewhat like a giant maze, with each stop containing a sphere. These spheres can contain defense power ups. strength power ups, and even be blank so that you can fill them in with your own choice of defense, strength, luck, and so forth.Tidus is the star player of the local Blitz ball team, the Zanarkand Abes. Blitz ball is a game played inside of a suppenended ball of water, and is somewhat like soccer in its idea, but then again is completely different. A whole set of rules has been made for this game, and you actually play through it to gain items. This shows off a theme that has carried through most final fantasy titles, mini games. You can play blitz ball, race chocobos (a type of large, rideable bird), and countless other time consuming mini gamesin conclusion, this is only the very tip of the iceberg. There are countless things to be said on this epic game. The storyline is top notch, and there are countless things to unlock. Pick it up as a rental first, many people don't like the turn based action this game has (although it only helps you toward strategizing as best you can.)

{"product_name":"B0002CNUN0","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"HOW do they do it?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"Tony Hawk defines the phrase \"old school\" in the realm of professional skating-his accomplishments and exploits are legendary. Hawk's notoriety is also attributed to the franchise of video games that bear his name, and it's very appropriate that his latest, Tony Hawk Underground 2, is in its own rights \"old school,\" thanks to its solid, familiar gameplay and the inclusion of Classic Mode. Okay, before getting nostalgic and teary-eyed, THUG 2 isn't a rehash of Pro Skater's glory days, quite the contrary-it's a wild two team, six-city romp around the world as you create a persona and shred it up with the Birdman, Bam Margera, and a motley crew of skating degenerates in the World Destruction Tour. The gist of the WDT is simple: accumulate points by completing an exhausting list of objectives to unlock other parts of the globe. Along the way, playable special guests like hot-rodder Jesse James and a host of skating pros lend a hand, board, or customized ride to further help your team's cause. As with THUG, the environments are pretty expansive and there's no time limit, leaving you free to map out the level and systematically complete the prescribed tasks. However, there's nothing in THUG 2 that should surprise anyone remotely familiar with the gameplay: see it, skate it, thrash it, or bash it-we're talking places and people. Like the Hawks before it, THUG 2 introduces new control features that up the ante on the already exciting action, the most significant being Focus Control. Once activated, all the action is slowed to a virtual crawl, enabling you to combo the more complex tricks and aid in completing goals that require miraculous tightrope-type grinds. Also in the mix is the Freak Out move, which lets you start a combo by throwing a tantrum after eating asphalt. The Story mode and unparalleled customization features aside, such as the new Create-a-Graphic feature and the ability to implement your face into the game via the PlayStation 2 EyeToy (sorry Xboxers), THUG 2 also includes Classic Mode-yep, the two-minute timer and the all-time favorite goals like spelling S-K-A-T-E and finding the secret tape are back! In addition to the levels found within the game, there are also a host of levels from the previous Pro Skater games to make you feel all warm and cozy inside. Three words: outstanding replay value! Technically, THUG 2 is an exceptional game thanks to great sound, which includes a topnotch soundtrack; outstanding controls; and, aside from some awkward clipping, crisp graphics. Both the Xbox and PS2 versions compare favorably in every department and the only advantage at all lies with the PS2 version, but only because of its online components. If there's a reason to get excited about the franchise again, THUG 2 is definitely it. The Story Mode is decidedly different in that it doesn't feel like a rehash of THUG and the inclusion of Classic Mode is brilliant-that's without accounting for the expansive customizable and multiplayer options. Simply put, this game is skating nirvana.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2004"}

You couldn't really blame the developers for overlooking the now-ancient PS2 technological limits for something more flash like the new-gen consoles, and yet, those geniuses at Crystal Dynamics and Eidos have really taken great pains with this to remake it into something different, new and fun.GRAPHICS: 5/5When I first played TR: Legend, I had several honest-to-god \"Wow!\" moments because of the gorgeous visuals. \"Tomb Raider Anniversary\" gave me more than that, it couples the \"Wow!\" factor with a hefty dose of nostalgia and some insanely detailed models that are totally reminiscent of the feel of the original 1996 game, while still managing to be new and fresh and engaging. Level design is changed to accommodate Lara's new movement style, but are still recognizable enough to make us fans of the original game grin from ear-to-ear with the familiarity of the settings. For example: the water-filled subterranean room in The Great Pyramid is so nostalgic as to be breathtaking, but requires a whole new thought process and set of puzzle solutions to traverse. Similarly, St. Francis' Folly, arguably the first level in the history of video games that really proved theworth of the 3D environment, looks so familiar, but plays very differently. The upshot of this is a game that will not only thrill newcomers, but will make us old-time Tomb Raiders sit back and remember exactly why we fell so much in love with Lara Croft in the first place.Character and monster designs are, as you'd expect after TR: Legend, simply beautiful, only now more so: this is certainly the most beautiful incarnation of Lara to date, and all of her co-stars in this adventure are great examples of what can still be achieved when talented people program for the PS2. The only exception, oddly, is Jacqueline Natla - she looks more supernatural than before, and less plausible - but that's just some odd character design, not badly executed graphics.SOUND: 5/5As with the graphics, the sound designers of \"Tomb Raider Anniversary\" must be praised excessively for creating an aural atmosphere that will grab and entertain not only newbies to this series, but that will also make fans of the series remember the original atmosphere with delight. Gone is Lara's PDA - no interruptions from colleagues pepper the silence of the tombs and jungles here - and the music is a brilliantly re-imagined rendition of the original's themes.PLAYABILITY: 5/5I know I've been walking down memory lane here for a while - this game is just so across-the-board reminiscent of the original - but where this updated version of \"Tomb Raider\" really comes into its own is with the control system. It's basically the same brilliant engine as TR: Legend, but rejigged and tightened to make \"Tomb Raider Anniversary\" an absolute joy to play. You won't be falling to your death or making silly mistakes because of controls (the camera, as with all 3D games, does cause some moments of frustration, however these are few and far between), and Lara in combat mode is now a much more challenging and rewarding thing: you can't just point and shoot anymore, you really do need to think.LASTIBILITY: 4/5This game is tougher and longer than TR: Legend, so it's nice to see that Crystal Dynamics really listened to the critics of the 2005 game - levels are bigger, there are more of them, enemies are tougher with a progressive difficulty curve, and traps and puzzles are now more involved, with far more emphasis on Lara's (and your) acrobatic ability.But it's still a little short.It's MUCH better than TR: Legend - a twelve to fourteen-hour playtime the first time you go through it, and as before, there are multiple ways to complete a level, and multiple rewards for doing so, particularly in time trial mode, but it's still a bit too short. The reason I love the original TR games on the PSOne is for their longevity - this game, while absolutely breathtaking in all other areas, is still no match for the length of the first three.Still, compared to most contemporary videogames, it's absolutely fine, and in and of itself is a rewarding and challenging game, full of respectful nods to the original, and full of new tricks and features to keep us all entertained.OVERALL: 4.5/5Buy it now. I can't recommend it highly enough, \"Tomb Raider Anniversary\" is a stunning game. If you liked the original, or if you're just curious to see what all the fuss is about, \"Tomb Raider Anniversary\" represents the pinnacle of Lara Croft's exploits, both technically and artistically.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2007"}

Fans of the classic and newcomers alike will delight at the unique game play options that the bionic arm afford.","reviewerName":"M. Donnelly","summary":"Not a User-Friendly Game","reviewText":"Bionic Commando was a game I really looked forward to for a while.  It has a lot of potential, since it essentially looks like a fast-paced, action-packed version of Spiderman 2.  I say this because web-swinging was revolutionary in Spiderman 2, so it's the best comparison I can make.I was sorely let down with the gameplay in Bionic Commando, however.  First off, the controls took a while to get used to.  Nothing was quite fluid enough to enjoy for quite some time, and even after I got the hang of things, I wasn't really enjoying it the way I expected to.  Just expect to die.  A lot.  I'm a seasoned gamer, I play my systems every day, and I love a challenge, dating back to Contra on the NES.  But this game wasn't challenging, it was irritating.  Things just don't work the way you want them to at most times.I would imagine if I played this game for about a month every single day for at least an hour or two, I might be more comfortable with it.  However, I'm not willing to invest 60 hours of \"work\" in trying to enjoy a video game.  I respect those who have overcome this barrier, but if I'm paying for a video game to entertain me, it should entertain me out of the box, in my opinion.  Learning curves are okay, but this game simply was not FUN in playing it--and I did try to enjoy it for many hours.Overall, the 3D rejuvenation of Bionic Commando is hardly rejuvenating at all.  It leads to a great deal of frustration, because swinging and combat just don't control well enough in 3D space.  The game was great in 2D, but in 3D a better team needs to work on the controls to make this one shine.  It has the potential, but just doesn't deliver.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

I thought the graphics were good, the gameplay was good, and well, I couldn't really find many problems with the game. My favorite thing about it is that it's first person and there is no health bar or ammo meters on the screen which kinda makes the game more realistic. It's the first game I've ever played that's like that. Another great aspect to the game is that there are some levels where you play as Kong, and no matter how good the gameplay is, if you can play as Kong, THAT'S AWSOME!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2006"}

Stone","summary":"Excellent game but I have pet peeves","reviewText":"Great game with some cons.Most have already covered the pros extensivelyPros: Long single player (if you play medium stealthy)Really nice art/graphics except for faces.Solid story.Unique but not complicated.Cons:When you learn where enemies are and already know how to solve problems it should take a way a bit of the games re-playability.  However, this games single player took me 17 hours which is excellent (I played stealthy and mixed lethal and non lethal options and was awarded the best ending).  Also, there are multiple pathways to each objective so i'll be playing through this twice and buying DLC's.The collectable items that upgrade your gear aren't very powerful.  Only thing I really needed was faster reload with crossbow and seeing through walls. The other 10-20+ rune or bone powers are kind of useless.  Also, I can only hold 10 sleep darts?The faces of NPCs are below average modern day quality but that didn't really bother me.  I wish there was more character development in regards to members of the pub gang.The flooded district really pissed me off.  I think i died or had to reload over 50 times.  Also spent tons of time trying to figure out how to recover my gear.  The answer was simple in hindsight but ultra frustrating.  Blowing my cover happened wayyyy too often but I guess that's my fault.  I didn't realize the river monsters that shoot goo at you were killable for a while either so they pissed me off pretty solidly.The party level may have a bug where the guards attack you after you trespass upstairs whether they caught you or not.The mystery guy who occasionally springs up and explains things seems to only have one motion.. Fold his arms and occasionally lift a hand up.  It was funny after a while.  They really phone that one in.  No character development in regards to him either.  He's just some kind of supernatural power guy.Repetition of sentences.  Amazing how 10 guys are getting their own squads due to last night.I wasn't invited into the tub with whatsherface.  Does she even know who I am bro?Short ending scene finale that I wasn't thrilled with.Overall, 9/10 game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2014"}

It seems like the annual release of the next installment in the iconic first-person shooter series should be a national holiday, given how many people attend the midnight launches for the game and no doubt skipped work or school the next day (myself included). Having hit the apex of popularity with Modern Warfare 2, the big question is how Black Ops will compare. I don't live and die by COD games as some people do, but I can say that Black Ops is one of the most satisfying and intense shooters I've ever played, with the best campaign out of all the games in the series and a multiplayer aspect that I can finally enjoy.Perhaps I'm the odd one, but I mainly buy these games for the single-player campaign as I am not the best at online shooters. The campaign in Black Ops is easily the best out of the series, with more cohesive storytelling and a more satisfying conclusion than the previous entries. Set in the Cold War era (early to late 1960's), you fight your way through diverse terrain in Russia, Cuba, and Vietnam, among other locations. As with other games in the series, you play as two main characters and you go back and forth between their missions. Without giving too much away, the story is pretty stock, but the manner in which it's told and presented is a big step forward for the COD series, which has lately felt like a batch of multiplayer games with a brief single-player campaign tacked on. Black Ops gives players a better experience in this regard, and despite being brief (7 hours roughly), it doesn't feel too short or seem to end as abruptly as the Modern Warfare games. The difficulty settings are standard for the series, and for achievement/trophy hunters, the biggest rewards come when playing on \"Veteran\" difficulty.The style of gameplay, the weapons and the linear design is all par for the course, but Treyarch has done a wonderful job at bringing this era and the surroundings to life. The cinematic quality that made Modern Warfare 2 such a hit is still intact here, and the graphics and sound are as amazing as you would expect. What I've always enjoyed about the COD games are the tight controls, and Black Ops will fit like a glove for any FPS fan. The multiplayer, undoubtedly the biggest day of Black Ops, is surprisingly accessible for people like me who typically get owned when going online. The focus is on class creating and experience points, and while I've only played a couple of hours, everything seems to run smoothly and without lag. My only fear is that the usual frustrations, such as campers and rude teenagers acting like idiots, will eventually creep in, but I'll be optimistic and see how things play out.I don't believe in gushing over games and hailing them as the \"Best Game EVAR!\", so I'll avoid hyperbole and simply say that Black Ops one of the better FPS games that I've played. If I have any negative feedback, it surrounds some of the difficulty spikes and the dumb-as-bricks AI of your teammates (and some enemies), but that was the same case with Modern Warfare 2 and especially World at War. Black Ops is not a perfect game graphically and it doesn't reinvent the wheel for FPS games, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying experience that I don't regret investing the time or money into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
