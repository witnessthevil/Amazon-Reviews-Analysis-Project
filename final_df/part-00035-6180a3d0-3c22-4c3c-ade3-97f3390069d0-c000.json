{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Griswel","summary":"Back to the Future","reviewText":"As a fan of the original, it was tough getting my hopes up again.  Prior attempts to re-boot the game were not successful.  If you haven't played the old X-Com, this is a squad combat game where your troops progress in equipment and skills as you fight your way through a series of battles.  Combat is turn-based, and troops can retain the ability to react to enemy movements by not using up all of their time on a turn.There are some definite improvements on the original.  First off, the game looks great.  The cut scenes are excellent and the combat zones look great.  There's a somewhat limited view, but that's because you see only what your squad sees.  The special abilities of your troops make for an even better strategy experience in combat.  Some troops can finish their action with a shot, giving you a chance to point-blank the enemy if they've moved.  Some are pointmen due to their reflexes, some snipers, some heavy weapons.  The game rewards planning and using your mix of skills properly.  The terrain is deformable, i.e. you can blow stuff up.  This was a big part of the original.  Why search a building for the enemy when you have a rocket launcher to blow the walls off?  It's fun (and effective).It's not a perfect game.  The 'top' part of the game, the overall strategy, is much less flexible and involved than it used to be.  For most players this is probably a plus, but some will miss it, especially base design.  On the other hand, no more picking up clips and doing other scrounging or inventory management and packing.  The game is not going to be as long some other X-box titles, but hopefully there will be DLC to add to the play life of X-Com.All in all this is the game X-Com fans have anticipated for a decade or more now.  The type of game isn't for everyone, but if you liked the original X-Com, or you're a fan of squad-based strategy games, this will make you very happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2012"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Play it again for the first time, well, again...","reviewText":"The early Final Fantasy games only got better with each proceeding installment, and Final Fantasy II improved somewhat on the first game that started the most popular RPG franchise, well, ever.  Like the first Final Fantasy anniversary game to get released for the PSP, Square has re-made Final Fantasy II for Sony's portable; updating the graphics, adding a few extras, and leaving the somewhat stale gameplay intact.  The graphics and animations have been updated for the modern age, and they look gorgeous on the PSP's screen.  Not to mention that the loading times are noticibly shorter than they were for the first Final Fantasy anniversary game, but the buggy leveling system and the constant, random battles are by far the game's biggest annoyance, and really bring down this port.  Not to mention that not too long ago, Square ported re-makes of the first two games in one cartridge as Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls for the GBA, which retailed for the same price as either of the two PSP games.  Sure the graphics are updated, yet somehow, Dawn of Souls was more enjoyable.  If you don't own Dawn of Souls or any of the previous Final Fantasy collections and you're craving some old school RPG action on the go, you could do a lot worse than this.  Then again, if you're more used to the Final Fantasy games or RPG's of today, chances are you probably won't dig this too much.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2007"}

This time, it's real bad.","reviewText":"My most anticipated launch title for the PlayStation 4 was Battlefield 4. And now that it's out, I want to return it and get something less broken. This is a review for the game before the patch but I felt I needed to get a warning out for excited Battlefield fans: this game rarely works currently. I'm not just talking about the multiplayer either. The single player is bugged as well. If you happen to crash (which you probably will), you'll be treated with a nice message about your save file being corrupted. It's a bit disappointing given the hype they put out for it. Is it sad that I'm actually loving Call of Duty: Ghosts more than this? At least the game runs and works correctly, regardless of the resolution patch it needed right at the start.When the game isn&#8217;t crashing, I was able to try out the party chat with friends to get ready for some epic&#8230; team deathmatch. That&#8217;s because currently the Conquest modes are all busted which is the best mode in the Battlefield series. In the menu, they&#8217;ve managed to remove key elements in the game that make it easier to join as a group online. No more party mode (yet). That means you have to join a friend&#8217;s game in the multiplayer menu and then hope you&#8217;re on the same team. But that&#8217;s not all! You&#8217;re more than likely not even going to join your friend&#8217;s game because that menu is messed up too. Today, the one time I got into a game it just quit after moving around. See the video here: [...]Stay away from Battlefield 4. It&#8217;s a broken mess right now, even on PC and current gen systems. EA is promising a patch next week.

Modern Warfare itself was a really great game.  In my opinion MW2 set a new standard in first person shooters.  The graphics were spot on, the play was very smooth, and you can tell much thought was put into the maps, weapons, and all other aspects of the game.So why do I rate it 3 stars?  Well I will start with the special ops modes.  It seems that Infinity Ward was trying to play on the success of Treyarch's Nazi Zombie mode in World at War.  Not only was the special ops mode fun for all of 5 minutes, they made unlocking new stages extremely hard.  So yeah, play through a mission or two, can't unlock anything new, give up.  Just not enough really going on to keep you coming back.Campaign mode was excellent.  A good story line that captured your attention and made you say \"wow, this should be a movie\".  The levels were all unique and fun, and there was very little \"filler\" content (unlike Black Ops...OMG) A+ job, I personally really enjoyed it.Ok now what everyone wants to know about, the online multiplayer.  MW2 tackled the party and lobby problem head on.  Everyone stayed together, no lag outs, even the host migration feature was nice.  Enough game modes to keep things fresh, perks, pro perks, great guns (some of my favorite guns in real life made it into this game), wild killstreaks...nothing really to complain about on how the game itself was designed.  I played it non stop for weeks after it came out.  That is, until the cheaters came out.  For some reason MW2 spawned a mass outbreak of cheaters, hackers, glitchers, and exploiters of all kinds.  Eventually I got fed up with the online play.  Lag switches, aim bots, rapid fire controllers, wall hacks, teleporting, commando pro, barrier glitches blah blah blah it got to where it was unplayable.  I don't know how it is now, but I got rid of it. It seems like they even gave up on patches for this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2011"}

A pepper grinder gives you an option for ranged combat and feels almost like a pepper grinder gun (especially the manual aim). A teapot canon, clockwork bombs and the Hobby horse are a few more weapons at Alice's disposal.  Throw in the ability for weapon upgrades via teeth collected off enemies and you have a simple but effective combat system.  Alice also has the ability to shrink which helps you fit through keyholes and see secrets.The game also has a nice mix of platforming and puzzle solving.  The platforming element comes from Alice's ability to jump-float and triple jump essentially.  Chaining these features together you can help Alice platform across the shattering Wonderland.  It is this area where the gameplay tends to weaken I feel.  While the platforming is acceptable and the puzzles are not that bad, in the end it does become a bit repetitive.  The reason for this is that the game doesn't change it up enough for the platform/puzzle segments.  Despite the repetitious nature though, the platforming and puzzles do a good job spreading out the combat, so the game doesn't end up becoming a hack n' slash.  The only \"true\" gripe here is the camera.  The camera tends to give you bad angles at times or might prevent you from noticing that moving gear has well.. MOVED out of the way.  While the camera is not terrible, you could find yourself fighting with the camera from time to time during platforming segments.GRAPHICSThe graphics here don't look half bad.  While they are not going to blow your mind the graphics engine is quite acceptable.  What really blows my mind is the art style here.  There is a beauty about this game with a shadow over it.  A bit like a Tim Burton movie but with more of a twisted, demented persona to it.  The world is colorful yet violent at the same time making for a very immersive experience.  I did notice some texture pop-in problems** at times but it was very rare.  Frame-rate is good with only a few moments where it dips below 30 FPS, often when the camera is forcing a very odd angle during a cut-scene segment.  Gameplay is not affected.SOUND/STORYThe Sound Effects are above average in my book.  The world is immersive and sounds as good as it looks.  Music sets the tone just right and the voice acting is excellent.  The storyline also comes across very strong.  It is deep, disturbing yet artistic. While it won't have you at the edge of your seat it will surely keep you wanting to move forward to find out what is going to happen next.REPLAY/LENGTHReplay value for this game really comes down to how much you truly loved the game.  I for one could easily play through this game a few times, especially since it boasts GAME+ mode.  It also has a variety of difficulty settings and the ability to stage select to gather collectibles.  My first run took me around 12-14 hours to complete which is not a bad length for this kind of game.  You certainly get your $$$'s worth in gameplay.OVERALL 84% (8.4) .. BAlice: Madness Returns is a strong game. Despite the platforming feeling re-used a bit to much(lack of variety) the game is definitely a title worth owning.  The gameplay is solid, the artwork is fantastic and it boasts strong replay if you enjoy these kind of games.  Throw in a fairly decent storyline, and DLC outfits and weapons, you have yourself a strong title worth the price of admission.**NOTE: New Copies of Alice: Madness Returns will should include a code to give you American McGee's Alice free of charge!**NOTE: Texture pop-in problems also have been occurring on the 360 version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004CDBP9G","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"a fun, imaginative, different, polished game","reviewText":"The first time I saw an Alice game was when this was featured in an edition of Qore.  I'm glad to say it has lived up to my expectations.  Over 80 reviews are already up, so I'll skip the plot and go straight to the gameplay.There's a lot of platform jumping in this game, which is free of frustration thanks to Alice's double jumping and gliding abilities.  If you do miss a moving platform or otherwise plunge to your death, you won't have to sit through a loading screen.  Alice screams as she falls, then a moment later you are returned to the last place you had solid footing.  There are no frustrating do-overs in this game at all.  There's also no backtracking worth mentioning.  If you do get stuck, you can use Alice's shrink vision, which lets her see everything from clues to invisible platforms that let her advance, as well as gaining the ability to pass through keyholes to access secret areas.In addition to platforming, there are many hidden areas and goodies throughout the game.  It reminded me of finding invisible 1-up boxes in Super Mario Bros. back in the day.  You are rewarded for exploring with \"memories\" of Alice as she tries to piece her mind back together.  These memories are quotes from people in her life and gradually help fill in the story.  They are hidden creatively or placed on a high platform you must find a way to reach.  Looking for them is actually part of the fun rather than being a shallow way to extend the game.  Hidden areas also have \"teeth\", which are the currency used to upgrade your weapons.The game itself is quite long but never feels tedious.  While it takes a while for variation in enemies to show up, each of the six chapters has a very unique style about it, and Alice's outfit even changes to complement them.  For $2 you can download DLC of extra outfits, each of which are very cool looking with lots of detail, and each also gives her some extra power, as well as upgraded weapons.  I played the game on normal and while strategy is needed, I never felt overwhelmed.  You can hold L1 to target enemies, and I never had any meaningful camera issues.  Thankfully you also cannot be nudged off ledges during combat, nor do combo attacks send you to any cheap deaths.  The designers really managed to make this game \"accessible\" without it being insultingly easy.I won't recap the story or spoil anything, so let's just say it's dark and earns its mature rating.  This is most certainly not drawn from the animated Disney version of Alice in Wonderland I grew up with.  There's a bit of cursing and some blood, but honestly I think anyone teen and up could play it without being traumatized; none of the enemies in the game are even human.In conclusion, if you like good platforming, lots of hidden areas to find, a few light puzzles, solid combat, a compelling story and creativity at every turn, this is a must own.  I have finished the game once and never experienced a single bug, glitch or crash.  If you're deciding between this and some other game, go with Alice.  That overhyped FPS you're looking at will still be there later.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2011"}

I have one of the designs of the xenomorphs that Giger did tattooed as a sleeve on my arm, I love 'em.  This game was something that I've been anxiously awaiting the release of.  I woke up on release day to read how horrible this game was, the graphics, etc... but I still said that I'm an Aliens fan so I'll pick up my reserve of it and try to love it the best I can.  Yeah...easier said than done.  The graphics are beyond laughable.  There is this canister on the ground that from a distance looks cool all lit up, something ala Dead Space the stomp containers...but when you get close to it, the lights are so pixelated and blocky that it doesn't even look like a light, it's terrible.  Now apply that little detail to the rest of the game.  It looks horribly unfinished, the mouths don't even move the right way when the characters talk.  The dialogue is very stiff almost like people were held at gunpoint when reading their lines.  The action is either predictable or stupid.  There's no bullet detection when you shoot the aliens, they just got covered in their blood and fall over.  The only redeeming part of this game is that my game stop gave me a full refund on it.  Now, I don't hate it....but I wouldn't pay more than 20 dollars for this......WHICH is probably going to be sooner than later it will be that cheap.  So I urge people to of course, gather your own opinion on this, but as a hardcore gamer and huge Aliens fan, this missed the mark by a few lightyears.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}

The camera control and angles can get annoying at times but is nothing that will hinder the gameplay.

This is not entirely true.  While it is not a remake, it does feature some nice extra touches that make it a worthwhile purchase.  For starters, right from the beginning of the game you can choose to play either Claire or Leon's story.  This is not an option in the original.  Also, there is a noticeable improvement in the graphics, especially in the cutscenes.  The fuzziness of those old Playstation graphics has been cleaned up quite a bit, and you can actually see people and objects clearly.  You will especially notice an improvement in the graphics if you play this version of the game on a standard CRT television, not a high def LCD which cannot handle standard definition and the much better contrast ratios that standard televisions deliver.I noticed other small changes, as in the names for certain items.  Instead of finding two Red Gems in the R.C.P.D, you will find two Virgin Hearts.  There may be other slight changes, but I'm not far enough into all the scenarios yet to have seen them all.The Gamecube version is especially enjoyable if you've been playing the downloadable Playstation version from the Playstation Store.  That version looks terrible, not just because it's got the original graphics, but also because most people are playing it on high def tv, which makes standard definition graphics look even worse than they really are.  So if you want the best looking version of RE 2, pick up the Gamecube version and play it on a standard television.  G never looked so good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

The graphics and background as well as animated effects of the game worlds dynamics are astounding so I give kudos to the makers on that part but sadly the horrific camera and movement controls made what could have been a enjoyable game more of a annoying mistake.  There is really no camera control unless you go into first person view which in itself is sometimes problematic especially during fights also when you have to move the motion controls leave a lot to be desired as well as sometimes loosing your sense of direction  in some areas.  The voice cast that were picked for this game also leave a lot to be desired as the actor who did the voice for Edward seemed to apathetic in his roles and it just seemed his acting ability in this game was sub-par as well I won't say he's the worse I ever heard but he definitely isn't the best in this game either as some of the small part character voice cast seemed to do a better job than him.  I don't want to give to much away but I'm sure many people have seen or played the game enough to have heard about the ambiguous ending after the game that left many people like myself wondering \"What was the point of the game in the first place\".  So is the game remotely worth getting?,  I was able to get the game for $5.00 dollars which is a decent enough price but for my personal point of view I think even $5.00 dollars was too much for this game...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2011"}

I like that for regular game play, this would be easy enough for a kid to play (maybe with some help from an adult) but the puzzles and completion are challenging enough to keep adults engrossed for the entirety of the game.My only issue with this game is that, as far as I'm aware, this is the one in which they introduced the new split screen for co-op. Fortunately I didn't play co-op too much with this one so it wasn't a big deal, but it's definitely been frustrating in other Lego games I have played completely co-op. For those that don't know what this is the screen stays as one while the characters are together, then splits apart as the characters walk away from each other. The two screens move around each other depending on where each character is and it can be very confusing and dizzying!I noticed many people mentioned glitches and issues with the game. I never had this problem even though I played the game when it first came out.

Overall, the redesign is a big success and makes the original Classic Controller obsolete, but it's not quite perfect still.The controller may feel \"cheap\" in the hands of some due to the surprisingly light weight, but this is due solely to the lack of motors for rumble; I've disassembled the pro and the build quality and components are the same as any other Nintendo controller.The grips are the largest and most ergonomically shaped Nintendo has ever used and are similar to the Xbox 360 in terms of comfort, although the pro grips are somewhat less thick.  The oversize Z buttons are very comfortable and have been stacked, Sony style, to improve accessibility, a welcome improvement that unfortunately never sees any use as the L and R buttons are considered the default triggers by most games.  The face buttons are somewhat widely spaced and protrude from the controller more than past Nintendo pads, springing back more quickly with a clicky and definite feel that resembles a mouse.The analog sticks are further apart and fall under the thumb at a more comfortable angle thanks to the the new grips. The sticks are by all appearances the same as those used in the Classic Controller and Nunchuk, which have heavier resistance than Microsoft or Sony's and feel somewhat imprecise and inconsistent in their movement.  The sticks work well for simple movements, like running at full tilt, but under-perform for precise tasks like aiming in a FPS.  The cap of the stick is a comfortable rubber material and has a single outer ring, which cleverly keeps your thumb from sliding off without obstructing contact with the surface like the concentric rings of previous Nintendo sticks did.As far as compatibility goes, there's really nothing this controller can't do a reasonably good job with.  Being based off the SNES controller, it's obviously a natural choice for retro games, but it also feels very competent for N64 and Wii titles as well.  It even works fairly well for PC games and emulators, provided you're willing to buy an adapter.  The only real criticisms to make are that the analog sticks are not the very best the industry has to offer and the lack of rumble or wireless make the Pro feel like it's not quite a full fledged gamepad.  Regardless, at the price it's offered at and with the quality it delivers, I find it hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with this controller.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2010"}

However, this game is a lot of fun.  Ammo and guns are scarce so you have to use anything else in the environment, and items are actually quite plentiful-- signs, pipes, 2 x 4's, and more are all at your disposal.  The concept behind the combat system is awesome, it gives you a break from the \"spray and pray\" that every FPS utilizes.  In doing so fights feel more personal and involved since you have to get right up in a baddie's face, then block and attack.  This in turn requires flanking and a little forethought before attacking, especially if you have multiple targets.  (It's also quite satisfying dropping a guy to his knees and having a few options as to how to finish him off, such as snapping his neck, bashing his face in, and others.)  The AI is \"intelligent,\" enemies will take cover and wait for you to make a move instead of just charging.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"A lost star for length","reviewText":"I feel short changed.Well, so this is the new Tomb Raider....after all those sequels which were derided for apparently lowering the quality of the game every time (I actually quite enjoyed most of them, with only a few exceptions), Tomb Raider Legend has been lauded as the return to form. Well in my opinion, it's more like an expanded demo of a potential return to form. However it looks great, and as I started playing, I was hoping for the thrill of the very first game to come back to me. I played the original PS1 Tomb Raider game again recently and I couldn't believe how well it had aged. The levels were long, the explorable areas were huge, and the puzzles were multi-layered, often built out of smaller component puzzles. The game as a whole had a good solid length and satisfying difficulty curve. This is a game that is now a decade old, and I'm still impressed by it.So how far have we come? Well, Tomb Raider Legend has definitely played true to the original spirit. It has enhanced the character of Lara Croft, as well as re-invented the control system. I'm very happy about the former update (Lara is still beautiful, upper-class and indomitable), but not so keen on the latter. It came as quite a shock to me to find that the definitive control system had been completely re-worked and, with no option to customize it, I was initially bewildered. X is now jump? Triangle is action? No walk button? No sidestep or sidejump? No backstep for those tricky jumps? It took some getting used to, and I'm not sure whether it's an improvement or not. The grid of jumpable distances and calculations that all TR fans will surely recall has been dumped, and instead Lara behaves like all other platform game protagonists...if you want to jump across a gap, just run at it and leap when you think the time is right. The game does the rest...in fact here it does a bit too much. If the gap is deemed as passable, the game will compensate for any small miscalculation on your part and make sure you end up on the other side. This seemed a bit odd to me, and I found that I missed the feeling of knowing whether I had accomplished anything or not. This new scheme also allows you to perform acrobatic tasks like jumping directly upwards from hanging off a ledge to another ledge about 6 feet above, which is surely physically impossible! As are sideways and backwards jumps from ledges and poles that magically dump Lara safely on another ledge or platform if the game deems that that was the way to progress. Does this sound picky? I know that in the past Lara could do cartwheels while firing her guns, and do a backwards somersault to land on a platform higher than her own head, but I didn't seem to mind that as much! I think it's because the game does not present enough physical challenges anyway that I felt further hand-held throughout the exploring phases by this new scheme.Another thing, is that the weapons mode is a real let-down. The old auto-aim has been replaced by a targetting mechanism that only stays locked on target intermittently. This is very obvious on the final boss, where Lara's aim is constantly lost when she runs to dodge any long range attacks. I would have liked a way to lock-on, and then strafe while firing, but this is seemingly no longer an option - unless I missed it. But in bizarre opposition to the boss fights, regular gun fight sequences are incredibly easy, you only have to run around wildly firing non-stop and the enemies will all drop. I never came out of a hugely out-numbered fight (say Lara against 6 or 7 goons) with damage more than about one medipack's worth, and that's when I wasn't being the least bit careful.I've got still more gripes - you can't stockpile anything. One additional gun at a time is all you get, and a maximum of three medipacks!! Thats just criminal. Mind you, with the game this easy, arriving at the last boss with 20 stored medipacks would be a pushover! Oh well, Lara's previously bottomless rucksack was always a bit far-fetched, I suppose.Ok, I've left the worst till last, and that is undeniably the games length. I finished it in about 4 days, and that's unheard of for a TR game. Short levels, few puzzles, not enough secrets, not enough booby traps or variety of enemies. Every level is like a taster for what the development team are obviously capable of. They just needed to make them all 3 times as long. At least. The levels look great (time for some praise at last, now!)...they are leafy and organic, dank and spooky, or full of ruined temples as and when required. I could have done with some larger and more awe-inspiring architecture, though, and the sense of immense scale has not been maintained. I don't recall many of the towering structures and giddying drops that made climbing so perilous in the earlier game. Fans of TR1 will surely recall the Atlantis level - a constant climb through a kind of giant floorless shaft ending up on a platform where the boss appeared - one slip off the edge meant a fall down through the entire level to a final sickening thud on the floor. There's nothing like that in this game, and I think what I miss the is the sense of realism you get when you can see where you've been climbing from and it's dizzyingly far down. Tomb Raider Legend doesn't play with layered or cyclical environments, and all the levels are pretty standard: start travelling from Point A and keep going as far you can and you'll get to Point B. There are two motorbike riding leves but they are very arcadey and almost impossble to lose.Tomb Raider Legend is a wonderful taster, passed of as a full length game. A lot of care went into design and execution, but it's still a bit glitchy (although with nothing like the game-halting problems of Angel of Darkness, thank god!). I look forward to another game from this team, and let's hope it's a biggun next time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2006"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Armando N.

One of my problems with the PlayStation controllers ever since they got the analog sticks years ago was that they just feel too lose. To me, the best analog stick was on the Xbox Controller S, from the previous console generation, but the GameCube's was pretty good too. That's exactly how the Wii Nunchuck's analog stick is, and I don't have any complaints about it. It has an octagon gate, as you can tell in the picture. The cord that connects to the Wii Remote is the perfect size, though it takes a while for it to straighten out after being bundled up in the packaging for so long. And of course the buttons on the back are easily accessible. I really don't have any complaints about how this thing functions for the games it's needed for.If I don't have any problems with how it works, why'd I take a star off the rating? This thing just plain feels too light, and I'm always scared that I'm going to crush it on accident when playing a tough level in Donkey Kong Country Returns, or just by dropping it. This sucker almost feels weightless, and I prefer a little heft in my controller, but that's just me.For something that isn't really necessary for the Wii, but might as well be, this attachment's priced right, and should last you a while.

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"Popularity Contest","reviewText":"I would have loved this game had it not been for the in-game clock rushing me to do things I'm not ready to do. It was a constant aggravation hurrying from point A to point B in time so that I could meet a character simply to buy a few items from him or her, or to get a key to opening up that character later on to become a friend (more on this saving grace later). And then, to add to that, there is only one permanent save point in the whole game, and going to that save point is often off-limits if you don't want to progress the story. In general, I felt rushed by the whole in-game clock system, and frustrated when real-life time-constraints forced me to move on.The in-game clock also makes it hard to do one of the few things that makes this game fun: collecting characters to join in the quest. Even finding the characters that are recruit-able can be time-consuming, let alone getting the tasks done that is needed to recruit those specific characters. But as you collect more and more of these characters, the game turns into a Pokemon-like \"gotta catch all\" kind of thing. I constantly searched the back corners of the world of Radiata Stories in order to find absolutely every character possible, and though I failed in recruiting everyone I still want to go back through and try to find who I missed. Early on, most of the characters are weaker, but as the story progresses stronger ones make themselves available, and that means a better team when battling the monsters of the world.That leads me to the battle-system. The main character, you, of the group must shout orders at the other three characters and, depending on what the characters are capable of, they will act accordingly. Most will attack if you tell them to, but only a few can heal. Plus, there is a link system where the four characters link up and perform special attacks or have special abilities. It adds a little something, I think, to constant, monotonous battle systems found in most RPGs. But still, there comes a point when shouting orders and linking becomes rather useless, as the characters get so strong that it turns into more of a button masher than anything else. Still, early on it's fun and unique.The story is okay too. It follows Jack as he tries to go in the same path that his hero father did by becoming one of the famed Radiata Knights. Things don't go so well for him and he believes his hopes of becoming a knight are lost. It doesn't end that way, though, and Jack finds himself journeying with two other Radiata Knights on missions. Still, something goes wrong later and Jack suddenly finds himself ousted as a Radiata Knight. From there he must start over and joins the Theatre Vancoor, a warrior guild that accepts missions from the highest bidders (or whoever needs a job).The three positives--the decent story, innovative battle system, and character collecting--made up for the one thing that nearly killed this game for me, that being the in-game clock. I had fun doing the things the game was rushing me to do, though I feel a little cheated at not being able to do everything the first time. As for recommendations, I can only recommend this to poeple who have quite a bit of time on their hands as it will take three or four attempts through the game to collect every character (or just two if you have an extremely large amount of time and a strategy guide).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2006"}

Partners in Time is the second installment in the series, where rather than using just Mario & Luigi, you now use their younger selves as well. Partners in Time is a really great game that has most of the elements that made Superstar Saga such a spectacular game, just on slightly lower levels of quality.Partners in Time starts off showing a scene in which Princess Peach and a few escorts travel back in time to the Mushroom Kingdom of the past with Professor E. Gadd's recently finished time machine. However, when the time machine returns to the present, Peach is nowhere to be found, and time holes start popping up around the Princess' castle. Naturally, Mario & Luigi use these time holes to go into the Mushroom Kingdom of yesteryear in search of the princess, but they discover an alien race called the Shroobs has taken over the world and captured the princess. They also meet their baby selves while in the past, and they enlist their help and become a quartet of heroes in an effort to defeat the Shroobs and save Peach.The story is pretty solid, and the time travel element works very nicely in it for a little added depth. The dialogue is also very likable, although not as much of a constant treat as in Superstar Saga. The game has fewer characters that come in throughout the story, which gave the writers less of a chance to show their writing skills as we saw so brilliantly in the first game. Not that the writing is bad, it still reveals each character's personality remarkably well and is pretty entertaining to read, it just doesn't quite measure up to my expectations after playing the original game. And it lacks the proper dose of Fawful (ignore that last sentence if you haven't played Superstar Saga). Partners in Time does retain a wonderful sense of personality by both dialogue and visual humor, though, as Luigi always seems to fail at calming down the crying babies and the Toadsworths also try to keep the baby princess entertained. Despite the setbacks from Superstar Saga, the story elements do their job very nicely to keep the game going strong.The biggest change in Partners in Time over Superstar Saga is definitely controlling all four characters rather than just the adult Mario & Luigi. The babies travel on the adults' backs and they can split up to reach higher places and go into smaller spaces. The two sets of bros. each have their own set of abilities that enable them to trigger certain events and solve puzzles. Partners in Time shines brightest in the use of the four bros. all at once to solve puzzles, though. Often you must split them up and alternate between both duos to allow the other to progress, and eventually reach your goal. These puzzles are rarely very hard but they are very creative and extremely entertaining to solve. Actually, this is probably the one element of this game that beats Superstar Saga.The use of all four characters also plays an important role in battle, for better or worse. Solo (well, more like duo) attacks involve both the adult and the corresponding baby now, and either jumping on an enemy twice or whacking them harder with a hammer can do more damage. These attacks are fun to do, but what made the battle system in the original game so fantastic was the Bros. Attacks. Unfortunately, they have not made a full return, and have been replaced with Bros. Items, which involve such acts as kicking a Koopa shell at an enemy or jumping on a foe repeatedly. They are pretty fun to use, but when compared to the spectacular Bros. Attacks from Superstar Saga, they really have no appeal at all because they lack just about all the creativity and satisfaction. Overall though the battles are still very fun, but just slightly held back due to the change in Bros. abilities.As a DS game, Partners in Time utilizes the two screens very nicely. The lower screen is where the action takes place and the bros. are controlled. The top screen is used as a map outside of battle, which is extremely useful, and it also shows the babies when the bros. are split up for puzzle solving. In battle it is used as an extended range for enemies to go into and attack from. There is only one instance in which touch controls are required in the entire game, but the two screens are put to such great use all the time that it's easy to forget that touch controls were even an option for the developers. The game works wonderfully with regular button controls anyways.The overworld in Partners in Time remains pretty straightforward, and isn't all that open. Peach's castle in the present serves as the main hub of the world, and the time holes appear in various parts of the castle, each taking you to a particular area in the past. None of the areas link to each other, though, and there is never a reason to revisit any of them, giving the game a much more enclosed feel than Superstar Saga, where you had the whole world open for you to explore. The game works just fine in these boundaries, but on the whole Superstar Saga did a much better job of feeling free and open.Partners in Time's graphics are very similar to Superstar Saga's, only slightly improved. The cartoon quality is very good as everything is bright, colorful, and smoothly animated. The graphics hit a slight quality boost from the GBA game, but not by very much. They still look pretty much the same, except maybe for slightly better overall animation quality. The main difference in graphics is definitely the 3-D effects, which are used for a few enemies' attacks, and they look very nice and add a layer of depth to the graphics on those occasions, however rarely they occur.Sound is another strong point for Partners in Time. The sound effects are very good and fit the game's style nicely, including the babies' crying and the adults' occasional gibberish. The music is very fun and catchy, especially in battle. The sound quality is also very good, as the DS is most certainly capable of.Partners in Time can take about 15 hours to complete, which is a pretty good length. It feels a little shorter than Superstar Saga, but it's still long enough. There really isn't anything to do once you've beaten the game, though, except play through it again, but like its predecessor it's fun enough to be worth replaying in the future.Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is a great game, and it succeeds in just about everything it attempts. The strong sense of personality is very evident, the puzzles are a treat to solve, and the DS' two screens are used very nicely. What holds it back from being so amazing like its predecessor is that just about all of these elements are on slightly lower levels of quality, the battles aren't as entertaining due to the change in Bros. abilities, and the world lacks the openness that Superstar Saga had. Despite the fact that it just can't measure up to its fantastic predecessor, it's really a great game.Positive:+ great sense of personality+ clever puzzles are a treat to solve+ top screen map is very useful+ smooth, colorful graphics+ fun, catchy musicNegative:- Bros. Items aren't nearly as fun or creative as Bros. Attacks- world isn't as open as before- lacks the FURY of the original(if you haven't played Superstar Saga, ignore that last one)LAST WORD: Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is a great game, just not as incredible as its predecessor. If you enjoyed Superstar Saga you will undoubtedly enjoy this game, if not then play Superstar Saga first. I can guarantee you will look to Partners in Time for more, though, and it does deliver an entertaining, wholly worthwhile experience.SCORE: 8.8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Timeless Classic Returns","reviewText":"Pros:+A very well done storyline+A good battle system+Several sidequests to undertake+Some new content to experience+Lots of replay valueCons:-There's a good amount of new content but it might not be worthwhile to those who've already experienced Chrono Trigger before; likewise, there's no improvement in the visuals... this may or may not please some gamersIn 1995 Square released Chrono Trigger.  A game commonly hailed as one of the greatest games of all time.  In the years following it became one of the most highly sought after Super Nintendo games of all time.  The game saw a rerelease on the Playstation in 2001 along with Final Fantasy IV in the Final Fantasy Chronicles package.  This marks the third time Chrono Trigger has seen a release since it first debuted.  The game has aged very well but some gamers may find there needs to be more of an update.Chrono Trigger has a well known story but it never hurts to go over it for some who may not have played this gem.  In the year 1000 AD, the Kingdom of Guardia has the Millennial Fair.  You play as Crono, who goes to the fair and bumps into a girl named Marle.  After wandering the fair with her for a while, Crono and Marle decide to check out his friend Lucca's new invention, a teleportation device.  When Marle steps into the device, it reacts to her pendent and she is suddenly transported through time.  Feeling somewhat responsible, Crono decides to go through time after her.  What begins as a simple rescue mission turns into something so much more when you go into the distant future and see that the world has ended.  Now, in an attempt to save the future, Crono and his friends will stop the apocalypse from happening.  Their adventure will take them through time and they'll meet several interesting characters.It is because of the characters and the well put together story that Chrono Trigger is so memorable.  This version features a newly translated script that is much better than the original (as if the original needed a tune up).Another aspect that makes Chrono Trigger stand the test of time is the gameplay.  You'll roam the field normally until you come into contact with an enemy.  Where as most RPGs have to transition from the field mode to the battle mode, Chrono Trigger instead has your characters spread out and pull out their weapons.  The battle system itself utilizes the ATB battle system from Final Fantasy for some fast paced action.Where the game truly shines, however, is its Tech system.  Every character has a series of unique techniques that they can utilize.  At first the system doesn't sound that interesting, but your characters can combine their techniques together to pull off double and triple techs.  It helps to make battling more interesting and fun.  It also assures that you'll try using every character at least once just to uncover all the double and triple techniques out there.  More than that, however, it adds a lot of strategy to the game given that each characters techniques are unique to them.  You may find that what makes the difference between sending a character into battle and not has to do more with their techniques than their base statistics.There are plenty of side quests to keep you busy, and the time traveling element makes some of them more fun to partake in than others.  As if that wasn't enough, the DS version also includes all the animated cutscenes from the Playstation release.  If you'd prefer to enjoy the game in a completely classic way, you can turn them off if you desire.  There are also a few extras added to the DS version such as new dungeons and touch screen controls.  The touch screen controls themselves work fairly well, although you may still find that using the buttons and D-pad is still much easier.Chrono Trigger is by no means a challenging game.  It's also a fairly short one.  At most you'll probably take twenty hours to complete it your first time through.  Veterans may find themselves completing the game in less than fifteen hours.  Chrono Trigger makes up for being a short game by having a lot of replay value.  First there's the New Game+ feature which lets you go through the game again carrying over your techniques, items and equipment.  The game also throws in multiple endings, which will encourage you to play the game again.Musically, Chrono Trigger has one of the best soundtracks around.  Some of it sounds better than the original Super Nintendo game.  Many tunes will be stuck in your head for years to come, mainly because so much of it can convey so much emotion.Graphically, however, is where Chrono Trigger can be a mixed bag.  The character models and backgrounds look incredibly detailed, and in the DS port some things have been smoothed out.  Artistically, Chrono Trigger will probably never fade into oblivion.  On the other hand, Square-Enix released Final Fantasy IV and Dragon Quest IV earlier this year with improved graphics, bringing the games into 3D.  Final Fantasy IV, in particular, showed major improvements in its presentation that made the story more emotionally gripping.  It's a wonder why Square-Enix wouldn't do the same with Chrono Trigger.  It would've been stunning to see some of Chrono Trigger's best moments in a new light.The good news, however, is that Chrono Trigger hasn't had many releases, and there's so much more added than simply a new dungeon.  This means even if you did play an older version of the game, there's a good berth of new content worth checking out.  Whether or not it's worth forty dollars is subjective.Chrono Trigger is a remarkable game.  If you've played it before, one more go can't hurt.  If you've never played it, this is the definitive version.  Every RPGer should play this timeless classic at least once.  Age has not slowed Chrono Trigger down one bit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

FFXII had showed me that they forgot how to make a good Final Fantasy after they fired the writers that where responsible for Final Fantasies before FFX, and FFX-FFXII just disappointed.  I have to say, I'm so happy to have gotten FFXIII.  It is a really pleasant surprise from Square, I now remain a fan, where as before I thought they had lost their touch.Pros:Great characters: Most of them break the mold.  They let you in immediately and establish an emotional connection.  You find yourself loving them before very long.Voice Acting: its really quite good.  There are a few people who could have done a better job, but it is hardly noticable.  For the most part, the voice actors are very good.Game Play: They didn't carry on that horrible Gambit system from FFXII thank god, so the game doesn't play itself like FFXII did.  They instead have a wonderful and complex battle system that strings together commands and utilized different behaviors.Graphics: Jaw dropping.  The graphics are amazing, and even in the game play, the characters motion is life like, fully animated, and fluid.  The faces have a reality to them and are incredibly detailed.  It looks like a movie.Fan Service: Chocobos, Cactuar, need I say more?Story: The story is outstanding, and frequent beautiful lush cut scenes bring it to life.  Yes, it is linear, but Final Fantasy has ALWAYS been a linear story, and I dont think there is anything wrong with that.  Its a unique story, unlike anything I've seen before, and its fascinating.  Once you get started, you cant put the controller down, because you have to know what happens next.  I played for easily 8 hours strait saying \"okay, until the next save point...\" haha.Combat System:  The combat system is vastly improved, and is tremendous fun and very exciting.  Staggering allows us to weaken enemies, and the different \"paradigms\" let us switch party roles on a dime.  Very awesome.Cons:uhm...Voice Acting: one or two extras aren't the most awesome voice actors ever... but who cares?There really isn't much that is bad to say about this game.  Its not an open ended RPG like Dragon Age, but anyone buying a game from Final Fantasy cant be expecting that.  Final Fantasy has never been an open ended multi story line game.  This game is beautiful, reminiscent of Final Fantasy 7, and loyal to what fans love and expect from the Final Fantasy series.  I didn't have high expectations for this game, because of past releases, but when I got it, I was blown away.  All my expectations where met and then some, this game is astonishingly wonderful in every possible way.  Get it now, it worth it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"Not perfect, but best handheld so far with a few caveats","reviewText":"I've never been THAT much into the handheld consoles.  I get them for my 8 year old, and play a few things here and there, but with several Xboxes at home, the PS3, and a Wii, the handheld never appealed to me.  But a few weeks ago before launch, the local brick and mortar had one of these to try, and my son and I played with it some, and I was quite impressed.  The quality of the screen, the brightness, was just astounding.So I sat on the fence, didn't know if I'd get it or not, but much the same as my PS3, I was pushed over the edge by LIttle Big Planet.  It won't be out till June for the Vita, but that was the game that I got the PS3 for, so figured I may as well get the Vita, since my son and I both love playing it.I got three games with it, Modnation racers, uncharted, and the Hot Shots golf.  Also downloaded the three free things for it from the PS store, that use the cards to create a little virtual reality stage wherever you put the cards in your home.Games - they're all pretty good.  Responsive, no lag at all during gameplay (but a LOT of waiting for things to initially load, they take longer than I would've expected).  Speakers are incredibly weak, but I tried my bluetooth iPod dock and it worked fine with this, as do headphones, which I'll probably use most of the time if I'm playing it myself.The controls are where It took away one of the stars.  My son has a Nintendo DS but we didn't get the 3DS since I knew this was coming since last year, and wanted to wait and see how it was.  But on the 3DS I preferred their analog stick design - where the whole pad slides, rather than an actual pivoting joystick like here.  These are just a little too small, and too far to the outside, for me to feel any real comfort with them.  The tops are not just hard plastic, have a little bit of texture, but not enough to really make the thumbs \"stick\" in place - so your thumbs slide all the time.  They're very easy to move, so it's not really a BIG problem, but for me, it was more than annoying enough to warrant dropping a star.  The placement of the triangle, square, circle, and X is just a little too close to the stick as well, making it awkward sometimes to do some moves.Touch screen works very well, is precise and I don't have any issues with mis-clicks, or it not detecting what I'm trying to do.  I'm not sure just how much use I see for it in some games though depending on the other controls you use, since it can be a pain shifting the hand enough to slide or touch as needed, when there's other controls you're hitting with that hand.  Most of my gameplay so far though it seems that they've taken that into consideration, so when you're going to do something like sliding a finger on the screen, there's usually not something else you'd have to be doing with that hand as well.Graphics - visually stunning.  Granted, the games I picked aren't designed to be bleeding edge (except for uncharted which is amazing on this little screen) but when I'm used to the DS and a LeapPad Didj, this is just amazing.  Even the simple graphics for the cart race or the golf are done well, and the vibrant colors are just a joy to experience.Content manager - you install this on your computer, then it allows you to copy music, photos, videos, etc, to the unit, as well as back it up to your PC.  The link the handheld gave when I plugged it in via USB took me to an error page - I ended up googling for \"content manager mac\" and got a link that worked.  It installed fine, and everything was recognized and cataloged, but you can only control the manager from the handheld - NOT the PC.  I would've preferred if I could easily go through my PC and select the music to copy over from my collection - but you can't.  You can only get a little bit at a time on the screen, hit checkboxes, and then copy.  Makes it more of a pain than if we could have done it from the computer instead.  But the process itself worked fine, I had no issues and things played fine on the Vita then after they were copied.Power charger is an adapter that converts the 120v to a USB outlet.  Then a USB cable that plugs into that, with a proprietary end that goes into the Vita.  So I can charge it easily from my Macbook Pro which sits in a stand by the couch where I sit anyway when I\"m not at work, so that's far more convenient than being forced to a power outlet only type charging cable.I'm also irritated at how Sony always manages to shaft the end users with proprietary memory cards - in this case, yet ANOTHER overpriced memory stick that can't be used anywhere else.  I've avoided Sony products because of that in the past...  And still do, other than something that doesn't have a similar product from another company (i.e. camcorder or camera, etc).  I just dislike their practice of forcing people into their pricey stuff rather than simply adopting an established standard like an SDHC or something.I also really dislike the doors for the games - it's this tiny little thing that you have to wriggle a fingernail into to pry it open - and it hangs on a couple flexible pieces of plastic.  I've generally had lousy luck in the long term with things like that - usually they break off.  We'll see about this one...Cameras are pretty worthless, and only use I have for them is the freebie games that use the special coded playing cards that come with the camera to turn a small section of your environment into a game setting.  And even that's really a flakey deal, poor resolution and barely visible game area.  Tiny tiny characters you can barely see unless you're right on top of the card.Normally something with as many things that detract as this, I'd drop it down to three stars.  But still, for the quality of the graphics and gameplay, and how light the unit is (surprisingly light, I was expecting something more hefty), I'll keep it at four stars.  It certainly is a game changer in this market, which it would have had to be, for me to get it, since I've passed up on every other sony hand held up to this point for any number of reasons - this is the first one that I felt any desire to purchase.There's clearly a LOT of activity going on with their servers for the PS network, since downloads are HORRENDOUSLY slow - this morning, a 1MB update took me 10 minutes to download on my 16Mbps cable modem, and yesterday while not as bad, the downloads were nearly dialup speeds...  I'm sure it'll get better after the initial rush is over, but be prepared for long downloads for things in the meantime this close to launch.Once there's more games out there for it, it'll definitely be the one to get.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR12","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Better than expected, but the franchise is showing it's age","reviewText":"Four things seem pretty consistent about any Call of Duty release:People will complain how awful it isLots of voodoo about how to improve graphics/network playPeople will buy it by the shovel load anywaysThe multiplayer will be accused of being awful with all kinds of balance issuesI play the game for both the single and multiplayer; in general the graphics in either mode seemed to have taken a big setep backwards, most likely a nod towards playability on consoles.  But really, these people complaining about how every single game crashes and unplayability must be using an ancient office PC with onboard graphics.  It runs smoothly on my three year old Dell with a GTX-460.  And don't get me started on all the \"fixes\" for network issues--it's always the same thing, someone with a magic configuration that does away with network problems, and they never work.The singe player story--when the previews first came out showing bots and drones with a futuristic feel I was disappointed.  I was hoping for a sequel to a 60's game it would be set in the near modern day environment of the 70's and 80's which is practically unexplored territory in games--plus I'd liked the original story.So I was pleasantly surprised that at least a good part of the game took place in the 80's....and then realized why people hadn't made games about it before.  Events like World War Two and the 60's Cold War/Space Race/Vietnam War have an overarching significance in our cultural memory.  The 80's US/Soviet Detente does not.  Yes, you get to see real life people like Jonas Savimbi and Manuel Noriega, but it seems to fall flat.The Modern Warfare/Black Ops villains were mysterious and powerful.  The Black Ops 2 one just never seems to connect--even though this time they give him plenty of motivation and back story.  I kept thinking--\"Really, from nobody to all powerful global villain?\"  Even though that's pretty much been the plot for all of them.So the single player isn't bad---more like unfulfilling.  Even the episodes in Afghanistan fighting on horseback seem like the same ingredients we've done before just mixed together a little differently.The story does have multiple endings--and it's only clear a few times where your choices are, and never really explained what you're leading up to.  Well, real life is like that also and it encourages some replay value to see how it works out.  At only about five hours it passes quickly.The multiplayer---again, four things always ruin the gaming experience:Balance issuesNetwork lag/problemsCheatersBad attitudesWhat the PC player community wants is dedicated servers.  Someone sets up and pays for a server, and it usually becomes a 'hood for a clan or group of gamers.  It also becomes a place where arbitrary rules and really bad attitudes prevail.  I lost track of how many poor excuse admins I ran into who banned anyone they didn't like or would change rules on a whim.  The plus--if you can call it that--is cheaters were supposedly kicked in a heartbeat.  In practice not so often.What's been the upcoming method is peer to peer gaming.  A player is randomly chosen as a \"host\" and is a virtual server for others to connect with.  Pluses are you don't need a dedicated server and you can play the game the way it was intended.  Minus is cheaters aren't kicked by anyone--and no, Steam doesn't seem to want to do much about them.Black Ops 2 has much more variety in perks, weapons, and so on.  As the weapons are ranging into science fiction you have to play them to get an idea what they're capable of.  A welcome introduction is leagues to class similarly skilled players together.  However, this does not feel like the Black Ops multiplayer--more like a product improved Modern Warfare 3.Almost anything else I can say about the multiplayer should be prefaced with \"so far.\"  Balance seems good, Modern Warfare 3 was almost singlehandedly ruined by akimbo machine pistols.  Here it doesn't seem like there's one gun everyone uses, such as the Famas in Black Ops before they did some updates that depowered it.Network issues again haven't come up yet.  The most common problems are lag or skipping/missing connecting with a target.  I'd say easily 3/4 of the accusations of cheating are people who were on the good side of network lag.  To them the game is super easy, people walk into bullets, and they barely need to aim.  To those of us on the other side it was emptying sometimes a full clip for little effect into someone with unbelievable stamina and speed as the network was perpetually trying to sync us up to them.  Again it seems to be working pretty well.Cheaters.  Not yet.  Blacks Ops never had very many but they were all over the place in Modern Warfare 3.  Probably the most common is texture hacks--if you ever see someone's winning screenshot and the screen is all orangish red and the players are a featureless light blue, that's a texture hack.  They replace the textures on their game install with ones that make it much easier to see the enemy.  Second is x-ray vision--the enemy are outlined in purple boxes so they know where you are all the time. Next is the traditional wallhack--shooting through walls, which I hardly ever see because it's so obvious. Lastly is the aimbot.  The most extreme example I remember was someone in Modern Warfare 3 standing in the middle of the map mowing everyone down with an M60, swiveling instantly and ending with a final kill count of 224. More likely is someone with a very weak gun yet who always seems to gets good kills and headshots, even from impossible ranges.  The cheaters and developers know people watch for their stuff so they get better at acting and hiding it.Bad attitudes.

{"product_name":"B00005AV86","description":".","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"Creative, vast, and difficult","reviewText":"Kid Icarus became available in its original form with enhanced 3D graphics for the 3DS via download from the Nintendo eShop about a couple of years ago, and I immediately downloaded the classic for a cool 6 bucks. They also made a highly regarded new Kid Icarus (Kid Icarus: Uprising) for the 3DS with some breathtaking 3D visuals and brilliant graphics, but I digress. Although I still owned the original cartridge and could play it with relative ease - plug in the old NES via the 'rca' style video cords - I was excited to play it via the comfort of my 3DS (not to mention the convenience of the save point feature for all of the 'Digital Console' games for the 3DS and DSi). When  I revisited the game, I was astonished at the difficulty - and frustrated, actually, as I recalled loving this game. I think, however, the variable at hand is that throughout the many years I didn't continue playing action-arcade and platformers, at least not challenging ones. I opted for turn-based and strategic RPGs as I got older, and while I can still enjoy a game of Galaga, Mario, Metroid or Punch-Out (I can still reach Tyson... or Mr. Dream... I have both versions), Kid Icarus is just too hard for this old man. I gave the game more than a justified try, too - but after several hours and over 10 revisits and barely making it to level 2, I had to hang up the gloves, or, in this case wings, in favor of a different, romantic visit to nostalgic video game past by downloading something like the original Legend of Zelda or perhaps blowing the dust off of my NES and playing a round of Archon, as much as I wanted to relive the days when I could blast through the difficult levels in Kid Icarus.To be completely fair, though, even though my trip down memory lane left me a bit disillusioned and wishing for an 'easy' setting, this title was pretty fantastic. Perhaps a bit too challenging right off the bat, Kid Icarus was extremely creative. It offered both side-scrolling and vertical play, a touch of roleplaying elements with regards to character development and purchased upgrades, and a very vast playing environment - lots of levels, varied enemies and bosses. The graphics are decent for NES and if you have a 3DS, enjoy the added 3D effects (only a handful of the original NES games available from the eShop have been 'amped' up to 3D, and these are therefore only available on the 3DS. Other classics like SMB, Metroid, Mega Man, etc. are also available on the DSi).On a final note, if you enjoy challenging platformers/action games and aren't stuck on first-person, this classic should not only be in your collection but is just as worthy playing today - the only thing new platform based games have on such a well developed classic is graphics: which, if you're a well-rounded gamer, you can look past.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"The One Who Critiques","summary":"One of the best in its class","reviewText":"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is not only one of the best Real Time Strategy games on the market it is one of the best games period. It's up there with RTS games such as the original Rome, original Company of Heroes, C&C;, and Homeworld. Anyone who enjoys a good RTS game now and again should definitely consider picking this up.It's biggest flaw is the DRM(digital rights management), which is pure trash. I understand the need to combat piracy, but this hurts the real fans more than anything. I have great internet, but my room is 75-feet away from my wireless connection so I don't always get the most stable of connections and therefore I can't even play single player sometimes. This is my biggest issue, and in no way does it take away from the great experience I had with SC2.Gameplay- standard tactical RTS gameplay,  feels very satisfying ordering your troops around and attacking the enemy. First off you start with a small amount of classes and as the story progresses you unlock more and more diverse classes from Tanks, Aircraft, Titans, Spec Ops and more. You have your standard defensive, economical, armory, and class structures to build during your time playing, setting up your base is always key along with maintaining a vast amount of resources. The game has some RPG elements where you can give certain classes and structures particular skills which is a nice addition as you choose carefully what you use with your research points and money. You also have the option to pay for mercenaries which is a nice way to get troops on the battlefield quickly.Small Flaw: when setting up base and your SCV(builder) gets caught between a structure and essentially becomes useless for the whole game unless the structure is attacked and the SCV repairs it or dies... It's s minor flaw but during my experience it happened quite often.Sound/Visuals: MAN, MAN! The SOUND in this game is AMAZING! From the movement of your troops to the sound of the combat and even the dialogue during the cutscenes, to the one liners your troops say when selected. Everything just sounds so detailed and crisp it's just great! Graphically the game looks good, nothing spectacular but adequate for a Real Time Strategy game. But the detail in this game is where StarCraft shines, the layout looks very complete and full rather than other RTS' where the environment looks baron and dull.Story/Characters: I found the story quite intriguing, I enjoyed every single part of it from the very first minute all the when until the credits started rolling. Having never played the original SC I was able to follow along with the story for the most part and I was never really confused at any point during my campaign play through. The voice acting is very good on all fronts, there was really no weak link to be found here. The characters were really cool, enjoyable and interesting I especially loved the dialogue between Jim Raynor and Tychus Findlay.Over all the story and characters really stick out in StarCraft 2.Multiplayer: This is what will keep you coming back long after you beat the game. The community is one of the better communities out there and online is still very active to this day. It's hard not to find a multiplayer game.The balance is good, I always thought it was a fair game when playing SC2.Overall StarCraft 2 is one of the best in its class, today it still warrants a 40$ purchase whether your buying for yourself or as a gift.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2014"}

Work your way through the classic storyline as Jill Valentine & Chris Redfield work their way through that well-known mansion. You'll find that there's no solace in a room that you think you've completely freed from zombie infestation.","reviewerName":"TorridlyBoredShopper \"T(to the)B(to the)S\"","summary":"ReMastering the Mansion with the Same Good Looking Friends","reviewText":"Fan or foe of the Resident Evil series, you have to admit that it changed the face of gaming forever. Along with franchised games like Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, and Alone in the Dark \"the term \"survival horror\" became a way to describe what was not only a fad in gaming but that was also a marketing force. This, of course, led to many noteworthy offspring of the genre, many rip-offs of the big kids, and many consoles trying to cashing in by making the next in their series the best in the series.And now, hoping down the Bunny Trail, comes the brand new world of porting.For those who are not accustomed to \"porting,\" it is basically a term used to say \"we took an old game and shoved it into a new system with a shiny new box.\" Sometimes this works out well and you have a great piece of nostalgia, and sometimes this works in the \"not-so-well\" classification and you find yourself somewhat miffed by your purchase. With Resident Evil :deadly Silence, I kind of feel like the title says it all. There are all those graphics that stepped back out of the same place I think disco went to die, seemingly 16 bits when compared to the beauty of the \"now.\" And this isn't meant to insult the original Resident Evil because, when it was cutting edge, it was cutting edge. This is more like saying that the blade has dulled and the experience has soured and, well, you get the picture.And then there were the controls.One of the biggest complaints I've ever heard from people playing the older games are that the controls are terrible - at best. If you go into the game with that mindset, expecting the controls to be abominations, then you'll find yourself impressed with how psychic you are. That seems to be another drawback of porting - you have the same schema following you in all sorts of forms, making you not-so-silently curse the things that also made the game a memorable one to play. Fighting the wonderful world of remembered enemies is a pain at best with the controls that make life difficult - playing with them and running into old big and bad (O that loveable Tyrant!) reminds you why you spent so much time trying to master running and gunning and moving backward and assaulting at the same time.Chris, Jill, flashbacks - \"Haven't I see this before?\" Yeah, you have.Despite all of this, the game is still a fun thing to bust out and play again and it really does deserve a little praise. When your eyes adjust to the glint of the pixels and your fingers adjust to the way you reformatted your fingers just to play videogames you'll sometimes slide into the zone and remember how much you loved this game. You'll also laugh as well, amazed that these moments were some of the most frightening things that the digital experience ever spawned.Add in the new controls that you get to play around with and you have something nice to play - provided that you play at a discount.Its amazing what can be forgiven when it comes to fond memories and handheld gaming.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2007"}

MacMahon","summary":"The Professional Reviews are Right, but Alpha Protocol is Still a Hit for RPG Lovers","reviewText":"The thing with professional reviews is that they are written for everyone, for the \"mainstream\" if you like.  The score at the end reflects what the average Joe might think of the game, but the text is meant to key you in on what your particular brand of video game enjoyment might get out of it, though they rarely accomplish this.So let me tell you about Alpha Protocol from a pure RPG standpoint, from a fan of other real-time stat-based PC RPG games like Deus Ex or Morrowind.Alpha Protocol rocks!I know what you're thinking, \"that can't be true, look at the reviews!\"  Well, we talked about who those reviews are aimed at, didn't we?  Alpha Protocol is not aimed at those people.  AP (as I will now call it) is surprisingly aimed at classic RPG gamers who are now a niche and do not control the industry... unlike Bethesda, who changed The Elder Scrolls into real-time hack and slashing based on player skill, Obsidian has made a shooter-RPG that is completely stat-based.  This throws off a lot of reviewers, as they all complain about \"clunky\" aiming, \"bad\" stealth and cover and other such things.  The thing is: aiming is stat-based.  If you have no points in assault rifles but you keep using them, you are going to miss every time.  If you put a ton of points into pistols then in no time you are a one-shot death machine.  For instance, not only does putting points into pistols enhance basic accuracy, meaning where you put the target is where the bullet goes, but it also gives you the ability to aim from cover, which when playing stealth is essential.  Speaking of stealth, people say it does not work but it does.  When you put points into it you get enemy arrows, telling you where they are and which way they are looking, along with cloaking.  You can also buy stealth suits and camouflage from the store, which makes you even harder to spot.  With a maxed-out pistol and stealth character you can easily go through every mission never being spotted and one-shot killing all the guards safely from cover.  It's awesome.Which is not to say the game feels perfectly polished, it does not, it has that old Obsidian rough feel to it.  It's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be though, and through my entire play-through I never had any significant bugs or anything.  The main reason it feels rough is because the graphics are about 3 years old and the animations are poor.  Also, the AI can behave buggy at time, but as a stealth character I honestly never saw them do anything really crazy... maybe because they were dead before they left their patrol route.  PC controls seem fine too, not sure what the complaints are there... standard WASD shooter controls.  There is some annoying mouse smoothing, but you can disable it and the game feels smooth and responsive.  I think most of the \"clunky\" and \"buggy\" complaints come from people who expect a head-shot to be a head-shot no matter their stats, which is just ignoring the kind of game they are playing.  If you watch professional reviews of the game on Gamespot, IGN or Gametrailers you can see this repeatedly come up as a negative, even though it's true to the RPG genre and classics like Deus Ex and Fallout 3 did the same thing.The main thing I disliked about the gameplay was the mini-games littered throughout.  Gone are the days when you could just pass a computer skill-check and access the files, now you need to play a stupid mini-game no one likes in every RPG.  AP's are no better or worse than any other game's in my experience, though they may be more frequent.  The only one that is a bit rough is hacking, but I don't think that has anything to do with consoles as some reviews suggest, it's just an annoying mini-game period.  The good news is you can get special gloves which give you more time on all the mini-games, so it's not so bad after the first mission or two.  The only other real issue I have with the game is lack of quick-save, but honestly I believe this was done to encourage you to live with the consequences of your actions.  Similar to AP's dialogue system, which forces you to make a quick response, the game often forces you to make a quick mission decision... the auto-save is always quick to record your actions, making your decisions weighty and without being able to be scrubbed.  Flubbed that line with that girl?  Well, you have to deal with the fact she likes you less.In addition to the gameplay there is also, of course, a story.  As an RPG AP focuses on choice and consequence and does a good job of it, plus the game auto-saves after decisions meaning it's tough to just load the game up from before and make a different choice.  You'll still likely pick one kind of character and stick with it, a joker, a serious man, a violent crazy... the results of these choices are more impacting than in most similar RPGs though.  In Mass Effect for instance your decisions seems to effect cutscenes later in the game, but not actual gameplay.  In AP, this is changed, and it reminds me of the classic Morrowind Thieve's and Fighter's guild quest-lines where you had to side with one or the other and that was that... in AP, you often take sides, and your missions later in the game are severely effected by it.So... choice and consequence, stat-based action that doesn't dumb it down and amazing Splinter Cell style stealth.  That is what you get with Alpha Protocol.  If you want the next extremely polished AAA console shooter that cost 100 million dollars to make then look elsewhere, but if you fondly remember games like Deus Ex, which made you think about your character build and rely on more than your shooter skills, and gave you endless choice and consequence in the story, and you can live with some lack of polish... well, Alpha Protocol is for you, as it was for me, and I suggest a purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

In fact, it should be a requirement that you buy this immediately with your PS3 system.

In fact, this game borrows heavily (and at certain points, STEALS) from the Tomb Raider series A LOT.  Just take a look at the way Nate jumps on ledges, wall runs on vines, etc.  That's a bad thing when it comes to creativity/originality, but hey, Tomb Raider was awesome, and it's great to see another well-produced game along those same lines.As for the storyline of the game, elements of it were heavily borrowed from the movie \"Romancing the Stone\" with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner (Nate taking Douglas' role, and the female journalist taking Turner's).  The similarities are remarkable here!  So obviously, the developers of the game had both Tomb Raider and \"Romancing the Stone\" in mind when they developed Uncharted.  Uncharted 2 is also out right now, so maybe that's like \"Jewel of the Nile\"?

Thats until I started playing the first thing about this game that is noticeable  is the graphics that it boasts they are very impressive. The story is very shallow at the start but then it picks up and its very hard to put this game down I found myself starting playing at 6 and stopped in 12 at night. The gameplay is a combination, shooting with a cover system of course,  interesting platforming and some very fun driving sequences and it also has some puzzles which are not very hard but I loved one specifically(I won't say cause I don't want to spoil anything) The story is as I said shallow at the start but then it picks up and what they made of el dorado is very interesting(SMALL SPOILER it ain't really a city of gold) The last parts of the game are very rememberable and I highly recommend this game, sorry if my review is kinda bad I am not really good at making reviews.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player. The realistic environment features real-time weather and light changes that effect the game play for a remarkably immersive experience.Explore an Entire TownThe town of Bright Falls is 100 square kilometers, and players will be able to roam through this incredibly detailed area any way they like, roaming the town or wandering out to the lakes, forest, satellite towns, and more. The game gives the player goals, but how he chooses to go about completing them is up to him. Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Average, Flawed and Hardly Worth Playing","reviewText":"This is one of the few \"horror\" games available for the Xbox 360 so you have to take the good with the bad. Keep in mind this is a heavily story based game, so you can't expect the game mechanics to be perfect. Despite that, it's hard to find anything worth a second look in Alan Wake.Main PointsGood-Story is dynamic and multi-faceted-Definitely has the scare factor-Extras really help explain the world of Bright FallsBad-General mechanics could use some tweaking-Later weapons are sometimes less effective than initial ones-Graphics are barely average and in cases quite bad-Despite the dozens of cutscenes, story is hard to follow-Repetitive gameplay defeats almost any fun factorGameplay and Combat 5 of 10In a world of FPS Alan Wake stands out as a deviation to the norm. In the world of Alan wake you are a famous writer reminiscent of a Stephen King novel. And the game is setup to appear like a movie. You'll be spending the majority of your time running through the woods. No; take that back. You'll spend 80% of the time running or driving through the woods. The repetition is punctuated by collectables which are manuscript pages or these coffee thermoses that you find lying around the forest. They contain pieces of the story. While in the woods you'll be fighting things called \"The Taken.\" These are dark entities that are some sort of possessed townsfolk brought to life by this Darkness that resides in Cauldron Lake. The Taken are turned away only by light and this is also the only thing that heals you.It's difficult to describe the combat without making it sound utterly boring. You fight small groups of Taken usually 3-6 at a time. To keep them away from you, you HAVE to have the light shining on the particular person and usually make it \"focus\" to maybe burn out their retinas or something. And if you stay too preoccupied with one, another will come up behind you and hit you in the back with an axe. It only takes three solid hits to kill you, so you have to be quick. But, if you've played any shooters, the learning curve should be pretty short. Otherwise, there are a decent amount of weapons, but they don't really progress all that much. Your main weapons are: revolver, shotgun (almost worthless), pump shotgun and hunting rifle in the way of firearms. And then occasionally you're given a flare gun which takes out a bunch of enemies all at once, same thing with the flashbang grenades.Other than that there really aren't any other true weapons. It's not that you can't get by with them; it's that they get so flippin' boring to use. The revolver is the only good all-around weapon. The other ones don't seem to be any stronger and they take far longer to reload and shoot. There's almost no progression and absolutely no balance. Worst of all, there are only two human enemies - big guys and little guys. Then sometimes these large groups of ravens will attack you.Graphics 5 of 10People look quite good in Alan Wake; faces are very detailed have a decent human quality to them as well as the majority of the animation. But the forest looks so sub-par it's hard to discount. Trees are 3-D and there are shrubs and grass blades, but that's about where the next gen visuals stop. Everything just looks so pixelated. Textures resemble a polished PS2 game and remember you'll be spending the vast majority of your time in the forest.Story 6 of 10When I think about horror games of the past, Resident Evil, Silent Hill and so on come to mind. They gave me a compulsion to want to find out what's going to happen. With Alan Wake I find myself getting the scare and stress factor but find it difficult to care what's going on. And it was even harder to finish. The characters are either too boring or to ostentatious. And I personally couldn't relate to Wake whatsoever. He's a whiny writer who picked a backwoods town to take a vacation in. Then he gets annoyed by anyone who mentions that they're a fan. What did he expect? The other characters aside from the main antagonist are forgettable. In terms of game stories it's actually pretty solid. There is a plot with well-defined characters, intrigue, mystery and background in terms of the manuscripts you pick up along the way. But as I said before, it's a story based game so it has to rely on the story because the real gaming part is going to be lackluster. Maybe I just find the whole idea of a \"horror game\" a bad idea.Replay Value and Difficulty 4 of 10Replaying Alan Wake even with DLC is not likely for myself. The game is probably worth $30 at best. The main reason is I find almost no reason to do so. The manuscript pages offer a deeper dive into the story of Alan Wake, but are written in the narrative of Wake's poetic license so these are less factual than they are a different look at what's already happening in the game. The game is quite difficult even on what they call normal. This is how I first play a game is usually on its lowest difficulty to get the mechanics down and understand how they really programmed the game. So for casual gamers this would be quite off-putting. For people who want a real challenge, it's perfect. Gameplay tops out at about 15 hours, which I was actually happy about; as I said before at $30 you're pushing the value limit.ConclusionAlan Wake is a game which takes a risk on a bold new gaming experience, melding the King-esque storytelling with the third person shooter. And it works ok, that is the issue with everything. It's all just ok. There's nothing inspiring or fun about the game if you're not totally into the genre or you find this particular story very appealing. Would I rent or buy? I'd definitely rent to see if you like it, but I'd be hard pressed to tell anyone to buy this without a trial period.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2011"}

Luckily, that isn't the case. Blood Dragon is downright awesome, and it's one of the best stand alone games I've played since Minerva's Den. Why? Well, it's pretty simple. It's basically the dream 80's action film in a video game form. Part Tron, part Terminator, and part Robocop, this balls to wall action game deftly mixes the the best of 80's action films with all out with explosive game play. Let me just say that, if you have any passing interest in 80's action films, you need to play this game.First off, while Blood Dragon essentially Far Cry 3 regarding game play, everything else is completely different. Honestly, it's the whole 80's inspiration that drove me to purchase this, and they did NOT disappoint. The basic plot revolves around Sergeant Rex \"Power\" Colt, who's on a mission to destroy a rogue robot army in a futuristic dystopia in 2007. He's aiming to get the chick, cause a lot of deaths and destruction, and of course, save the world from a robot apocalypse. Along the way, there are cyborgs, cheesy 80's one-liners, laser-spewing dragons, and a world that is basically an orgy of neon lights and brilliant, colorful landscapes, brought up to uncomfortable levels of rave. Oh, and they have Michael Biehn (of Aliens/Terminator fame) playing the lead role.It's the style, and the fact that they hold NOTHING back, is why this tongue in cheek, but still genuine, love for the 80's works. It's a wild game, evoking every awesome 80's action film brought up to the most grandiose levels of sheer awesomeness. It's wild and it doesn't hold anything back. The visuals are stunning, as the game is awash with brilliant neon colors, designed in conjunction with terrific art direction that brings to mind the type of fantastic world I've dreamed about since I was watching the said 80's films. The music itself rounds out the packaging, effortlessly mixing futuristic techno with the of 80's action films such as Terminator and Robocop.Game play wise, Blood Dragon plays pretty much identical to Far Cry 3. The only really major change is that, instead of skill trees, it's basically just a more predetermined smaller set of skills (weapons are handled differently as well, but it doesn't deviate from the original game all that much).  If you played the third game, there is little you need to know about the game play. The mechanics are identical, and in truth, Blood Dragon is pretty much identical to Far Cry 3, only re-skinned to match the all out 80's wackiness. Honestly though, that's not really a pejorative; the game's style is just so wild that it proves aesthetics can provide a totally different experience. Besides, it's DLC, so what do you expect? Bottom line, if you liked Far Cry 3's game play, you will like Blood Dragon as a game without question.Enough talk. Check out the bloody thing as of right now. Blood Dragon is definitely a surprise this year, but it's a welcome one. Far Cry 3 was definitely one of the best FPS games I've ever played, so a completely wild spin-off was more than welcome. Not too much to say here, but if you like Far Cry 3, or have nostalgia for awesome 80's action flicks, than check out Blood Dragon now. You won't regret it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}

Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"Not the Best, but good.","reviewText":"A couple of years ago, I bought Road Rage, and I finally decided to share my thoughts on this fun but not very good game. So far, the Simpsons franchise has released many games. The Simpsons is the longes running and best T.V. series in history, but the games, unfortunately, are not one for the record books. Many years ago, in the early 1990s, The Simpsons for arcades was released. The game was quite fun, but did not capture the feel of the Simpsons. Then came The Simpsons wrestling, for the Playstation. The game was fun, but got boring quickly, very similar to Road Rage. And as far as the Simpsons Skateboarding goes, I won't even get into how bad that game is. Now, the problem with Road Rage is that it is not a fresh formula. Instead, it is merely a Crazy Taxi clone, with The Simpsons. While the game was as enjoyable as Crazy Taxi, any fan of Crazy Taxi became bored because they had already played the same game in a different style. Road Rage is not a bad game, it just really doesn't give the Simpsons video games that extra boost that they need. The Simpsons Hit and Run was recently released.(Check out my preview on that.)It is just like Vice City, except in the Simpsons world. Of course, it is not as violent. However, Hit and Run is the best Simpsons game ever made, so get that instead of Road Rage. But I won't lie to you. Any hardcore fan of the series should give Road Rage a look, even just a rental. But get Hit and Run instead! 'Nuff said! This is one game that Marge would frown at, and Bart would love. Decide which you are like!My Rating:7.0.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2003"}

The original game, while not without its flaws, was a greatly executed game that combined great 3-D action of today's new era with older action gaming elements.  Devil May Cry 2's problems come into play with the improvements made from the original.  While the levels are quite larger than the original's, the level of detail and personality are nowhere to be found.  The environments just look so generic and unappealing that they will become instantly forgettable.  Dante has a few new moves that are easy to pull off, but are worth nothing more than to improve your stylish action rating.  Dante also has a partner named Lucia, but her levels are pretty much the same as Dante's only shorter and some go in a reverse order.  Also, Dane's ultra cool attitude that he had in the original we hardly see any of until late in the game, but then again the game is rather short, and players will walk away feeling disappointed.

This game is also  first new handheld title in the Zelda franchise that Nintendo has released for one of their flagship products, the 3DS.  The game is a direct sequel to the 1991 SNES title, &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;, which is one of the most highly acclaimed games in Nintendo&#8217;s bountiful back catalogue, featuring all new dungeons.Make no mistake.  &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is the best Zelda game since &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221; or, barring that, &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221; itself.  For longtime Zelda players, &#8220;Link Between Worlds&#8221; may first initially lull you with its emotionally powerful, highly nostalgic rendering of Hyrule circa 1992, only to discover how deeply Nintendo is rearranging the Zelda template.  &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; casts off series conventions (while still retaining its identity as a Zelda title).To compare notes with another franchise,  Hideo Kojima is radically restructuring the inherent design of the Metal Gear universe by making &#8220;Metal Gear Solid 5&#34; an open world game rather than a tightly controlled stealth game.  In order to ease players into the radical shift and new reinvention of Metal Gear&#8217;s signature stealth play, as adapted for an open world environment, Konami is releasing &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221;, which is a prologue to the main game, as a separate, introductory primer for &#8220;Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain&#8221;.&#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is a reshuffling of the deck, a &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221; if you will for Zelda.  Unlike the Metal Gear comparison, this game isn&#8217;t about charting new territory though - it&#8217;s about returning to the very roots that made the series so special in the first place. Before we get into the ramifications and what this game may mean for Zelda in general, here are some pros and cons.PROS:Link navigating via merging into walls as a painting is both highly imagitive and drastically opens up new ways of solving puzzles and transvering Hyrule, breathing much needed life into Zelda's [intellectual side] cerebral side.Excellent level design  almost goes without saying.  Nintendo has always excelled at level design.-No farming for items.  All usable items are manna-based, with a meter that regenerates over time.  You never have to worry about running out of bombs or arrows again!  (We so needed that in the original 1987 Zelda!-Mini-games, including baseball (!!!) and chicken dodging-Has a dual world setup (Hyrule and Lorule), like the original SNES game.NEUTRAL:-Borrows the overworld map of its SNES predecessor almost to the pixel.  For veterans of the series, this borrowing will be highly nostalgic, though others may complain they are just rehashing &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221;.  One benefit of using the same map is that it helps provide continuity for a series renowned for how disconnected each game appears in relation to others.  (In 2011, Nintendo finally published an official timeline in &#8220;Hyrule Historia&#8221;.  Guess what!  There are THREE SEPARATE OFFICIAL TIME LINES, and all three branch off from &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221;.)-The story is pretty simple.  While some may think that detracts from the overall experience, I am fine with a simplified story.  Nintendo has never been about story, and when they do get tangled into in-depth story-telling, you end up with three timelines and soap opera disasters like &#8220;Metroid: Other M&#8221; which by the end you lose almost all respect for Samus.  There&#8217;s a reason why they keep narrative out of Mario games (though to be fair, the Mario RPGs have some good stories).CONS:-Visually feels little more than an upgrade to &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221;, rather than a distinct artistic style.-The Overworld, while expansive in 1991, feels a little small by today&#8217;s standards.-Lorule (as opposed to Hyrule) just sounds like an idiotic linguist pun.  This is just a minor personal complaint though.THE MORE PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS OF MODERN ZELDA:  It&#8217;s not a secret to everybody (to lightly misquote a certain Mobin) that Zelda has grown increasingly stagnant in recent years.&#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221; is by far the most devise of the mainstream &#8220;Zelda&#8221; installments, even more so than initial responses to the art style of &#8220;Wind Waker&#8221; circa 2003.  The more flawed elements of that game are all game design decisions that became codified in the sacrosanct &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221; and over the years finally met their logical conclusion in &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;.Eiji Anouma, the main overseer of the series, has even stated in post &#8216;Skyward Sword&#8217; interviews that Nintendo is rethinking Zelda conventions in order to keep the series fresh and relevant due to lackluster response by players to recent titles.Tevis Thompson has written a great, lengthy essay regarding the issues he believes is plaguing modern Zelda games.  (The title is &#8220;Zelda Just Keeps Getting Worse. But It Isn't Beyond Saving&#8221;.  It is well worth reading).  Thompson is discussing &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;, the 2011 Wii game.  &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221; is by far the most devise of the mainstream &#8220;Zelda&#8221; installments, even more so than &#8220;Wind Waker&#8221;.  While far too long to address Thompson point by point for an Amazon review, the essential summary of his complaints are three fold:1.  Zelda has gone from a vast, overworld experience to an increasingly narrowed, mechanical by rote design, rather than organic gameplay which invites multiple methods of play.  Key quote: &#8220;Modern Zeldas do not offer worlds. They offer elaborate contraptions reskinned with a nature theme, a giant nest of interconnected locks.&#8221;  Thompson describes &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221; as a culmination of &#8220;reducing the world into a series of bottlenecks&#8221;.  In other worlds, Zelda games have become so mechanical in nature that they have lot their sense of wonder and adventure and even (or perhaps especially) danger.  The worlds also feel empty, a complaint I first voiced against &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221;.  For all the grandeur of &#8220;Hyrule Field&#8221;, save for some Stalfos knights that appear after sunset and an occasional Peahat or too, it&#8217;s a pretty empty field.  The sky in Skyward Sword is also notoriously void of any real exploratory content worth mentioning.2.  Lack of Difficulty.  The two NES Zelda games (especially &#8220;The Adventure of Link&#8221;) can be brutal at times. Beginning with &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;, the difficulty of the Zelda franchise has been on a steep downward slope.  Saturo Iwata, Nintendo&#8217;s President, has directly addressed this decrease in difficulty in Nintendo products.3.  No respect for the player.  By design of bottle-neck environmental roadblocks (first heavily featured in &#8220;Zelda II&#8221;* and culminating in &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;), greatly reduced difficulty, and extemly intrusive &#8220;journey companions&#8221; that hold your hand every step of the way, Zelda feels more like a guided tour of Hyrule than a daring adventure with real danger at every turn.  The puzzle elements have been greatly minimized due to constant direction.RESTORING ADVENTURE TO ZELDA: &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; largely addresses Thompson&#8217;s concerns.  These are the practical, concrete game play mechanics in which A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is reinvigorating Zelda.-Death has consequences.  When renting your items, you are able to keep said items for as long as you stay alive.  However, if you die you lose your items.-Challenge: Directly ties to the first point.  The overworld isn&#8217;t the grandiose, but almost entirely devoid of enemies, Hyrule Field.  Instead, there are well armored foes intent on killing Link and LOTS OF THEM.  Likewise, the dungeon bosses are more difficult than we&#8217;ve seen in a long time.  They take skill and cunning to beat as well as figuring out how to best exploit their weak spot.  The dungeon enemies themselves are no pushover either.-Enemies are used as boundary markers.  From Thompson&#8217;s essay: &#8220;Link must be allowed to enter areas he's not ready for. He must be allowed to be defeated, not blocked, by the world and its inhabitants.&#8221;  You can get into some areas that will push you to your max to escape alive, let alone in stunning victory.-&#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; returns to the open world feel of the original NES title, albeit in the confines of Hyrule as shown in &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;. Due to renting items, dungeons are largely (but not entirely) completeable in any order, rather than a pre-defined set path that must be followed at all costs.-Item renting restores some of the wonder and adventure to the series, because this time around you are truly interested in the contents of treasure chests, knowing that they will hold something other than series trope items such as boomerangs, bows, etc.-Fast Travelling: If you find yourself without necessary items for a dungeon, you can quickly get to the shop to get said item via warp points without excessive backtracking.-No more &#8220;Hey, Listen!&#8221;  For the first time in years, Link is on his own, left to figure out what he must do without constant rejoinders from the game helper of the week.  To compensate, if you need assistance there is the very unintrusive Hint Glasses which are mentioned briefly and then never forced upon the player, or visiting fortune tellers, which is entirely at the player&#8217;s discretion.  Just like the statue in the 1st palace of the Dark World where you must shoot an arrow in its eye to proceed or the backtracking in the Ice Palace, there will be moments you are left puzzling what to do.WHAT &#8220;A LINK BETWEEN WORLDS&#8221; MEANS FOR THE ZELDA FRANCHISE: There are two main camps in Zelda Fandom: those who think &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221; is the best and those who think &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221; is best.  While predictions are a dangerous venture at the best of times, &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; clearly indicates that Nintendo is not above radically rewriting conventions for one of its most successful IPs, returning them to earlier times.  To return to the Metal Gear comparison with &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221;, &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is laying the groundwork for the still unnamed (at the time of writing) Wii U Zelda game which we know is in development.Appropriately enough for a series with three time lines, developmentally and in game design &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; has effectively ignored the last twenty years of its own franchise. Nintendo has returned to the original ethos and game philosophy of the first Zelda titles and have created an alternate point of development in which Aonuma has indicated he is fully intent upon pursuing. Anouma has confessed to never completing the original Zelda title and wanting to never make a game like that.  Before this game, this attitude would explain why there is such a disconnect between the recent games and the trail-blazing originals.When the game was first pitched to Miyamoto (before it was a &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221; sequel or even featured the painting), he declined, saying that it &#34;sounds like an idea that's 20 years old!&#8221;.  While the context is not exactly the same, Anouma and his team are finally returning to the hallmarks of Zelda that so captivated us in the first place (at least, gamers of my generation), returning to the older ideas of the series.&#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is a course correction LONG OVER DUE, and if this game is any clear indication, not only have Anouma and his team learned from their mistakes with &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;, but are going all the way back to the very foundational elements of the series before &#8220;Ocarina&#8221;.Aonuma has stated based on user feed back (now so readifuly plentiful via the Internet and Miiverse) that the new Wii U Zelda game will focus much more on the open-world feel so pioneered by the original NES classic that has been largely untouched by the series since then.  Games such as the The Elder Scrolls and the Grand Theft Autos are more closely kin to the original &#8220;Zelda&#8221; than &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;  If Anouma is to be believed, then the Wii U Zelda will be a reinvention of modern 3D Zelda titles.  If Nintendo follows the direction established in &#8220;Link Between Worlds&#8221;, then the Wii U Zelda will be a grand reinvention indeed!While Miyamoto is ultimately responsible for Zelda, the last fifteen years have largely been spearheaded by Anouma, and for the first time I feel that we are seeing how Nintendo would develop the series based on the original four games.  We are returning to Miyamoto&#8217;s original vision for the series at long last!.......*Whereas almost the entirety of Hyrule in &#8220;The Legend of Zelda&#8221; is open to the player, in each successive game the ability to explore became increasingly more and more confined either by necessity of the plot or that to progess to Dungeon 2, you must have an item from Dungeon 1, etc.  Thompson points to &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221; as the starting point of this mechanical trend in Zelda games (&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a wall with weird rocks.  Use a bomb.&#8221;), which is not wholly accurate.  While minimally present in the original NES game, &#8220;Zelda II&#8221; is the first game that really locked you into a defined order of dungeons and locked off worlds.  While &#8216;Link to the Past&#8217;&#8216;s Dark World dungeons are tremendously flexible in the order in which you complete them in &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;, there is absolutely no possible way for extensive sequence-breaking in &#8220;Zelda II&#8221;.  Want to go to the Island Palace?  You have to have the Faerie Spell, which can only be obtained by use of the hammer.  Want to go to Maze Palace?  Have to have the Raft from the Island Palace in order to cross over into eastern Hyrule.  Want to go to the Sea Palace?  Have to have the boots from the Maze Palace.  To get into Three Rock Palace (or even access the southern portion of Hyrule in which that palace is located), you have to have the Flute from the Sea Palace to get by the River Devil guarding the bridge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Red Baron \"Rdeschain\"","summary":"Not A Bad Game, But Not A Great Game","reviewText":"I played through the story line, and I enjoyed playing the game,  Some people have complained about the language and story,  but I thought that the way they integrated the experience aspect with the story line was good, it makes sense to the story that your gaining skill points which is different then other games.  The story is not fine literature,  but then again it's a FPS.  If you want a story driven game this is not the right place to look for it,  I am aware other games have story and action but this game is not trying to do that,  It is not like they shot for something and missed,  they aimed at a specific goal and made it.The graphics and good,  and the game play is engaging as well,  the skill points aspect of the game is fun, and not as repetitive as I thought when I looked at the reviews,  it is all based on how you play the game,  if you change up the weapons frequently then it is not that big of an issue,  if you use the same three guns the entire game it will be an issue.I am extremely disappointed in the multiplayer function,  I have a good internet connection at my house, and this game kept saying some odd message about something or other not being properly set so I would have trouble hosting a game,  I have not had this issue with any other game I have played or owned, so I am a little confused,  also I have gone back to older games that I enjoyed playing online,  Resistance two is one of my all time favorites,  it came out a while back and has a lot of features,  Games are supposed to progress and develop new features,  all games have lets say a death match or team death match,  one of the recent halo games has something called Horde which is basically the only multiplayer function in Bulletstorm.  Resistance Two has all those other multiplayer plus team based missions that change up every time you play a map, so that no two times are the same really,  the objectives in each mission and they change up so that you have a unique experience.  None of that in this game,  it is the same thing every time,  you have to play with a certain number of people, and you have to gain skill points by killing enemies,  but the maps I have played on were so small that the other people kept killing people right before I tried to,  We were fighting over enemies to kill... Lame.I am giving this game three stars for that reason,  EA is going to charge people who buy the game used ten dollars to use the online features,  or just to play the story mode,  not sure if you can just play offline.  But that is really unfair to consumers,  first to charge them, but also because the content is not working as well as it should,  the one multiplayer match I got into was glitchy, and they decided that the best place to put a warning about internet connection was in the center of the screen,  I was playing and right in the middle of the screen was \"internet connection bad\" or something like that in big black letters,  not cool.  So The only thing that you really get is a single type of multiplayer game, where you work with other players to fight a bunch of bad guys,  to get points and your ranked when you play echos,  that does not seem worth charging people who want to buy a used copy ten dollars.  They should have put in the other standard multiplayer games,  Death Match, Capture the Flag, and so on, as well as team based for the same thing.  They could have been more creative, then using something that is basically a multiplayer version of the game in a smaller level, Resident Evil 5 added Versus, but they charged players,  if games are going to be adding multiplayer DLC that seems really wrong,  I will bet anyone that they release DLC and the download will be super small because like some other games,  it will just release content on the game disc.Also people who have complained about the language should know that you can turn it off in the main menu,  you can also turn off blood and gore.This game should have been better in terms of the multiplayer,  because that is how most people get hours out of a game,  but this games multiplayer functions are super lame,  and non creative,  I mean just off the top of my head they could have used the gravity boots from the first five seconds of the game to do a sky scrapper death match, where your running around a building,  they could have had a death match where not only do you have to survive but you have to make your way through a collapsing building a very popular theme in the game,  expanding on that they could have a team based version where one team has to keep you from escaping and destroying the building.  That took me two minutes,  the game developers had a lot more time to give players a really fun multiplayer experience, and instead they gave us one lousy mode that hardly works,  and they expect people who buy used games to pay ten dollars to be able to play it, as well as not being able to play on multiple platforms,  the days of games making it easier to go play at a friends house or lend games is being destroyed by EA.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2011"}

This one sneaked into our gaming universe while I was looking the other way - playingDemon's Souls, actually :). It was the first thing my big son asked for after earning a number of academic awards from his school so... PSN's quick downloads offered instant gratification. It's he who is the bigger Dragon Age fan but I played the sequel myself for a dozen hours or so already so these are my observations, enhanced by his better informed views.Dragon Age Origins: Awakening continues where the first game left off. Having played the previous chapter, I'm not sure how this would appeal to someone who'd begin their quest here but I suspect that would not be as good an experience. There is an option to transfer your previous character depending on the ending you unlocked on the first game or you can make a totally new character in the beginning of the game.In the story, you are a commander of the Grey Wardens and you literally own (true) the new land you are traveling. This gives you more power and more discretion than you had in the previous game. There is also a new set of characters you can invite into your team like Justice, a Fade spirit, and Anders, a rogue mage who escaped from the controlling mage tower.Occasionally, you'll bump into a few of the original characters and people whose lives you affected in the other game. New features in the game include new materials, like dragon wing, which is more powerful than the old materials ones like red steel. There are also new monsters, new classes and new ablates for the old ones. For extra abilities, you can now craft runes and enchant armor.The game is enjoyable, quite addicting, and lives up to the excitement and humor of its predecessor. I found the sequel quite enjoyable myself and, according to my son, there wasn't anything he didn't like about it except for the loading time. We both hope for more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2010"}

Before I bought it, I paced around the store biting my nails and reading (and re-reading) online reviews on my smart phone. Seemed like a toss-up, but the asking price was low so I decided to make the purchase. Within a few minutes of playing, I knew I'd bought a game I would never play through. In fact, I don't intend to play more than the 10 minutes I already put in. Here's why.It's a Wii port. Not only do you need to know this, which most people do, but you need to APPRECIATE this fact. Think about it for a minute. The graphics are ridiculously poor, the gameplay is absolutely awkward and not enjoyable, the missions are flat and repetitive, and the entire experience is what I would expect of a $5.99 PSN download-only game. Hey, when it comes to non-mainstream games and looking for something different, I'm first in line. However, when a game as bad as this one comes along, I feel the need to save others the headache of striking out on a completely unimaginative, boring game with clunky controls (a result of porting from Wii's motion-sensor controller) that should never have been brought over to the PS3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}

Captain Titus is summoned to a distressed planet where an Ork invasion is commencing.  Titus is a first responder to the crisis, to protect the Manufactorum and its prized posession, a Warlord class Titan, Invictus.The artwork, the story, the feel, the action -- all of it is very true for to the spirit of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.  Any fan of the genre will be delighted to see the world brought to such vivid life.  The level designs are generally large and open and are built to such a scale that you feel small in a gigantic universe.  Towering cathedral peaks, gigantic factory settings, Imperial fortifications, ruined cities, and much more.  There is no shortage of blood, gore, and exploding heads.The combat action isn't very complicated and is fairly easy to get a grip on through out the earlier levels.  As the game progresses you'll become exposed to slowly increasingly more frantic and pressured combat situations where you will have a chance to make use of your skills, weapons, and melee moves.  Your arsenal expands nicely over time, and there really isn't a lack of available ammunition in the long run.  The action does build slowly, but it certainly builds some good momentum as the game gets into the last third.  You will know the maelstrom of combat in due time.Any fan of Warhammer 40,000 should give this game a try.  Play it through, if at all possible, and really experience what the game has to offer.  I can't tantalize any further without spoilers.  If you aren't a fan the game can still be very appealing as the action is good -- and who knows, you may find yourself pursuing the genre beyond the video game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph","summary":"A space tragedy (spoilers)","reviewText":"After romping around the Mass Effect world over three games and more than 100 hours total, watching the final battle for Earth play out, and then making what Nicholas Sparks would call \"The Choice\", I found myself feeling like the entire experience had been a complete waste of time.  It sounds spoiled, I know, but that was my honest reaction.  Why turn my back on many happy hours of rewarding gameplay?  I don't fully understand yet, but I'm pretty sure it is for narrative reasons.  Here goes a justification:The characters in the Mass Effect series and their dialogues are not particularly well-written.  Well acted?  Sure.  Well written?  Absolutely not.  This third installment is especially bad in this regard.  By the time I left off Mars I was cringing nearly every time any characters where talking to each other, but sitting through all the stilted conversations waiting for paragon actions to pop up.  Characters have some depth but now seem to primarily exist in the game world for two reason: 1.) as outputs for a continual stream of humorless, sarcastic comments and 2.) as conduits to a series of \"Sophie's Choice\"-style scenarios which become increasingly less interesting as it dawns on you that, yet again, you alone must decide the fate of this species or that.  It almost feels like Bioware looked at their successful application of a grandiose (and engaging) moral quandary in the final moments of ME2 and decided that ME3 should be nothing but those.  But these issues weren't really a big issue for me until the ending....The world effectively destroyed regardless of what actions you have made previously.  An AI comes out of no where, narratively speaking, and informs you that it's time for one last trip around the dialogue wheel.  All of the choices you agonized over, some feeling almost too personal to possibly exist in a video game, are discarded to make way for a brief and unsatisfying ontological explanation of the game world strait out of the \"Clever endings\" chapter of the \"How to write SciFi\" book.  It felt total inconsistent with the action-heavy, emotionally-overwrought tone of the preceding 99% of the series.  A good analogy would be the 1982 theatrical version of Bladerunner.Following this massive disappointment, it was easy to brood on other narrative issues, two of my favorites being:-Why is organ-grinder supreme Shepard even allowed to respond with emotion to most scenarios?  I mean to say, after the witnessing the horrors of battle (and in fact being the casual agent of many) would s/he realistically have any capacity for even a weak emotional response?-The currency with which you are paid in ME3, the 'credit': why would it hold any value to anyone after a galaxy-wide attack?From a technical and game play perspective the ME series is great.  Perhaps one day this fun, streamlined gameplay will be worked seamlessly into complex narratives.  A game which was clearly building toward a Michael Bay-style ending delivered one from 2001: A Space Odyssey, pretentious symbolism included.  Unfortunately, this one exasperating misstep clearly poisoned nearly everything about the whole series for me. It's great that Bioware had the nerve to undertake this project and I'm still glad that I supported them, but I would highly recommend not playing this or any of the other games unless, like Bladerunner, an alternative ending is tacked on.A Note For Indoctrination Theorists:-Even if what you say is true, the ending was still a narrative train wreck, a complete failure to convey the authors' intent.A Note For Mainstream Video Game Critics:-I honestly used to respect what you had to say, but your universally positive reviews of this game have ruined that too.  The disparity between gamer ratings (low) and your ratings (high) I think highlight how disconnected you've become. Your standing is gone now and maybe that will end up being good for the video game medium in the long run.UPDATE:(3/21) Sounds like Bioware is open to releasing an alternative ending.  Good for them.  There's certainly no shame in admitting that your first pass was an utter failure and then changing things. Bladerunner is case and point.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

The music is great with the Pherkad music being stunning. But the voice acting is just horrible. Flat, wooden delivery and overacted at the same time too.Gameplay: This isn't the good category but it's not bad. Basically your battle system is a card system, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Phantasy Star Card Revolution. Every turn you have the option to pick an attack, defense or magic and other cards for your turns. Probably is they're random so you can get stuck looking for something really quickly.

The game starts in the cheer village fo the first Jak and Daxter, then you find yourself hurdled into a time portal, where Jak is captured and tortured mercilessly by the &quot;Crimson guards,&quot; which are the law enforcment of the town, that is really just out to kill everyone.once you have broken out from the prison, you discover that dark eco has been pumped directly into your system, and you now have a sort of alter ego. Once you fill up your eco gage, you can go crazy and take out multiple foes, and look really cool too!Another addition to the sequel is vechiles. Everything hovers and flys from bikes to sedans. While travelling through the vast world, it gives a very dark dreary sense, and makes you feel out of place, thus the dark atmosphere.The most obvious addition to this game is the weaponry. You can obtain a plethora of destructive goodys throughout the game, and use them whenever you please, yes even to shoot civilians if your sick mind is so inclined!in conclusion, this game takes awhile to go from good to a master piece.

This game was originally released in Japan on June 10th, 2010. It took a lot of effort to finally get this game released in the USA. Credit goes to a few sources such as Operation Rainfall to help rally support, Gamestop for help funding the release (more on that later), and Nintendo of America for finally publishing this game for North America. I purchased this from Gamestop as it was the only retailer selling this game besides purchasing directly from Nintendo. The manager informed me that Gamestop made a deal with Nintendo to purchase all the copies of this game, essentially funding the North American localization and giving Gamestop exclusive rights to sell the game. Long story short, yes you have to purchase from Gamestop but that shouldn't stop anyone as it will help support these types of games for future releases in the USA. I would recommend playing this game with the Classic Controller or Classic Pro. The Wii remotes and Nunchuk aren't really complicated but it is much easier to move around and attack during combat with the other controllers and you don't have to hold two controllers.This game is a JRPG (Japanese Roll-Playing game) from director Tetsuya Takahashi (worked on a lot of the Final Fantasy games, Chrono Trigger, and Xenogears Saga). The story is amazing and will keep you hooked. The gameplay is addictive. There is a reason why game informer magazine gave this game a 9.5 out of 10, metacrtic a 92% and several other reviewers gave it a 9 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10. When you play it, you will see why.Battle System: Uses a real-time battle system with positioning. Similar to Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic, you select enemies (the main enemy is robots called Mechons or you can attack local wildlife), and choose to attack them. Some enemies will attack you on sight or sound. You can sneak up on most enemies and do a back attack for major damage. What is similar to Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic is that when you choose to attack, your party automatically attacks. The difference from those games is that the player you are controlling, you have to move them into position for them to auto-attack. Everybody has special attacks called arts and talent arts. These are spell-like abilities such as healing, shielding, defense, etc. and special attacks that can knock enemies down. Each art has a recharge period before you can use it again and talent arts recharge by using enough regular attacks. Some special art attacks will depend on positioning of the enemy, such as back attack you need to be behind the enemy or a side attack you need to be on one of the enemy's sides to deal the maximum damage. Other aspects of battle include combo attacks and the ability of your main weapon (the Xenoblade) to see future enemy attacks that will essentially knock out a party member. This ability gives you a chance to stop it from happening by warning that party member or doing something else to prevent it. The battle system is somewhat complex but very manageable with tutorials and they don't throw all aspects at you from the beginning. You can lock-on to enemies before actually attacking them and see what level they are at and if they will attack on site, sound, or just leave you alone. Obviously if you see an enemy or animal at level 75 when you are at level 20 you will know not to mess with them, but keep your distance as they may attack on sight and wipe you out fast.Inventory/Leveling up: Inventory is massive and found all over the place and obtained in treasure chests from defeated enemies. You can see if each item will help raise or lower the stats of each player. Some clothing items have slots on them where you can add ability gems or some come with ability gems already attached to them. More about this in the next section. You can buy and sell inventory. Leveling up is done automatically when you gain a level. Each combat art must be manually leveled up. From each battle, you gain points to use for leveling up these abilities.Gems: This is somewhat complicated to explain. There are multiple types of gems you can create including gems for increasing stats, attacks, defense, etc. You have to craft these gems from the raw materials you gather. Each material has one or multiple stat enhancements attached to them. These stats are measured in a percentage. When crafting gems, you have to choose a combination of materials that will take one of those stats to 100% or higher in order to create a gem. If there are multiple stat enhancements that don't reach 100% during crafting, you will be able to save 1 or more of them in pure form and reuse them. Materials also have different levels so you can craft higher level gems as you progress. All of this might sound confusing and granted I am still experimenting with this, but it is easier to do than to explain and the tutorials do a great job of explaining this.World Map/Exploration: Each area you explore has a map. Different points you come across in each area will have an auto transport icon that lets you warp to that location. If you want to go back to Colony 9 (where the game starts), you can just warp and then warp back to where you were). Exploration is very open and the area to explore is huge. The director described the area as the size of the Japanese Archipelago (basically the size of Japan itself) but the game moves along nicely. Each new area you reach on the map will also net you some experience points so exploring is beneficial to leveling up. There is day and night time during the game and enemies are different during the day and night. You can change the time of day at any time which is a nice feature and you can save anywhere (except during battles).Missions/Side Quests: The main story missions are easy to find and follow. A lot of times you get an arrow pointing the direction and distance you need to go. Side quests are plenty in this game. Most of them are not complicated just collecting certain items or defeating certain creatures. When you collect an item that is used for a future side quest or mission, the Manado tells you and marks that item for you so you know not to sell it. Side quests net you experience and money.Conclusion: This game is simply amazing. This is the first game I have ever reviewed before I actually complete it. I am about 20 hours in and loving every minute of this. I want to get the word out to pick this up and support this game. If you are a fan of JRPGs (and who isn't), get this game. If you are new to JRPGs, get this game. I believe this game will have aspects that every gamer will enjoy. Story, battle, exploration, crafting, character development, etc. This game has it all. Can't wait to finish it. If this game sounds complex, just remember that there are tutorials along the way and you can review them at any time during the game. I will update this review with any other details that I come across that could help other gamers make their decision to purchase. If you have questions, feel free to ask and I will try and answer them quickly. I give this game a 10 out of 10 and I don't see that changing as I progress in the game. This is the best graphics I have seen on the Wii and although it is not HD, I'm just glad I get to play this game and I thank all the efforts that went into getting Nintendo to release this in North America.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A great start to a storied franchise","reviewText":"I was never a fan of this series. I had played it before, but not long enough to hate or love it. Then a review by the Angry Video Game Nerd was released a week or two ago about the series and I decided to give it a try. At first I was frustrated, the game is very challenging. Not in a fair way though. Every time you get hit you jump backwards and if you're on a platform you fall to your death. That was a major flaw in this title. Still I found myself continuing to play it day after day. I still stink at it but it is rather addicting. The graphics are good for the NES with a large array of enemies. The music is also amazing for 8 bit and never seems to get old. It is now a gem in my collection.Presentation- This game has some of the best music in videogame history. The graphics look great and the overall feel of this game is spooky and horrifying. 5/5Graphics- This game looks awesome for the beginning of the 8 bit era. There is a nice palette that keeps the creepy feel without getting too dark. There are also a lot of different enemies to fight. The game looks great for its age. 5/5Story- Well you fight through castles and kill anyone in your path to get to Dracula. He is the main villain of the game and the rest of the series. Not a bad story for as old as the game is. Some text would have been nice to add to the depth of the story though. 4.5/5Game play- This game has some great side scrolling action. There are many powerups and weapons to get along with an array of enemies to battle. The one flaw is the jumping backward when you get hit, which adds a lot of frustration to the game. Other than that no complaints, except it's hard for me to find porkchops (health) which are hidden in the walls. 3.5/5Lasting Appeal- Despite its game play flaws it is surprisingly addicting. I have ordered the sequel and I believe that I'm now a true fan of the franchise. I am continuing to play even through the frustration. It's kept my attention and is a true classic. 5/5The Verdict: This game was a huge surprise to me. I like old games but I don't normally get addicted to them like I was to this game. It does have its flaws but they are far out weighed by how fun it is to play. 4.6/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

Far Cry had a lot of AI problems with enemies being able to see you miles away, you needed a monster computer to run it, it had almost no story, and was pretty repetitive. Unfortunately, Far Cry 2 follows all these trends again, but with better graphics, a setting in Africa, an even more confusing story, a super confusing level editor, and the same bland boring huge open world. Now I'm not saying Far Cry 2 is bad I'm just saying it needs more filling because there is way to much crust on this one.The game starts out great with you in the back of a car driving to the guerrilla's headquarters. Once you get through the tutorial you're thrown into the beautiful yet empty world trying to find \"The Jackal\" who is feeding both rival gangs guns and fuel (APR and UFLL). You can work for either side since you need either or to get to The Jackal. For starters, the game has lots and lots of guns and you can upgrade them by using diamonds (finding diamonds cases and/or completing missions) you can buy the weapons for infinite ammo in your save rooms, you can buy manuals which increase accuracy, reliability, etc. You can also buy equipment that will let you hold more ammo, more health, more stimpaks etc. There's lots here and everything is fairly priced, but you earn diamonds so slowly it takes forever to get enough.When you're actually shooting the guns feel great, but another problem carried over from the first one is that these guys never die. You'll pump a whole clip in these guys and some times they'll still be standing. Some times your gun will jam and you have to mash X to get it unstuck and if you're really unlucky you're whole gun will break and then you're SOL. Getting the reliability upgrades fixes this and swapping out weapons from fallen foes helps this a lot. Far Cry 2 also has a \"buddy system\" which are aqcuired by completing missions, and these so called buddies can save you in battle (if you run out of health...think of it as an extra life), they can help make missions easier by offering alternatives. This is a great system and is probably the only great game play idea in Far Cry 2 that isn't boring or doesn't piss you off. When you do get low on health you can pry bullets out of yourself, wrap yourself in bandages, and even poke yourself with magic needles. You can refill these at health boxes in random areas or one of your save houses. You unlock new save houses by killing all guards in the area and bam there you go.The next game play element that is from the first game and was bizarrely stripped down is the vehicles you drive. There are only maybe five in the whole game and those are a Jeep, a car, an assault truck, and a couple of boats. When your vehicle gets banged up and starts smoking you can hop out and repair it to new which is great, but even if the car starts smoking a little bit it runs very slowly...LAME. Now to get to the most annoying part of the game...the constant back tracking. I understand this is an open world game (I love sandbox games don't get me wrong), but Far Cry 2 fails at this. First off the map they give you is horrible since it's a little piece of paper you hold (next to your GPS) and all the dots look like blobs so the legend is useless. You'll travel to a missions on one side of the map finish it then have to navigate all the way back to town. You can't really go off the trails since there are so many mountains, rocks, tress blocking your path unless you run on foot.Then this is where the meat of annoyance comes in; there's nothing in between all of this driving around! Maybe here and there you'll see an animal, but all you get are the same thugs coming after you in their vehicles from the guard posts plastered all along the trails. That is really ALL there is between driving from mission to mission. The missions are exactly the same, maybe you'll have to save a friend (or shoot him/her), but essentially it's all the same.The malaria effect was useless and made things even more annoying. Every so often you'll have to take a malaria pill and if you run out you have to go to the ends of the Earth (ok Africa!) to get more or you die. Essentially this makes the game boring and I got a headache every time I played this. Now if you like sandbox games where there is hardly a story, and you just drive around killing random thugs then go ahead have at it. Now this brings me to the level editor which is deep, but there's no tutorial and it is NOT user friendly. Lastly, the only exciting thing is multi player. The best part of Far Cry 2 are the graphics; the game is gorgeous with free flowing grass, everything burns, trees break when under fire, the lighting is beautiful it just all looks so good, but the game play is just not there. Sorry Ubisoft maybe Far Cry 3 will fix all of these issues.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access.

The Xbox 360 is in our family room so we have seen him play this game just about everyday for the past month. None of us are hard core gamers and we have not played the earlier versions or competing games, so this review is from the perspective of mostly casual players.The game has several single player modes, including the main story line campaign (very involved) and \"Special Ops\", but most enjoyable is the on-line multi-player (Xbox Live) game play. It is hard to get bored with this one.Here are my observations:+ Graphics - Simply Outstanding! Very detailed and realistic looking in most scenes - looks great on our 46\" HD-TV+ Controls - The game controls are fairly intuitive in the default mode, but can be customized to suite your preferences+ Difficulty - There are four levels of game difficulty, from \"Recruit\" (fairly easy) to \"Veteran\" (which so far is impossible for anyone in my house)+ Replay Value - The combination of difficulty settings and large number of \"Special Ops\" missions makes the this a fun game to replay, even after completing all of the missions+ On-Line Play - There are a lot of options for multi-player gaming, including \"Capture the Flag\", \"Team Death Match\", \"HQ Pro\", and our favorite \"Free for All\"As you would expect, this is a very violent game and can be somewhat disturbing since non-combatants (humans and animals) can be targeted. There is also the slightly gross blood splatter that shows up on the screen when you are injured.Overall, this is one of the best games for any system I have ever seen. The many missions and on-line play make this a great value since it possible to play a different game every time you turn the game on.Highly Recommended!CFH","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2010"}

Jackson's voice booming in your ear is controlling the character as it all happens. And now you can, with Afro Samurai for the Xbox 360. Based on the popular anime series, Afro Samurai will finally let gamers control their favorite samurai as he violently slashes through an eclectic lineup of assassins, ninjas, and robotic thugs..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The voice acting is done by Samuel L.

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An interesting action adventure with lots of style","reviewText":"The Good: Great graphics, voice acting, characters, and story, fun and gory combatThe Bad: Monotonous combat, very short, broken platforming, tough boss battlesAfro Samurai is just one of those comic/cartoons that you never really hear of until it's a video game. Afro Samurai is about a ummm...samurai named...Afro...who is trying to find the #1 headband from the person who killed his father. Anyone who holds the #1 headband becomes a god and only the #2 bearer can challenge #1. While the story has interesting developments and great characters the game is mainly focused on combat. Afro, and Ninja Ninja, are voiced by Samual L. Jackson (you may have heard him as Officer Tenpenny in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) along with Justice being voice by Ron Perlman (Hellboy fame).There are a lot of elements to the combat in AS, but the whole thing becomes very monotonous after a few levels. You have three basic attacks: Light, Heavy, and Kick (along with jump). You also have Focus attacks (which slow down time) and if you hold either heavy or light you with instantly slice in enemy to bits. Not all enemies can be easily succumbed to the Focus so some will have to be weakened before using this. There is also a Parry technique in which you can \"mount\" an enemy and slice their head off. Parry is essential to most boss fights (more on those later) and to staying alive.While the combat is very satisfying only because of the sheer amounts of gore that are spilled it does become very repetitive. There are combos you can learn but they aren't really necessary since you can just button mash most of the time. I particularly loved the gore since it isn't canned and any part you slice off WILL come off. If you slice just the toe that comes off, slice a piece of a guys' skin it comes off. The whole theme is very mature with lots of cussing, sexual innuendos, and nude polecats. Yes, nude female samurais...nothing's hotter than that. Anyways, there are some platforming sections, but this part of the game is somewhat flawed since Afro likes to stick to things a lot and the controls for this can be somewhat unresponsive. Controls for combat are spot on, but they seem to become sluggish and sticky when your platforming.Another great aspect (that I'm glad more developers are doing) is there is no HUD. Just like games such as Dead Space everything is on your main character to tell what's going on. The more Afro glows red the closer you are to dying, when your focus is charged up Afro's pendant sparkles...and that's pretty much all you need. You do level up and learn new focus moves such as bullet slice (reflect and slice bullets in slow-mo), mounting etc. There are some different enemy types, but there could have been more. You'll see a lot of the same ones half way through the game and it tends to add to the monotony.Enemy AI is actually pretty good and you will have a challenge fighting off enemies by the dozens. Thankfully Afro is fully equipped to take on all these baddies. Combat doesn't tend to get to frustrating until you get to bosses since the windows for attacking are so small it takes so much patience to kill them. While your character does level up it doesn't really make a difference since it's all set on auto really. The game is fairly short clocking in at about 4-6 hours depending on how you play the game and your skill level. There is zero replay value since there are no extra modes you unlock or anything. I just highly recommend Afro Samurai as a fun weekend rental.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Did I say Doom 3 BFG was repetitive because it bares repeating like in the game again and again and again.  That said the underlying story is interesting, the dialogue appears realistic especially that of the self serving self absorbed, totally deluded, pompous, over the top mega big space corporation.  The DOOM atmospherics aren't of a quality found in Dead Space and Dead Space 2 close but no equal.  The design of the space station facilities is interesting but again not as detailed and lived in as those found in the whole Dead Space franchise. Dead Space was so creepy because; everywhere there were signs of people just going about their everyday lives. You walked into room after room where half eaten sandwiches, well used bedrooms or messy kitchens told of people who may have just left.  In Dead Space you get the haunting impression that whatever happened took everyone by surprise interrupting their daily routines.  Death is always far more creepy and jolting if the victims do not appear to have seen it coming.DOOM 3 shares with us a mining planet which appears to be largely a boys club.  There were scant few sistas on the DOOM 3 vision of a Martian colony which made it less realistic.  I mean a brassiere salesman would die of malnutrition on the MARS featured in DOOM. The video quality is good but not great unless its being compared to DOOM 1 and 2 which are featured on this DOOM BFG disk.I took one star off for the perfectly horrible in game mechanics in DOOM 3 BFG.  I have seen some really BAD game control mechanics in my time but, the whole DOOM 3 BFG controller layout is so far beyond awful that words do it no justice.  If you played the best DOOM 3 on XBox 360 consider yourself lucky.  In DOOM 3 BFG You have very few in game controls to customize the gaming environment to your personal liking.The Playstation 3 port is perfect garbage.  The flashlight is an ugly generic lit circle with no shadow details. The weapons management system is clunky, unresponsive and not worthy of a quality video game release.  The weapons are all extremely slow to use cycle and reload making what might have been a fun game more a tedious chore to play. DOOM 3 BFG is still a fun very interesting game but this port is just terrible. Id software took out the best things about the original DOOM 3 and left in its wake this watered down game with its primitive control routines.  This DOOM 3 BFG port has frame rate issues on PS3 systems but they don't render the game unplayable.

I always invert my controls, so this game sucks for me, as the camera doesn't go where I want it to go and the game won't allow me to make it work right.The question is this: why would they let you invert the gun aim but not the camera?

A little continuity would be nice here.Inverting the look is natural to me... pressing the control stick up is like leaning your head down (looking down), whereas pressing it down is like leaning your head back (looking up), so not being able to make the controller work that way makes the game frustrating and unplayable. I tried to play the thing with the non-inverted camera and it is just completely foreign to me, like writing left-handed.

It seems like only yesterday I first discovered it in an arcade and eventually played it to death on the Dreamcast all those years ago, so saying that Marvel VS Capcom 3 has big shoes to fill is saying it lightly. Featuring graphics similar to Super Street Fighter IV and Tatsunoko VS Capcom; Marvel VS Capcom 3 takes all the insane combos and crazy character team-ups and gives them a serious upgrade. There is so much chaos going on on-screen that keeping up with it is difficult at first, but the game delivers everything that fans of the Marvel VS Capcom series have been yearning for. It looks and plays spectacularly, is easy to pick up and play, and it's final boss in Arcade Mode is Galactus (!), which makes the game worth checking out regardless. The only gripes I have with Marvel VS Capcom 3 is that the character roster isn't nearly as massive as it was the last time around, but that's understandable. However, while giving both Normal and Simple control schemes before you start playing gives button mashing gamers a whole new way to inflict damage. This choice between Normal and Simple comes off as being a bit cheap, especially considering how surprisingly deep the fighting engine was in Marvel VS Capcom 2. Still though, Marvel VS Capcom 3 is a spectacular achievement, and is more than worth picking up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2011"}

The one thing I never understood is the Super Move shpeal. Great, your opponent cuts to him/her glowing in rage for a second and that's basically your cue to BLOCK. I've never been victimized by a Super Move via player or CPU. The second you're being shown on the screen glowing (about to do your Super Move), you can either a) BLOCK or b) Pull off your Super Move right after to counter.

In addition to the outstanding graphics the game produces, while many other rpg's have players constantly \"fighting in a complex battle menue system,\" Fable II minimizes this to a large degree, and allows the player to switch from magic, to melee, to range weapons combat with ease and no fustration,  thereby allowing them \"enjoy playing the game\" without having to constantly pause the game and access a menue system in order to do something.

However with Call of Duty games it's hard not to compare, there is so much to live up to. I know this isn't Infinity Ward and also not Modern Warfare 3 but they did set the bar very high when it comes to military FPS. So the question is, does Black Ops live up to its predecessors? The answer of course, is yes it does!Come on! Do we really need to review this game, was there really any doubt! If you are a fan of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1 and 2 then you'll really enjoy this game. Honestly I enjoyed Black Ops just as much and in some cases more.In a nutshell, the graphics are beautiful, the action amazing and the story is entertaining to say the least. Controls are great and very fluid and if you've ever played any other FPS you'll feel right at home, and if you haven't its very easy to pick up from the start. Multiplayer has been revamped, includes everything that made Modern Warfare great plus fixes some of the things that didn't. My only complaint would be the match making, I wish it would match people more by their skill level and not randomly.It's worth the price and (not to sound like a commercial LOL) if you only buy one game this year, this should be it.Now stop reading reviews and go pick up the game so you can start blowing things up!

This game takes all the strengths of previous games and capitalizes on them while making a few great-yet-minor tweaks to improve the overall gameplay experience. The single player campaign is awesome, if somewhat confusing at times. Chewing up the Vietnamese coast in a PT boat while \"Sympathy for the Devil\" plays in the background? It doesn't get any more awesome than that. MP is awesome as always, I love the in-game economy for upgrading weapons and systems. Lets you get what you want and ignore what you don't. Overall the game isn't innovative, but frankly it doesn't set out to be. It's a continuation of what we know and love with minor improvements, making it overall the best COD game to date. People are too hard on it just because the improvements, at this point, are only incremental. There is NO way this is a 3-star game, as current reviews suggest. This game is getting poor reviews only because of where it is in the franchise's evolutionary progress (the tail end--following nearly perfected predecessors), which is a shame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"A Brilliant Return to a Classic","reviewText":"As one of the greatest games of all time, Ocarina of Time is definitely worthy of this 3D remake. Not exactly a sequel to the original, OoT 3D is more of an update, with all new features, as well as keeping the original's charm.The plot in Ocarina of Time is pretty simple. You play as Link, a young boy from the Kokiri Forest, who gets tangled up in a plot to save Hyrule and rescue Princess Zelda. To do this, he'll venture through various dungeons, and even travel back and forth through time. It's these plot mechanics that made the original so compelling, and they're all here in the new one. The plot is engrossing, and still remains a classic today. Like I said, you'll do a lot of dungeon exploration in Ocarina of Time, and there are plenty to keep you occupied as you continue through the story. All of them have their own themes, whether your in the forest or a fish's belly. The dungeons are challenging, but not to the point of frustration. Luckily, you have Sheikah Stones at your hand, which let you view hint movies that will give you clues on how to progress, or to beat a boss for instance. They're similar to the Super Guide, and they're completely optional, so veterans won't feel obliged to use them.A lot of series staples, such as lock-on targeting and Epona, are also here, so it's the full Zelda experience. Of course, it wouldn't be Zelda without items, and there are loads here, which can be accessed from the push of a button or a tap on the touch screen. You can store up to 4 items at once in these slots, making for easy access when they're needed, especially with the Iron Boots. There's even a spot for your Ocarina, so you won't have to fiddle through your inventory for one item. The control pad is put to great use, and you now have even more control over Link than you previously had. The 3DS's gyroscope is also put to great use, and you'll move it around to aim Link's slingshot, bow and arrow, and more. It's optional, and it does lose the 3D effect if you move it around too much, so I just stuck with the traditional controls. And, everyone's favorite is back: Navi. And she's annoying as ever, and she even reminds you to take a break from playing every 20 minutes.The whole world of Hyrule comes alive with the 3D effect, and mountains and buildings that were once flat blocks are now vibrant and colorful. All the original locales are back, and no locations have been altered, so it'll be very familiar to oldtime fans. Castle Town in particular is very impressive, and the 3D is the most impressive that I've seen it yet.I recommend playing with the 3D on full-blast, as it adds depth that was virtually unseen in the original classic. Characters also come to life, too, and Link and Zelda look remarkable in 3D, especially in their famous castle scene. The graphics aren't perfect, but it's understandable, and you still may see blocky pixels up close, or some walls and buildings that don't really make sense within the environment, but other than that, the graphics are amazing.The soundtrack has not been altered, either (thank god!), and one of the most impressive game soundtracks ever is here, and all your favorite tunes return. From Hyrule Field to Kakariko Village, your ears will be in for a treat. The sound effects have also remained the same. Link's grunts and jumps are similar, and Navi is just as annoying. Of course, why would you buy a 3D version of an identical classic if nothing was new? For me, it's enough, but Nintendo's added a lot of extras to the game, which only increase the replay value. First, there's a boss battle mode that can be accessed from Link's house, which lets you race against the clock to set records fighting all the bosses in the game. It's a fun diversion, and it's addicting to beat your best times. But the best addition of all, is the Master Quest.Once you beat the main story, the Master Quest is unlocked, which is a reversed edition of the game, with harder enemies and such. Although very difficult, the Master Quest is a fun extra quest that is very rewarding.The classic. Ocarina of Time is back, with all the original's features, plus all new additions. It's the best 3DS game out right now, and any 3DS owner should have this one in their library.Pros:An Updated ClassicAll-New controlsFantastic 3D effectRemarkable soundtrackCons:Graphics aren't perfect","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Squaresoft's Masterpiece","reviewText":"There are few series I consider to even be on the same level as the twelve official games in the Final Fantasy legacy, and of those I consider chapter eight to be the undeniable pinnacle. Which, considering its predecessor, the nearly omnipotent fanboy wet dream that was FFVII, says one hell of a lot. This title had every reason to underwhelm, from the groundbreaking success that preceded it (and the enormous shadow of expectations it had cast) to the wildly different path it chose to tread in terms of storyline themes and visual direction... yet it succeeds all the same.As is the case with any RPG, the best place to start with FFVIII is its storyline. While chapter seven was focused on a maniacal egomaniac and his plans to destroy the world through the use of magic and spirituality alone, chapter eight concerns itself more with the political and technological necessities of performing such a feat. Not quite as exciting material at a glance, but twice as realistic. Sorceress Edea, the main protagonist of the story, sets about on her aspirations by overthrowing the government of the largest military power in the world, brainwashing its citizens through the use of the media, invading and obliterating everyone in her path, and manipulating her underlings to the point where she has their complete support without even expanding upon her motivations. Where the glam and glitter of Cloud and Sephiroth's tale has become legendary, the struggles of Squall and Rinoa against their oppressors feel much more weighty and, god help me, believable.Likewise, the central characters in and around your party are much more relatable and varied than those in VII. Where Cloud, Tifa and Aerith, the previous leads, were generally one-dimensional and cartoony, spitting incredible dialog despite their shortcomings, VIII's characters each have elaborate personalities, perks, downfalls and tendencies. Though he's initially far less charismatic and appealing than Cloud, his immediate predecessor, Squall is a tremendously complex, well-rounded lead character with an established psychological excuse for his aggrivatingly anti-social nature. The villains are similarly developed, with an equal amount of redeemable qualities tossed in to keep their more prominent negative characteristics in check. You're never faced with a simple, black and white boss fight, as you were in previous chapters... there's always something about the person you're battling that you can relate to. You form such an incredible bond to the characters in your party that the final cinema is a truly emotional experience, one of the most rewarding and worthwhile conclusions I've ever experienced in gaming.Where every previous chapter in the Final Fantasy story had basically opened with the lead characters already trained and experienced in their professions, FF8 is the first to tell the story of how these characters were first educated as super-soldiers, which natural reservations they had with their chosen role, and just how awkward their first steps as pros really were. In a way, this story is half Platoon and half Breakfast Club. The characters form a bond under extreme circumstances, both with each other and with the player, and develop into skilled fighters before they're even comfortable talking openly about their feelings.Visually, FF8 was and still is an unbelievable sight. The photorealistic characters, settings and effects all but set the stage for the picturesque beauty of Final Fantasy X, the cutscenes remain an almost speechless affair, and the character designs and overall visual theme of the game itself are just breathtaking. This is a game I'd die to see simply reproduced in high definition at some point in the near future, as it pushed the old PSone above and beyond the limits of its hardware. The cinemas are occasionally marred by some artifacts caused by the necessary compression to fit this onto four discs, and the in-game visuals just scream for the power to deliver what they're so obviously capable of. The visual accomplishments of this game are just staggering, and the final cinematic caught me off-guard yet again by just blowing away the modern competition. This game was produced in 1999, and for its opening and closing cutscenes to tear apart their modern contemporaries more than a half decade later should say more than a few things about how awe-inspiring these graphics truly are.And, equally complimenting the humongous strides in the visual department is what I'd loudly proclaim to be the best soundtrack of the series. As was becoming the norm by this point, each character, vehicle, town and dungeon has its own accompanying theme song, but never before had the tunes been so closely intertwined and related as they are here. The softly plucked strings of the Balamb Garden, your base of operations for the majority of the game, are touched upon and mentioned throughout nearly the entire soundtrack, bringing the entire experience full-circle and tethering it to what's quickly identified by both story and player alike as your home. Even the overly sappy J-Pop love ballad, \"Eyes on You,\" which is possibly one of the more annoying things I've ever heard on its own, fits in amazingly when surrounded by the rest of this impressive score. Nobuo Uematsu has never produced finer, nor more immediately recognizable and emotional work.No matter what I say, I can never feel as though I'm doing this game justice. It's a masterwork, the greatest end product to ever emerge from the renowned studios of Squaresoft. Its concentration on the organization, application and implementation of magic into each character's physical attributes appealed to the anal-retentive librarian in me, while the epic storyline, unimaginably cool cutscenes and untouchable characters swept me off my feet. I have my doubts about Square's ability to recapture this past glory, considering the slow downward slope they've presented with each new chapter of the Final Fantasy series since the turn of the millennium, but that can't drag down my utter devotion to the perfection of this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2005"}

No matter if you heard of it before or seen it beeing played, if you have played Kirby's Adventures, remember a little of it, and read this reveiw, you will know almost exactly what the game is mostly like. Ok, ok, I'll get to the point: It's a remake of Kirby's Adventures. Hm, a remake of an old game on GBA, oh so suprising ('Roll eyes sarcasticly'). It has the same levels and enemys and bosses and powers, but new graphics and mini-games. It's a new and imporved Kirby's Adventure on a conveinet, handheld electronic that fits in most overhead compartemts! Yeah (another sarcastic roll of the eyes)! But for those who havnt played Kirby's Adventures, this is a very inovative game, since no one's really made any cheap rip offs of the Kirby series yet. You play as a little cute pink ball that vicously sucks in and dijests enemys in a cute sort of way and takes their abilitys and uses the abilities against other enemies. Even after 18 years or so, It's still a unique gameplay, just because... no one has made any cheap rip offs of it... Any way, theres one pro, let me think, whats another, hmmm, Oh yeah, for those who played Kirby's Adventures, this brings back alot of nostalgia, and nostalgia feels good. And oh, yeah, the mini games are real fun and can be played with four other players. And with the unique gameplay, it's a good destroyer of bordom. Now for the cons. This game is very short, it can take one about half a day to play this game and beat it, there are lots of secrets to find, but like all games this becomes a chore to do after beating the game. Also, the game can be too cute for a large audience of people. And after one hit, you lose the abilty you ate from an enemy, and have to run back and eat it again. Theres a lot of running around eating lost abilitys, and since you can only have one at a time, this does become very repetative. For long-time gamers who played Kirby's Adventures, this is a great buy that really brings back the money. If you havnt played that first kirby game, its a good thing to get if you have a little money left over after buying other games. It's a good time waster and can cure most cases of bordom, but not extreme bordom.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2003"}

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it&rsquo;s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"D.

The graphics are cartoony enough to make the gore comical but good enough to make it to where it isn't a joke either.  Jack Black is at his top notch Tenacious-D best.  The \"guest\" voices are great and the story so far is killer.Only gripe is a couple control and camera issues (what game doesn't have camera issues really).  At times the troops following me have gotten between me and the camera and I couldn't see enemies coming.  Control issues are minor in that I'll be working over an enemy with the battle axe and for some reason when it comes time to deal that final blow Eddy will turn around and drop the axe in the opposite direction and that opens me up for a mild pummeling.The game is great it has RPG elements, and RTS elements, all rolled up into a neatly packaged action/adventure game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone really.D'OH I completely forgot the music.  WOW.  All I can say is WOW.  Looking at the list of over 100 Songs I thought there was going to be a bunch of times where I would find the music distracting but every thing seems familiar when I hear it.GREAT game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

For years, I bought everything that came out, only to become disappointed more and more in the past several years.  Games getting shorter, gameplay getting worse and more cumbersome, stories getting so complex, terrible save systems and then ever rising prices made for just a lousy time.As with most people, I've started to both buy fewer games, as well as only buy them when their price drops through the floor. Very few games are even remotely worth the asking price at launch in recent years.  But there are exceptions....Borderlands was a sleeper hit, none of us saw it coming.  It filled my jones for a brainless, fun, addicting shooter, that was a \"no harm no foul\" shooter that kept my attention, entertained me, and almost never frustrated me.  I found myself playing through Borderlands many times in the past couple of years, mostly because it was just plain fun and didn't take itself too seriously.Now comes Borderlands 2..  even more silly, yet more addicting.  More stuff, more weird enemies, more bizarre storylines, more absurd weapons and gizmos, more piles of garbage and even more idiotic characters.  Its just plain fun.  Its the kind of game I can sit down for 20 minutes, shoot some stuff, play a mission, and then shut down the computer and get back to my normal life.This is the first 5 star game I may have played this year.  I actually stopped playing games for a good part of the year, as the releases have been awful for the most part.  Finally, something I can play through, and play again.  Just plain silly fun.

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"There's No Stopping Space Vikings T. Edwards!","summary":"Good","reviewText":"Graphics:Opening with some cut-scenes as many games do, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics. While for the most part they were beautiful, great scenery and fine details, there is a sub-par looking rendering of water, hair, cloth, and facial definition that took it down a couple of pegs. After putting several hours in with the game though I was greatly pleased to find that the actual gameplay is gorgeous. The environments are rich and imaginative, comparisons to Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth have been mentioned periodically to which I'd agree. For the most part many of the areas fit the feel of Castlevania despite a couple of stinkers, but if you took the more traditional Castlevania castle and simply spread its locations around then the better half of the game feels appropriate.Sound:Lords of Shadow has been knocked here and there for not feeling much like Castlevania, a sentiment I don't personally share at large, but I'd so far have to agree with in regards to the score.The music is, as far as I can tell, high quality orchestrated music. My personal 'problem' lies in what I feel is a failure to maintain the heart of what Castlevania music was. There were no cheesy electric guitar symphonies, no eerie choir, and really not a lot of blood boiling music. The music never once stood up and demanded attention. There are most certainly songs recycled from the past but they have been re-tooled to what I would call a more generic sound. This will probably go both ways for fans of the series, some may appreciate the progression of the music, and others may find themselves waxing poetic about the good ol' days along with me.The voice acting is good; you get typical Patrick Stewart along with some serviceable performances from everybody else. Generally you're only going to be dealing with it in cut-scenes and I think the storytelling there is good enough. Again I think the not-quite-right character models mar the delivery more than the actors themselves. There is however sporadic occurrences of NPCs nagging you through the levels which can be nerve grating when all you're trying to do is explore.General:The game unfolds in chapters and stages. Individual levels present themselves in different ways, some are longer combat areas, and some are really short with only a boss fight, and so on. Each individual level has a completion percentage which can ultimately be maxed out by playing the level on max difficulty, finding all of the hidden objects (which is tracked, nice), and completing a trial for that level. Out of the gate you can access 3/4 visible difficulties (don't know if there's any 'secret' difficulty) and switch them on the fly so as you progress and backtrack you can flesh out some of that completion if that tickles your fancy.It took me roughly 15 hours to beat the game on normal with relatively minimal backtracking. I'd say I skipped probably  - 1/3 of various unlockables and skipped over the challenges entirely. I'm thinking I probably have 5-10 hours more of gameplay to get the missed items and probably much more than that in challenges. The game has its hairy moments on normal but a person looking for a challenge could probably start off on Knight difficulty without too much added frustration.The camera can be highly problematic at times. Nine times out of ten it's going to be fine but in the one time when it isn't the frustration can be high. Some of the more minor things are a constant jitter to the camera and a poor correction to the analog controls as you switch areas but the single most irritating to me were enemies hanging out of your field of view. The enemies being out of view typically wasn't a problem but there were a couple of boss fights which forced me to play conservatively because of the camera which kind of took my head out of the fight. It's not game breaking, and turning on enemy life bars helps a lot, but it's certainly what I'd call a problem with the game.Achieves/trophies aren't too crazy, basically finish the game 100% (or 110% as the games suggests). I personally have no desire to play on higher difficulties unless I uncover some incentive for doing so but it looks like even a normal play should be able to get the majority of them.Combat:The core of the combat is Gabriel's weapon, the combat cross which I'm just going to call a whip. With your whip you have direct attacks mapped to a button and area attacks to another which you can string together in various ways as you unlock combos to execute... er combos. It's very straight forward, a little button-mashy, but since the two attack types perform in very different situations you'll generally be methodically timing one or the other. Many of the combos manifest themselves in a situational sense such as direct attacking after a grab, charging an area attack, and so on. I feel this contributes greatly to avoiding an indiscriminate faceroll of the controller since most combos have a pretty particular use and using it is mainly a matter of timing and positioning.In addition to Gabriel's whip you have secondary weapons and magic. All of the secondary weapons have a primary function but can also unlock additional abilities and combos. The magic is used sort of like combat states; you can hop in and out of light mode or dark mode provided you have enough energy to use attacks while in either. In their raw form light mode causes your attacks to heal you and dark mode causes your attacks to do more damage but their use doesn't end there. Each school has its own unlockable skills, which are quite powerful, but they can also be combined with certain secondary weapons. As an example you get fairies as a sub-weapon which serve as a distraction tool but when used in light magic mode they become seeking kamikaze fairies. The secondary weapons have limited uses and require occasional replenishment from kills and the environment. Your magical energy is replenished either from kills, fighting well and filling out your focus meter, or refilling at neutral energy wells. It's also worth noting that you can over-charge your magic up to an additional full bar but this bar will deplete itself over time regardless of whether you use it or not.In addition to the magic and sub-weapons Gabriel gets a small handful of additional relics. Some of these also serve as weapons or lend more combat abilities but they have more nuanced uses and can be a little difficult to effectively use in combat at times. They generally grant you some very cool moves but I personally found it difficult to find much reason to use them over the whip but it was nice to have them available for situational opportunity.Certain enemies also open up opportunities when weak to execute them via a simple button sequence while others can be ridden which is generally a progression tool. Riding a troll for example will let you smash walls, and you can certainly fight with it, but you're pretty caged in with the creatures you're allowed to ride making them have limited use as a mount. It's fun, it's there, but as I said it's mostly used as a tool to access new areas.Platforming:It's about what you'd expect I guess, lots of climbing and swinging. To me it feels mostly like a segue from one combat to another, which is fine because finding your way around is fun, but there doesn't really seem to be a lot of danger in doing it which adds to a sense of going through the motions. So far the majority of my failures in getting around have been to poorly defined barriers of where you can go or jumping in a pit because I didn't see a really obvious exit. Failing in the platforming isn't instant death, you just respawn at the last solid point you were on and take a bit of damage. Only if you repeatedly fail or find yourself low on life already will you actually die from a failed jump.Periodically you will be fighting titans which are really big bosses done Shadow of the Colossus style. You enter these fights and you're tasked with scaling the creature and attacking specific weak points. One could almost consider the platforming before these guys to be practice of sorts. You'll be using all of your jumping/swinging/climbing skills in conjunction with quick time events to methodically disable the titan as you traverse its body. It's quite a bit of fun but again it feels more like a game of memory and less like there's any real risk of dying.Story:It wasn't New York Times Best Seller material but I was certainly engaged from start to finish and towards the end my desire to unfold the next chapter ramped up so I'd call it a success. The ending wasn't what I expected at all, and I'm still gathering my opinions on how I feel about it, but it will certainly have Castlevania fans talking I believe. Be sure watch through the credits (assuming there's an option to skip).Pros:Gorgeous gameplayGood voice actingFun to playCons:The camera can be weird at timesIn closing I'm a big fan of Castlevania and I enjoyed the game a lot. It's a genre that doesn't find its way in to my house much but I had a blast playing this. If you're coming in to this game after having played the numerous similar games to come out this year it may be prudent to find a more discerning opinion on how this compares to other games in the genre but I assure you this was a very well done and fun game right out of the gate. I'd strongly recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"Bill Lumberg","summary":"It was a good game until EA showed their true colors.  Last EA game I will ever buy.","reviewText":"BY NO MEANS WHATSOEVER A REASON TO STOP PLAYING COD MW2. They want you to cough up $7 per class to unlock guns because they realized that they made it take forever and then some to level up and unlock things.  They could've just given double xp weekends or something. But, NO.  They want the player to pay for their mistake.  And people complained about the map pack price for MW2!  This is like a 10th prestige lobby in which they collect the money.  So , it's pay up or be at a disadvantage to those who have.  What EA has done is lower than low and I won't buy any of their games again (not that any were really that good to begin with). Also, they have an office near here where they pay their testers nothing and keep them as temps for years (literally) so that they never have to pay benefits. They were doing this long before the economy even got bad.  I know this as I know someone who worked their for over 2 years as a temp.  Below is my review before they really sunk so low.  Before this, the game was 4 stars.  Now it's 2.PROS: awesome sound that is great to crank volume up, explosions are great, vehicles, good degree of realism, conquest mode is a blast,  graphics decent, teamwork is encouraged.CONS: bad A.I. in single player campaign, only 5 maps for Conquest mode, I don't care much for Rush mode, few game types, cannot quit playing after match without waiting for next one to begin, weird movement, no prone.***Below, I've answered questions that one might ask about how the game compares to predecessor and MW2:HOW IS THIS GAME BETTER THAN THE FIRST BAD COMPANY?They have made the game more COD-like with level structure and regenerating health, more game types, movement doesn't seem as 'floaty'.WHY DOES THIS GAME NOT REPLACE COD MW2?They are two different games.  I wish that they could make one game with the good from both games. It would be as good as a game system with awesome online, bluray player, built in wi-fi, netflix without disc, that forza 3 and uncharted 2 could be played on.  Basically what MW2 is missing, BC2 has.  And vice versa.HOW DOES THIS GAME COMPARE TO MW2?*BC2 is better in these ways: sound, vehicles, more teamwork centered, explosions, destruction, less known multiplayer exploits, less camping.*MW2 is better in these ways: graphics, gameplay, action, movement, guns, campaign, more gametypes, better ranking system,killstreaks,  better when playing solo, game menus.I guess the 'floaty' movement in BC2 is the main reason why I prefer MW2 over it.  Still, BC2 is great and definitely worth buying.  It's a great change of pace and I plan to juggle playing the two games.  There is still a lot of camping going on in the BC2 but, at least half the people aren't sniping like in the 1st BC.  Please don't take the COD-haters' postings as gospel as far as it being better than MW2.  It is completely different and doesn't beat it in my opinion.  Go ahead and mark my review unhelpful, COD-HATERS.UPDATE:  If one thinks that this game is an escape from camping that happens in MW2, think again.  Except in this game a medic can camp with sniper and continuously heal him.  Also that spas really has some range on it.  Just a few annoyances I observed after playing for longer.  Also, I remember reading peoples' reviews saying how this game takes more actual skill.  My somewhat noob-ish female associate plays MW2 and this game with me all the time.  My MW2 k/d is twice hers but, we are about equal as far as k/d in this game even though my rank is higher. Hmmmm makes me wonder as I am not a camper in either game.  The title remains unchallenged for king of the online shooters.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B009LEIUY4","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Perhaps the best Etrian title to date-","reviewText":"Nice of Atlus to include the pre-purchase bonuses - but the art book was uninspiring.-->You do have the option to continue your demo file on the regular game.If you have played a game in this series, congratulations on discovering a wonderful, albeit niche series.There are a few new things. Most notably is the easy mode. I don't recommend it, part of my Etrian love comes from the punishing difficulty. That being said, even on the regular setting it's not as tough as the first three.The 3D is amazing, more so because it's so well integrated that I often forget it is 3D! The style of game is definitely geared towards a nice 3D style. Graphics aren't the best I've seen on 3DS, but they're very nice. The colors in the 'dungeons' is very nice.Battles are fast. This is old school, turn based combat. You can plan your attacks and be patient, but once you enter the commands, the action moves quickly. Battles can be tough but if you spend time grinding then you shouldn't get 'pwned' unless you run into a FOE. Usually that spells death unless you are well prepared.There are several other options such as the map mode. You can do what I do and let the computer draw the general map and then you draw the walls, secrets, doors, and other details. Or you can do it 100% down to the floor itself. Whichever way, it's still fun and reminds me of those old nes games like might and magic, shadowrun, wizardry, and others. Most of those games didn't have maps, so I used a lot of graph paper mapping those games by hand! Takes me way back.This is a clever blend of old school, turn based, first person video game rpg and of pen and paper rpgs. It's well worth purchasing. Especially since these games tend to get scarce later on and resell for higher than their release price.Also of note: Atlus has been releasing QR codes for additional quests and content. It's pretty cool that they are doing that. And there is a video tutorial on how to use the codes in the game.  The QR codes get you a few little trinkets, but nothing crazy good.  A few open up some quests later in the game.  You can scan them once, and then the quest will be an option later without having to re-scan the QR code.Also, don't expect much from the pre-release extras.  The art book is just a few pages, and isn't more than the first few pages of an instruction manual.  There are a few renderings, some character bios, and a little comic page.  It's about the same size as the case itself.  The CD has several of the non-orchestrated tracks.  (That is the tracks as recorded by the composer before they were orchestrated).Update:The game gets tougher.  Exploration in the skyship is really quite fun.  It's a similar setup to the dungeon exploration, yet it isn't.  It's nice to be able to secure food to sell in town.  Great way to make money.  Sometimes it's tricky to navigate the airship with the obstacles and the FOEs.  The subsequent 'worlds' get much cooler.The burst system is a great addition.  Especially the Escape Burst that takes you from battle and to the dungeon entrance.  Nice if you are getting whipped by a FOE.My only complaint is that you receive a crap ton of experience with each completed quest (update - it doesn't make a huge difference later on - it's the early quests that toss a ton of xp at you).  I know this makes life easier and makes for less grinding, but it really also kind of lets me down when I struggled to beat a bunch of enemies to gain a level, then I return from finishing a quest and get another level basically.  It's not quite that bad, but I think it is one of those things that the developer inserted because folks were complaining.  And that's on Normal, not Casual mode.Also, you can apparently start a *New Game after beating the game.  There is a locked out harder difficulty setting that I think you can play on a harder setting than Normal.It's just as fun as the older titles, but with more exploration thanks to the skyship and multiple labyrinths and caves instead of the one big dungeon as in the first two titles.  And for the record, those kangaroo things are annoying!  But launch carrots and they get all \"nom\".Oh, one other beef, I wish they would have had character drawings come up when you talk to people at the Peacock place.  Instead of just selecting a person (like Grizzled Explorer or Love Struck Adventurer).  Would have been fun to have that one extra little touch of interaction.Pros:+ Decent challenge+ Amazing soundtrack+ Fast battles+ Lots of options (including Casual setting)+ Great classes+ Great screen setup on main exploration screen and in battle+ Access to enemy info in battle (once you've beaten at least one of that type)+ Good map making interaction+ Overworld exploration and multiple dungeon types for varietyCons:- Just one save file (come on guys!)- Wanted more color palettes for PCs (just two)- Pretty short and lackluster art book for the pre-purchaseUpdate:You do get to have some grinding time after you kill Blood Bear and reach the 3rd level of the Lush Forest (name? The first multi floor dungeon).  So from level 12 - 18 or so you will be grinding.  I imagine that the grinding will come in spurts.  But at least you have the scavenging skills so that you can go into a dungeon, fight baddies, scavenge, and then return to town and sell the goods.Also, some QR quests don't open up until you can access the dungeons.  You really don't know which dungeon will access which QR quest unless the QR has a description on the site or e-mail you got it from.  Otherwise when you scan it, it says \"You are unable to access this quest at this point in the game\" or something to that effect.------------Update:Gets tougher, but mainly the bosses and some of the FOEs.  Just leveling up helps.  Subclass system interesting but doesn't really change game play too much.Almost done with the game and I must say I have enjoyed it immensely.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"C. Pohle","summary":"Amazing.....just give it a chance.","reviewText":"Initially I did not enjoy myself the first time I played this at all.  Mirror's Edge is really a strange bird....it's one of the few (maybe the only) games out there that gets better the more you play and become familiar with it.  Reason being is that it consists of mostly all trial and error game mechanics (which I'm not a fan of to any extent) to become familiar with the levels and eventually proficient enough to proceed the quickest and most efficient way possible, which is the name of the game.  When first playing and being completely unfamiliar with the environment, it can become infuriatingly frustrating trying to find the correct path.  This is not such an issue except when the chase sequences begin, where you need to haul *** and get out of dodge ASAP.  Then it's like being a chicken with your head cut off, running in every direction into walls, off rooftops, wondering where to go all the while being torn up by gunfire.  Admittedly not very fun.  Combine this with the fact that there's no margin for error at all when you ARE on the right path.  Throughout your first few playthroughs you will die a lot, and I mean A LOT.  Count on it.  I've died 15-20 times in a row trying to discover the correct path to success and how to navigate the best possible way.  Luckily the falling death animation is always fairly satisfying with a nice loud crunching sound effect, just like you'd expect to hear from someone hitting the pavement from 30 stories up.  A fairly accurate depiction of death by falling I'd imagine.While I'm at it, I mine as well get the negatives out of the way.  There are a few numerous points throughout that are simply poorly designed and/or executed.  One noteworthy part takes place while trying to escape from the mall, where it's required to swing from a bar onto a platform and jump to the other side.  Thing is, Faith needs to shimmy over to the center of the pole to be able to make the jump, which she seems intent on doing at .00000000001 mph.  Not to mention taking five seconds to start swinging.  All this takes a good 10-15 seconds, with the police filling Faith's behind with lead all the while.  She cannot take much punishment and dies very easily.  It's purely a matter of luck to make it, there's no skill involved whatsoever and I had to restart on easy to be able to get past it after dying for the 40th time.  There are similar parts like this (a train section), but it's by far the worst offender.With all that said, the payoff is well worth it when you've put the time and effort into learning the intricacies of movement and the architectural layouts.  When this game's off its game I've never been so pissed in my entire life.  It's one of the few games that has actually made me throw my controller into the wall.  However, when it's on its game, it's ON it.  There's nothing that provides such a rush as Mirror's Edge when everything is clicking.  When you know what you're doing and where to go, the chase sections are pure adrenaline and extraordinarily well done and it all of a sudden blossoms from being very frustrating to massive exhilaration.  The feeling of freedom, speed, and ability to take on almost any obstacle in continuous flow without losing momentum while hearing cops shouting behind you to freeze, gunfire, bullets pinging and glass shattering all around you is an exceptional experience when it all comes together so seamlessly.  This is helped by the incredible presentation, most notably the sound design.  Faith breaths and grunts with every exertion, her footsteps rapidly tap on the pavement in an ever increasing tempo as you gain speed for a huge leap, all accompanied by a stellar soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood of speed and pursuit.  It's tense and keeps you on your toes at all the right moments.  Faith wasn't the only one catching her breath at the end of a good chase, let me tell you.Now, I can completely understand why some people hate this game.  It really does not give off a first good impression at all, and if you're one that's really short on patience I'd advise skipping it.  Trial and error is inherent to its gameplay structure, which is unfortunate as it'll turn off a lot of people from this amazingly innovative title.  It really is a brilliant attempt at something new that is sadly marred by a few questionable design decision and poor execution.  For how much you can get it for nowadays though (I got mine for $12), it's worth a shot.

Lohrke","summary":"a review on the campaign, multiplayer, zombies and combat training","reviewText":"well, color me surprised.after having been disappointed by the last couple of CoD games, i was hesitant to purchase black ops 2.  a lot of the gripes and criticisms of black ops 1 and more particularly MW3, were wholly justified.  but, being the sucker that i am, i forked over $60 because i love me a FPS and i really enjoyed combat training in the first black ops (more on combat training in a minute).  after having spent nearly a week with the game, here's my verdict:campaign -  in short, it's a massive improvement over the last four CoD campaigns.  i don't think it's stretch to say it's the best CoD campaign since CoD4.  yes, it still looks dated (very dated, actually), but what it lacks in snappy graphics it makes up for in pure fun.  all the trailers leading up the game led me to believe the campaign took place in the future. well, only about half the game takes place in the future.  the other half takes place during the last days of the cold war.  all the protagonists from BO1 are back and they all still speak like testosterone-happy alpha males (the franchise really, really needs legit writers who can write dialogue).  however, the gunplay is what matters and that's where BO2 excels.  first of all, you can customize your load out before you start every mission.  it's a nice touch that allows you play your way.  not all guns, attachments, camos, etc are available right off the bat (you have to unlock them like you do in the multiplayer), but it's a nice change.  the campaign also gives you several choices in the game that will affect the outcome.  this is practically unheard of in FPS games, so kudos to treyarch for mixing it up and bringing something new.  each mission also has a series of ten challenges specific to that particular level.  some of the challenges are fairly easy, but some are very challenging.  and sometimes the only way to complete all the challenges is to replay the mission.  the only part of the campaign i don't care for is the strike force missions (but that's probably because i suck at real time strategy games).multiplayer - ah, the great love-it-or-loathe aspect to all call of duty games.  i haven't played any CoD multiplayer since MW2.  i got sick of the glitching, camping, obsession with killstreaks, etc.  BO2 isn't a drastic departure from the formula, but it's a least an improvement.  scorestreaks have replace killsteaks which encourages more team play.  smart move. the maps are much improved, in my opinion, from BO1.  in fact, there's not a map i don't care for.  the sound design is 1000 times better.  where in BO1 it sounded like you were shooting pop guns and peashooters (pew pew pew), the guns in BO2 are hefty, beefy and actually have some bass.  they sound great.  not BFBC2 great, but close enough.  i haven't experienced all the freezing on my ps3 that many others have noticed, but the lag is absolutely horrendous.  rubberbanding is non-stop, hit detection is often spotty, and with 650,000 people online at any given time, i'm not sure why it can take five or six minutes to get a game started.  but, despite it's flaws, it's the most fun i've had on a CoD multiplayer since CoD4.zombies - again, kudos to treyarch for not resting on their laurels and simply regurgitating past incarnations of this mode.  sure, it's still zombies, but in addition to the tradition survival mode, you now have the tranzit mode and griefing mode.  i haven't played too many zombie matches (i don't last long anyway when i do), but it's definitely fun and challenging.combat training - honestly, combat training, for me, was the best part of BO1.  sometimes i just want to kick back, practice, own the AI, play with a friend or two and not worry about having to listen to a bunch of hopped up pre-pubsecent, vulgar kids.  combat training was the main reason i bought BO2.  unfortunately, combat training as we knew it no longer exists.  you can still set up bots and play games, but there's not combat training progression.  i was really disappointed about that.  all the guns and unlocks are available right from the beginning, which isn't a bad thing, but part of the fun of multiplayer and combat training is the ever-present allure of unlocks.  on the positive side, all game modes are available in bot games (free for all, team deathmatch, kill confirmed, domination, headquarters, etc).  i really wish there were a combat training progression, but you can't win them all.all in BO2 is without a doubt the best all-around CoD game since CoD4, in my opinion.  there's plenty to admire and my hat's off to treyarch for making a concerted effort to try something new.  given CoD's popularity they certainly didn't have to do it, but that fact that they did earns my respect.  just hire some better writers next time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

When you know that by now, it's much easier to enjoy the sequel.  Crytek went for the money on this one, but despite what you may have heard, it's not all bad.Having ditched a console copy a third of the way through due to boredom and disappointment, the game really does play better on PC.  Early on from release, it's fair to say this was a bastardized port from consoles in many ways, but with the high res texture pack and DirectX 11 with tessellation update, the game does play really good.  We're not talking Battlefield 3 levels, as this is a big older tech than that, but with everything set to Ultra playing w/DX11 on my SLI rig, the game is very smooth.  The motion blur in particular adds a video style quality to the movement that does feels real.  However, no amount of DirectX can fix the linear level design.  I can see on one side, going from the wide open jungle to the claustrophobic city makes some sense, but there really isn't much to do other than follow the invisible walls here.  On the control front, speed is massively nerfed and if you have the means, for better or for worse, the game controls more intuitively with an Xbox 360 controller.  All that said, the pixelated and choppy frame-rate of the consoles is no match for a fire breathing PC rig if you have one and though the gameplay itself is small in scope, the epic settings seem more at home maxed out on PC.  When the action gets hot, the game does deliver with better choreographed artistry and explosions than anything I've seen with similarly structured Call of Duty games.The story loses steam and interest before too long, but the opening with Profit is really awesome.  In fairness, the story in Crysis 2, even as it thins out, is much better than the last go around.  A special mention must be given to the rousing and penetrating main theme music from the great Hans Zimmer.Just note:  If you want the DX11 and High Res update, you MUST be running 64-Bit WIndows.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

An uneasy peace settled over the land while, for years, the drums of war were silent. Yet the kingdoms of men grew complacent in their victory--and slowly, the defeated orcish clans regrouped under the banner of a new visionary leader.Now a darker shadow has fallen over the world, threatening to extinguish all life--all hope. The drums of war play upon the winds once again--rising urgently toward the inevitable hour when the skies will rain fire--and the world will tremble before the coming of the Burning Legion.WarCraft IIIreturns players to the war-torn world of Azeroth.

Blizzard proved through the years, with WarCraft II, StarCraft and other games, that they listened to feedback well, and could craft a great gaming experience. That's why, when WarCraft III kept getting delayed, I knew it would be well worth the wait.It definitely is! Blizzard had hoped to combine the fun of strategy gaming with the personality of RPGs. They did this very nicely, with stunning graphics and sound that really draw you into the action.First, the strategy. WarCraft III has all the traditional elements - mining for gold, chopping down trees, building houses and barracks and so on. You have to manage your resources wisely and construct your force to meet the mission at hand - whether it's a long trek across unknown terrain or the defense of a town.Next, there's the role-playing. We're not talking EverQuest level RPG, but more a 'personalization' of the troops. Instead of having just a mindless horde of 3 type As plus 8 type Bs going into battle, you have Jaina, the young spellcaster who is on a mission. Or you have Arthas, the paladin who hopes to keep back the tide of attackers. The Heroes have special abilities, can gain strength and powers as they go. It gives you extra incentive to hunt out those special extra missions, to build up your heroes so they are even more powerful in subsequent levels.Finally, there are the stunning graphics. Sure, graphics aren't everything. But when a game is fun to start with and then has gorgeous cut-scenes with dandelion fluff floating across rippling meadows, and birds with feathers that rustle in the wind, you really get drawn into the world. You start to care about the interaction of the various groups, and as they talk about their concerns and fight with their enemies, you begin to root for them.Even beyond that, the multiplayer and custom game capabilities make this a game you'll play for months after you exhaust every built in campagaign.Highly, highly recommended for any computer gaming fan!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2002"}

This title shows the dark side of war and adds a psychological bent to things. The Line is very story driven but also has very solid graphics and mechanics. I didn't encounter any kind of glitches and never had to reboot the game. The action buttons are also easy to use and the game play is fast and interesting. The single player campaign is pretty short, give or take a little under 10 hours, and the 15 chapters move very fast. The auto saves and checkpoints were mostly well spaced, though in the last few chapters there are some challenging parts where I would have liked a few more checkpoints. The weapon selection is pretty typical for the genre, but I like that you don't have to carry a handgun as your secondary weapon. You can pick up whatever you want, whenever you want. Music throughout the game is well implemented. I don't like this style of classic rock, but the titles and mood do fit well with the storyline. The gameplay is very linear, which is pretty typical for this genre, but I would have liked a little more opportunity to explore the surroundings. Collecting the intel items is fun, but doesn't really add anything unique to the story.Where I think the game falls a little short, and leads me to rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that while there are alternate endings, the alternate endings really only depend on the last couple of choices you make in the game. I think it would have been much more dynamic if they had the alternate endings dependent upon choices you make in the game from the beginning. But you make different choices early on in the game and this does not affect the game play (other than earning unique trophies for your choices). So it would have been cooler if your choices led you to play the role of a villain or a hero, but in the end you pretty much end up a villain, with some varying outcomes. I also would have like to seen some additional downloadable content for the campaign play - side missions, for example.FINAL GRADE: B+ (Recommended)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2013"}

Umbrella Chronicles is basically the old ones combined with the action-oriented slant of 4 with rail shooting on top of it. But with Resident Evil 5 at best a good year away, Umbrella Chronicles is meant to satiate your Evil thirst for awhile and while it's probably not as amazing as the main canon games, this is probably the funnest of the offshoots.Story: Basically a retelling of Resident Evil 0, the REmake and 3 which centers on Rebecca Chambers, Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Billy Coen and Carlos Oliviera dealing with the horrors of zombies and other mutated creatures as they make their way through a train, a mansion and an overrun Raccoon City. We also see the mission Chris and Jill go on to rid the world of Umbrella as well as a few bonus missions.Graphics: The graphics are an example of being \"serviceable\"; meaning they're kind of bland and not as sharply detailed as we'd want but they more than prove adequate at dealing with the enemies you'll face. The levels are recreated quite well and, although some things might be changed to make it more flowing (eg: you don't need keys to open doors anymore), the layout is quite spot-on and it was fun to see things where they should be.Sound/Music: The music at times was rather forgettable and either I tuned it out or I was busy trying to stay alive that it just floated in the background but the music's alright, it's just not hummable or anything. And the voice acting should feel familiar to people: namely its badness from its bad dialogue to its questionable voice choices (Rebecca's higher pitched voice or Wesker's overly dramatic tone like on \"TyyyyrraaaannnT!\").Gameplay: UC is basically an automated rails shooter where the nunchuk controls the direction your character is looking and the C changes your weaponry. On the Wii-mote, things are simple with B and A acting as your aiming and firing but at times I end up pressing the + button by accident but that's more controller design than anything. Pretty much the whole level can be shot up if a white crosshair shows up and it's either an enemy or in cases it's stuff to shoot so you can get a ranking (end of level rankings are based on time completed, stuff shot up, critical hits which are when you blow a zombie head off and how many files you found). They can also have things like ammo, grenades, the files or even reveal a new path.As for difficulty, it's kind of all over the place even on Easy since, while hard to actually die on Easy, certain things get annoying, namely getting that critical hit since the weak point can be so tiny that you'll either blow the head clean off or they'll just act like you shot them in the face and die anyway. Not to mention zombie heads can act bulletproof at times and full-on gunshots still have them lumbering towards you. The big thing is the boss fights who suffer from that tendency to take the bullets a little too well and some bosses seem to go on forever simply because their health doesn't drop fast enough.The surprising thing is how addicting it can be with the files taking up quite a bit of time since a certain level exists in each level (don't worry, any found gets carried over on retries so you don't have to find all of them again should you miss one), plus there's the rankings with the S class being the coveted spot and depending on your ranking, will net you stars which are used to upgrade your weapons for more firepower or greater ammo capacity. This is the kind of game you play with friends and have fun rather than the super serious stuff like the REmake where you shut off the lights and blast the sound.It's short and it's quite repetitive but replaying a level to get a better score is why this game should at least get a playthrough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"First one was my favorite of the series","reviewText":"I am just not a huge fan of this type of RPG.  I like the story elements, but the RPG side of these series of games has gone down the toilet.  It took me several months on ME II to get into the game enough to finish it.  For me, it was a huge step backwards.  They took out the exploration portion and placed your toon in a corridor and added some cut scenes and fights here and there to the story arc conclusion at the end.  The third in the series has taken this to the next step and reduced much of the content to move a little bit, shoot some baddies, etc. etc., end and debrief.  I just can't really get into it.  Why not just watch a movie instead?  I loved Skyrim and those types of games and I wish they would do a version in space that was more of a sandbox instead of the theme park trend that the ME series has gone down.The graphics and sound is good, I didn't mind the new talents and leveling process, but I just had a hard time getting through it.  In the first game I could play for hours, second one maybe a mission or two if they seemed good.  On this one I had a hard time completing one mission in a play session.  Its so scripted, nothing you do matters a whit.  The ending was a let down as well, though I really don't care as much about that in I wish the game itself had more depth to it.Too bad too, the series started off so well.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX9VO","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"GUNZERK!","reviewText":"The first Borderlands won me over with its great visual style and making me want to keep playing just to see how much stronger my weapons could get. It's one of the only games where I wanted to get the Platinum trophy, and I still plan on getting the Game of the Year edition just to finish all the extra missions, even now all these years later. I really liked the game, and when the sequel was announced, I was pretty excited. Borderlands 2 does so much right that it's hard to talk about the few gripes I have with it, because there's so much good here. A Game of the Year edition of the game was recently announced, and it'll be coming out very shortly. It's going to be a full-price game since it comes with everything AND the kitchen sink as far as DLC goes. If you're on the fence about the game still though, I highly recommend getting this regular edition since it's so cheap now. I don't play that many FPS games, and when I do, they tend to be more unique than the standard war games (not that I have anything against those). I can't say that Borderlands 2 changes the way we look at the FPS genre or anything, but good lord did I enjoy playing the heck out of this one.Borderlands 2 has a relatively good story. A dude named Handsome Jack has taken over Pandora and there's a resistance called the Crimson Raiders who want to stop him from going further with his plan. I'll leave it at that, since things are more deep here than they were in the first game, and I don't want to ruin any of the twists. Let's just say that if you played the first game, you'll see many familiar faces, and 4 of them are given real character this time around, making for a cast that is easy to get attached to. I did like the story for the most part, though most of the fun and time put into the game is in doing side missions. If you were to ignore them altogether, you can probably clear the game in 1/4 the time it would take to do everything in the first run. Where's the fun in that though? The world of Pandora has a lot to see and shoot, with bullets and loot chests everywhere. Bandits, Skags, Hyperion robots and more are just as plentiful. And as usual, there's an ungodly amount of guns to go through- it's insane! Two guns can look identical and have the exact same attributes in every category but one may have a slightly bigger magazine size, or have better stability. Elemental weapons are back too: explosive, fire, corrosive, electric and slag. Basically, if you loved the first game, there's nothing here you won't like!In the previous game, you had four different classes. This time around, you can have up to 6 if you buy two of the DLC classes, but you still have access to the main 4 from the get go. They all play -a little bit- like the previous classes, though one is essentially the same thing. Axton the Commando is pretty much Roland the Soldier. He has a rad turret that can be deployed as his action skill. Use this to act as a distraction for your enemies while you take cover and recover or snipe them off from a distance. Or just deploy it and shoot side-by-side! Zero the assassin would be Mordecai the Hunter, I suppose, with his skill tree having a section that buffs his sniper skills. He also has a unique ability that creates a hologram of himself to distract enemies while he turns invisible. As the time runs out for this mode, Zero will do more damage. Want a great critical hit? Hit 'em at the last possible moment. Maya is another Siren, like Lilith, with a new ability. She has a Phaselock, which lets her levitate an enemy into an orb for several seconds, making them a sitting duck. It doesn't sound that good on its own, but when you look at her skill tree and realize that this ability can draw in other foes, cause everything around it to burn or melt, and it can give Maya health if the enemy is killed while Phaselocked, it quickly becomes clear that this skill rules. And if the enemy is too strong, like a boss or something, they take raw damage instead of being trapped. Finally, there's Salvador the Gunzerker. Do I need to say anything more than that he can use two guns at once with his skill? ANY two guns??? A sniper rifle and a machine gun? Sure! A rocket launcher and a shotgun? Why not! Two rocket launchers?????? Oh yeah, he can do that too! Something great about the classes this time around is that none of them are truly more efficient with a certain weapon type like they were in the previous game. Yes, some of their skill tree abilities help out with certain weapon types, but x character isn't best with x gun.The game also has much better graphics, and the soundtrack is just as memorable too. My absolute favorite track comes from my favorite mission in the game, the Circle of Slaughter. Survive 5 rounds of an onslaught of Bandits while this killer track 'Bandit Slaughter' is playing. Seriously, go search for that track and listen to it. That sucker gets me pumped for Circle of Slaughter every time, and I never get sick of hearing it.There's so much more I could talk about with this game to try and convince you that it's worth playing. Hopefully the low price gets it a little more attention now. There are a few minor nitpicks I have though that keep it from being a 5 star title. First, it's the same issue I had with the last game, and it's backtracking. I got sooooooo tired of going between two areas over and over for certain missions, or having to walk back through an area because the car couldn't pass through an entryway or something. It seemed like the Fast Travel stations could have been placed better, or there could have been maybe two per map to cut down on this. Having them so far apart doesn't add challenge, it just gets annoying after a while. And maybe it's just me creeping up on 30 in 3 years, or I've dealt with this kind of humor too much in other media...it's the writing. A lot of the humor here will probably be enjoyed by a lot of gamers. I liked some of it too, just not when it's variants of the same thing repeated over and over. There were only a few times where I really laughed out loud. Notably, a robot who wants to  be human trying to think human things had some lines that were just plain comic gold. Aside from that, most of the threats from enemies are the kind of thing you'd hear from a middle schooler who just watched South Park for the first time. The only other thing I'll mention is that character animations could have been much better. When two maijor characters in the town of Sanctuary are going over something terrible that Handsome Jack did, they're having a heated conversation with great voice acting, yet they'll just wave one hand around while the other hand is on their hip, and the other character is standing there in a neutral stance. You couldn't put a little more effort into these animations? It's nothing major at all, just something that bugged me after a while.Tiny complaints aside, Borderlands 2 is a blast, and one of the more memorable titles I've played this generation. I'll definitely be getting the Game of the Year edition when it comes out. Until then, I'm going to work on a new character!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2013"}

I'm going to come out and say it, because a lot of people complain about it. This game is not an arcade baseball game! But a simulation baseball game. The pitching and hitting take time to get used to. But when you do master them, this game is very rewarding and fun. And not sure if I'm a little rusty but it does feel like there are less runs. I played a game with the Phillies last night and there was 2 home runs. the game just feels like you're there, and realistic to the point where youre not hitting homers and scoring left and right.The rod to the show also has minor updates. The catching mode is a  good addition, although can get a little  boring. But it is fun to call the pitches. And they added warm ups. So if you're a relief pitcher and you get called into the game, you can warm up and practice your pitches. Also in the beginning of games you can practice swinging the bat.I've also noticed some minor tweaks that I don't remember from the previous games. The crowds look better, the beach balls look more realistic. The home run celebrations are more life like. I love the foul tips, some are in the stands while others are in the dirt. If you're a fan of baseball and have a PS3, go buy this game. It takes time to master it, but when you do this game is so much fun. And if you're a die hard baseball fan and have money for a PS3, go buy one, you wont regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats.

Solid Snake is my hero, and i wish he were a real person so i could meet him and get a picture of him a cardboard box.  this is another reason why i like the game and the rest of the series, the humor.  while funny, most of it still has a point. sure, it's funny to see a guy sneaking around under a box, but it's also very stealthy and strategic.  as long as you don't move while the enemy is watching, you're good to go.  using the box is like an ongoing game of red light green light.  except in this game you can pop out and break the guy's neck.  also, knocking on walls is sometimes funny, but all the time useful.  knock on a wall to lure an enemy into a mine you secretly placed near a truck.  there are countless ways to enjoy dispatching your enemies, even without the use of weapons.  leading them around circles with your footprints in the snow is also humorous.but enough about the comedy, and onto the meat of the game.  the story. while not all convoluted (see also:  metal gear solid: sons of liberty.), the story still maintains a good conspiracy type theme involving the government and a rebel group of terrorists known as Foxhound.the members of Foxhound are some of the most memorable in videogame history.  the first, Revolver Ocelot, a gunsling, six-shooting Soviet that sadly loses a hand during an encounter earlier on in the game.  Vulcan Raven, a giant and shaman, he wields a gigantic gatling gun and resides in a warehouse freezer where he talks to his fellow ravens.  Sniper Wolf, a sleek and sexy, well, sniper, that has a reputation for always getting her target.  Psycho Mantis, a war guinea pig and avid gas mask wearer that also has psychic and telekenetic abilities.  the leader of them all is Liquid Snake, Solid Snake's \"brother\".  he's pretty much just an arrogant, powerhungry jerk hell bent on world domination/ a good end boss to really get the urge to kill.  other key players include:  the legendary Gray Fox/the ninja/one of the coolest freakin' creations in all of videogame history.  his optic camo and razor sharp katana (a gun later in the game) are just too cool.  He slices up enemies like they're butter and looks cool as hell doing so.  he is by far, next to solid snake, the coolest character ever imagined.  but they wouldn't be nearly as cool if it weren't for the story behind it all, which i'm not going to get into, you'll have to buy the game if you want to know more about it.  there is also a woman in the game named Meryl, who is an army brat and snake's love interest, kinda.there is also a VR training mission part to the game.  it is quite fun, especially if you have a very competitive relationship with a friend or family member that likes games.  you can easily lose hours tryin to shave off a tenth of a second off your opponents time.  my friend and i would spend entire days just playing the VR missions.  after we couldn't beat each other anymore, we called it a tie.  there is a \"technical wizard\" you can watch go through all the various stages to give you a better idea of how you can get the best possible time.  but if you are anywhere near as good as my friend and i got at the stages, this techinical wizard will look extremely slow and stupid.  man...those where the good old days.  and the greatest thing is, you don't unlock a damn thing for beating any of the missions, just more variants of the same, like doing them with weapons, stealth, cardboard box...oh well, it's still a great distraction.  and it's way better than the VR missions game that game out, but in that you get to be Gray Fox for a couple missions, which is amazing.  cloaking and slicing people to ribbons, sign me up!the cinematics in this game, even by today's standards, are some of the most well crafted to date.  enemies are all introduced in an impressive manner and even scenes of pure information and dialogue are fun to watch (at least the first time).  the voice acting is superb and the whole thing comes off as something of movie-quality work.  this game isn't a classic for no reason.  check it out and you'll understand why.  and if you can't stand the blocky graphics of the psone, get the re-vamped Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, for the gamecube.  it's the same tale, with some minor added and changed stuff, but nothing major.  either way, it's well worth you money, and so cheap for such a masterpiece.  no one should be without a copy of this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2004"}

So, utilizing an overly inconvenient security scheme only serves in penalizing the people who actually paid good money for their product - and manage to shoot their sales in the foot at the same time.It may seem unbelievable, yet it is True: \"STEAM-secured\" HL2 barely sold HALF the units that unprotected HL1 did! (Source: The Washington Post - link provided in comments).You would think some bright MBA (who could not tell the difference between a FPS game and an RPG) was sent home with no bonus? Guess again. Here come the Episodes!After underselling HL2, VALVE then tried to catch up with short Episodes sold as...expansions. Well, a couple of hours of gameplay and some polished surfaces an expansion do not make. So, when Episode1 sales missed their projections by far, the geniuses accountants jettisoned the BLACK BOX release (which were to contain just the NEW games) and came up with this...ORANGE BOX idea.This release contains, of course, Episode2 and - in order to sweeten the deal - the original HL2, Episode1 as well as a short maze game and a multiplayer platform (all based on the HL2 engine). I do remember Episode1 being so short that, even back then, I was sure it was only PART of the expansion under developement: these parts were eventually to be sold as separate...Episodes 1 & 2 (& maybe 3).Now, let's see how good a deal the ORANGE BOX actually is. This is what it contains: HL2 (an excellent 2004 game not really showing its age), Episode1 (a very short expansion), Episode2 (the rest of the expansion, also short), PORTAL (a 2-hour FP maze runner) and the multiplayer game TEAM FORTRESS 2.So, are the accountants actually doing us a favor when pricing all these games for 50$? Not unless this is your first experience with HL2.If you do NOT own either HL2 or Episode1, then, yes, this is a GOOD DEAL. If, however, you already own HL2 and Episode1, I would suggest waiting for the individually sold components. When was the last time we paid 50$ for another short expansion?Now, since I do have to connect to a server in order to play a multiplayer game, it makes no difference to me whether that be STEAM or any other server. Validate away my genuine copy to your hearts content!However, I REFUSE to ask permission every time I wish to play a Single Player or LAN game FOR A TITLE I HAVE ALREADY PAID AND BOUGHT!I REFUSE to ever again submit to the whims of STEAM - only to fall victim to busy, unstable and fickle servers!VALVE has to learn eventually that respect is a two-way street. The intrusiveness and inconvenience of STEAM created a huge debt with its original HL2 customers - and, since the market correction of the affect of STEAM failed to sink in, the ORANGE BOX will now inevitably pay that debt - with interest.Episode2 may be a fine expansion and TEAM FORTRESS the new CS. Nevertheless, they are still STEAMed up by accountants posing as game designers. They fooled my once...I am NOT going through that again!PS:WESTWOOD was once a mighty company riding the cutting edge of creativity (the COMMAND & CONQUER series was their innovative idea, starting with the classic DUNE that introduced the RTS genre). In 1997 they released an online RTS game named COMMAND & CONQUER: SOLE SURVIVOR. In 2003 (just 6 years later) WESTWOOD was bought by EA GAMES which (true to its mega-corporation mentality) pulled the plug on the existing servers. Whoever had bought SOLE SURVIVOR now had a piece of worthless reflective plastic.Now, what makes you think this cannot happen to VALVE?(and what will the value of all these STEAMed games be then?)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2007"}

It tries to do a few things differently but in the end it's lackluster. I have played all of the previous SOCOMs and had high expectation for this one, but unfortunately it didn't impress at all.Cons- The squad controls have been simplified (or dumbed down) which gets mixed reviews. I personally think it made things too simple. You can only order your squad mates to move to certain location or attack a specific target, that's it. You can no longer tell them to hold fire or cover specific areas, which significantly reduces the tactical aspect of a true SOCOM game.- Stealth aspect of missions are an interesting design choice. It would have been executed much better; example, there are times where you are detected by enemies without any reason and they all swarm on you and you are dead within 5 seconds. Realistic? Perhaps. Fun or entertaining? Absolutely not!- Weapon upgrade system is highly flawed. You have no control over what gets upgraded, and the selection is very limited which is disappointing.- Story and characters are not engaging. You don't really care much about the story or the characters at all since they are not interesting.- The camera view is somewhat odd and annoying; it switches between third-person and first-person at will without reason. I find this to be distracting and unnecessary.- Multiplayer is not all that fun due to limited weapons upgrades. COOP mode had potential but you don't earn XP at all and weapons upgrade is extremely slow. Another disappointment!Pros- Levels are generally well-modeled with good detail.- Controls are generally fine other than the camera issue mentioned previously.Overall, I can only give this a 2 out of 5 as it did not meet expectations on any front. Hopefully the next one will be better.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great cooperative-style gameplay for all","reviewText":"Puzzle games exercise your mind without splattering blood all over the screen. Pikmin is a great game that emphasizes cooperation over gore!The concept and plot are fun and child-suitable. A space explorer, Olimar, has crash-landed on a planet. He only has 30 days of &quot;air&quot; to fix his spaceship, and he's missing 30 parts. Luckily, he doesn't have to find them alone. He has up to 100 little flower-like Pikmin to help him out!They're cute and cuddly, and different pikmin have different skills. Some swim. Some are resistant to fire. Each one alone isn't very strong, so sometimes you need multiple of them to do something. The game becomes a logic puzzle - how do you get to a spaceship part if it's guarded by a series of obstacles? It's very rewarding when you figure each puzzle out.The time limit is both good and bad. On the good side, it keeps the game challenging and means that the overall game is relatively short to play. On the down side, if you have trouble with something (or if a younger child is playing) it can get very frustrating. So the game might be far too short for you (compared to something like Final Fantasy X that you play for months) or it might be impossible because of the time limit.Still, practice makes perfect, and most players will be sure to enjoy this one's puzzles as a fun challenge!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2002"}

{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"Mr. Kirk J. Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Only 2nd to S.T.A.L.K.E.R","reviewText":"Metro 2033 hits the consoles which never got a taste of the spectacular \"S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow Of Chernobyl\" title on the PC. This is a fitting tribute to the game in a release which can only be described as a \"lite\" alternative to that game.You play the character of twenty-something Artyol in a post-apocalyptic world of the metro. Humans live underground in a world dominated by fierce creatures from the unknown. A whole society is brewing with life in what is left of the underground train network. The lifestyle down there is grim, but we are surviving as a race. Young children are brought up in a society where people have never seen the sky. Some inhabitants sell weapons with currency of old ammo shells. Few are brought up to work or gain finance and our race is struggling to expand.The background to what's going on happens quickly and gives the player a great feeling that we need to fight back and regain our planet. There are struggles between moving from one station to the other and those that dare move out risk being slaughtered by the strange mutants that roam the dark tunnels. You are given a clear indication of what must be done and the storyline is always very prominent and an important part of the game.The shooting mechanics are not as smooth as you'd expect from a Call of Duty game. It is clunky and rarely reaches satisfying levels. This is perhaps the way it's intended. Tense atmosphere is created with limited ammo, and the player knows he has to work to gain resources, and plan how to react to the increasing difficulty level. The interface is perfect, there is no real \"pause\" menu, your objectives and direction can not be consulted by a map which freezes the game. This must be done by getting out your clipboard, leaving yourself wide open for attacks. The game always makes you feel like you're on edge.Creature combat may not be very satisfying but combat also reaches out to human vs human as well. You will be infiltrating enemy camps of neo-nazis and other selfish and rebellious factions, who can and will refuse to conform to form a union. There are a few \"side quests\" as well which are rewarded with achievement points.There are a good ten hours in this game, that's maybe too short but I never lost interest for a minute.This is not a particularly lonely game like other games of this type, in fact for a lot of it you will be siding with colleagues to push out and explore what's happened to the world in pursuit of an answer. These people are great to have around and in general are not as annoying as the usual American side-kicks in many FPS's. Unfortunately the ideas behind what happened to the earth are never fully explored and that did take away from the game a little. There is enough here though to keep you occupied and anxious to see the next part.One criticism is that stealth should play an important part of the game, but it never feels safe or something you should do. A lot of trial and error is required, which becomes frustrating since some enemies have the annoying tendency to know where you are well in advance. There was also a part in the game where one of the guards became invincible, I learned this was because the crescendo event didn't trigger. This was a minor inconvenience though.Also the friendly AI becomes incredibly irritating in some levels. They tend to run head first into a battle they should know they'll lose. Near the end of the game you are getting rushed by dozens of creatures in the open air, the friendly AI is screaming for you to run, and you do - yet the player is punished for not keeping up with the AI has no sense of urgency and walks it.For anyone who enjoyed S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Metro 2033 is definitely for you if you can accept its linearity. The graphics on the 360 are mind-blowing so will be even more incredible on a good PC. Not only are the graphics technically impressive, the dimly lit caverns and eerie flashlight flickers suit it perfectly.Overall I have to give this game 8.5/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"ceLeon","summary":"It can be so much more, for now it's a mix of ups and downs","reviewText":"his is such a difficult product to review because it includes so many things in one single (and huge) box but I'll try to do my best and I'll also include some comparisons with the PS4 which I also own and have reviewed. I tried to be as objective as I possible while provided a brief comparison to the PS4. A lot of people on both sides (X1 and PS4 are just downvoting the other console because they don't like it when the other one succeeds. Take the reviews as you please but don't believe every one star review you see here.Hardware: The best comparison (and the most popular) is that the Xbox One basically looks like a futuristic VCR, just as big, not pretty by any means with just the logo and the loading slot in the front. Half glossy and half vents to prevent the box from getting too warm (like the previous gen). One USB port on the side and the rest at the back: HDMI (x2) In and Out. 2 USB, digital audio, network and one for the Kinect, which is surprisingly massive and bulky and will definitely be noticed on top or below your TV. For all of you who are wondering if the big power brick is back, yes, it's back but thankfully it's a thing that tends to stay at the back of your furniture unless you are used to moving it from TV to TV or to a friend's place. X1 vs PS4: PS4's console is definitely better-looking, smaller and if we even get into the technical specs has a slighter edge over the X1Controller: I'll review the controller separately but in summary. It's a mostly-better version of the Xbox 360 one. The layout is basically the same with the buttons and sticks in the same place. It's slightly heavier and the analog sticks include a grippy texture in the rim that will definitely help your gameplay if you have sweaty hands that slip off them. The bumper buttons are a little harder to press this time, which I don't particularly like and the rumble feature in the triggers feel really weird/funny but once you get used to them and developers focus on them I'm sure it'll enhance the experience while playing. X1 vs PS4: X1 wins, especially with a way better battery lifeSoftware: I'm not a Windows 8 user so I can't say I'm familiar with the interface at all and it's not as intuitive as the PS4 one (which works fine for now but I'm not sure when I have more apps and games in there). As expected, you have your gamerscore, the last couple of apps you've used, and links to other things like friends or other apps. The other screens are the usual sections for movies, games, etc. And there's another screen when you can pin up the apps that you use the most. The multitasking is miles better than the bad implementation of the 360. You can move between a game and the dashboard super quickly, do some other thing and come back with the tap of a button in contrast with the slow and painful process you had to go through on the 360 to message a friend or something like that.Snap is a feature I don't see myself using a lot right now, but it's there and I can see how some people might make a lot out of it. You can basically \"attach\" another app to the side of the screen, be it a browser or live TV in case you want to keep track of a NFL game while you play a NFL game :)In case you don't know, it CAN'T play Xbox 360 games. It's a different architecture so you might want to hold on to your old console if you still play some of the games. what you can do is login with the same account and carry over all your friends and gamerscore.You can record gameplay just as with the PS4, only that the Xbox provides a more robust editing feature but unfortunately, live streaming will not be supported at launch.X1 vs PS4: I'll say it's a tie for now, which might be able to change in favor of Microsoft if they improve the experience.Kinect: After the considerably longer set up than I expected I was able to use some of the commands with the Kinect, which is now included with every console (and explains the $100 price difference between the PS4). It's trying to replace the use of the controller to navigate through the system so you can say things like: \"Xbox, on\" or \"Xbox, play Dead Rising 3\" and it should know how to do it (It's \"Xbox, turn off\" NOT \"Xbox off\"... silly Xbox). When it works it's fantastic but in my short experience with it, it doesn't work until a few attempts which ruins the experience and misses the purpose of it. Maybe it'll get better with time, I hope it does. I still feel weird talking to a camera but maybe that's the future.One of my favorite things it does is when you walk into a room, the Xbox will recognize your face and log you in automatically, you don't have to do anything. And the same thing happens if someone else walks into the room. It's a cool feature but overall I don't think they succeeded with it as they advertise it. Forget using it with motion, it works worse than voice commands. I can see the potential. It's there, I just hope they make the most out of it. Thankfully, it's not required to be plugged in to use the Xbox so I'm sure a lot of people will lose interest and just do that.X1 vs PS4: I don't have the PS4 camera but from what I've read everywhere it doesn't come close to what the kinect can do so if you're into this you'll appreciate the X1 a lot more.TV Integration: For the record, I have DirecTV with a DVR which I use most of the time instead of watching live TV.This is one of the features that made me NOT cancel my preorder since I was really excited from what I had seen in the demos and thought I might be using it a lot. WRONG! If you use your cable subscription to watch mostly recorded stuff like me, this is not for you. You can't say something like `Play episode X of show X' which was recorded 1 hour ago. It only works for live TV right now.What's happening is that the X1 is not just taking control of your TV signal, it's just showing whatever your cable box is sending through HDMI so any menus you get there, you'll get BELOW the xbox menus making a very clunky interface that doesn't look pretty. When you change the channel through the Kinect (as I understand), the xbox is sending an IR signal everywhere in your room in hope that it bounces and makes it back to your cable receiver so it works even if they're side by side. Maybe in the future some cable providers will get into it and give better integration but for now It's a no-go for me, at least until surround sound is here.At least it has Netflix, Hulu, Amazon plus some sports channels too.Since I don't have a PC I can't test the media streaming feature it comes with but maybe I'll try to get one to test it and I'll update the review.Games: Microsoft is saying that the X1's launch lineup is the \"best ever\" or something like that. I'd say that if we take all the cross-platform games for both consoles you're left with very few options that in no way represent what we should expect from this generation. I can't wait to what developers can make out of these boxes and wow us all.As with the PS4, you need to install the games before playing them (at least part of it) and man is that slow. Why can't I just insert a disc and start playing like before? I'm sure it can't copy things in the background without having me to wait!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"space_hamster\"","summary":"Enough user-created content to make it a worthwhile purchase","reviewText":"It would be fairer to compare this story to the original Baldur's Gate, instead of the sequel Baldur's Gate 2. The storyline to NWN is not as strong as Baldur's Gate, as your own character is another \"nameless adventurer\", and therefore has very little personal stake in the story's events. It's best to think of the single-player campaign as a showcase for the Bioware developers, to show what the game-engine is capable of doing.The graphics engine is much more advanced than the Infinity Engine used in Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. Everything is portrayed in a 3D-environment. This is especially evident in the flame effects from objects as mundane as torches, to the flames emanating from an approaching demon. Spell effects are spectacular - the best being area effect spells. Even spells as mundane as \"Hold Undead\" display a mighty impressive light show.The interface is also much less cluttered than the older Bioware games. Some of the commands come from a radial interface, which can be activated by right-clicking the mouse. The rest (eg. Journal, Inventory, Spellbook) come from a small menu on the right-hand side of the screen. The other 90% of the screen is clear, which makes it possible to watch the rest of the action without being distracted.It is possible to switch between different camera view modes from within the game menu. You can also zoom in and out using the mousewheel (if your mouse has one). This feature is particularly useful when fighting foes, and you want to examine the battle up close.One of the most glaring differences between NWN and Baldur's Gate, is the lack of multiple characters in your party. In Baldur's Gate 2, there was space for up to five extra characters. This made for some interesting moments, especially if some of your characters had different alignments. I think the reason for this may have been the difficulty of implementing this \"multiple-character\" feature in the Aurora toolset, and making it user-friendly enough for the casual mod-creator. Hopefully, NWN will implement this feature in a sequel to NWN.I would strongly recommend this game to newcomers to the RPG genre of PC gaming. NWN's interpretation of the 3rd Edition rules is incredibly easy to master, as so many of the mechanics (eg saving throws, attacks of opportunity) are calculated behind the scenes without any intervention from the player. A new player can quite literally hack and slash their way through this game ala' Diablo, if they chose to. However, for experienced players of D&D; there is enough depth in the single-player game to keep them amused for a few hours.However, Neverwinter Night's greatest strength has only become self-evident over the few years since it's release - and this it's customisable tools. The Aurora toolset gives users the power to create their own adventures and distribute them to other players on the internet. I strongly recommmend Penultima series (created by Stefan \"Twoflower\" Gagne's) as a terrific jump-off point. Penultima can best be thought of as a send-up of the RPG games that Bioware are famous for. Every single convention of RPG-gaming is skewered mercilessly. It's very much inspired by the Discworld-series of Terry Pratchett novels, and is well worth the download. And Penultima is only the tip of the iceberg. There are countless other examples on the internet, of adventures that have been created by devoted fans of NWN. In some cases, like Penultima, the originality and flair of the storylines outshine the original campaign created by Bioware.Please note, that a tutorial and detailed documentation on the Aurora toolset, is available for free download on the Bioware website. There is no need to purchase the strategy guide. In addition, the NWN internet community has posted many articles and tutorials on the Aurora toolset.When NWN was first released, many players were complaining of the \"lack of content\" in the game. They felt that there wasn't enough depth to the single-player campaign to warrant its purchase. It's now obvious that Bioware were taking a huge gamble, hoping that whatever \"depth\" was lacking in the campaign, would be more than compensated for by the huge numbers of fan-created modules that would follow. In the end, it paid off, as any visit to Bioware's NWN website would so effectively attest to. NWN has a thriving internet community, and in the end, it is this that makes the game such a worthwhile purchase.One final note, for those with older PC's. The game is best viewed and played on a relatively fast PC. This game was reviewed on an AMD Athlon 2000+ XP with 512MB RAM and GEForce 4 videocard. Sound effects (and there are plenty) are best experienced on a 3D-effects capable soundcard, such as a Soundblaster Live!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2003"}

Essentially it was so bad, that you just return it through Amazon....&#9830; My Friends have all gone through Turtle Beach headsets, and they have all broken at around the 4-6month mark when the manufacturer's warranty states it should last for at least 1 year.&#9830; After around 3-4 months it will become stretched, worn, and not \"of quality\"Good things:&#9829; CheapSide Note: I've had my original PC headset which is some $15 headset that I've used, and friends have used for the past 5 years....and it still looks and works like it's brand new. Turtle Beaches...last as long as an Xbox 360 controller...&#9760; Warning &#9760;: If you plan to use this headset constantly like me (hardcore gamer ~5-10hours a day) it will fall apart within 6 months from my experiences....&#9829; Help &#9829;: Through amazon customer service you should be able to get a free pre-paid return label + a full refund when it's shipped (not when they receive it). I was given $50 for my last headset as a return, and purchased a brand new one for $35 with free 2 day shipping = New headset + $15. (Use this advice, or....buy a new one when yours breaks)Update: My latest Turtle Beach X31 has broken by.....\"interior headband is beginning to \"break apart\" or come lose, essentially the interior side of the headband snapped? Not entirely sure if it snapped or is just coming apart, but basically it's causing the headset to not fit firmly on my head around my ears, and instead bends outward a bit.  Cause of Problem: Poor Quality Materials? This one I only had for a month....having a replacement sent out.Positive note: I've discovered that you can keep getting refunds/replacements on this item forever through Amazon as long as there's a manufacturer's warranty...it's odd...but because you are able to get a refund, and then re-order the item, the 1 year warranty is \"renewed\" through Amazon, so for anyone out there wanting a new set...be sure you go through Amazon before the 1 year Warranty expires. For me...this basically means a lifetime warranty until they fix this product..they keep adding features, and lowering the quality...and their customer service is horrible...(much like Razer)Update:The plastic piece on the slide out piece somehow cracked or snapped off...most likely when I was putting it on... They are all cheap plastic junk.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

UPDATED","reviewText":"I liked the game to start, but I am only a few hours into it and find the combat broken.An example: Guy grabs me and I have to hit \"y\" button to be released. I hit \"y\" button 15 times but I am never released. I die and have to travel back to fight. Same thing happens three or four times. After traveling back AGAIN, I start hitting \"y\" button BEFORE the prompt comes up and it works (yes, you have to hit the button BEFORE the prompt or it won't work).OK. I have it figured out right? Well, next time I am grabbed, I start hitting the \"y\" button but THIS time a prompt for \"x\" button comes up and I lose right away (because I am hitting \"y\"). And I die. And I am supposed to travel back to the fight... AGAIN.I don't think so. Now the game has transitioned from entertainment into \"boring work\" and I have enough of that in my life.UPDATE:I started playing this game Friday night. Hated it and put it down with the intention of never playing it again. I wrote my original review and gave the game a 1-star rating. However, I had nothing else to do that weekend and ended up picking the game up again. I actually finished it. I still think the combat is bad, but you can upgrade your health very easily early on, especially if you do the side missions. This, plus buying health upgrades from food stores (which is actually a pain in the butt since the upgrades slowly disappear over time and also disappear if you die or reload and there are 2 kinds, only 1 of which appears on the map) means combat is manageable. However, it still isn't particularly fun.Now, I would rate the game a 6 out of 10. Still not great, but not bad. It is NOT as much fun as the GTA games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"Finally, Play Multiplayer Your Way !!","reviewText":"It seems like there will be those that complain about the multiplayer aspect because of all the changes and those who welcome them. I am probably one of those who welcome some of the changes to the multiplayer aspect and so far am really enjoying them but before I get into it, here is where I stand on some of the other aspects.Controls - in my POV, if you have played one, you have played them all. CoD thankfully has not had much under the hood done and whatever minor or major tweaks you want to do with the controls is easily done.Graphics - Again, when you get a CoD game you get a AAA title that looks great on the screen, small noticeable differences in shading are well noted in this game as well.Multiplayer maps - maybe it's just me but it seems like there were more maps in BLOPS I but the ones they give here seem to be a bit more tight and give way to more run n' gun type play, very frantic movement with little chance to slow down.So, what's my take on MP?  First off, I think this is the 1st CoD game that really takes the time to walk in newbies, amateurs and veterans without the pressure of feeling like you are being dropped right into shark infested waters.  I am one of the very few who can admit to not being that guy who eats sleeps and breathes Call of Duty.  I am not the guy that studies each of the game maps religiously nor am I the one who sole aim is to rack up all the kills on screen.  While I do enjoy playing this game, I have found it frustrating that the multiplayer side can be so lopsided.  You are a level 5 soldier being dropped in a map with everyone's skill levels all over the place and it seems more like you are just playing to survive.  I have hated the fact for years of playing this game having to hear someone's 9 or 10 year old child at 2am on CoD using words that would make a sailor blush sometimes ruining a good online moment. I am one of those people now who play online without using my mike because most of the time I really am not up to playing with strangers who don't know how to act and because me and most of my friends are married, have kids etc, it's difficult for us to get together and play together. yes, there is life beyond video games!!So, yes, I welcome the idea of at least the 1st 10 levels being completed with everyone close to the same levels. I think it's a great idea and wonder why this hasn't been done sooner.  I even like the idea of now being able to set up private modes with yourself and AI bots to practice on with everything at your disposal for times when you don't want ( or can't)  play for hours upon hours feeling that need to level up, not to mention when all of your other friends are busy, those who are on and able to play, you can squeeze them right in and still have a full map with all the game has to offer. Treyarch has taken that dangling carrot off of the stick and has finally made a CoD that is accessible to anyone who wants to play it the way they want to play it. If you want to play online, great, if not that's great too and you still have access to all the modes needed to get a lot of variety out of the game.  There are also some \"Party\" games that friends can play together. Some of you reading this will probably think that it's crazy to get this game and not play multiplayer but I am also willing to bet that a lot of people who haven't wanted to play this series for years have had that same frustration and can now find a reason to play without the push of having to play with others.There are going to be many detractors out there that are probably saying that playing with bots are lame but the AI is pretty sharp in most levels and you can set the intensity before you start.So in summary, if you ever been intimidated or just didn't want the frustration of trying to keep up, this Call of Duty is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000084313","reviewerName":"Scott Cohen","summary":"Ruby/Sapphire, best games in the series","reviewText":"Features* More than 350 Pokemon to collect, battle and trade* A quest that spans over 35 hours.* Cartridge save (one slot)* Connectivity with future Gamecube games* Link cable support for four player (multiple cartridge)* e-Reader compatibility* Only for Game Boy AdvanceIntroductionIn 1995, Nintendo had released the first two Pokemon games Pok&eacute;mon Red and Pok&eacute;mon Green.The series was extremely popular in Japan, and was released stateside in 1998, with the release ofPok&eacute;mon Red and Pok&eacute;mon Blue. The series started off slowly, and the popularity boomed in the beginning of 1999, starting with Pok&eacute;mon trading cards, clothing, a Saturday morning television show, and more. With the large userbase of Pok&eacute;mon, Nintendo released a special edition of the game, also known asPok&eacute;mon Yellow Version: Special Pikachu Edition which tried to emulate the television show, where Ash (the main character) would start off choosing a Pikachu, instead of a Charmander/Squirtle/Bulbasaur. It was extremely popular. It was the best selling game of 1999, selling over 1.1 million units in it's first week of release. Then, in 2000, Nintendo and Game Freaks released a brand new game called Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver.This game boasted a whole new adventure, starring over 250 Pok&eacute;mon, a time system, and a new character. The game was extremely popular among the younger children, and even amongst the older teenagers who played the Red/Blue/Yellow versions. Then, in the summer of 2001, Nintendo and Game Freaks released a special version of Pok&eacute;mon Gold and SilvercalledPok&eacute;mon Crystal version.The game wasn't as popular as the Gold and Silver versions. Yet, it still sold well. In 2002, Nintendo and Game Freaks released Pok&eacute;mon Stadium 2, the sequel to Pok&eacute;mon Stadium released in March 2001. Now, 5 years later from the release of Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue , Nintendo released brand new adventures, Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Pok&eacute;mon Sapphire. Now, I will review the Ruby version of the game, which is the version I own.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------GameplayIf you have played the original Pok&eacute;mon games, the gameplay will be basically the same. You walk around with the D-Pad, do actions with the A button, cancel Actions with the B button, pause the game with Start, register an item to Select. L and R have no use, unless you want L to be A and R to be B. The battle system has been greatly improved. Now, you may do a 2-on-2 battle! This means when you fight two people, or 4-way battle with link cables, you use the first two Pok&eacute;mon in your party are used in battle. It's very cool indeed. Don't forget, this game features 386 Pok&eacute;mon, so you'll have plenty of time playing this game. There are 8 badges to collect, like all of the other games.GraphicsIf you have seen any screenshots of this games, you will have definetly have noticed the upgrade of graphics. There is now shadowing, footstep marks, water movements and reflections, etc. The battle graphics are very good, they have the usual movements of when the Pok&eacute;mon attack, etc. The graphics are fair, but it's not the best seen on Gameboy Advance. It's not the best graphics seen on GBA, but near it.SoundThere isn't many different sound effects from the original Pok&eacute;mon games, but the music of the cities is great. Every Pok&eacute;mon has it's own cry, which is over 386 different sound effects just for the Pok&eacute;mon. This is about the same kind of sounds you would hear on the Super Nintendo.Lasting AppealThis game will last you at least 35 hours, and if you take the time to train a perfect Pok&eacute;mon party, battle with all your friends, and collect all 386 monsters, you will easily clock hundreds of hours on this great game. Battling and trading definetly give this game a lot of lasting appeal.Gameplay: 10.0Graphics: 9.0Sound: 9.0Presentation: 9.5Lasting Appeal: 10.0Average: 9.5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2003"}

It adds enough new units, upgrades, and heroes to make the game seem new once more. Furthermore, a new campaign is added that continues the story where Reign of Chaos left off.The expansion adds a new hero to each side- the Shadow Hunter for the Orcs, Blood Mage for the Humans, Crypt Lord for the Undead, and Warden for the Night Elves. The Shadow Hunter is probably the most notable addition here, since previously Orcs had no good way to heal their units early in the game. The Warden is also a good Night Elf pick if you want to try assassinating someone else's hero. Additionally, you can hire mercenary heroes at a Tavern. These are just as good as the ones you get normally, save that they don't take any time to train. They include the Naga Sea Witch, Pandaren Brewmaster, Beastmaster, Dark Ranger, and Pit Lord.New units and upgrades are also added for each side. Some of the old units, including the Ballista and Catapult, have been changed and renamed. The Orc units are the Batrider (anti-air flyer) and Spirit Walker (Tauren support caster). Upgrades include the Troll Berserker- a throwback to Warcraft 2 and Reinforced Defenses, which makes defensive buildings tougher. The Humans get the Spell Breaker (a caster-killer) and Dragonhawk Rider (another anti-air unit) as well the Arcane Tower- which could save you from a one-hero rush. Upgrades include Barrage and Flak Cannons, which make Siege Tanks and Flying Machines into very serious anti-air units.The Undead receive the Obsidian Statue, which can either heal nearby enemies or restore their mana. It can also be turned into the Destroyer, a deadly magic-immune air unit. The Nerubian Tower is also added, which does less damage than Spirit Towers but slows enemies. Upgrades include Exhume Corpses, which lets Meat Wagons generate corpses on their own. The Night Elves gain the Mountain Giant, now the most powerful melee unit, and the Faerie Dragon, an anti-caster air unit. Upgrades include Mark of the Claw, which allows Druids in bear form to cast Roar.In addition to these units, every side can now build a shop that sells items geared toward that side's strategy. For example, the Undead shop sells an item that can make a patch of blight anywhere it's deployed, which allows them to build defenses outside their home base. There's also a host of new creeps to find and fight, some of which are incredibly powerful.The new units and upgrades do change the way the game is played. For one, it's now quite risky to make an all-caster army, since there's no less than three new units that are completely immune to magic. Needless to say, the new hero choices and the presence of Taverns also results in new potential strategies. Despite the changes, however, it's generally true that what worked in Reign of Chaos still works in Frozen Throne- you just might need to make some alterations to your army makeup.The single play campaign is great. It includes two new cinematics (as is the norm for Blizzard productions, quite eye-popping) and introduces quite a few new characters as well as some old. The story focuses on rivals Illidan and Arthas, but supporting cast is also involved, including a rather interesting bit from Sylvanus Windrunner. There's even a new semi-playable side added- the Naga. I wish there were a way to play them in custom games or multiplayer, even though they aren't fully fleshed-out as a race. In all there's a Night Elf, Alliance (humans and blood elves), and Undead campaign. The Orcs don't figure heavily into this part of the plot, but there's a bonus Orc campaign that continues the story where it left off and includes guest appearances by Thrall, Jaina, and Cairne (download it by connecting to Battle.net). One of the best things about playing these campaigns is you get quite familiar with some of the new available heroes, which will help when it comes time to make your choices in multiplay. In some missions you'll also see something notably missing from the game- naval units. These can be built by way of a goblin shipyard, though as yet they aren't available in custom games or multiplay. There's also a lot of new magic items to be seen, some of which are downright godly.For mapmakers, there are also new doodads and tilesets for the editor, including sunken ruins and Dalaran ruins. Some of the new placeable objects are quite impressive. The editor has also been revamped, allowing more control over characters and spells. If you know what you're doing, it can now change pretty much every aspect of the game.Frozen Throne is about as good as an expansion can get, and is especially excellent for an RTS expansion. If you like Warcraft III, you shouldn't hesitate to get it. The bonus campaign in particular shows that Warcraft really can be a combination RTS/RPG, and I don't doubt that there will soon be many player-generated scenarios like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2003"}

And of course, there are some new types of necromorphs and weapons thrown into the mix.The environment sounds and music are also used to better effect in this installment, sometimes unnerving, and they will make you jump.Issac is easier to control overall - this may be in part due to experience with the first game, but they also must have made some tweaks. Controlling Issac during anti-gravity scenarios is handled differently than the first game, but I think it's an improvement.The \"Deck Navigation\" system that was so cool in the first game isn't mentioned in the \"DS2\" booklet but thankfully it's still here, with improved functionality, and you learn about it during the first chapter of the game (the rotating/zoomable \"map\" is gone, but the new system is much more convenient).The only obeservations I have are:\"DS2\" oftentimes requires that you kill an enemy AND melee stomp the corpse to get their \"goodies\" (ammo, credits). In the original game, you just had to kill the enemy to get access to their stuff.This doesn't bother me, but some people also don't like the fact that Issac is now a talking character in \"DS2\" (in \"DS1\" he didn't say a word).Some people will also miss the \"map\" feature (again, \"Deck Navigation\" is still there).The first \"Dead Space\" seemed to have more to do with \"space\" - a large part of this game has more to do with horror/dementia/survival than \"space\" per se, but again, this is just an observation, not really a complaint.If you have been sitting on the fence and haven't bought a \"Dead Space\" game, then \"DS2\" would be the one to get, because it's such an improvement over the original and they designed the first couple chapters so that you don't really have to play the first one in order to get a handle on the storyline. Be forewarned, though - this game is chock full of disturbing images and sounds -more gore than the first, if you can believe that (this is not a game for kids).If you played the original Dead Space and liked it, then you should get this game - it's definately more absorbing, scarier and fun than the first, a game you'll want to play again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

A. Theisen","summary":"This attempt to please everyone might entertain, but can't truly satisfy many","reviewText":"Let's be honest about this up front. The Need for Speed series has been, well, pretty much dead the past 3 years. The happy-go-lucky 100% non-story-based tuner car customizing wacky police chasing magic was gone, and NFS: Undercover in 2008 did very little to revive that feeling. The series was in the midst of an identity crisis. There are only two places to go from a spot like that, as you can either go back to the tried-and-true formula, or work toward finding a new niche in the market. EA has opted for the later, aiming for a game toward the level of a simulator that completely takes street racing and horribly AI-clueless police out of the picture and puts you on real-world tracks. A bold move, to say the least. The only catch is giving the game as much mass appeal as possible.There has always been two distinct camps in the GT/racing gaming market: sim versus arcade. The likes of Gran Tourismo, Forza and rForce versus Midnight Club, Burnout and the oldschool Need for Speed. Some companies (namely Codemasters) have tried to bridge that gap with titled like `Drit' and `Grid' by starting on one end and leaning in toward the center. The Japanese market has a few different solutions including touge racing and its (very real) underground racing world, which combine the heavy tuner aspect of arcade versus needing to know the mechanical ins and outs of a car to get true performance from it.  To date, no one has truly been able to split the gap between simulation and arcade feel. Need for Speed: Shift is no different. It's the biggest effort yet to make a solid compromise both ends of the spectrum, but in the process it fails to entirely please fans of either style.The game scenario is exceedingly simple, as it should be. Its lack of involvement in what you need to do is a refreshing change. You start out with nothing but a little cash, start with one car, and race your way to the top. Nice and easy and lets you pick which events you'd like to participate in at your own pace in whatever cars you happen to like. Your early races are on variations of famous tracks, but you'll soon be racing on some of the world's more popular Gran Prix tracks. All the real-world tracks are very faithful recreations of the originals, which is kind nod to the simulator crowd. Some absolute classic circuits are included, including Silverstone, Spa and Road America. If you have no idea what any of those are, you're probably already at a disadvantage toward understanding this game.Car selection is impressive, if not a bit small. About 60 cars in total, options range from daily-driver basic sporty coupes such at the Scion tC and Honda Civic Si until you reach the top which is occupied by the world's most absurd hypercars, and everything in the middle. At the top end, you'll be zooming about in the infamous Bugatti Veyron, Zondas, Lamborghinis and the like. An exciting thought to throw down on some great tracks, to say the least. Each car (besides the end-game hypercars) is upgradable in a normal game style, allowing you to improve different aspects of the vehicle. Tuning options are ridiculously vast and include a massive range of settings, including variations to parts that 90% of players will never have heard of. How many people know what adjusting the position of a bump stop does? Again, a nod to the simulator crowd. There is a `quick tune' option instead of digging into every detail, but the effects on the car are rather vague compared to digging into the details yourself. At no point, however, does victory completely hinge on being able to dial in a car to its limits. This can be seen as either a good or bad thing. Some of the vehicles, on top of their normal string of upgrades, have a special tuning option, which is the \"Works package\" conversion. The idea being to turn what was left of your street car and turn it into a track-carving beast, it completely eliminates whatever civility left in the drive in the name of speed. Kind of. It can certainly be fun to see something like a Nissan GT-R turn into a car that you'd see in the Japan Super GT series. Key here being that only some cars can be upgraded this way, and most of the luxury/exotic models must be left alone with just a body kit at most.So far so good, right? Lots of bits to please the simulator fans and drag them in. What about the arcade-racer end of the line? Plenty of good additions here, as well. The sensitivity of all the controls and inputs are adjustable and levels of CPU assisted driving variable so that you can turn some cars into a flail-the-wheel-all-the-way-over-to-corner type you'd normally see. There is a Drifting game mode, which is little more than a matter of knowing when the mash the throttle and make the car get loose. You can turn on the racing line for each track so you know when to brake, there's a mini-map that varies in size with your speed to show you the track, etc. Some of the available assists to help you around the track include stability control and enhanced traction control. Some new and curious ideas include steering assist and braking assist.Wait. Steering assist? Braking assist? This is where NFS: Shift dives into inner conflict and begins its failure to combine the two racing camps. I don't just mean anti-lock brake assist to help you stop (also an option) or it being harder to spin out in a corner, I mean LITERAL steering and braking assist, as in the game will slightly steer and slow the car for you when it deems it necessary. Though this might sound like a boon to the fan of the arcade racer since it dumbs down the complexity of GP circuits, it's actually a substantial curse. It's quite concerning to see an AI try to move you into a turn or tell you what speed to take it at. It's an insult to simulator fans and to arcade racers alike, as both of them just want to drive the car and be on with it. Mistakes and crashes only hut the car visually (except on the highest difficulty), so there's no real penalty for messing up besides losing some track time. There's even a button to reset your car on the track if you crash or spin out too far. What's most frightful about these assists is that most of the cars feel uncontrollable without them on, and the design of the gameplay and AI doesn't allow you to go \"full-sim\" without huge penalties. The only consolation is that you can change your assist settings at any time during any event from the pause menu.Now that we've spoiled the game for Simulator fans, let's see how it looks the other way around. Your first event is racing a BMW M3 on a short circuit so the game can judge your skill and suggesting a starting difficulty. For someone used to an arcade style of racing, it'll take a good dozen tries to get around the 1-mile track without flying off repeatedly. The feel is, without massive adjustments to control settings and sensitivities, pretty much of terror for a more casual driving game player. You'll be accelerating on straight, slamming the brakes before each corner to a near-stop, turning very slowly, and repeating. This is not a very glorious or fun way to zip about some of the greatest racetracks in the world and it makes the experience of it being on real-world tracks completely meaningless. As the game events get harder and longer, the sense of helplessness while driving quickly around twisty tracks never entirely goes away and even when you think you're used to it you're forced to use faster cars which just start the process all over again. I say that as someone who has wasted hundreds of hours in every variety of racing game and as someone who has always laughed when they made a huge driving error that resulted in a crash. I've been through it all and even I've gotten annoyed. So, not this time. Crashes and runoffs are frustrating and feel like they're often no fault of your own. With a dozen or so different types of car assists available, it's quite possible it wasn't your fault.Digging deeper into that helpless feeling, we run into one of the key selling points of the game. As has been hyped in advertising, the game has a robust and detailed cockpit view that gives the player the \"feeling\" of speed. At anything over 100mph (160kmh), the sides of the screen will start to blur out and only have complete focus straight ahead, which is meant to be a \"simulation\" of real race-speed driving. By the time you're up to 150mph you'll be terrified to go any faster and above that you might as well drive with your eyes closed. It's a novel idea, but inconsistent and feels far more like a gimmick to avoid framerate issues in a highly-detailed cockpit than a true game feature. In actuality, it forces you to leave the racing line option on at all times and keep the braking assist, since it's absolutely impossible to see your braking or turn-in points for sweeping corners with everything but the 2ft of pavement in front of you blurred out. Thankfully, the game keeps the option of bumper, hood and third-person views available for you. I'd suggest hood view for a good experience without the drawbacks that make ten-tenths racing impossible, as the blurring effects only exist in cockpit mode. This is certainly not a game for third-person view. One interesting thing I do like about this style, however, is what happens when you crash or hit objects. The entire screen will grey out and get fuzzy, akin to a driver having to regain focus when all sense of direction is lost and panic sets in. Sadly, this cannot be turned off.The graphics are generally solid if you look past the deliberately-blurry speed effects. Cars are replicated down to the symbols on the rims and the size/color of the brake parts. The real-world track recreation is outstanding (though I question what they consider the racing line to be at times). Road America is my `local' track and the sensation of driving it in-game versus real life is solid, so I'd figure others will feel the same way. Menus are neat and tidy, fonts crisp. It's far from the detail of a Forza or Gran Tourismo but it certainly gets the job done outside of a sizable number of technical glitches. It's worth noting that none of the graphical bugs actually affect gameplay.Despite all this negativity, I can't deny there's fun to be had. It's hard to argue against a lot of the cars here and some of the tracks. It will just take a whole lot of tolerance and patience to find this small window of zen. Might I suggest spinning a Porsche Cayman around Donington for awhile?Sound is both amazing and disappointing. The sound effects of the cars (namely engines in heavy race tune) boils the blood and will leave you continuously wanting to turn up the volume. Though surround sound features don't seem terribly impressive, having a subwoofer really helps. On the other hand, the game soundtrack is absolutely horrible, just like with most EA games. Luckily, the music setting for in-race is set to `off' by default, which is where you'll want to leave it. The soundtrack will really only come up during replays, autosave time and drift events. It's tolerable, if not a tad obnoxious.The awards system is a strongpoint I think a lot of players might overlook in the middle of either being annoyed that their car is behaving too blandly on a twisty circuit or that their car is impossible to control at high speeds. As you play you earn badges which are essentially just marks of progress. They count how many passes you've made, how much you draft, how much contact you make, your wins on different difficulties, etc. It's well thought-out, and the game is kind enough to offer its top trophies/etc without having to complete extreme online racing requirements. You overall progress is marked in drivers levels from 1 to 50, and the game will keep track of whether you are a Precision driver (smooth, clean driving) or an Aggression one (constantly bashing other cars and skidding around everywhere). Just based on how racing games work, however, you will inevitably end up at Precision. In order to add up Aggression points means you have to remain in the main field and bash up with your opponents, with is both dangerous and not very good way to drive to victory. The AI is very aggressive and has no problem shoving you off-track, though I'm not sure if it's deliberate or accidental programming. In any case, you want to be in front and stay in front.Multiplayer is slick, if not somewhat limited. Games come up quickly and lag control is tidy. In most games, contact with your opponents will feel like it actually should have happened and wasn't just a fluke of the server being confused about where the cars were. One thing the multiplayer does make you stare in the fact of a lot, however, is load times. They're absolutely awful in all game modes, with over 30 seconds from menu to race start.A variety of other issues/complaints include, but are not limited to: an inability to use a custom controller button configuration (absolutely inexcusable), highly-tuned cars on default settings being created such that they will literally bounce down the track on long straights from the car bottoming out, an inability to customize the exterior pieces of your car, an awful livery editor, an incredibly confusing HUD while racing, the anti-gravity physics of Drift mode, no races longer than 20 minutes or so even in \"endurance\" events, highest tier of cars have no sense of interaction between the driver and track, lower-tier modified cars are substantially faster than the endgame 750hp+ cars, huge numbers of loopholes that allow you to bypass ever having to play at a normal difficulty, and the lack of a free race mode that just lets you practice.I won't deny that I've gotten my kicks from the game and I'm had fun, but it's only come after a whole lot of trial and error or settings and configuration to find out the few things that won't continuously annoy you. With any luck, some of the frustrating default suspension settings and AI will be patched and FAQs will get out there that will help on car setup on different tracks.All in all, Need for Speed: Shift is proof that you can't please the masses by compromising between different sub-genres of games. The game gets close(r) to a balance of simulation and arcade at times, but mashes the edges together far too much. Honestly, the game is more likely to appeal to racing purists that want to drive F1 and DTM circuits for fun than it will the average person who wants to hurl a fast car around the pavement. Such a focus won't revitalize the series and won't turn much of a profit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}

There are flaws, and here are the flaws I see.1. Driving on the line is hard with the faster cars. I used the Lamborghini Murcielago at the higher stages and quickly learned that staying on the line was impossible for me, so I would slow down, direct my car in the direction I wanted to go, and floored it. It provided a little drift which I like, but am sure that isn't what the game designers had in mind.2. The drift races were just too complicated to control with the faster cars.

The out of car views remind me a lot of an arcade racer. Reminds me a lot of when Trip Hawkins released the first Need for Speed for the 3DO. Trip now runs EA, and has made EA what it is today.

What is disappointing is that it was designed (as stated) for Guitar Hero. However, I do not have room in my home for two drum set controllers, no matter how nicely they fold flat to store. So we took a chance with this one because we thought it would be a better gaming experience to have \"real\" cymbals instead of using drumheads.We have Rock Band 1, 2 and Beatles and Guitar Hero, and yes, it does work better for Guitar Hero. It doesn't really work at all for Rock Band 1, and it's not great for Rock Band 2. If you are a perfectionist who doesn't want your Rock Band 2 score to be impacted by controller misfires, I'd say to stay away from this one. If you are just a casual Rock Band player, or are Guitar Hero-only, this set is fantastic, thus an overall score of 4 from me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Chitown Lurker","summary":"Best tactical FPS on the market","reviewText":"I've played virtually all of the previous Battlefield games, and like most others who are like me I find the series to be the pinnacle of online play. This one raises the bar once again.First, please let it be known that this is NOT a sequel to the Bad Company series. It is a sequel to Battlefield 2, a title that was released only on PCs. I've seen people gripe about the \"introduction\" of features like jets and going prone, but these things have always been staples of the main series, and thus cannot be considered \"additions\".The online play is fantastic, especially with a team of players using their mics. The pacing and the controlled spawn points allow a squad to employ actual tactics and strategy. This is not a game where the quickest trigger always wins. Victory typically goes to the most clever players.Some have griped about it trying too hard to be like the Call of Duty series, but frankly I don't see it. Yes, there are a couple of maps that are either very light on vehicles, and at least one that has none at all, but it simply forces players to try different classes and strategies to achieve victory, and it never causes the game to devolve into a mindless run-n-gun fest. The sense of tactical play always remains.As for the campaign, it's solid. It's certainly no worse than the one in Bad Company 2. Frankly, I was surprised they even bothered with a campaign at all. This is the first game in the main series (i.e. non-Bad Company) to even offer one. Online IS the core of the franchise. But the campaign is a nice diversion.Graphically this is, in my opinion, the top of the heap for console shooters. There is a little screen tearing, but beyond that, it's very pretty. I was actually surprised at how well it turned out. It's certainly not PC-quality, but there's no doubt that you're playing the same game. Those who were frightened by the beta really need to take a look at the retail release, because the graphical quality is a lightyear ahead of that.The audio is incredible, especially with a home theater system. I would go so far as to say it's the best of any console game thus far. Even passing bullets sound different based on how close they are. A close miss will \"snap\" by your ear, concrete will crumble as it is shot away, and jets flying overhead will sound like they're outside your house. It's perfect.Please note that if you're buying this for the 360, make sure you have a HARD DRIVE to install the high-res textures to...a flash drive, including the one in the 4GB 360 consoles, will NOT work as the textures require the performance afforded by said hard drive.Cons: Few. One is that I cannot figure out how to control which side (US or Russian) I am altering my soldier loadouts for when in the soldier customization off the main menu. It seems to default to whichever side I played with most recently. This matters because each side has slightly different weapon options. It's not a big thing, as these are easily enough altered in-game, or in the 30 seconds before a round starts.My only other issue is that LMGs are way too accurate even without the use of a bipod, the the point of almost making the bipods pointless. They feel more like those in Bad Company 2 than the ones in Battlefield 2.Regardless, this is by far my favorite online shooter...ever. The online is NOT even remotely similar to Call of Duty. This is a game for players looking for a more tactical style of play, where you are rewarded for thinking and supporting your team first and foremost. If that's up your alley, this game is a must own, regardless of your opinion of the (very good) Call of Duty series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"MK37","summary":"MP fans","reviewText":"This review will be pretty simple. BF3 is the best multiplayer game that is out right now. I am not saying that Halo (which i am a huge fan), MW3, Crysis 2, GoW and some others that they are not fun or good games. BF3 after some updates and server stabalizing is an outstanding online game. The game is incredibly balanced, level design is good and leveling up is fun. All the different classes can support each other and like a RTS there are checks and balances when it comes to vehicles and character loadouts. This game does not offer the overall value of Halo and GoW when it comes to game options. It also does not have a great co-op mode like some of the above games. MW3, GoW and Halo are much better choices if you are looking to play co-op or with a live person sitting next to you. The campaign in BF3 is average with a few standout moments in. The jet sequence is one of these moments...but again there are better options if a quality campaign is what you are looking for...So saying again this game should not be bought if you want some co-op fun or if you have people coming over to play some games or you want a high quality campaign...but if you want arguably the best current online multiplayer experience out there. Then do not wait to purchase this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Unlike other game environments that serve as nothing more than a visual backdrop, the devastating Helghan climate takes a notable toll. And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle.

Beautiful game ,great sound, fantastic level design, but the gameplay itself is average, hindered by slow player control/movement.  The gun selection is minimal and there is no true sight beyond a guide or a dot.  You know what the look of this game reminds me of \"Waterworld\", but in Space.  The game is just gorgeous, but not good enough for me to keep.  It's hard to give this game a 3, there was so much that was put into the game and they were so close, but I am told there is a patch on its way to fix the player control/movement.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  The fun factor is not long enough to keep my interest past a hour or so.  I used to play COD4 until I could barely stay awake.  My next purchase will be the next Madden, the next COD game, and I'll rent the next Uncharted.

{"product_name":"B0030HM2WO","description":"Amazon.com Product Description","reviewerName":"M. Ram","summary":"A celebration of Transformers lore!","reviewText":"I re-watched the first two seasons of the G1 series before getting this game, and while it takes place in its own continuity, it does have a ton of references (characters, locations, lines, trophy names...) back to the classic show. It also draws upon the other TF series, comics, and even the recent Michael Bay movies (only in a few character models, thankfully). There's also a lot of design and gameplay elements you've seen in other games like Vanquish, Gears of War, Uncharted and the Halo series, as well as a few things from the Matrix films.I found the game to be a blast for the most part. I'd read the complaints about repetitive gameplay and short length but found that they sort of balanced each other out; each level is just long enough to not be tedious (and they do mix it up with different characters and their abilities, and one flying level for each of the factions), and the boss battles are memorable. The lack of ammo does play a factor in the game (especially in the Autobot campaign) but you learn to deal with it. I enjoyed the fact that you have companions throughout the game, and loved hearing their one liners and banter (some of the voices are off, and some have unnecessary accents, but the quotes are gold). The controls take a bit of getting used to, but after a while they become second nature; I haven't seen anything else in gaming that comes close to the thrill of being able to jump off a building and transform and blast off as a jet in mid-air.My only real complaints about the game are technical - I had to download an update which then took almost 45 minutes to install for some reason. Every time you start up the game, you have to sit through at least 2 loading screens for the menu and save files, respectively. Loading screens (and having too much going on in a battle) will often cause the game to stutter and even freeze completely (three times during my play-through). The cutscenes use the game models but are very low quality for some reason. Sometimes you'll see an enemy jump around in the same spot in a neverending animation loop, or see your allies transform back and forth for no reason. Finally, at times the camera will be in a bad spot and you'll be destroyed by enemies or weapons you can't see.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

Simply put, playing this game was a magical, imagination/mind-opening experience; almost a mystical one, in fact. This euphoric feeling and sense of awe that we felt the first time we played this game would never again be matched, at least up until this stage in the video game realm. What made it so amazing was the fact that Mario, who had only existed in 3D in our minds as kids, had now become like the cartoon character we watched on the \"Super Mario Brothers\" cartoon. The days of Nintendo's rule were the great ones in video games, and it's a shame that kids nowadays won't get to grow up with Mario like us generation x-ers. Every Mario game, for me, was truly magical, but Super Mario 64 was truly revelatory. I spent years of my life playing this game (literally), and still play it more today than another other game available, for any other system. Unfortunately, this was one of the few true masterpieces for the Nintendo 64, and Sony took over with the PlayStation. For me, however, Nintendo and Mario are what video games are all about, and Super Mario 64 was the pinnacle of the entire industry.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2006"}

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Adam Ruining \"My reviews are genuine.\"","summary":"It's okay.","reviewText":"Pros: Many beautifully rendered elf girls run around a primitive planet finding aliens and battling giant crabs with swords (that is, the elf girls have swords; not the crabs) with very little exploration of stars or oceans involved.

Single player Federation campaign, spanning three full epochs (Enterprise, The Original Series, and The Next Generation) Robust multiplayer with full Xbox Live support","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Worth playing","reviewText":"Star Trek fans have had some pretty funny luck when it comes to video games. For every good game like Starfleet Command or Elite Force there is an Star Trek: Encounters or Star Trek: Pinball. Luckily, Star Trek: Legacy is a pretty decent game, although it is clear that it had the potential to be a whole lot better. On paper, Legacy sounds like a great Star Trek game. Give the player control of lots of ships, cover every series, include the voices of every Starfleet captain, and tie it together with a storyline that would actually make a good Star Trek movie. And for the most part the game is pretty good.You start the game off as Captain Archer in the NX-01 before moving on to the Enterprise, Defiant, and so on. The ships are modeled pretty accurately, and behave as you would expect. The combat offers a good amount of depth without getting absurdly complicated like the Starfleet Command games. The starship combat revolves around maneuvering your ships, either together as one task force or individually, into position to get your enemy into the firing arcs of your weapons, while trying to stay out of theirs.Most ships have both phasers and torpedoes. Phasers are good against shields and they run off of energy which recharges after firing. The amount of damage they do increases over time, so allowing them to fully charge before firing again is a good tactic. Torpedoes are good against the hull of a ship and they do a constant amount of damage. However, you have a limited number of them, so you will want to make sure you have a good lock on the target before firing. The strength of your weapons lock depends on your position and distance from your target. And if you are able to get in close enough you have the option of targeting specific subsystems in the enemy ship such as weapons or engines.You can also manage your speed. Besides going to warp, you can run at full,  or  impulse. Slowing down allows you to turn faster, but also makes you an easier target to hit. In addition to changing speed, you also have control over your power systems. Rerouting power can give you a boost to the system (engines, shields, weapons) that you need the most at any specific moment. For example, you can take power from your shields and route it to weapons for faster recharge and longer range at the cost of defense. Lastly, you can issue repairs on certain ship systems, but repairing will drain energy, making your ship less effective in battle while the repairs are underway.There are of course other tactics that you can take advantage of such as hiding ships in nebulas and beaming away teams to space stations once the shields are down to capture it, but these are more mission specific and you wont find yourself doing them very often.As you complete each mission, you are given points that you can spend on buying new ships for your task force. You can have up to four ships directly under your control at one time. Ships fall into different classes such as cruisers and destroyers, and it's up to you to decide how many ships you actually need and of what type. These points carry over from one mission to another, so it's a good idea to try to save as many credits as you can or you may find yourself facing heavy opposition with not enough points to buy more powerful ships to even the odds.The missions offer a pretty good variety of things to do. They are not all \"go here and kill everything\" missions that you might expect. While some will task you with doing just that, there are also missions where you will be evacuating people from poisoned planets, sneaking across enemy lines in a cloaked ship to conduct hit and run attacks, and defending Deep Space 9 from the Borg. The game is at its best when it throws you into these huge battles. Seeing these beautiful ships fill the screen and explode is pretty exciting.However, the game also has some low points. This is mainly the result of your inability to save during the missions. So if you fail, you are suck restarting the mission from the beginning. With some missions lasting nearly an hour, this is really unacceptable. At the very least the game should offer a mid-level checkpoint. Sometimes mission objectives are not completely clear, leaving you trying to figure out what it is that you are supposed to be doing. One mission where you save planets from falling interstellar debris proved especially annoying because of a rather narrow margin of error. Luckily this is the exception rather then the rule. I only had to restart one mission the entire time, although it did take three or four tries until I finally got it. But for the most part the mission design is fine.The storyline is actually surprisingly good. It tells the story of a Vulcan scientist that discovers the remains of a Borg ship during the early days of the Federation, and figures out a way to become their queen. It's a pretty good plot device that ties all of the eras together, that is if you can follow it. If you find yourself feeling like the story is missing something, that's because it is. A few missions were cut, particularly from the end, of the game in order to get it out in time. You still get the gist of what is going on, but it's not as clear as it could have been.While the storyline is pretty cool, the way it is presented is not. Missions often open up with long winded narrative by one of the captains while the camera just circles around the ship. This is a pretty boring way to tell the story, and it's surprising that they could not find a more interesting way to tell it. However, the voice acting is pretty good for the most part, and having all of the captains voice their lines makes these sequences bearable.Online, the game doesn't have much going for it. There are only two modes of play available. The first is a deathmatch game where you simply try to destroy your opponents either by yourself of in teams. The second is a co-op survival game where you and your teammates try to survive wave after wave of enemy ships. Both can be fun for a while, but it's not something that will hold most people's attention for more then a few games.Overall, Star Trek: Legacy is a good game. The starship combat is fun and has a good amount of depth to it, while the missions offer enough variety to keep you playing for a while. There is also a good mix of achievements that give some incentive to go back and play certain missions over again. Although it is a little disappointing to think about how much better this game could have been if they spent a little more time on it and added a few more features like checkpoints and more multiplayer options. Let's hope Mad Doc Software gets a shot at a squeal, and are given the time they need to make it amazing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Not a Cakewalk, but Fun Just the Same","reviewText":"NOTE:  If you own a PS3 and are considering buying Portal 2 for the PC, you might want to buy the PS3 version instead--because you'll get both!  Portal 2 for the PS3 comes with an added bonus:  it supports Valve's \"Steam\" system.  While controversial to PC Gamers, Steam is designed for the PS3 to be a point to track your savegames and trophies and upload screenshots.  The bonus comes in when you use an existing Steam account or create a new one:  tying Portal 2 into Steam will unlock a copy of the PC & Mac versions that you can play on any computer.If you've already played Portal, you won't be disappointed with Portal 2:  it's more of the same, and then some more on top.  While the difficulty still has to start low and ramp itself up to get new players used to the world, it does so in a way that old players will find new and interesting.  This time around, top-notch voice-acting injects a wicked sense of humor into Portal 2 that is just perfect:  there were times my family came in the room simply to be in earshot of Portal 2's dialogue.While I will go out of my way not to give you spoilers, I will tell you that the storyline for Portal 2 gives us a nice new level of depth while still bringing back some familiar themes.  It removes some of the isolation by making your relationship with your character just a bit more personal:  others who talk to you drop you little hints about your past.  Best of all, Portal 2 adds some very clever new 'items' to your interaction that bring entire new dimensions to the problem-solving you'll have to do.  There is a supporting cast of other characters--some of whom you never actually meet--but just like Gordon Freeman in Half-Life, you still play a silent partner in the story.The concept behind Portal is simple:  you are trapped in a series of areas that have been designed to challenge your brain.  Each has puzzles that require you to do particular actions (press a switch, carry an object, etc.) in order to get to the exit, and each exit leads you on to the next level.  Some have obstacles, some have hazards...and some are downright deadly.Where Portal is different is that it holds a first-person-shooter perspective but requires no fast-twitch skills.  You do need to be able to stomach some very dizzying spins and turns, and you will get at least a bit of vertigo at times when you're hurtling off a ledge aiming yourself at a narrow hole.  The only object you hold is a device capable of opening said hole: \"portals\" are inexplicable holes in reality.  Pop a hole in one wall, place an exit in another, and when you step through Hole A, out you go through Hole B.  Simple?  Not when you have to put a hole in the bottom of a pit, open another in a vertical wall, and then hope you fall into the pit fast enough that coming out the wall above you has enough momentum to throw you onto that platform on the other side of the room near the ceiling.  Not to worry--you won't be straining the laws of physics right away:  Portal 2 gradually works you towards the more complicated rooms at a very capable rate.  Just as in the first game, we have moments where we peek behind the curtain, but stepping outside of the rat-maze doesn't mean you get to stop thinking on your feet.Portal 2 also offers a two-player co-op mode that takes our problem-solving skills to a new level:  instead of a competitive race to the end, it's all about teaming up, working together to get to the exit.  A perfect example of this is that there is one puzzle in which both of you need to reach the goal, and you will only be able too stop your hurtling momentum if each of you times things just right and crashes into the other...causing both of you to drop down exactly where you need to be.If you enjoy thinking on your feet, don't mind the first-person interface, and want something different from a shooter game, Portal 2 will fill your needs perfectly.  It is clever, it is funny, and it is paced just right to keep the frustration low and the fun factor high.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

I tried to enjoy the action but was caught up looking for items or trying to open doors to reach the next level. Some missions are so short, literally all you might do is run and open a door and a mission is over.

The bosses were pretty cool but the motivation really wasn't  there.Who were these people to you?Why do they want you to die?If they wish to make this a real action game, forget the 'resident evil' style puzzles and just do a 'final fight' type style where you just have to  fight your way to the end of a level.I just really wasn't all that impressed.

It was over before it began.It was like a summer blockbuster movie, with no plot, not as much action as promised, and too  many special effects. A very underwhelming experience of a game. I'm glad it was cheap.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2003"}

In this follow-up to the critically acclaimed first title, Jack Carver thinks he's found paradise. When a gorgeous woman draws him in on a dangerous heist, their sun drenched days take a chilling turn. Hunted for a murder he didn't commit, Jack must draw on his most savage instincts to make his predators his prey.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"FCIP isn't all that spectacular...","reviewText":"Well Far Cry Instincts lets us take control of Jack Carver, a former US Navy Commando-now turned-fishing boat captain who is on the run from his past. Eventually, after having his boat annihilated, Jack finds himself battling for his life on this island against pirates, mercanaries, and a mad doctor named Kreiger. Soon enough this Kreiger fellow gets a hold of you and injects you with some virus that transforms you into a lethal killing machine with abilities such as smelling people, seeing in the dark, super strength & speed, and the ability to jump great distances. Anyway, you basically have to kill Kreiger and the leader of the Mercanaries named Crowe and escape the island.In Evolution, we find that Jack has been spending his time basically getting drunk when this young dame hires him as a muscle during a weapons sale between her and some local militia. Just as the sale is about to go down, some rebels come and obliterate the militia - and after you kill them - it looks like everyone is poiting the blame on you for the death of the militia. Anyway, your trying to escape from this new island when you get assaulted by people who have the same kind of powers as you, and the big cheese known as Sereum (or something like that) tries killing you and that dame from early... so naturally you want vengenace.... especialyl after he kills your man Doyle from Instincts.Though different stories, both games play exactly a like. Through Jack's eyes you get a lot of weapons from assault rifles, shotguns, .50 caliber machine guns you can rip out of the ground, sniper rifles, and others to destroy numerous enemies - though you can only carry 3 types of weapons, most of the smaller ones can be duel wield. You can also use your animal moves which can be entertaining like when you punch a pirate 100 miles away. There are a lot of vehicles to drive such as hummers, ATVs, hand gliders (that was cool), various types of boats, trucks, and many more.. though there are no tanks. In both games you can set traps, which include laying claymore mines into the ground or tying up branches so when enemies walk near them the branch whips back scoring you an instant kill. It was pretty cool, but got pretty useless later on.There is a multiplayer and it is pretty fun. There are many types of game modes ranging from mere deathmatches & capture the flag games to \"Predator\" games where one person becomes feral and stalks other players. There is also a map editor where you can make your own stages with any kind of box, vehicle, emplacement, or anything which is a really cool feature. Great for X-Box Live.Lets talk difficulty. Far Cry Predator is a pretty hard game for a few reasons: You'll be fighting ALOT of enemies at one time (both in air and on ground), the weapons seem sort of weak when you're using them, and your health depletes WAYYY too fast - for instance you'll get shot like twice with an assault rifle and you're almost dead. However, the boss fights are pretty simplistic and just require you to slash at them with your claws for a few moments.. so its a win-lose situation: It's hard to get up to the boss, but the boss is easy.Graphics are kinda subpar figuring they just used the normal X-Box mechanics, but they still look pretty good. The white beaches, dense jungles, dark caves, and crystal clear water look beautiful... the character models look a little lame and boxy, but one quick glance at the enviroments and you can easily forget about them.Almost all of the sounds were great. The music was really thumbs up and helped add a bit of lonliness & freakyness to the atmosphere. The guns sounded great, and the voice acting was awesome - Jack Carver is the man. He curses, is sarcastic, tough... he has a lot of personality that is shown through his dialouge.Now for endings. Instincts was boring - you beat Crowe, Kreiger gets killed by some mutants, Doyle & Cortez pick you up in a helicopter. You say, \"Cortez - you owe me a damned boat!\" and Doyle gives you a suitcase full of money. You grin and fly away.. thats it. In Evolution, after you beat the leader of the new Feral people (Sereum), you meet the dame who hired you and tried to kill you near the end of the game, and she starts freaking out because..well...she tried to kill you and you survived. You throw her money at her and she says,\" There was nothing else I could do Jack.\" and your character looks at her and goes, \"There was a time when I used to think like that too.\" and kicks open a door to reveal a way off the island. Thats it.... sadly, Doyle dies. Sort of lackluster, but every game's ending has been bad so far.To finish it up Far Cry is a pretty run of the mill FPS with only a FEW qualities that make it stand out slightly. Sure its intense, and sure the multiplayer is good but the game is kinda short, the ending doesn't feel rewarding, and when your done with the stoy (and don't have X-Box Live) then there really isn't much reason to play Predator again. Rent it first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

I'm a big fan of shooters, particularly sci-fi based shooters, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on this game.  I pre-ordered it weeks in advance without really doing any research on it, so shame on me.  I guess I assumed that since reports had dubbed Titanfall the &#34;XBOX One Savior&#34; due to slumping sales and the PS4's market dominance, that it would be a sure hit.  After a few hours of the game, I can safely say I'm pretty disappointed.First, let me say that this isn't a bad game at all.  Visually, it looks great.  Characters and environments are well done.  The sound, controls and overall gameplay are also first rate.  In all honesty, I only have one gripe...albeit a major one.  The game is devoid of an actual &#34;campaign&#34;.  Sure, the main menu gives you the option of a &#34;campaign&#34;, but it's not in the traditional sense.  The &#34;campaign&#34; is simply a series of multiplayer game sets.  There is no real story or substance.  It's basically just a drop ship dropping you into a multiplayer battle.  Shoot, shoot, shoot, earn a titan (a large robot that you can pilot), blow some things up for a bit, and if you win the battle, shoot down the opposing team's escape ship before it leaves for a bonus.  If you lose, get to the escape ship before you're blown up for a bonus.  That's it.  There is no character development, only character classes from which you can choose at the beginning of each battle.  Heck, there aren't really any characters to be heard of.  The lack of story really makes the game seem shallow and unltimately, boring.  I know there are a lot of multiplayer fans that will love this game and, as I said, it's not as if this game is &#34;bad&#34; per se.  I just prefer my blockbuster games to have an actual true campaign that contains a solid storyline and a bit of depth.So, take this review for what it's worth.  I'm not trying to bash the game as I am simply stating that it's not really my cup of tea.  Multiplayer is a nice option, but I don't want a game that's multiplayer only.  While MP can be fun, it wears thin after a while.Multiplayer - 5/5 starsOverall Game - 3/5 stars","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2014"}

I could say it was an adventure game, since there's never any true stressors in it.  It's a relaxed lounging on the couch game.  Sure, you have those little intervals with the droids, but it's never really a matter of life or death.  I could say it was a puzzle game, since there are a lot of great puzzles in it.  It could be a platform game, since it has a lot of those elements as well.  I do know that despite my trouble fitting it into a genre, it is a perfect game.The humor isn't completely universal- but there is something for everyone.  The voice acting is fantastic.  The writers really did a great job with this.  You know the giggles that you had in the first one?  Expect triple the giggles.There are very few games I would recommend to almost anyone- but this is a game for your girlfriend who gets mad at you when you play modern warfare.  This is a game for your hipster friends (Do you have those?).  This is a game for the most hardcore of gamers, because it's just that fun.  Children could play it, and while a lot of the humor would go over their cute little heads, any of the gut wrenching potato scenes would definitely give a kid a good laugh. It even has a co-op option, which isn't as fun as the single player, but is still great.FIVE STARS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}

BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Better late than never.","reviewText":"For some reason, I'm always late to the party on playing the modern classic games. Whether it's because I wait until big price drops most of the time, or because super hyped up games makes me cautious, it takes a long time before I get to play most of them. Bioshock is one of those games, and after finally buying it recently, I have to say that I'm ashamed of myself for not playing it sooner. This is one of the few games that had my attention from the very beginning, and I didn't play any other game until I beat it. The last game that did that for me? Fallout 3. I -love- the city of Rapture and very much look forward to playing the sequel very soon. As much as I hate to sound like a fanboy who won't have anything negative to say about the game, I mean it when I say that this is one of those games that I didn't want to end. For the handful of people out there who still haven't played Bioshock, you need to at the very least borrow it from a friend.Right from the start, you're thrown into the fire. You play as a man traveling over the ocean in a plane, when it suddenly goes down. As the only survivor, you make it through the fiery debris to a lighthouse that ends up being more than it seems. As it turns out, it leads to an underwater city- Rapture. This was once a perfect city, ruled by no one, where people could do as they pleased without worrying about big government coming in and ruining everything. At least, that's how it was at one point. Things are much different now. Mutated killers known as Splicers run amok, everyone's going nuts over a substance known as Adam that practically gives the user super powers, and little girls with syringes go around Rapture harvesting the Adam from anyone they encounter with the help/protection of the huge Big Daddy body guards. A man named Atlas contacts you via radio, giving you tips on how to stay alive down there, and he also needs your help to get back together with his family. You help him out, he'll help you out. It's a long journey, and you'll make use of guns, tools, special powers and computer hacking abilities in order to make it out.Bioshock never drags on, moving along at a smooth pace. It plays like a standard First Person Shooter, but with some interesting tweaks. You shoot and change weapons with the R1 and R2 buttons, and use powers and change them with L1 and L2. You can only carry a few powers at first, but can get a few more slots as you progress, and you can always change what you have thanks to handy gene swapping vending machines conveniently scattered throughout Rapture. In addition to more powers, there are ability enhancements to be found. Extra power while swinging the wrench, having more time to hack gun turrets and security cameras, resisting damage better, emitting an electric shock when hit by an enemy...there's quite a bit you can have, with many fun combinations. The powers you use are also good for more than just casually hitting enemies. If someone's escaping from you and is running through a flooded area, zap the water with your lightning! Is the bad guy picking you off from a distance? Pick up a trash can with telekinesis to use it as a shield and make your way toward them. I was surprised at how smart the AI could be on the normal difficulty setting. There are lots of First Aid stations in Rapture for anyone to use for a small fee- even the enemies. The first time I learned this was when a Splicer ran away from me as I was reloading my machine gun. I chased after him and had the guy against a wall...but he was doing something to the First Aid station. Before I could figure out what was going on, I saw that his health bar had fully restored! How do you remedy this? Simply hack the First Aid station so it heals you but hurts anyone else who uses it. It was also surprising to see how well the enemies would make use of objects to take cover, or run off and hide for a few seconds before getting the drop on you, literally and figuratively. Early in the game, an enemy that can walk on the ceiling is introduced, and these guys always managed to get me, even towards the end of the game.And do I even need to say anything about the Big Daddies? These are one of the best-designed characters in a game I've seen in years. Even towards the end when I had strong enough weapons to take them out in just a couple of hits, I'd get that \"oh no\" feeling when I'd hear one at a distance. Big Daddies can and will make a rag doll out of you if you're not fast enough or don't set up a trap. Fortunately, they only attack you if you make the first move, or if you pose a threat to the Little Sisters they usually accompany. Taking care of the Little Sisters is a big part of the game, where you either save them from the parasite within, or harvest the parasite and get lots of Adam to buy new powers and abilities. As ghastly as these little girls are, you can't help but feel sorry for them, both the condition they're in, and when you take down their Big Daddy and see them crying over the lifeless body.I could keep going about the things I loved about the game: sitting back while well-acted audio diaries played out, the perfectly minimal score, fantastic art direction, etc., but I think everyone's heard enough of it over the last 5 years. Bioshock deserves the praise it got. My only complaint is that I wanted more, the semi-letdown of an ending, and it seemed like the character you play as could've been more fleshed out. In the opening cutscene, he's talking, but as soon as it's over, the guy never talks again apart from groans when he gets hurt. We learn A LOT about him as the story progresses, yet he still came off as 'generic mute hero' to me. To be honest, the hero was the one boring thing about the game, but it's not a big fault. The final boss battle is over before it gets interesting, and I'm hoping that when I go through Bioshock on the hardest difficulty soon, that it'll be better. Let's just say that the good AI seemed to have went to every bad guy -except- the final boss. And my little gripe is that the ending is over way too quickly. Final level finishes, you get a cutscene that can't be more than a minute long, and the credits roll immediately upon the cutscene finishing. No time to let it sink in- the credits start up the second it's done. At least it was a good ending for what it was.Giving this game 4 stars instead of 5 feels wrong, but I truly feel that the last moments could've been stronger. The writers put a ton of time into the plot and making the characters seem real, and it shows that Bioshock is a labor of love. It's one of the best games I've played this generation, and I'll be going through Bioshock 2 very soon in order to be ready for Infinite. Long live the Big Daddies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2012"}

So I finally loaded this one up and WOW! The beginning cutscene was amazing. Alot of the game storytelling is done in comic book format and you have the ability to either watch it again or fast forward through it.The graphics are amazing (they recommend 256 meg of ram and a 64m video card, which I had, which means you may not get the full effect with anything less), the sound eefects and music were awesome, and the controls were just like any other FPS game (I shouldn't call this an FPS since it is played in 3rd person, but hey). Also, there are harder levels of play available after you beat one.I read one review that said the game looked cool and all, but there was know strategy. Strategy??? You mean there is another strategy besides shooting everything in site? This game definitley had strategy to it. One example was if you just went into a room with guns blazing against 3 or 4 guys, you either suffered significant damage or died (which is what happens most of the time). You have to decide what weapon to use, how you want to go in the room, and which guy to take out first becasue some of the bad guys had weapons that do serious damage. Usually when entering a room where I knew bad guys were, I used the \"Dodge and Shoot\" alot. With the click of button when you are moving, everything slows down and give you the advantage while you are airborn. Very cool to use abd saves you alot of damage. Then there is the \"bullet Time\" method which lasts about 5 to 8 seconds (as long as your meter is full). As soon as you press the button, you move in slow motion and it give you the advantage of targeting them and avoiding their fired shots. It's very cool seeing buckshot fly past you in slow notion. A definte advantage you need on certain levels, otherwise you spend alot of time reloading because you will be dead. Another cool feature is if you shoot someone in the head or in a certain area (say, near a ledge) and you see the guy go flying in slow motion. Very cool. Also, some of the levels you had to figure out how to get to the next area and it takes a little thinking, but the way is always in front of you. There was also a level where you had to get Max through his dream and that was pretty cool.The outside scenery (this takes place during the worst storm NY has ever seen) is awesome. The snow falling all around, sirens in the background, wind whipping all around when you step outside, very nicely done. There were only 2 things I didn't like: They cut to a story board a little too often, & 2, the game was a little short. Other than that, this was clearly one of the most awesome games I have ever played. It had me hooked from the moment I started playing it. Too bad it didn't have on-line play available, but heres too hoping that they make a Max Payne 2 with that capability.Max Payne is nearly the ultimate game, but hey, no game is perfect.

Comics, television, and especially video games. Zombie games have to do a lot to stand out in the crowd now. Dead Island taunted a gorgeous open world and deep RPG driven gameplay, but did it deliver what it promised?The moment you first lay eyes on the island resort of Banoi, you're most likely going to say something along the lines of \"Wow, this game is beautiful!\" and you'd be right. Everything in Dead Island is very well rendered, from the good to the bad. The palm trees and sand are pleasing to the eyes, and in the same way gashed and chewed up remains are absolutely disgusting. If there is one good thing I have to say about Dead Island it is that the graphics are consistently stunning.Upon booting up the game, you are presented the choice of 4 different characters. Each character has different specialties and personalities, but unfortunately none of them are likable. All of the playable characters are an annoying stereotype, from the football jock to the coky feminist , and they just had to throw in a gangster black guy to boot. Add on top of that that none of them had any reason to vacation to the island aside from getting drunk and partying and you just don't really care if they survive or not.The game controls from the first person perspective and is for the most part an RPG. You take on quests from other island survivors and, as you complete more story related quests new areas are opened to you. One area where the game falls short is that it is not nearly as open as it claims to be. Once you unlock all the areas, it is decently large but the island is still not that big. In the end, you're pretty much made to stay in the area where the story is unfolding unless you want to be completely bored to death. Killing zombies and completing quests awards you with experience, and as you level up you acquire skill points to buy upgrades and abilities with.Another area the game falls short is the weapons. The game was supposed to be about improvising and using what is around you, but instead there are only a handful of items that can be used as weapons. Fortunately these weapons can be upgraded to break the monotony, but that still isn't enough. For example, if you have a baseball bat and 2 nails, you make a spiked bat. This is cool, but doesn't save the game from the fact that there are very few weapons. As you use weapons, they degrade. Guns become less accurate and strong, and pipes bend and rust. Use them enough and the weapon will break. This is kind of a neat feature, but ultimately the fact that you will likely find another weapon just like it soon causes you to only care so much. On top of that, combat eventually just gets repetitive and boring to the point that you hope you don't tun into another enemy - and not because you're dying.Overall, Dead Island is very pretty, but that does not save it from mediocre gameplay that doesn't live up to any of its promises. Perhaps if I had known nothing about the game prior to my purchase, I would have enjoyed it more. I watched all the prerelease trailers and read most of the articles about it before it came out. I expected a wonderful, beautiful, open world zombie game. It may have delivered on the beautiful part, but the gameplay is fairly linear despite the side quests and the combat gets old quickly. There are plenty of toher zombie games out there that are much more worthy of your money and your time.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Valkyria Chronicles was an unexpected, but very welcomed step in the right direction for the company. This artful strategy-RPG focuses in on one Welkin Gunther, the well-educated and intellectual son of a legendary war hero, in an alternate 1930's Europe.Not only is the story endearing, but the presentation is brilliant. Valkyria Chronicles is told through a book titled \"On the Gallian Front\", by Irene Koller, which lends itself beautifully to the story the game sets out to tell. With two large factions warring over a powerful dwindling resource called \"ragnite\", Welkin and his small nation of Gallia are swept up into battle, with Welkin leading Squad 7 of the militia. The book is also a treasure trove of information, with tabs that allow access to all the details and back stories that help to solidify the world of Valkyria Chronicles. It basically acts as an encyclopedia for people, events, weapons, and other things in the world as you progress in the game.One of the most striking facets of Valkyria Chronicles is the stunning art direction, with visuals that, for lack of a better explanation, looks like an anime done with watercolors. The character designs are by far most impressive, with loads of unique and individual characters, though there are some rather bland level designs in-game. But the game looks great in motion and even better during cutscenes - this approach gives Valkyria Chronicles a lot of its initial appeal and charm. Aside from the potential squad mates being unique, they're also all voiced and come with their own back stories.The game is presented in chapters, each with containing a few cutscenes, some dialogue exchanges, and missions to be completed. While thumbing through the chapters, all other options are opened up, including Headquarters, where you're bound to spend plenty of time. Over at HQ, you'll be presented with all of the new recruits, who can be dropped and added at will to make up the squad. The training facility is where experience points can be allocated to the different soldier classes, to increase their combat potential and unlock extra abilities and orders. There's also an R&D; facility for upgrading weapons, as well as your tank, and a couple other interesting locales to frequent. This is all done through menus, of course - you'll never be in control of your characters outside of combat/mission scenarios.The gameplay is a unique mix of real-time, strategy, and RPG elements, really in a classification of its own. Welkin commands the tank, from which he can issue special orders. There are five different classes - Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, and Sniper - that can be recruited into your ranks and deployed at the start of battle. Battle starts with a briefing, giving you your objectives (Often involving capturing an opponent's base), followed by the opportunity to deploy whichever troops you see fit for the task at hand.Once your soldiers are out on the map, you're allotted a certain number of turns per phase, which you can spend on a variety of actions. Aside from issuing specific orders, the most common option will be individually selecting soldiers, who then run around in real-time, with their moves restricted by an AP gauge. Hitting R1 starts the aim mode, where your soldier stands still and performs an action, whether it be an attack on an enemy or healing an ally. While running around in real-time, enemies can't move, but they can both fire if you enter their line of sight and return fire if you fire upon them. The gameplay is incredibly deep, rewarding, and addictive. Not to mention fresh and inventive.The game is a bit of trial and error if you don't catch the hints presented to you. Furthermore, a poorly spent phase or even turn - a mistake or two - can lead to frustration, as it's entirely possible to end up in a situation where it's nearly impossible to come out of. It's not overly difficult, but it's not spoon-fed to you - likewise, some missions can be a real pain. If you're ever feeling underpowered, of course, there are also Skirmish battles that can be completed for some much needed experience - and money.Valkyria Chronicles is one of the freshest experiences I've had in gaming in a while. It will draw you in with its charm, and then leave you on the edge of your seat with its gripping narrative and compelling, relatable characters. Before you know it, you're down a good 40 hours or so of your life, ready to put in more with a new game or expanded DLC, because it isn't just a compelling ride, but fun to play. All PS3 owners should give this one a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Best GTA yet...","reviewText":"Ah, Vice City. I remember it very well from my childhood-the long, light-brown beaches, the pastel-colored garages and tenements, the Ferrari Testarossas coursing down the streets, that blond-haired guy with no socks blowing up cars with his shotgun, the serene Jan Hammer music...wait a minute, that was all on that one episode of Miami Vice I saw last night. Never mind. The Vice City we're talking about here may look a lot like the Miami that Crockett And Tubbs rocketed around every week in the 80s, but there's far more to it than meets the eye. After all, this city's home to the new Grand Theft Auto-a game that not only lets you play the villain escaping those impeccably fashionable cops, but is also the sequel to the highest-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. Does it live up to the hype? It's fair to say so. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is set 15 years before all the mayhem that took place during GTAIII. You play Tommy Vercetti, a punk from Liberty City that just spent the last few years of his life in prison. He's sent down to Florida by his mob boss to scope out the local drug scene, but ends up caught in a coke deal gone bad. Now it's up to him to get both the drugs in question and the money lost in the process... not to mention the folks who tipped the cops off to the deal. What's the point of getting mad, after all, if you're not gonna get even later? Vice City works basically the same as its predecessor,you have free reign around the city (though half of it is inaccessible at the start of the game) and you're allowed to do whatever enters your mind. Assuming said \"whatever\" involves driving cars, stealing cars, attacking people, doing wheelies in the middle of rush-hour traffic, or sending an ice cream truck up a ramp and 200 feet in the air before landing in the ocean, that is. There are over 80 missions this time around, and they're tied together much more nicely. The endless fetch-n-kill jobs you had in GTAIII are mostly gone, replaced with everything from drive-bys and remote-control helicopter bombings to golf-cart car chases and pizza-boy assassinations. There's easily a hundred hours or so of gameplay here if you try tracking down all the hidden packages and stunt launchpads, but you'll likely add a few dozen more to that figure just by cruising around, checking out the city sprawl (it's twice as big as Liberty City), exploring the insides of buildings, and scaring up the cash to buy strip clubs and condos. Now, before I let myself espouse mightily about how addictive Vice City is, it may be best to go over some of its rough spots. Exhibit A: the graphics. The city looks beautiful, especially at night when it's all lit up with pastel colors, and there are all sorts of amusing touches you only get to see with thorough exploration. However, the famous GTAIII motion blur is back, and it's worse than ever: the entire game looks like Tommy took some kind of really bad acid. This feature can be turned off, and it's recommended you do so as soon as possible, but the blurring also hides some of the graphic plainness that's an unfortunate necessity of the game's huge environments. The GTA3 pop-in has returned, too-palm trees appear in front of you from just a few hundred feet away-and the characters in cutscenes still look kind of like marionettes with their weird flipper arms. All of this probably won't bother you too much-the game's just too darn fun for me to care-but it's still understandable why Rockstar didn't call this GTA4. A breathtaking sunset marks the end of another glorious day in Vice City. Tommy is so mesmerized that he moves into oncoming traffic to get a better view. Perhaps he needs some glasses. With that out of the way, it's time to espouse. Vice City is absolutely packed with new stuff to play with, and almost none of it is boring or badly implemented. Besides the usual new cars, Rockstar has added motorcycles and a helicopter or two to the city traffic-the former are tremendous fun to drive, and the latter is great for surveying the crime empire Tommy builds up towards the end of the game. Ray Liotta (from GoodFellas) provides the voice for Tommy, and he's spot-on wonderful in the role-the way he delivers each of his lines, from \"I'm gonna get your money back, okay?\" to \"Hey, I like this shirt,\" fits in perfectly with his smart-ass street criminal role. But the best praise should really be reserved for the radio-station soundtrack. This is 1986 we're talking about, of course, so the in-game stations play nothing but your favorites from the age of yuppies and wine coolers. Michael Jackson, Hall and Oates, Mr. Mister, Jan Hammer himself-they, along with a few dozen others, are all in effect here. If you liked the hilarious radio chatter from GTA3, there's a ton more of that here, too. Make sure you're not in the middle of a multi-car police chase while listening to the Crocodile Hunter parody; you'll likely break into laughter and drive into a light post or moped rider. When you get right down to it, nothing much in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is different from its predecessor. The aiming system's been improved, and the character models look a bit (just a bit) spiffier, but that's about it. However, you'd be deeply mistaken if you think the formula's stale. The gameplay in Vice City is more addictive than ever, except now there's twice as much of what made the first game so great-more streets, more cars (and other vehicles), more cool missions, more awesome street life. GTA3 fans won't be disappointed one bit, and those few PS2 owners who never played the last title are in for one of the most time-consuming games they've ever played. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a dirt bike I wanna send flying over this channel...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2003"}

They all have been so well-rendered to keep your mind in tip top shape. As for Nintendo, they have also made their mark with the way we play video games on the home market, and the handhelds with the Game Boy rendiditons, and the Nintendo DS nearly over a year ago. Well, Nintendo has put that mental challenge to the extremes for the DS in more ways than one.Brain Age for the Nintendo DS, is a compilation of all different kinds of games and puzzles that test your ability to read, and apply yourself mentally. The game consists of certain evaluations that reflect on how you remember words, simple math problems, and how fast you can also read. The game also includes sudoku on it, and it tells you how you are with the game, and what you need to do better. The stylus is really used quite well, and much better than most of the other games that rely on it. There also are challenges that test you verbally as well, like the stroop exam where you have to read the color of the text of a word, instead of the word itself. There is one big disadvantage, you have to say the words clearly through the stroop exam, because there are times where you may get the answer right, it might not be registered properly and your score may be affected.Despite a few flaws on the microphone, Brain Age really is a great mental challenge for Nintendo DS. It is a must buy for the mind as well as the pockets. I love how stimulating the challenges are, and there is so much to go around. I just hope there are more of these mental games for other systems like this one soon, it is definitely something missing for the video game market.Graphics: B+Sound: A-Price: A-Microphone use: C+Control: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2006"}

I was frustrated with the controls and uninterested in the story.  For whatever reason, I checked out the demo on PSN and found it rather enjoyable.  The controls were much improved, and it was just a lot of fun throwing Storm Troopers off of things or using the Jedi mind trick to make them attack each other or commit suicide.So I thought it might be worth my time, then the reviews came out.  My opinions usually fall inline with those of the critics so I planned on steering clear of this one.  However, due to a sale at Gamestop, I was able to get a used copy for free.  Can't complain about that right?Now after completing it, I must say some of the critique is warranted.  The game is definitely short, around 6-7 hours is all it'll take to finish.  There are two endings, but you don't need to play through twice to see both of their results, just pick up your saved game at the end.  The story that I'd read was so ridiculous is nothing too outrageous for Star Wars.  In fact, the cutscenes are phenomenal, and are basically movie-quality.  It wasn't anything earth-shattering like Bioshock, but it had it's own little tale to tell, and did so adequately.As far as gameplay is concerned, it can get repetitive, but as your powers increase, you do feel quite powerful towards the end of the game.  I thought they greatly improved the mechanics of force-throw from the first.  There were some jumping/platforming elements that offered just the right amount of challenge without too many cheap deaths.  Everything seemed to work well in regards to button response time and camera angles.The only glitch I encountered in the game was during the final fight with Vader.  I was at a point that was supposed to trigger a button-pressing sequence, but because of my location on the platform when this began, the game continued to switch camera angles, stuck between a cinematic and actual gameplay. I had to reset and start over at the beginning of the level, which probably wasted about 30 minutes of my time.  No big deal when the game's as short as it is.There are some mini-game time trial sort of things if you're into that.  Completing them unlocks alternate costumes and some comic-book like videos of backstory.  I think there's about 10 of them, and I completed them all in about an hour.So to summarize, this game is probably not worth $60, but it will entertain you for an evening.  And if you're a fan of Star Wars, it does a good job recreating the feel of the films (whether that's good or bad).  It's a nice little simple game that doesn't require a lot of thought.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2010"}

As Commander Shepard, you must assemble the galaxy's deadliest team and stop the most terrifying threat humanity has ever faced.","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Quite a Ride","reviewText":"I never played Mass Effect 1 but I have been waiting for the sequel to come to the PlayStation for a long time. I almost bought a 360 for it but I'm glad I held out. The PS3 version is by most people's account the best version of the game. I agree graphically that it is a bit sharper and you get the DLC that other platforms had to pay for at not cost. The game itself is an exciting RPG/3rd Person Shooter. When you start you can choose from a few classes. Some are excellent at biotic powers and some are just for shooting things the old fashion way.I chose soldier and because of that I had very little biotic powers. I could slow down time but that's about it. The biotic side of the game for me was my crew mates. You level them up along with yourself when you gain squad points. As you add skill points to a skill it becomes stronger until you reach full potential then you have two versions of it to choose from. The gunplay in the beginning of the game was a little boring but it became really fun once you were able to upgrade and get new versions of your weapons. That added a lot of depth to the combat. There are also different types of ammo to use that increases your weapons attributes. Nothing is more satisfying then freezing an enemy an watching them implode.Now onto the story. In my opinion the first few missions were very dry. They were sort of easing you into the story because later on it really picks up as you have to gain the trust of your team. Once you assemble your team you have to do missions for them so that they are loyal to your cause. These missions are very interesting and give great insight into their backstories. These loyalty missions take up a major chunk of your game-time so it's good that they are backed with great stories and varied environments. The main story is about saving humanity. It's a little weak at times, but the last two hours of the campaign are epic as you are left with some major decisions that will surely ripple into Mass Effect 3.Voice acting in the game can be a little spotty. Sometimes you are blown away by there emotion and other times they sound more like computers. Shepard especially sounds terrible at times but the surrounding characters keep you from falling asleep. Even Yvonne Strahovski who is a terrific actress sounds like an ice queen from time to time. It's almost like the actors did not have all the backstory to the lines and their performances were weak because of it. This would not normally be a big problem but because of the huge amount of dialogue it does wear on you.The graphics in this game are pretty good. Though some lower resolution textures do appear from time to time they do not distract from how good this game looks. There is some frame rate drops but it only seems to occur on the Normandy. So at least it's not during missions, and it never leads to games crashes.The combat is very traditional. There is cover everywhere for both you and your enemy. You then lean out of cover aim down your sights and pick them off one by one. You can carry five weapons at a time. You always have a pistol,shotgun,assault rifle,sniper rifle, and a heavy weapon slot. You have different versions of every weapon and you choose your load out before a mission starts. You can have two crew members with you on a mission. You enter a targeting state where you choose a target for them to soot biotics at. This is where there special skills come in. Every character has different skills and you will go back and forth on who is your favorite. They will also use it without you telling them to but you have better decision making then they do. The AI is not as smart as I wish they were. Both your teammates and enemies are stupid enough to just stand there and get shot.This game has a very long campaign (which includes all loyalty missions) at 28 or so hours. I'm sure you could stretch it out by doing more side missions, but that's how long it took me to complete all the story missions and a few side quests. The game also is necessary for those that are planning to buy Mass Effect 3 as your choices will transfer over to that game. So those that die in this will be dead in the third game. I'm glad that I only lost one crew member and someone I didn't like at that. Make sure that you choose your team roles carefully in the final mission.Overall Mass Effect 2 is a fun experience. That once you get past the first few hours is a very enjoyable ride. It does have some trouble in voice acting from time to time, but the monotone dialogue is nothing that distracting. Also you definitely get your moneys worth at a 30 hour campaign excluding the DLC which I haven't tried yet. If your on the fence about this game pick it up it is an enjoyable experience that you will be happy you signed up for.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

I thought the story was boring, the characters irritating, the cinematics overblown and the gameplay lacking in originality. Due to that I dreaded playing The last of us.So why did I like TLOU:Balance & pacing - a good balance of gameplay, exploration and cinematics. The big moments mean more because there are enough slow quiet ones. There are segments in the game that are much stronger than others but I have a feeling that will vary player to player. I didn't time the playthrough, but the game length felt appropriate for the story and didn't have much padding.gameplay-  I love survival horror games and this one mixes some of the flashlight exploration elements of silent hill (methodically exploring abandoned areas) with stealth like Metal gear.The \"puzzles\" are lacking, but what there is maintains a sense of realism (find a ladder to get across a gap.)The stealth is well done, even though it is not heavily varied.  Being seen puts you instantly into a fight or flight situation and you are unlikely to survive.In the spirit of survival Horror you cannot hold too many bullets at once and you will find yourself in a pinch if you engage in gun battles are every turn.There are some character upgrades in the game as well as crafting, but both are fairly shallow and should not entice nor deter any player.Characters/story - not all the characters are great, but they carry the story fairly well. I'm not going to say this is the greatest story ever told because it's far from it.  It is compelling enough and achieves what it's trying to for the most part. It is clear the developers and actors took much care in crafting an experience for the player and regardless of my personal lack of attachment, it is phenomenally executed.Exploration - Mostly linear; however every area is basically like a small sandbox for the player to explore.  There are secrets to find and just enough options to keep stealth movement interesting. I would have liked to see a few larger areas, but for the sake of story pacing perhaps what they delivered was fine.graphics - excellent.In conclusion: as a player who does not appreciate spectacle over gameplay I still liked TLOU. It delivered an incredible overall presentation while providing enough gameplay elements that were interesting to survival horror and stealth fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GF72","description":"","reviewerName":"Xavier 7","summary":"WOW, this is a paradigm shift in HD re-makes.","reviewText":"Nintendo has once again innovated.  I've always loved the concept of HD re-makes and have been quite content purchasing games I played years ago in order to experience them in a higher resolution for today's televisions.  It prolongs the life and legacy of great games.Well, rather than just bumping up the resolution for an undoubted GameCube classic, Nintendo has re-visited the flooded version of Hyrule and made some very minor but very smart tweaks to a great game.  It's funny, as I played this title for the first time in 2010 (it was in my backlog since 2003, yikes....) I thought that an HD remake would be quite a feat for such a wonderful and vibrant looking game.  Obviously Nintendo thought the same.  While I won't go into the particulars of the game itself, as reviews have existed for it since 2003, I'll take a brief look at what is new:RESOLUTION: Wind Waker now runs at 1080p, 60 frames per second, and has never looked better.  The game is absolutely gorgeous and its once controversial art style has really worked to its benefit to keep it timeless looking.  The lighting system has been redone and its better than ever, in my opinion.  The sun cascades down on characters in a way that looks quite realistic, even for a cartoon-like game, and dungeons are appropriately gloomy.  Beautiful.SAILING:  The bane of the original Wind Waker was the constant need to reposition the wind in order to sail the vast ocean world of Hyrule.  It was a pain and could become quite annoying.  Nintendo has fixed that with the introduction of the swift sail, which can be obtained at the auction house.  Once equipped, sailing is smooth and effortless...as it should have been all along.  Sure, it defies logic but it great enhances the gameplay.  Plus, this is Zelda!  Nothing wrong with a magical sail....FETCH QUEST: Another gripe of the original Wind Waker was a nasty fetch quest involving maps, tons of rupees, and the Triforce.  This has been greatly streamlined allowing one to go after all the Triforce shards immediately circumventing the procurement of about 3000 rupees and the associated maps plus Tingle's involvement.One feature I am not crazy about in this new iteration of the Wind Waker is the Tingle Bottle, which replaces the Tingle Tuner feature of the GCN original which needed a Game Boy Advance linked to the system.  To be frank, the Tingle Bottle is just in-game Miiverse functionality.  And rather than tips and hints, ala ZombiU or Demon's Souls, players are free to type or write at their leisure.  As a result, the majority of Tingle Bottles are merely spam and self portraits of Link.  Useless. I wish that either Nintendo would have copied the ZombiU and Demon's Souls in-game tip system or reintroduced the Tingle Tuner using the gamepad sans GBA.  Oh well, it really doesn't detract from the experience, it's just...there.All in all, fantastic re-release.  This is the way it SHOULD be done and I am looking forward to other HD re-releases from the Big N.  (Please, please, please Super Mario Sunshine!  Please!)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003GSZ9ZE","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr. Kirk J. Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Fear Alma","reviewText":"The NPC AI of the original FEAR had some of the greatest ever seen in modern FPS. This has strangely been forgotten about over the years. In 2011, FEAR 3 teases a fraction of that AI and actually surprises gamers. We&#8217;re still not at 100%, and this raises the issue of why us gamers are more fascinated with fancy bump-mapping than playing with enemies who will out-do you by flanking and working together to cave your skull in.If you&#8217;re a fan of horror and FPS, FEAR 3 is a must-buy. It does not reach the high standard of 2005&#8217;s product however, but is probably better paced and executed than FEAR 2. Visuals range from great to poor; high-res to blotchy and watered down textures. There are lots of things happening all the time in FEAR 3, so when you&#8217;re not being attacked and engaged in battle, the supernatural is at work. It&#8217;s a very &#8220;busy&#8221; campaign.Score and ranking up plays a subtle importance. More points are awarded for using different weapons and methods. Even well-hidden dolls of Amy can be sought out for bonus points. It all feels very strange , even in a game which relies on strangeness; but feels oddly compelling. It encourages a repeat play with a second character, Fettel. Fettel is a psychic who has only melee weapons but can possess other NPC&#8217;s to progress through the same campaign, this gives the player around 12 hours of gameplay in total. Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t seem overly long or tiring.Sound plays an important role here, even more so than the visuals. The score dictates the mood, and keeps you on the edge - or calms you right down, before jump-scaring you out of your comfort zone once again.Two missions make the player believe he's playing Left 4 Dead 2 - yes really. We&#8217;ve gone from the dark, weird and elaborate atmospheric setting to a silly, over-the-top black comedic one with (yes!) zombies who charge you with suicide vests. This experience feels disjointed and not part of FEAR. Thankfully, this is short lived - the game returns to its dark roots before long.There&#8217;s moments of frantic action which become tough and frustrating, more notably a few sections on the rooftops. Soldiers come in thick and fast, swearing like dockers as they become annihilated by the player in slow motion. There&#8217;s a solid boss battle or two to be had, and a section where you&#8217;re attacked by infinitely respawning demon dogs as you panic to close a shutter down (which, supposedly protects you from the fierce power of the dogs pounces).I admire FEAR 3 because it&#8217;s a title many people avoided, but I actually really enjoyed it for what it was. It is dark, grim, depressing and soul-sucking title which horror buffs will love.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"Great game but difficulty set way too high","reviewText":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist gives you three options for playing and awards you depending on your playing style.  There is Ghost which is non-lethal stealth, Assault which is fairly much full bore rush in and shoot anything that moves and then there's Panther which is a middle ground between the two extremes.  I think most people will play the Panther style game though the options are there for you to choose whichever style you wish.The basic premise of the game is that you have various missions to complete.  Each mission gives you cash which you can then use to upgrade the equipment you carry, the combat suit you wear or the plane you use as a home base.Graphics wise the game is very good with realistic movement of the characters and details set into the backgrounds.Sound is also very good.  You know it's good when you don't really pay attention to it, it kind of just fades into the background  but then you hear footsteps and you are instantly on guard trying to find who's making them and where they are.Gameplay is where its at however.  This game, in my opinion, is not really designed for a single player. It's more designed for co-op play (there are certain missions that are co-op only).  Co-op mode splits the screen vertically with one player on each side and the graphics scaled appropriately and it works well. You do lose you radar (an option that you can buy for your aircraft) which is a bit of a pain but otherwise the game works very well in co-op.  The major thing I would have to say about the gameplay however is that I think they've set it too hard.  Some missions my friend and I have found extremely difficult to complete, even in co-op mode which should give you a better chance, when the level setting is supposed to be on Rookie.  It's certainly a very hard game and not one for people who like casual shooters (ala Far Cry 3).One other thing worth saying is that the game comes on two DVDs (Xbox).  The second DVD basically consists of the hi-res graphics package.  Although it's worth installing this for better graphics (doesn't slow the game down in any way once installed), it does take about 30 minutes just to install and unpack this.Overall there is a lot to like about this game, lots of options and ways to play it and even a re-play factor in that you can go back and play the game a different way once you complete it, just beware of the difficulty level.Graphics : 8/10Sound : 9/10Gameplay : 6/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2013"}

Presenting this scenario as a powerful and realistically crafted alternate history, Turning Point&#xBF;: Fall of Liberty delivers an explosive First Person Shooter experience in a world where famous real world locations appear startlingly different under Nazi occupation.","reviewerName":"Z. A. Recht","summary":"Turning Point","reviewText":"Turning Point: Fall of Liberty reminded me on many levels of the venerable Xbox title Freedom Fighters. At least, it reminded me of it while I was reading the box at Gamestop.Freedom Fighters was an excellent game. I still play it now and then when I hook up my Xbox. Turning Point, unfortunately, is not an excellent game.It does get points for being generally fun to play. Not amazing to play, but fun. Shooting Nazis never does get old. This is a rental game, I'd say. If you rent it for a couple of days, you'll have just enough fun to justify the five or so bucks you spent. If you pay full price, on the other hand, prepare yourself for severe Buyer's Remorse pangs.My first warning that I was getting a half-baked product was in the opening video. It was stiff, disjointed, lacked any music, and seemed to cut itself off in mid-stride. Worse, it failed to do anything more than serve as a 30-second exposition. \"Nazis are invading. Oh, the humanity! New York is under attack!\" That's about it.There is no real story. Well, there is, but you never feel invested in it. The lackluster, half-hearted videos between levels that are supposed to drive the story onward serve as little more than fluffy filler, lacking pretty much any sense of timing and drama. Apparently, you're a regular Joe named Carson, who is a high-rise riveter in New York.Wait, just a second. I have to interject something. What is it about games, movies, and books all being set in New York? And why do we have to see the same landmarks every time? Are there no other cities on the East Coast where we could set a game? C'mon, throw in Boston or Baltimore or something. Anything. I'm sick to death of New York city being the setting of 90% of games set in contemporary times.Ok, now we can get back on track. The setup goes like this: as this is an alternate timeline, Winston Churchill did not survive to lead England during WWII. Britain falls, and the Axis is victorious in Europe. Now, a few years later (they never say, but it couldn't be later than 1946 or 47. That's actually a pretty decent setting--lots of potential. Lots and lots of wasted potential, actually. So you're Carson, a regular civilian, and you're fighting for your life against the Nazi invaders, who are falling like snowflakes out of the sky all over New York.The first level scored points with me because of its frenetic pace and heart-pumping explosions. Then I got my first weapon--the MP50 (an upgraded MP40) and went to work. Once I hit combat the negatives in this game really started to stick out.To keep things simple, here's a nice bullet list of the things that frustrated me about the title:--Apparently, helmets want nothing to do with corpses. Shoot an enemy in the leg, and his helmet will take off and fly across the room. This happens to every enemy with a helmet. (Admittedly, it's handy to know when they're really dead, and not just crouching, but it's a head-scratcher.) Why do the helmets spontaneously animate?--The enemies will be in the same place every time you play through, so mastery of this game is little more than trial and error, learning where the big threats are. I had thought we'd moved past this kind of predictability.--For a while I thought some Nazis hated each other, because they would shoot at one another. Then I realized that they weren't. They were all shooting at me, but for some reason some Nazis stand facing away from me while attacking. Others fire their rifles off into the sky for no apparent reason. These bullets DO hit you, somehow, no matter where the enemy seems to be aiming. They must be magical.--Sometimes enemies will be standing right next to a grenade you've thrown and not die when it explodes.--Nazis \"appear.\" For instance, you can clear a room, move on to the next one, clear it, and--BOOM, you're dead. How? Well, a Nazi materialized in the room you'd just left and shot you in the back with a combat shotgun. Where did he come from? No one knows. Maybe through a vent in the ceiling or something.--Bodies vanish. This is something else I thought we had moved past.--Despite \"being a member of the Resistance,\" as the game tells you, it would be far more accurate to say that YOU ARE THE RESISTANCE. Your allies do show up from time to time, but they are always waxed in short order and you're back to a solo show. They don't do much in the way of help, anyway. It's pretty much all on you.--Carson, the main character, wears his construction clothes throughout the entire campaign. What, he couldn't find anything more appropriate for combat than jeans and a bright orange shirt that practically screams \"HERE I AM SHOOT ME NOW.\"--Oh, and Carson's weapons are so high-tech that they become invisible when you climb a ladder or inch across a ledge. (I'm not sure what the practical use of an invisible rifle is, but...meh.)  You might be carrying a Panzerschlag and a Fallschirmjaeger carbine, but they just aren't there. Would it have been too hard to show the weapons slung on his back, or something? Of course, the second you complete the climb, the weapons reappear.--There are serious clipping errors. Enemies will fire through vehicles in certain places and hit you. If you return fire, it will ricochet. It's a one-way deal, and you're on the butt-end of it.--The HUD tells you which direction you're being attacked from. Or at least that's what it is supposed to do. The most recent example--still fresh in my mind--is when a Nazi fired a rocket at me. It passed by me on the right, hit a wall, and my HUD flashed red--telling me that I was being attacked from the left. So I spun left. No one there. Another rocket comes into the hallway. Now I'm being attacked from straight ahead, even though I'm looking down a completely empty hallway. Most of the time the HUD gets it right, but every so often...beware! BEWARE!--Sometimes you'll find crates of grenades--a blessed relief, since you (in this example) don't have any left. So you walk over to get them and...well...you can't. It just doesn't let you pick them up. But the next time you come through that level, try it again. Sometimes it'll let you take them. Sometimes it won't. I have no idea how it decides whether or not to hand 'em over.--Similarly, sometimes enemies, when killed, will drop their weapons half-under a table or something. When this happens, they're out of reach--even if you're standing on half the weapon, you can't get the ammo from it. In parts of the game where ammo is scarce, this can lead to your premature death.--Only a bare amount of effort was put into some of these encounters and animations. Example: you come across a Nazi during his daily constitutional (i.e., a nice satisfying dump). What does he do? He looks up, surprised, and raises his arms to surrender. Normally at this point I'd just kill him, but on my second time through, I wanted to see what he would do if I just stared at him. Turns out, he just repeats that same animation over and over. Looks down. Looks up. Surprised. Hands up. Looks down. Looks up. Surprised. Hands up. And so on. This particular Nazi either has the attention span of a goldfish, or the developers were too lazy to come up with anything better than a six-second looping animation. (I'm guessing the latter.)AND FINALLY--This bullet point must be stressed, hence its separation from the list. The MP-50. What. The. Heck. Is the matter with it? 90% of the time, it works just fine. Other times, though, I'll step out into a hall, aim, and...nothing. It just doesn't fire. But that's not all. No. When this happens, the game also locks you into the MP-50 so you cannot switch weapons, you cannot reload, you cannot even get out of aiming mode. The one \"cure\" seems to be to throw a grenade, if you have one. I've been killed several dozen times because my MP-50 randomly decided to lock up and refuse to function. This happens often enough--about 1 in 10 aims--that you really come to hate the MP-50 and will refuse to use it. This problem--locking in the aim and locking the controls up--only ever seems to happen with the MP-50. It's never happened with another weapon. This is a very prominent bug as the MP-50 is probably the most common weapon in the game. It's the kind of easily noticeable glitch that only a half-baked attempt at a game would allow to stand. It's also the most frustrating out of any of the things I've listed, because it basically reduces you to a walking target (you can't sprint while aiming) until you manage to shake it loose by pushing every button on your controller randomly. The MP-50 will also occasionally lock up even when you're firing from the hip (not in aiming mode, in other words.) It's not as bad when this happens, because the weapon will do this up-down hiccup animation, and then be able to fire again. Still annoying, though.Finally, though this game's settings and storyline are rather epic, the entire presentation feels flat and lifeless. There is no investment in the story. There's barely a story. And some of it I just don't understand.If you found out that Germans were building an A-Bomb in London and you knew where in London their lab was, but you're in America, what do you do? Well, if it were me I'd get on whatever means of commo I had to tell the Brits what I knew, so they could do something about.Not in Turning Point. No. In this game, the fate of New York City (again with that f-ing town) rests on your shoulders. Carson. The construction worker. They have this guy parachuting in like he's qualified Airborne, sent in solo against a heavily armed German garrison in the Tower of London. It just doesn't make sense. What kind of a Resistance sends over ONE PLANE carrying ONE GUY who HAS NO MILITARY TRAINING to save the world? A really stupid Resistance, that's what.I was hoping for a scene like Freedom Fighters had near the end--that dramatic, blood-pumping scene where the ships and fighters are advancing across the ice toward Governor's Island, and that amazing music is playing, and you truly feel like the leader of a Resistance. Dozens of your fellow Freedom Fighters assault alongside you, and you really feel like you're in a battle.Instead I got one plane, and one guy parachuting in like he's freakin' John Rambo with a grudge. Remember, Carson is a construction worker. He's not Delta Force. But apparently, the Resistance, in their infinite wisdom, chose to send Carson over trained soldiers. There wasn't any drama to accompany this daring assault, either.So, let's review. Utter lack of an interesting story (but an *outstanding* concept). With a bare amount of extra effort, they could have turned it into something amazing. Add some more voice actors. Write some scripts. Treat your gamers to 3-5 minute cutscenes where you get to know your fellow Freedom Fighters. Toss in extra background info to set up the next challenge and you'll have an epic story of Resistance vs. Nazis. C'est la vie.Numerous game glitches like clipping errors and Head's Up Display screwups abound. Those grenades that land at an enemy's feet and don't kill him. MP-50s that lock up your entire controller and lead to your death many, many times. And so on. Those things. Yeah. I guess they just skipped that whole quality assurance portion of development. You know, where they work out the bugs? They must have just shelved that step.Okay, I think I've about covered all of the things in Turning Point that bothered me and detracted from the overall experience.But you might notice I rated it two stars, and not one. Why, you might ask, given that you just listed a million and one reasons why no one should play it?Well, 'cause it's not a non-functional, broken game like Two Worlds or Neverwinter Nights 2. Those two were so bad on so many levels that they were quite literally unplayable. Turning Point is NOT among that drek. No, in fact, alongside those previously mentioned titles, Turning Point starts to seem like Call of Duty.Let's face it. Shooting Nazis is fun, even if you're doing it in a glitchy, slow-paced predictable sub-par shooter. And the environmental kills are fun, too. Lots of fun. Imagine kicking a Nazi in his jewels, then shoving him into a furnace and shutting the door on him. Or--in another instance, kicking the jack out from under a truck a Nazi is working on, crushing him. See? Fun!So it's not ALL bad. It's just MOSTLY bad.The Bottom Line: If you like FPS, and/or hate Nazis, this is worth a two-night rental. My recommendation is *not* to purchase it. It's not worth more than the five or six bucks you pay out at the rental store.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2009"}

That would be awful for the consumer.2) Turning 'owning' into leasing\"Tying games to some sort of server for activation is bad enough, but making them DEPENDENT on a server is horrible for the consumer. It takes away our rights (to play the game we paid for on our terms) and creates a system whereby you are simply LEASING a game. If at some point UBI Soft decides to take down their servers, you lose your game. They can take away your rights to play the game at any point in the future if they decided to. They have you by the cajones! If you give into this model, expect to never own any digital medium again; the makers of games, producers of music, and distributors of movies would love to see our current model of OWNING a physical copy of your game \\ album \\ movie replaced with a system where you only own the 'right' to access \\ play that medium. It's their wet-dream to turn the current system of ownership on its head so they can re-sell you things endlessly as well as take them away from you at their discretion. As a consumer, it's important that we speak out against this by supporting DRM free games (Mass Effect II, Dragon Age, Fallout III, etc...) and DRM free music (buy it from Amazon!) and REFUSE to buy this junk with built in limitations and restrictions that SERVE NO PURPOSE.3) Making games dependent on 'phoning home' means you're at the total mercy of UBI Soft (or whomever runs their servers)If their servers are down, you lose access to your game. If their servers are overtaxed, you may experience problems connecting to your game. Think that isn't likely? Think again. Currently (03/09/2010) the servers have been down for the last 12 hours or so, creating chaos for all those who expected to be able to fire up Assassin's Creed. It doesn't even matter if UBI Soft is malevolent or not; if your service provider has a bad week you may be out of luck. If there is a storm in your area, you could end up out of luck for weeks (this happened to me when a tree knocked out my cable internet for 9 says straight--I thought I was going to die). You're screwed if your internet, their servers, or anything along the line between the two goes down.4) DRM is pointless (and this online restriction is one of it's worst forms!)Want to pirate games? It's tragically easy these days. Even more tragic is that DRM, supposedly designed to prevent piracy, is a total failure at actually accomplishing that. Want proof? Google \"Spore + DRM + Piracy\" and see what you come up with. I'll give you a hint: Spore was pirated BEFORE it was officially released. Many games are unto torrent sites well before their release date. The worst part of this is that the pirated versions are in almost all cases SUPERIOR to the DRM infested versions: they don't contain the invasive, crippling, and destructive DRM that past games have been ruined by (Bioshock, Mass Effect I, Spore, etc...). I am NOT ADVOCATING PIRACY. I think you should buy the games you want to play. I am advocating NOT BUYING games that violate your basic consumer rights (right to resell your game, right to play your game WHENEVER you want to without restrictions). If a game limits those rights, I say skip it entirely. Because UBI SOFT are morons doesn't give anyone the right to steal. As your Mom (or at least mine) used to say: two wrongs don't make a right!I am not opposed to simple DRM schemes (disk check, or even Steam which has established very good rapport gamers by being both consistent, fair, and show a long track record of stability). I am totally opposed to anything that PREVENTS ME FROM PLAYING THE GAME that I paid money for. I don't want to see this standardized (and I don't think it will be) and so it's time to take action NOW and refuse to buy this garbage.The bottom line is DRM is not and has never been about preventing piracy. It's about CONTROL. Control over you and how you are able to play the very game you paid your money for. It's about wrenching ownership away from the consumer and replacing it with something much lesser: rental \\ leasing. Don't let them do that to you.Final Thoughts:UBI SOFT and those like them have got to be taught a lesson. The only way to get heard by these huge companies is by hitting them where it hurts: their pocketbook. Refuse to buy this game or games like it that infringe on your rights. Tell your friends not to buy it. Write reviews that inform people about the risks of doing so. That's how you get things to change. To the inevitable trolls who will tell me that DRM should just be 'given in to,' I'd like to point out that currently game makers are MOVING AWAY from DRM schemes. The reason is because of the backlash against pointless restrictions by those like myself who are unwilling to sit around and watch PC gaming be ruined by greedy scumbags. It's because of grassroots action (Spore for example) that the tide has turned and that DRM is now much less common than it was a year ago. Top shelf games are being released DRM free. You know what? I've bought all of them and recommend you do the same. Let's all give our money to the makers of games that RESPECT us--after all, WE ARE THE CUSTOMERS. Enough said.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Fully Featured Mouse Coupled with Easy to Use Software","reviewText":"In about a month of using the SteelSeries Sensei on my main gaming/productivity custom PC it has quickly become my favorite mouse in quite some time. The Sensei replaced a wired SteelSeries Kana gaming mouse that I've been using for the past several years and is light years ahead of that mouse.--------------------DESIGN:The Sensei is pretty straightforward as far as gaming mice go. Aesthetically the Sensei likely has more in common with far cheaper run-of-the-mill mice than some of the more radical designs by companies like Corsair, Logitech, and Razr. This can be a good or bad thing depending on the user. My current build is more subdued and I find that the subdued looks of the Sensei readily compliment my components including the Corsair K95 keyboard.However, the biggest drawback here is that some of the ergonomic features in other mice (G700 or M65) are absent in the Sensei. The biggest absent feature would probably be the thumb-rest those two mice feature but also the overall shape which is probably a bit more refined than the traditional shape of the Sensei.The Sensei consists of two major components: the base (which doubles as the power charger) and the mouse itself. The base is connected to the PC via an included USB cable. The Sensei is Plug-and-Play compliant, however, I strongly recommend downloading the SteelSeries Engine 3 software from SteelSeries' website: [...]SteelSeries Engine 3 is what really sets the Sensei off from just being another neat looking peripheral. Engine 3 detects any SteelSeries components and displays them in a neatly organized library under the 'My Gear' tab. Clicking on the Sensei a new window opens displaying the mouse and all of the adjustments that can be made. There is a lot of customization that can be done and I'll do my best to capture that in the next section ('software')The mouse buttons are well designed. The left and right main buttons sit flush with the mouse surface. The scroll-wheel features a nice rubber-type of surface coating and increment-evident scrolling. Four button are built into the sides of the mouse with two on each side.--------------------SOFTWARE:As I said before there is a lot of customization to the Sensei using the Engine 3 software. CPI (or Count's Per Inch) as opposed to what most companies call it - DPI (or Dots Per Inch) is the most basic adjustment. Two CPI profiles can be saved and toggled with the click of mouse button 8 (top-most button on the mouse). This is great for switching CPI on the fly between regular use and say a specific game where more CPI is advantageous.Each button is assigned a section in Engine 3 and is readily programmable using the included macro editor tool.Another neat feature is the illumination customization options to both the base/charger and the mouse itself. These can be customized using a standard RGB configuration tool or specific color codes. Out of the box the base is assigned to display the battery status profile (green = fully charged, amber = half-charged and so on). The color of the SteelSeries logo on the mouse itself can be changed independently of the base. Illumination can also be completely switch off.Other adjustments:Acceleration/Deceleration: Consider this a fine tuning adjustment beyond the assigned CPI profile. Based on a users input (quick or slow movements) you can further customize the mouse CPI for additional sensitivity.Lift Distance: You can customize how far you can lift your mouse from your surface and still register movement.Angle Snapping: This setting will help straighten lines (left or right movement).Polling Rate: How often (in Hz) the mouse and computer communicate. A setting of 1000 will set the polling rate at every 1 millisecond.--------------------USE:I've been using the Sensei for about a month and absolutely love this mouse. Even my wife who's been occasionally using my PC (for the dual monitors) for an online study program loved the mouse. I've used the Sensei in everything from shooters (Battlefield 4) to playing slower paced games (Skyrim) and Diablo 3 and the performance is outstanding. Being able to switch to custom macro setups and CPI is a breeze.I'm also happy to say that after some long play sessions my hand did not feel fatigued.--------------------THE GOOD:(+) The Sensei is well built and coupled with the Engine 3 software is really quite a powerful mouse and perfect for those that want a high degree of customization(+) Excellent styling and aesthetics(+) Perfect for gaming but also not so far out there that it's difficult to use in everyday applications(+) Excellent battery life even if left off the charger for a night or two(+) Can be used in wired mode if so desired (and includes a locking mechanism to keep the mini-USB cable locked to the mouse--------------------WHAT COULD BE BETTER:(-) The price point for this device is sky-high(-) The weight of the mouse is good (120 grams) but no option to add/remove weight like in other premium mice--------------------CONCLUSION:If you're looking for a spectacular performing wireless gaming mouse that you wouldn't be embarrassed to use outside of your gaming room and price is no object then definitely check out the Sensei. Unfortunately the price will probably keep most folks away from this product. Otherwise this is an easy recommendation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"[Scream of Rage]","reviewText":"I hate this game.  I cannot express in words the degree to which I hate this game.  If this game were a person, I could run it down with my car and not feel the slightest twinge of ethical concern.  I hate it so much it leads me to forget things that I've been trained to know are right and good and simply shout expletives in its general direction for the next few hundred words.  Fortunately for this game, I'm not quite that much of a jerk.Imagine that you took Test Drive: Unlimited and the last decent Burnout title, smashed them together, and then carefully excised everything even remotely fun from the mangled monstrosity that resulted.  There, my friend, you have found Burnout Paradise.  Everything about Revenge that entertained me enough to keep from snapping the disc in half and tossing it into traffic has been removed from this game, and I can't in good conscience recommend it to anybody.One thing that I can't fault the game for is its appearance, which is certainly a step up.  The game is definitely beautiful.  Driving through Paradise City, you get to see a lot of different environments, and every single one springs off the screen and directly into your face like some kind of carnivorous monster.  When it comes to useful visuals for the gameplay, however, there's some problems with the level of detail included in the game's environments - specifically, I have a hard time figuring out where the bloody road turns in some locations.  This is worst in the downtown areas and best on the outskirts of town, but ANY time I miss my turn because it doesn't look like there's a road there at all, somebody needs to yell at the graphical designer.The game sound is mostly unremarkable, so let's not.  It won't make you physically angry, and I guess that you might like the soundtrack (I personally loathed roughly 80% of the included music, but that's not atypical for me with an EA title), but it's not going to pleasure you sexually or make you reevaluate your life.My problems with the game all have to do with the gameplay, or, rather, the lack thereof.  If you've played Revenge, you might remember fun modes like Traffic Attack or Crash Mode.  Those were pretty terrific, right?  Well, they're gone.  Not only are they gone, but some of the fundamental rules that you would have learned from prior games in the series have been utterly invalidated.  The big one is the rules on What Kind of Traffic Causes Crashes.  In Revenge, they had a simple rule - if you could see headlights or it was a truck, you would wreck into it.  Otherwise, you knock it to the side.  I don't know what they replaced that with, but I DO know that in the first hour I played, I wrecked against no fewer than ten cars stopped at intersections, smaller than me, facing away from me.Of greater concern is the bald stupidity that comes from building an open world street racing game in a world that nobody has ever been to.  If this game were set in San Marcos, TX, I'd be all over it because I KNOW WHERE THOSE STREETS ARE.  I don't know where anything is in this game and the game doesn't do anything at all to help you learn.  I'm faced, as a newcomer, with the choice between spending ten hours losing hard just to learn where everything is (not fun) and just plain losing because I don't know where anything is (also not fun).  Closed tracks are fun because it's hard to get lost.  I got lost in three of my first ten events in this game and ended up on practically the wrong side of town.  That's bad.I could go on for a thousand more words, but I won't belabor my point too heavily.  The game has been well received, and maybe it's just me.  Maybe people who like \"open world\" style games will find something to enjoy here.  I didn't.  I found Test Drive to be a better implementation of the idea.  With limited modes that mostly feel identical, no Crash mode (seriously - Crash mode was a puzzle game and that was FUN; Showtime is entirely random), undirected gameplay, poor layout, and any number of other problems, this game would have to come with chocolate cake and my own personal supermodel before I would even consider recommending it.  There's a lot of potential for an open world Burnout game, but this isn't the game to realize that dream.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2008"}

The game is just that good and for only thirty dollars it's a bargain. While Resident Evil 4 was released almost three years ago, the graphics are better than a lot of current Wii titles. The Wii remote a nunchuck fit in perfectly to the style of the game and it's hard to go back to playing it on Gamecube after playing this gem on the Wii. Resident Evil games have always been difficult so if you're not a fan of single player survival games, this one will not please you at all. If you're looking for some great single player horror and the Wii, and there's not a lot of that on the Wii right now, look no further. Resident Evil 4 is the game for you.Resident Evil 4 brings back Leon S. Kennedy back into the fold after his adventures in Resident Evil 2. Also back is Ada Wong though only in a few select parts. Leon is recruited by the Secret Service to rescue the president's daughter Ashley Graham. Her kidnap was in Europe and the whole thing is made even weirder by the fact that our favorite zombie friends are back for more. Actually they're not quite zombies but a new type of zombie called Los Ganados. The Los Ganados are faster and smarter than ever before and can be a big problem if you run out of bullets. Remember this is Resident Evil, every shot counts.The game play of Resident Evil 4 is obviously changed by the fact that it's on the Wii, thought that ends up working to your advantage. The most obvious change is that you use the Wii remote to point and shoot at your enemies. You use the nunchuck to walk around and if you're out of bullets or don't want to waste them you can pull out your knife and knife the zombies. This aspect of the game turns out to be one of the best parts and I hate a lot of fun gunning down the zombies and knifing them at point blank range. This really is a new experience for Resident Evil.Wii takes one of the best games ever made and adds its own personal touch to it, giving us a refreshing new look at an already great game. The controls are really fun to use and can you really beat the price. For what was labeled as a port to the Wii, the graphics are really improved for the Playstation 2 and Gamecube versions. For Wii owners looking for new games Resident Evil 4 along with Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles are must haves for any mature Wii owner. Seriously for thirty bucks it's hard to pass up on this unbelievable game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2007"}

I remember as a kid how I was so close to beating the game and had to turn the game in to Blockbuster. I would have to wait for 10 years before I could get it on the Wii and then beat it only not getting lost in the desert or freaking out during chapter 3 or crying on how bad my coordination in chapter 6 was.The original Paper Mario has a generic plot. Bowser steals the Star Rod from the 7 Star Spirits and traps them into cards (note these cards will show up in Mario Party 5 as your guide). He then defeats Mario with his strength and kicks Mario out of the castle after raising it into space. Mario near death ends up being given enough power to survive and ends up in the Goomba Village. Here is where his journey begins as he teams up with a Goomba named Goombario as they travel to the Star Summit where they figure out their mission and then travel throughout the Mushroom Kingdom defeating Bowser's henceman, saving the star spirits and gathering new allies to assist you on the world map.I like how Paper Mario is because this is one of the few games where you can explore the entire Mushroom Kingdom. You get a feel of the Mario world better than the main series titles if only because you can see sub sections of the world. The fact that the Goombas, Koopa Troopas and the Boos have their own place in the Mushroom Kingdom and having distinct personalities from Bowser's henchman shows that the stereotype of all the troops at this point aren't evil.Anyways, this game is an RPG game, not a platformer meaning Mario and his allies take turns attacking the enemy (which most run into you to start a battle or vise versa). You have many options in the game. You can jump on the opponent, use a hammer, use the items and later on in the game, use the star spirits to attack. Your partner can assist you and depending on your partner depends on their ability. Goombario for example is used to tattle enemies and show the health bar while Watt (the best partner in the game) is used to penetrate the opponents defense with relative ease. Outside of battle, their abilities are essential as you'll need them to complete dungeons and find hidden items. Kooper for example is used to hit switches you can't hit while Bow is used to hide your presence from enemies (and this is essential in chapter 3 with the search lights after you).This game I feel was the hardest of the bunch mainly because it was hard to navigate in chapter 2, and in chapter 6, it was a huge difficulty spike with no warning. I mean, Paper Mario is one of the easier RPG games I played, so I don't see how people could have a problem playing it now (but back then it was difficult).Overall, pick this game up on the Wii Ware. I think its only 1000 points but you're getting more than 10 hours for this game (like 20-30 hours to get everything like I did), so have fun with the original classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}

Surprisingly, PM is only the 2nd true sequel of Mario on theN64. It may be flat, but it never falls flat. Classic Mario all the way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000KRXAGE","description":"Wii Play collects nine quick and addictive games that are easy to pick up and play and hard to put away. Thanks to the intuitive controls of the Wii Remote, even the most inexperienced gamers will have no trouble mastering the controls.    &lt;p&gt; Wii Play features nine separate mini-games, including the following: &lt;li&gt;Shooting Range, a point-and-fire game of target practice in the Duck Hunt tradition. &lt;li&gt;Billiards, a simplified variation of nine-ball with stunningly realistic physics that uses your Wii Remote as your pool cue. &lt;li&gt;Find Mii, in which you scan the crowds to find the right Mii&#8212;and Miis you and your friends created make an appearance. &lt;li&gt;Tanks!, in which you command a toy tank on a miniature battlefield in a gauntlet of 100 missions. &lt;li&gt;Other games include Pose Mii, Table Tennis, Fishing, Charge!, and Laser Hockey. &lt;p&gt; Every game features a multiplayer mode, so you and your friends can compete for the high score or go head to head to see who&#8217;s the best.  Wii Play comes with a white Wii Remote so that your friends can join in the action. (Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"goldentoaster \"goldentoaster\"","summary":"Waste of time","reviewText":"I would not recommend this game to anyone. If you have a Wii, then you most likely have Wii Sports. Thats all you really need for wii/mii fun. Only about 3 games in the bunch are playable in wii play, let alone fun, and the fun ones lose their luster within five minutes. You want a lot of shallow minigames done right? get warioware for the same price. The games are just as deep (but there are over 200 of them). With that game, you dont need the extra controller to play with friends. Its just that wii play games are so increadably shallow and quick that you will see all there is to offer in less then an hour. The only game that might keep your attention longer than that is tanks, but even that loses fun after an afternoon. The only reason this gets two stars is that it comes with a controller, but honestly, you are better off just buying a controller and passing on the game and saving your $10 for a movie or something that will keep your interest longer then 5 minutes. i know 10 dollars sounds like a little, but if someone comes up to you with a steaming pile of fresh, soft-serve dog droppings and says its only five dollars when the rest of the doo-doo he sells is $15, would you buy it just because it is a deal? Nobody needs this game, therefore nobody should buy it just because it is cheap.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2007"}
