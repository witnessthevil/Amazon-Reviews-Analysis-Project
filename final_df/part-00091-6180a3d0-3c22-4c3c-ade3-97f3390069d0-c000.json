{"product_name":"B006QRNKOO","description":"One of the most storied franchises in history soars to new heights. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the series. Link embarks on a sprawling adventure through the skies and across the continent when his childhood friend Zelda falls from their floating home in the sky beneath the clouds to the mysterious continent below. The introduction of full motion controls enabled by Wii MotionPlus technology synchronizes player movements with Link's actions while offering the most intuitive play control of any game in the series to date.","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"not so epic","reviewText":"Here are my thoughts after playing the game for a while. I'll update it once I beat the whole game.STORY/AMBIENCEIt's nice that Nintendo really tried to infuse Skyward Sword with a story. It actually works for the most part. The scenes between Zelda and Link are really touching. And for once Gannondorf isn't the main villain!That said, while the story itself is fine, it just doesn't have the same epic feel Twilight Princess did. First, Skyloft feels a bit silly. I have nothing against riding birds, but it just can't compare with riding a horse as the standard for a fantasy/adventure game. I feel like Nintendo wanted to make this game different but this was a case of throwing out the good with the bad.Also, more fundamentally, the game just has a more lighthearted feel to it. Even after Zelda disappears, Zelda's father doesn't seem particularly scared and tells Link they'll have to start to look for her in the morning. Enemies aren't scary. For the first 2-3 hours, you'll spend most of your time talking to folks in Skyloft and finding cute little animals in a forest. It's just tough comparing this to Twilight Princess, which had beautifully haunting cutscenes, a chilling villain in Zant, and a melancholy ambience.GRAPHICSFirst, I'll address what was probably the most controversial aspect of the game: the graphics. When it was first revealed that the game had a pastel color palette, some fans complained that it looked too lighthearted and the characters too cartoonish. I was actually worried about this since I loved Twilight Princess' realistic style.Fortunately, after getting a good sample of the game's artwork, I have to say I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. I still prefer Twilight Princess' realistic style, but Skyward Sword looks great. The characters look alive and they have a wide range of facial and emotional expressions.The landscapes and stages are at least as detailed as in Twilight Princess. From a distance, the impressionistic style works really well. Sadly, unlike Twilight Princess, there's no Hyrule FIeld, which was always my favorite part. Also, the other landscapes don't quite have that epic feel and almost look like they could have come out of a kid's game. Make no mistake - they look good, but not quite epic.SOUNDBecause Skyward Sword has such a deep story, it's all the more disappointing that Skyward Sword doesn't have voice acting. The on-screen dialogue text worked for past Zelda games because the dialogue was short and often transactional in nature. However, there are cinematic cutscenes in Skyward Sword and the text dialogue just becomes a chore to read and really detracts from the story. Worst of all is when there's dialogue on the screen but the character's lips aren't movie.The soundtrack is good, but not quite at the level of Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Again, as with the rest of the game, it's more lighthearted. It's tough to really judge while playing the game, so I'll have to wait until the full soundtrack is available for download.GAMEPLAYThis is where Skyward Sword really shines. While I don't think the swordplay is necessarily a revolution, it does add a new dimension to the game. You actually have to think about HOW you slash and hack. The Wii MotionPlus or its equivalent will definitely be standard for any future Zelda games.OVERALLSkyward Sword is really hard to rate because it both exceeds expectations and disappoints. The impressionistic art style didn't bother me nearly as much as I'd feared. On the other hand, the game just feels a whole lot less epic than Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and especially Twilight Princess. I'll write an updated review once I finish the game (it is a long game) but in the meantime I give it 3.5 stars.UPDATE (1/2/2012)Took me longer to finish the game than I'd thought. It is a long game, with at least 50 hours of play, and I didn't even finish all of the side-quests. However, my initial review remains largely unchanged.I think the root of the problem with the game is that it's a bit too much like a Mario game. Don't get me wrong, I love Mario. However, Zelda is supposed to be a different experience. In Zelda, the levels aren't just platforms, but rather supposed to be immersive worlds. Levels and challenges should feel like natural extensions of the story, not just &#34;fetch-quests.&#34; By contrast, in Skyward Sword there were way too many &#34;fetch-quests&#34; and pointless activities just to vary up the game design. My least favorite was when the Water Dragon simply threw several dozen musical notes around an ocean and forced Link to swim around looking for them. I almost shouted in frustration.Also, I think Nintendo made a huge mistake by not giving each of the dungeons a unique feel. It makes the game less memorable. I feel like I played and beat the game just a few days ago, but remember it less than I do Twilight Princess. Because the dungeons aren't entirely separate from the over world and are much smaller overall, they just don't stick out. I can't think back to the &#34;Water Dungeon&#34; or &#34;Sky Dungeon.&#34; Separate dungeons also would have widened the variety of locales and the play experiences. As it stands, I felt like I was going back and forth over the same territory, which got tiring.The non-playable characters all felt like add-ons and were fairly superficial. Unlike Twilight Princess, I didn't really find myself caring for any of them. One of the first side-quests is to help a mother find her child. My first though was that any mother dumb enough to let her child wander around on a floating city with no side rails and monsters running around at night deserves to lose her kid. Zelda's dad seems entirely unconcerned that his daughter is missing and possibly kidnapped by an evil demon. None of these characters actually helps you in your quest. Except for Groose. I ended up loving him. He had real character and actually does try to become more than simply a helpless victim.The bosses just didn't meet my expectations. There actually are a lot fewer than in Twilight Princess, especially if you don't count the multiple times you fight Ghirahim or the Imprisoned. Ghirahim actually worked well as a boss and was the only time I felt like the motion controls added anything to the game. I also liked smacking Koloktos with the giant sword. Other than that, the bosses were too easy and not particularly memorable. The final boss, Demise, was pathetically easy once you figure out that you have to use the Skyward Strike. The designs are certainly nothing like the intimidating beasts from Twilight Princess.Finally, I really have to reemphasize that the lack of voice acting is noticeable. Other Zelda games told the story more through images and narration. Here, so much of the cutscenes and story involve dialogue. It just looks and sounds ridiculous watching these scenes but only hearing odd grunts and sighs.Overall, I stick by my rating of 3.5 stars. It's a good game, but really could have and should have been so much better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000A8VBZ","description":"They just killed Cash. Now, they want to kill him again. America is full of run down, broken rust-belt towns where nobody cares and anything goes. InManhunt's Carcer City, nothing matters anymore and all that's left are cheap thrills. The ultimate rush is the power to grant life and take it away, for sport. This time, James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. You awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide, and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. This is a brutal blood sport.Continuing in Rockstar North's tradition of world-class gameplay with high production values and sardonic humor,Manhuntexplores the depths of human depravity in a vicious, sadistic tale of urban horror.","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Its Murder!","reviewText":"How do you like your kills? Pick one - Extra Bloody Violent and Gory - Cranium Splitting Gut Spilling and Ripping  - or how about just plain old Neck Breaking followed by Baseball Bat Swinging Decapitation? For what its worth, Manhunt is easily the most depraved and violent video game ever to be released on the general publics computer store shelves and who better to bring it to us that the developers of Grand Theft Auto.The story is a simple one. You play a guy called Cash who has cheated a state execution because of a guy called the director (starkweather) who wants to see you hunted on the streets of Carson city by gangs of deranged hoodlums who he has hired to track you down for a live snuff film he is making. He directs you to murder the hoods as he films your every move. You better get violent quick if you want to make it out alive!I have played and finished the game in three days.  It was worth every minute! First of all let us address some issues just to get everything into perspective. Manhunt is a far cry from the terrible State of Emergency also released by Rockstar. The graphics are certainly not Silent Hill 3 or Metal Gear Solid 2, but they are better than Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - but not by much. However the character moves are certainly superior to Vice City in 3rd person mode but the button bashing moves are not a whole pile different................. but this is NOT a button bashing game! Many people will hate this game if they do not take the time to actually play along with the stealth involved in the games architecture. If you only go for button bashing then you will only end up playing a fraction of what this great game has to offer.If you think that Manhunt is just a bloodier version of the street brawls in Vice City then you will be mistaken. Manhunt is everything that you could hope for! It is an ORIGINAL game! It is hyper-violent! It has a unique story, with lots of levels, weapons and death moves.  It is a FULLY FLEDGED 3rd person beam em up / shoot em up with approx. 22 levels from what I can see.The best way to equate this game is by comparing it to the graphics and gameplay seen in Shadowman 2, crossed with the stealth of Splinter Cell and Tencho with a dash of Hitman 2 along with loads of nasty weapons and lashing more blood and gore. It also boasts a very unique way of creating finishing moves. Out of the 20+ weapons there are 60 possible death moves and maybe even more. However this is all not just kill, kill and kill some more. You got to use stealth and you have got to use some tactics in splitting up the hunters so you can jump out from behind a dark alleyway and proceed to slowly follow them before setting up a finishing murder move. You can go into a street brawl if you want too but chances are that you will just end up trying to take on a gang who will turn you into pulp.There is a steep learning curve involved. If you rent for one night you will hate it. It took me awhile to get INTO the game and when you do it becomes something else. You actually experience the advantage of stealth mode when inflicting your kills and the game becomes a CHALLENGE!This is not such a simple beat em up and certainly not as fluid as Vice City but if you will spend time on it you will experience THE MOST BRUTAL game ever made. The game does have some cons - graphic detail is low, camera angles can sometimes be annoying, there is a linear story (but a good one!) and a lot of repetitive play but HELL this IS what everyone has been screaming out for! An ORIGINAL HYPER-VIOLENT game that actually  has a half-decent storyline with some wicked sound effects to boot. The game is very funny in parts and the bad guys say hysterical things when you are hiding in the alley. It actually seems REAL at times! This just goes to show that graphics do not always make a game! The sound effects are top-notch and the cut scenes are vicious. When you compare this game to others of its type (Splinter Cell, Hitman, Shadowman 2) it ranks right up there with them! It is great ... ONCE YOU GET INTO IT! Give it time and wham! Instant pleasure in a sort of horrific way. If that is your thing then you will love it! All hail the surprise Rockstar xmas blockbuster! We didnt even see it coming.......... whack!Pros:- Originality- Ultra-Violent!- Lots of nasty surprises.- Loads of weapons, bad guys and levels.- Outstanding finishing death moves.- You will play it again if you like it.Cons:- PC version will probably have a way better graphics.- You may not like repeating scenes over and over again when you loose.- Some parts can be too easy and others nearly impossible.- Its not Grand Theft Auto 5.***As a note this is a very ADULT orientated game with LOTS of VERY BAD language and LOTS of GORE. ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR KIDS!***","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2003"}

Even when there are some tough challenges, I've never felt the helpless exasperation that other series sometimes provide, nor have I ever felt like the solution to a problem was deliberately designed to sell the strategy guide.Phantom Hourglass has been around for quite a while now, but I only just recently picked it up and started playing it.  Even though it was partly aimed at showcasing the features of what was then the new Nintendo DS, it's held up well over time.  The look is cartoony enough that older graphics aren't so awful, the colors are bright, and the gimmicky use of the DS' unique features is downright charming.  For example, there are magic candles that you blow out by moving Link in front of them and blowing into the mic.  There are times you use the stylus to make notes on the map, and the game even hints at some good times to do so.  You move Link around on the screen by tapping or dragging the stylus in front of him, and when you do, his flickering fairy companion zips to the point where the stylus is touching the screen, helping you to orient yourself.Even with these \"new\" features, the original Link series shows through:  you still have the spiraling slash motion (though if you do it too many times in a row he gets dizzy), you still collect gems for money, and you can still find them in clumps of grass and hidden here and there in the game.  Although the look is more of an angled 3D overhead effect than the \"top-down\" Game Boy Zelda games, it's still fairly easy to get the hang of combat and movement.In \"The Phantom Hourglass\", you find that Princess Zelda has been a Pirate Captain for quite a while, only now she's run afoul of The Ghost Ship, a phantom boat that spirited her away, and now Link has to find the clues that will lead him back to her.  You're in an area that's less a world map of continents than it is a chain of islands, divided into four larger pieces that you must explore.  Along the way you have a companion or two, including a rather lazy treasure-hunting ship's captain. You also have some variety in the environments themselves:  for example, navigating a boat from one place to another involves drawing out the route, watching your ship fly along the water, and occasionally having to stop for new discoveries or random obstacles.I really enjoyed The Phantom Hourglass.  It was fun, entertaining, and rather well paced.  It doesn't have huge amounts of character development or story depth, but then again neither does it have a high degree of complexity or require a lot of fast-twitch skills.  If you're looking for an RPG that's easy to get into and hard to put down, Zelda is as good as it gets and The Phantom Hourglass is an excellent entry in the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"Tetris911","summary":"THIS is the Donkey Kong Country game that you have been waiting!","reviewText":"Remember when you first played Super Mario Galaxy 1 on the Nintendo Wii? Remember how amazingly fun that game was due to how different and unique the game played?  Most of all, I am sure you remember the fact that Mario Galaxy 1 was pretty easy?  Even though it was easy, it was still a GREAT and FUN game to play because Nintendo did a great job with making the Wii Remote/Nunchuk controls work really well with Super Mario Galaxy 1.  After you collect all the stars, re-beat the game with Luigi, etc there is not much else right? Finally Super Mario Galaxy 2 is announced and eventually released.  Super Mario Galaxy 2 BLEW anyone that beat Super Mario Galaxy 1 socks OFF! Super Mario Galaxy 2 is what the dedicated Mario gamer was looking to play because not only did Super Mario Galaxy 2 blew Super Mario Galaxy 1 away, it also gives you that GREAT satisfaction feeling of completing the levels/game due to how challenging Super Mario Galaxy 2 was at the time.  Anyone that has completed Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 will know that Super Mario Galaxy 2 was hands down the best of the two thanks to how awesomely creative, challenging, rewarding and FUN the game was to hardcore nintendo mario gamers.Now fast forward to Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Nintendo Wii because if you are reading this, then you will know how much fun that game was to play on the Wii, correct?  Most of all, it was a LONG time coming because there has yet to be a great Donkey Kong Country game since the first three Donkey Kong Country games on the Super Nintendo were absolutely phenomenal.  Besides how great and fun Donkey Kong Country Returns was for the Nintendo Wii, it did felt easy for true hardcore nintendo donkey kong fans.  Even though we still loved and praised the game, we just can't help but think that the game could of been a little bit more harder or challenging ya know?  Well guess what? Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is HERE and YES the hype is true! I, myself and others I am sure were on the fence about buying Tropical Freeze because of how easy Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Wii was back then but I am glad I bit the freaking bullet.....I mean BANANA...because Tropical Freeze is absolutely SPECTACULAR!  BUT most of all, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is the CHALLENGE that you have been waiting for since Donkey Kong Country 3 for the SNES because when I say Tropical Freeze is challenging, I ain't kidding! You ever notice when you play the first few levels, you always collect EVERY letter, balloon or the puzzle pieces as well because you just want to find them all before you complete the level? I always end up doing that and have been successful at that for a LONG time until Tropical Freeze first level was completed, I realized I was STILL missing 2 puzzle pieces! This shocked me because every single Donkey Kong Country game that I have played, I always end up successfully finding the hidden stuff in the first few levels due to wanting to explore, take my time, enjoy, etc. but when you play the first level of Tropical Freeze, I am going to bet 99% of the people do not end up finding all of the Puzzle pieces or KONG letters or both during their first time completing the level! Of course they will probably be able to find whatever they are missing the 2nd time they replay the level but I am not kidding, I honestly believe you will not find all those puzzle pieces or kong letters during you're first attempt of completing the 1st level or more levels of world 1.what else? well I know there is sadly, WAY too many negative nancy's that care more about the graphics than the GAME itself wanting to know if the graphics are good or whatever.  Read my words, are you kidding me!??! THIS IS DONKEY KONG COUNTRY FOLKS! OF course the graphics are going to look good, so QUIT worrying about that and focus on the more important part of the game which is the GAME itself!The music? HOLY CRAP! If you always enjoyed Donkey Kong Country soundtracks since the first DKC game for the Super Nintendo, then you are in for a VERY special treat my fellow DKC gamer! Also, did I mention there is alot of great extras/unlockables? I wont spoil that part cause trust me, you will want to see it in person by yerself rather than cheating by watching a full playthrough of the game via youtube or whatever lol.If you are skeptical about buying Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, then do not worry because there is no excuse to not buy DKC Tropical Freeze since this brand new spanking game is only $49.99!!! Smart play and decision by Nintendo because I can't be the only one thinking that this game could or should of been $59.99 but that's not the case.  Also, for the record if this game was $59.99, I would of still bought it!I am absolutely SHOCKED that Nintendo did not promote the online mode for DKC tropical freeze.  I know what you are thinking, \"WAIT WHAT? DONKEY KONG COUNTRY HAS ONLINE MODE???\" Then guess what? YES! It is true! DKC tropical freeze DOES indeed have online mode.  First off, do NOT get sad about the fact that online mode does not include co-op gaming because if you really think about it, Donkey Kong Country already has co-op mode locally! Plus, I don't see myself playing a co-op game of Donkey Kong Country with some random player I don't even know.  Anyways, why did I mentioned that Donkey Kong Country tropical freeze has online mode? Well, after you complete any levels in the game, the level itself will unlock a time trial option but the best part is the fact that you can UPLOAD you're fastest completion time of whichever level via ONLINE! After you upload you're best completion time for whichever level, the game will display an online leaderboard ranking! Plus, it will show the person that is playing what they are ranked as right away!But that's not all! Have you ever wanted to see how fast any of the levels can be beaten? Well, the online leaderboards allow the players/gamers to select ANYONE that has submitted their best times and you have the option to WATCH THE ENTIRE REPLAY of the fastest player beating any of the DKC levels! Let me tell you something, you will be SHOCKED and AMAZED on how insanely fast some of the best Donkey Kong Country players in the world can do.  It is seriously pure shocking to watch the reply, you will FULLY understand what I mean and feel after you watch you're first replay video of whichever level you want to see being completed in record times by hardcore DKC players!Before I end this review, please do yourself a favor by purchasing Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze for the Nintendo Wii U by either buying the retail disc box version OR please visit the Wii U Eshop and download the game to you're Wii U because i promise you that Donkey Kong Country tropical freeze is a game that you can proudly have stored on you're Wii U main channel page with all of the other games/apps you may have downloaded.  I got this game as a gift via disc retail package, even though I am just a TINY bit disappointed about that because I wanted to download Tropical Freeze to my Wii U, so that I don't have to change discs if ya know what I mean hahahaha.In conclusion, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is a MUST buy game for any Wii U owners that are looking for something to keep them playing for months due to how rewarding and challenging this game is compared to the Donkey Kong Country Returns Wii game back in 2010.  Were you left wanting more levels, more challenging and more rewarding feelings from completing the game/levels? Then buy Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze ASAP or you might as well just get rid of you're Wii U since you're Wii U doesn't deserved to be played if you didn't put in some DKC tropical freeze time in the Wii U.  I am not joking, if you do not play Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze on you're Wii U by the end of this month, then you should be arrested, plain and simple!Cheers everyone and BUY Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, the Wii U needs that Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze lovin! Please wear a hoodie or warm clothes when playing Tropical Freeze because you will literally start to become VERY cold when playing the snow/winter levels, trust me on this one!Peach out!ps.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Beginning with Super NES in the early 90's, Nintendo matched competing game systems in graphics capability and exceeded them when it came to quality of game titles.  GameCube is just the latest in that long line Nintendo products that takes all comers and disposes of them with frightening ease.  The key to Nintendo's continued success is the lessons learned from its first-generation platform, the Nintendo Entertainment System.  While there were a number of excellent titles for the system, there was no quality control on who could make games for the system or what was required for the games to be allowed on the system.  As a result, there were a large number of horribly inferior titles made by 3rd-party software companies.  These games were confusing, difficult to play, and ultimately very unsatisfying.  Nintendo cracked down on this and established very specific rules and guidelines to be followed for titles made for their subsequent systems.  As a result, the number of inferior titles shrunk to almost nil (some are always going to get through, it's just a fact of the business).  Already, GameCube has a set of games (released at launch or with the Christmas rush) that have all met critical and consumer success.  While the number of titles currently available are less in number than Playstation 2 (which admittedly has a year head start) and X-Box, they are of higher quality.  Playstation is still trying learn about quality control of game titles.  PS 2's selection is better than some of awful games that made it to PS 1, but it still has a long way to go.  X-Box simply comes across as a system that just wanted to rush out as many games as possible in time for launch, without really considering their quality.  Witness X-box's less than stellar sales record and critical and consumer drubbing of most of its titles.  GameCube's graphics are equal (if not superior) to the graphics of the competing systems.  While the Cube may not have some of the bells and whistle's trappings of a DVD player like the other systems, it's not held back by that.  With DVD player prices dropping like rocks, a person can get a decent one [inexpensively] these days.  No reason to pay [a lot more] for a game system that has that capability.  For pure gaming pleasure, GameCube is the king.  I continue to look forward to the new titles Nintendo will release (I'm sooooooo looking forward the Metroid sequel) while enjoying those games which are currently in release.  Nintendo continues to get the job done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Average installment at best","reviewText":"I'm not really sure what Bungie was shooting for with this installment, but I'm guessing they missed the mark by a long shot. I had read that they wanted to create an earth-based game because the fans of Halo 2 really enjoyed those first few levels, myself included. But it seems like they took all of the elements that made those levels great--and took them out of the game.First of all, the game was overpriced for what you get. If not for the firefite mode, I'd have been very irritated at spending [...] for a campaign that was that short and mediocre. Level design, story and the ending were all very flat.Lighting was terrible! Its almost like they made the levels too dark just so you'd have an excuse to use your VISR mode. The end result was terrible, because most levels are too dark without the VISR, but too bright with it.Suddenly we can't dual wield weapons anymore...what? Are we too weak to hold a second weapon? To make matters worse, we can still flip our warthogs over when they tip. We are further plagued by the inability to carry much ammunition and most of the best human weapons don't have much ammo for them anywhere.Level design was repetitive, which is a Halo trademark, and not a good one. A repetitive level that is GOOD wouldn't be a problem, but these are just plain unexciting. I assume they wanted the pacing of this game to be different, which I applaude. The \"run and gun\" of Halo is getting to feel very dated and played out, unless you're a 12 year old. Because of the focus of this game, I was hoping it would be more tactical, but unfortunately not. No cover system--you can't even sprint. Its like they wanted you to play a tactical type of game, but they took away every possible tool to make that possible. The weapons are cool on one hand--silenced riles and pistols, but what's the point? Everything in this game has shields so its not like you can take anything out covertly aside from grunts and jackals. They ARE going to know where you are, period. You're only chance for an effective ambush is to toss in a few grenades with a buddy and then mop up whatever is left, but this is not in any way covert.Firefite mode is pretty fun, but falls short of what it should have been. Terrible variety of weapons and not enough ammo. Not very many levels either, which doesns't help matters. It was nice to see them trying to emulate the fantastic Horse Mode from Gears 2, but they didn't do it well. You have to \"earn\" lives so you can keep playing. This should be something you can turn off if you want, but that's just me.In a nutshell, this isn't worth 60 dollars. I noticed that they dropped the price on Amazon by almost [...] within the first few days, probably because its not selling very well, and if it is, it shouldn't be. There is no innovation here, which was obvious when the original Halo 3 came out. The concept of this game was great, but it just didn't deliver at all.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2009"}

This game seems pretty good, as all halo (fps) games tend to be, but for me one of the things that I loved about Halo was the Master Chief story arc, and without that, it loses some interest. This game also suffers from some crappy character models, which is surprising, as I expected them to look at least as good as they did in Halo 3. They do not.  The gameplay is pretty good however, and the the story seems to be darker and more moody than the Halo francise in general, which is something I can get behind.I will probably play this before Force Unleashed, but not until i'm done with Dragon Age, ME2, AC2, Demon Souls, etc...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00BGD6LMG","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Erwin","summary":"Watch Slog","reviewText":"Watch Dogs is a game I desperately wanted to like, especially since it's exciting unveiling a few years back.  GTA clone with hacking and a dark revenge storyline, that sounded pretty cool.  It turns out it's a lot more fun to think about than actually play.The introduction is actually one of the best scenes in the game.  A brutal interrogation of the guy who caused the crash that killed the main character's niece.  Followed by a tense escape using your hacking techniques in many different ways.  Setting off a tennis ball machine, a car alarm, blacking out a building etc.  It is great.Once you get to the actual game, it grinds you away.  Aiden our hero is a grouchy dope.  The revenge plotline is ham handed.  Most depressingly, the gameplay is a slog.  Almost every action in Watch Dogs follows this general route.-  Get mission via either hacking a pedestrian or through game story-  Go to mission start-  Wait for some action to take place whilst watching on a video camera.-  Depending on mission type, chase and tackle a criminal, kill everyone, or kill everyone and solve a rudimentary puzzle using a number of different viewpoints with security cameras.That's all it seems to be.  Sometimes your actions will cause the police to chase you and you drive at high speeds while changing the lights or erecting barriers in the road.  If you are successful, you get away, if not, you eventually get chased and killed by a helicopter.  Or you can slowly swim into Lake Michigan until the cops give up and slowly swim back, a scintillating 10 minutes to be sure.Everything about the game is fine.  The cars handle fine, the shooting is fine, even the hacking, which mostly amounts to viewing your targets with security cams and occasionally blowing up a fuse box or lifting your character on a forklift is fine.  Everything is fine and that adds up to everything getting boring in a hurry.It's a clever idea and one that could have been great, but it falls so far short into mediocrity you'll be left wondering what could have been.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2014"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Pretty Good Device for the Casual Gamecube Owner","reviewText":"Make no mistake, this is the memory card for you if you've got a Gamecube (which I'm assuming you do, or you're planning on getting one soon).Anyway, there are 251 blocks on this baby, which may not seem like a lot, but it is.  It gets the job done, and you don't have to worry about it corrupting data or anything.  I've had mine for a while and nothing has happened to the files saved on there.  It's also easy to save and delete information from this thing with the simple click of a button.Please, don't get that damn third party memory card from Madcatz, my experience with that is corrupted data, and constant reformating of the card (which erases your files anyway).  Only go with Nintendo, they're the only ones who know the divine nature of their memory card.I must say, though, this is for the casual gamer.  Someone who doesn't have every game they can possibly get a hold of.  Some EA games, for exammple, take up over one-hundred blocks of memory.  Basically, what I'm saying is simple: If you're one who has a ton of games, you may find yourself buying more than one of these memory cards before you know it.  Not every game has a save for just the game.  Resident Evil, for example, saves on a different block every time.  Just like a playstation memory card.  If you're like me, however, you probably don't have THAT many games that it's a bother.The other thing I must caution is simple: This thing, like every other memory card, is small as hell.  This one even more so.  If you can, keep it plugged in your Gamecube at all times.The great thing about memory cards, just about everyone of them, is simple: You can take them anywhere.  Does your same friend also own Super Mario Sunshine?  Hey, that's great, now you can leave your copy of the game at home and take your memory card.  It lightens the load.It's essential to have a memory card if you buy a Gamecube, and this is a good one.  If, however, you happen to be someone who has a TON of games, this won't hold you over long enough, and you'll have to buy another.No Gamecube owner should be without a memory card, though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003O6CBIG","description":"","reviewerName":"magis123","summary":"Copying My Review From The Hardened Edition","reviewText":"Wow, I cannot believe I got duped into buying this game.  I watched all the preview videos, bought into the hype that Activision & Infinity Ward spun around this game; only to find out that when you got it, it looks NOTHING like any of the videos they have shown.  I have purchased the Hardened Edition for the PS4 (and I have a pre-launch PS4 to play it on), the regular version for the PS3 and the regular version for the PC; so I have quite a breadth of experience here playing the game already.Let's get down to it, the game is just bad.  It really is more of a beta than a final release product and if you contact Infinity Ward or Activision customer support about it, the representatives there will tell you that very thing.  I have heard from several different levels of support today [after spending nearly 6 hours on the phone with support] that we just have to 'bear with them, the product needs just a little tweaking and it will be perfect'.  Seriously?!  The game which you released needs tweaking?!  The connection is completely unstable [dedicated servers?  I do not think so] on the multiplayer facet that you get logged out after only a couple games, that or it locks up your system.HACKERS -- that is right on day one of the release of this game it was already hacked.  Infinity Ward knew about this two months ago because there was a Chinese site that had posted the entire code for the game for people to start hacking, but they did nothing about it.  And the in game reporting system?  It is the biggest joke there is.  All the multiplayer leaderboards show ridiculous statistics that are clearly hacking, but is anything being done about it?  No.  I have followed specifically 10 people that I reported for hacking on day 1 of release; nothing has been done to them or their account and they just continue to hack away.  Oh and the hackers are on ALL platforms, PS4 included (I am assuming XBONE but I do not know anyone with a pre-launch XBONE).NETWORK USAGE - When playing online, normal games use about 10-20 KB/sec of data usage (this is what I average playing either MW3 or BO2 or even currently BF4) ... on average I am seeing ranges from 65-100 KB/sec of usage with this game.  So 5x the normal usage with this game.  What could that mean?  Number one it seriously heats up your system, and number two if you have bandwidth caps with your provider, it will be 5x more likely for you to hit them and get overage charges.HARDWARE USAGE - (THIS RELATES TO THE PS3 VERSION ONLY, I DO NOT HAVE SENSORS ON MY PS4) - CPU Usage on the PS3 consistently spikes to 100% and stays there for extended times, longest time at 100% was for a full 35 minutes.  Just imagine that amount of usage.  After playing Ghosts for ~25+ minutes, the CPU core temperatures on the PS3 go to 90*C (194*F) on average, I have seen temp spikes in the excess of 115*C (239*F)  RAM usage, when playing the game there is never less than 100% of the PS3 RAM being used.  How this affects the game or system is that if god forbid someone sends you a message or game invite, you run the risk of disconnecting from the PSN servers because simply put the system cannot handle it.  Also if you do not clean out your Inbox and Sent Box which are stored in the temporary RAM on your PS3, you also run the risk of the game locking up.  The Blu-ray drive runs almost constantly.  I have never had a game that ran the Blu-ray drive this much.  Blu-ray drive temperatures are running between 65*C (149*F) and 85*C (185*F).  This will cause premature failure of the drive, which could be a very brilliant product strategy if that is what Sony wants (product failure means you would probably go out and buy a new unit).--------------------------------------------So what was my resolution after speaking with support today for 6 hours?  They told me to contact Amazon and that because of the level of complaints that have been issued about this game, Amazon would give me a full refund of the game.  That's right instead of making the game right or making good on the issues, they told me to go back to the retailer who sold it to get a refund for their faulty game.  Amazing.  Oh and my Hardened Edition only had the game and the steelbook inside of it, EVERYTHING ELSE was missing.  Their response to that, \"Well we are sorry about that, again contact Amazon for a full refund.\"  MIND BLOWN.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

This game had everything to offer.  It had immense replay value, a lot of challenges, and fun multiplayer modes too.  Thing is, I never played the original Super Monkey Ball before, so I won't be able to compare the two games in this review.For starters...Monkey Ball is like a puzzle game.  A game in which you have to roll your monkey through a series of paths to get to the goal at the end of each stage.  Every level has a time limit.  And on each level there are a number of bananas--collect a hundred of them, and you gain an extra life.There are multiple modes you can play this game on.  There's adventure, challenge mode, practice, and mini-games.  Mini-games are all the simultaneous four-player games you can play, such as bowling, golfing, and racing.  I have not played these mini-games much at all, so the only thing I can tell you about them is that you unlcok them by earning \"play points,\" and you earn these points by playing single player challenge mode.Adventure/Story mode is basically a one player adventure, with a plot (not a very good one though) behind it.  Story mode is broken up into many different \"worlds,\" which are then broken up into individual stages.Challenge mode can be played from one to four players, but only one person can play at a time.  You basically take turns playing, meaning you only need one controller for four people to play!  Challenge mode is the heart of Super Monkey Ball 2.  It is broken up into three difficulties: Beginner, Advance, and Expert.  Beginner has 10 stages, Advanced has 30, and Expert has 50.  Beginner is something a 6 year old can master.  Advanced is something that will take much practice.  And expert...well, you gotta be out of your M.I.N.D. if you think you can beat it!  Some stages have hidden goals.  These hidden goals allow you to skip over the next level.  If you beat a difficulty without losing all your lives, you get to play through its hidden stages, which are harder than the normal ones.I should also add that challenge mode's stages are slightly different from those in story mode.  And now for the summary of practice mode...it contains all of the story mode stages you've played before so you can get better at them to your heart's content.And that is Monkey Ball 2 for you.  Very fun.  Very addicting.  And very challenging.  I suggest you play Challenge mode.  It's probably the best reason for getting the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"3.5; as beautiful as it is flawed","reviewText":"The original Nights for the Sega Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga, was one of those cult classic games that many people still refer to when they talk about their favorite games but for the most part, most of us have only heard of it rather than actually played the thing. With massive demand and finally an announcement, players got excited that there was going to be as sequel, titled Journey of Dreams. But given Sonic Team's strange track record lately as well as the huge hype, could this really live up to the hype? Well it doesn't completely deliver so much as it delivers and then drops the ball then delivers again.Story: Will, an aspiring soccer player, and Helen, a practicing violinist, are pulled into Nightopia, the land that's created when people dream. But the evil of beings called Nightmaren want to rid the world of Nightopia so it's up to Will, Helen and our favorite flying jester, Nights, to gather up Ideya, the components that make up Nightopia, and rid the dream world of Nightmaren.Graphics: Recently I bought a component cable for the Wii which allows 480p resolution and Nights was one of the first to be tested and even without it, the game would still be amazing visually. With a bright color palette and lush looking levels, the game is a great example at how you don't need realistic skin tones to create great graphics and with 480p going, the game is even beautiful still. The cutscene graphics are okay but the opening cinema and the levels though are just vibrant and colorful.Sound/Music: Normally in these kind of games, I just put on my own music but the music in Nights is very lively and filled with memorable, upbeat tones and is the kind of soundtrack that you'd very well consider buying. The voice acting, however, is not horrendous a la Sonic's 3D adventures but they're still unfortunate since the British accents are quite off and the readings are kind of stilted and awkward.Gameplay: I had read several reviews where people found the Wii controls awkward so I thought I'd start right off the bat with a good-ol' Gamecube controller and controlling Nights wasn't even that much of a problem. While initially awkward to get the feeling for how it works, it soon became a breeze but when I thought I'd check out the Wii ones, I found them awkward as well and went back to the trusty Gamecube controller. The game also lets you use the Classic controller, Wii-mote by itself or standard Wii controls. Nights acts as a kind of rail shooter/Sonic the Hedgehog combo where Nights flies in the air and you control her direction from diving, climbing, doing loops (called Paraloops which act as a vortex sucking in important items within its radius) or dashing to gain speed and crash into stuff.The big minus is the platform-style parts where you physically control Will or Helen (they \"dualize\" with Nights for the flying stuff) and with the normal controllers they're fine, the Wii controls just don't feel right, not to mention the very notion of having platforming in the game when it was doing just fine with being a rail shooter hurts it. The other negative is the checkpoint system or rather its lack of one as when you progress through the story levels, you get a cutscene, play a level than the stage boss but should you fail against the boss, you have to start the level over complete with cutscenes and the level you just killed. It's quite a buzzkill when you're playing and unless you're a pro that could get through the game without failing once, it's quite a downer when you have to replay what you just beat with no checkpoint in place.Some are quite disappointed while others think its flawed but a good game overall. I'm in the second camp since I felt compelled to play again when I turned off the system but you kind of hope certain things are corrected for the hopefully-done 3rd game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2008"}

The graphics are the greatest thing about it, and the overall atmosphere is just awesome. But once you get past all that you have the usual, shoot, kill, slice, run, shoot, kill, hack, slash, crap that all these games have become. I thoroughly enjoyed games like painkiller, but they were just cheap, and all about fun, nothing really serious or great. This game takes itself way to seriously and even when playing with friends, they have all said, is this it? Is there really anymore, or plot to this game, and then we played some Tiger Woods Golf!! The zombie revolution definitely started with Resident Evil and went from there, now you have all these games and movies about infected people, and zombies running amuck causing chaos so you go pick up a shovel or shotgun and take them out. RE games had plots and made sense and where very exciting and made you tense, this just doesnt. Lets make all these into games and see how many great reviews they get, Land Of the Dead(there was a very stupid game made), Dawn of The Dead, Night of the Living Dead, I Am Legend, Quarantine, 28 days later, 28 weeks later, Pandorum the list goes on. While this isnt a movie is just seems like more of the same as those listed. Also you have games like Necrovision, Painkiller Ressurection(not like the others), Killing Floow, Dreamkiller, that are all taking on this dried up genre.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Chris A.

If you're somebody who likes to just be amazed that next-generation graphics this is the game for you.Tip: Be sure to take time to collect all the shards that you can find. The blue shards are found in police drones at hand scan stations and four shards are inside each power generator. It's worth it to track these down because they are the things you used to level up your skill tree.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"M.

The weapon selections are cool and the combat system is innovative (the dead-eye and showdown features are great: cue old west music and quick-draw movie cut).  Those were the game's strongest points by far.The weak spots had to do with the storyline and gameplay.  The story, by itself, was excellent and well-written but its execution was sadly lacking.  The game is 100% linear with absolutely no choice in course of action or deviation.  Even character choice is up to the story and not the player - you'll use different characters, both good and bad, throughout the game.  Totally linear gameplay really bugs me.  I finished the game just to finish it - but halfway through the game it was apparent that the gameplay was poorly implemented.If you like a game with some good action and fun combat sequences that you'll have no problem with this game - even the story is okay to watch.  But I can't abide 'watching' a story unfold with no choice but to pull the trigger.  You have to fight to progress the story and there is no other option - fight and win or start over and fight and win....Take care!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2005"}

The background music is pretty nice also. As for the game play, it the same as the others. Just hackin monsters up. There are some nice upgraded functions such as you can now carry a backup weapon. You click on the 1 key above your weapon for a weapon and/or shield or 2 for your backup weapon or shield. They also have allowed more strorage space in your storage chest. Another nice function is being able to revive any of the characters you hired to help you on your quest. There are many new weapons and other items (though most of them are for the 2 new characters added to the game), so I haven't gotten to see what they can do yet. The new monsters they have added are very cool. I have only played through the first 3 quests so far, but I haven't seen the same monster yet. There are only 2 things I didn't like about this game so far. 1 was the price. It is a little steep for an expansion pack that has only 1 added chapter, and 2 was how easy it has been so far. I have beaten the first 3 quests in less than 5 hours and until the end of the last quest, I wasn't in any real danger of dying (this was with a level 36 Barbarian). Other than those 2 things, this game has been alot of fun. And don't worry about everyone saying there is no story or the music is repetitious in every Diablo game released. They keep buying and so should you because it is just fun. Enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2001"}

When Diablo 3 comes out, Starcraft 2 will be dead to me.DIABLO 3 COME SOON AND SAVE US ALL!Starcraft 2 has been out for a few months now and I'm bored out of my mind playing it, melee and custom. I remember playing Starcraft 1 and how I was totally addicted to everything. I spent most of my high school youth (sad as that sounds) playing this and Diablo. I'm in custom games for SC2 and the only thing I can really find are a bunch of tower defense or mass spawning games like Nexus Wars (there are tons of similar games as well). I've been waiting FOREVER for Firebat Tag or some sort of fun tag game and I'm guessing no one is going to come up with one till maybe a year or two from now. I also thought that maybe this feeling was just me, but the proof is also in my friends list. I have over 40 people in my friends list and when this game started and a month or two in, 20-30 of them were on a lot. A month or so of not playing and I come back and now I only have 2-5 people on, which has been so for almost two weeks now.So I've sort of given up on Starcraft 2. Maybe another year or two and hopefully they will fix the following below and there will be a lot better custom games available. Overall, SC2 died because it was overhyped, over a dozen years in the making, and it's practically the same in many areas and worse where it counts. I was expecting A LOT more. I'm sad that Blizzard, a company that usually has a great reputation for making highly successful games, have failed on one of my favorite types of MMOs.Let's all hope they don't murder Diablo 3 as well.I have pretty much the same complaints as the majority, including some of my own personal feuds with it.1. Can't change usernames - you can change it now but it took months and should have been something available at the very beginning. They should have also said in clear, over-sized fonts that the name chosen would be your final. Now you can change it once for free, but pay for it afterwards. Thanks blizzard.....I was basically running around for a few months now with the lame username of Zerg. I made it because I thought I'd get a rare original name and that I could make multiple usernames. Fortunately for me though, some people still think there's such a thing as an original name so I get to gloat once in awhile. \"Yeah, I have the rarest name in the world, ENVY MEEEEE!\"2. No original names - So if you have a name, a ton of other people have it. Not to mention you can't even add numbers to your names, which kills the thought of originality even more.3. Clan Tags - Still don't see it available.4. No Chatrooms - this is one of the biggest issues to me because other than playing games, I would also use it to socialize with my gaming friends. Chatrooms and private chatrooms help people organize games they want to play with each other and so on.5. Personalize game names and Party and Invite System - Before in SC1, you can tell your friends the game name you wanted and they can copy and paste it into the search and be in there. Now you got to party up or invite one by one. I don't like to party up because if one person doesn't accept the game you want, you sort of have to wait and I'm not sure if they fixed this yet, but if you go into a game that has separate teams like a 1v1v1v1 kind of game like a custom game, you can't really join because being in the same party, the party system only works for games that'll let you be on the same team.... I understand the use of the new organization system, but I would like the option to revert to customized game names as well...6. Backstabbing is now replaced by a custom game called Phantom which I find is nowhere as fun. Backstabbing should be left as it was in the first one because it gives the feeling of real battle, where there's more randomness and unpredictability. In phantom, you already know there's a backstabber. I don't want that, I just want it the way it was, where you play a game like computer stomping or even just melee and thinking everything is great and then it happens.7. I don't really like how you can't run between stuff like pylons with my probe. This is a personal thing, but I like being able to run between certain closely built buildings, it's very useful for custom tag games.8. Profile icons look like crap. They look neat blown up, but when people join games, it looks like trash. Like one person would have this icon that I really thought was barf. Most of them look too small and the details so hard to see that earning them seems not so much of a reward. I play on a 24\" LCD Monitor by the way, so I would say I'm the majority or a little over.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"clifford goldenberg","summary":"nice game","reviewText":"Any disappointment i felt over the GameCube launching without a Mario game was gone after playing Luigi's mansion.

{"product_name":"B0016BVYAM","summary":"A brilliant evolution","reviewText":"I just finished playing the singleplayer campaign. I have to admit that I absolutely adored the first Bioshock and was waiting for this one's release with tremendous anticipation. You may think that biases me towards a positive review; but it also sets me up for bigger disappointment when things aren't quite up to snuff.First, setting aside the issues that have compelled other reviewers to give the game one or two stars: Games for Windows Live is annoying as hell but did not cause the game to crash for me. It simply caused a long delay in the game start-up sequence while GFWL signed in, not allowing any other actions. I would have opted not to log in if I had the choice.The single biggest disappointment is that this one, just like the first one, crashes instantly using DX10. My prior gaming rig wouldn't even start up a level without crashing; I'm now on a gaming laptop with a GTX 260M card, completely different specs, and it still crashes straight out of the starting gate. That's REALLY disappointing. Is DX10 really THAT finnicky that they can't even do basic QA on the thing?Overall the game stability was OK. There were about a dozen freeze-ups / crashes that hosed the whole machine and forced me to hard-reboot, but at the same time, my new gaming rig (Asus G72GX) hasn't been the most reliable anyway... I'm as liable to blame the computer as I am the game.Now for the actual game. It is an evolution, not a revolution. Everything is a little bigger, little better, a little more realistic, a little more fun. The graphics and environments are better, the sound is better, the voice acting is better, you can explore more and do more in this game than the last (such as walking underwater and picking up & throwing enemies with Telekinesis 3 plasmid, just like the gravity gun in HL2!) but there is no concept that is fundamentally different about this one from the last. That's not a bad thing; the last game was brilliant, and boatloads of fun. This one was just different enough to know that a lot of work had been done on it to make the environments more realistic and engrossing, to make the physics and character models more realistic. Unless my memory is failing me, there's a fair bit more \"elective exploration\" in this one than in the last one; in the last one there were a few rooms and hideaway spots that you needed to look for, that you wouldn't see if you just followed the game's prompts, but all of the large spaces were by and large explored fully just by playing through the game. In Bioshock 2, there are rooms and large spaces all over the place that you won't see if you don't go looking for them.The only part about the game that seemed to be pretty cheap is the cutscenes; it's not subtle that they cut corners there. There is far less (almost none) animation in the cutscenes. Just flashing still images, or nothing (blank). A lot of really neat scenes could have been animated and would have been enthralling to see, but instead, your screen simply flashes white and you hear some noise in the background and the gameplay comes back in a different scene. I guess you have to fill in the details with your imagination.Overall, if you liked/loved Bioshock, can be patient with GFWL, and don't mind being stuck in DX9c, forget about all the whiners, buy the game, and have a blast. This game is good enough to buy NOW (that is, it's good enough to justify the sticker price). I had very high expectations (with the bar being set by the first game) and was not at all disappointed, despite early frustration with the total instability of the game running in DX10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Movie Lover","summary":"This game was better than the first one!","reviewText":"\"Halo Combat Evolved\" had a better story mode than \"Halo 2\".

Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Survival Horror LIVES","reviewText":"Although a bit clique and at times repetitive, Alan Wake met my expectations and you are reading a review from a guy whose been eating up horror games ever since the very first Clock Tower (ever since the first Castlevania for that matter).The story of the insomniac, temperamental horror writer whose stories are coming to life is nothing new (The Dark Half, In the Mouth of Madness). This is where Alan Wake fails to terrify the way it should, because you know what's turning the world upside down just by reading the back of the box. I would rather leave it to the imagination to guess why the world has gone insane.Still, for what story this game tells, it tells it well. It's played out in intervals. At the start of every \"Episode\" you talk to people, get to know the town, play past events prior to Alan's arrival to Bright Falls. Then you're thrown deep into a dark environment, most of the time in the woods, but sometimes you'll find yourself in a specific area of the town and all you have to do is make it to someplace alive. Then the whole cycle starts over again with the next \"Episode.\" This makes for a very linear game. I was hoping for a more sandbox style game where you can explore and find hidden objectives inside peoples houses, or in the shopping mall or the lumber mill. Instead you are tossed wherever the director wants you to be. But the gameplay was fast paced and the environments were suspenseful enough to keep me playing until I absolutely had to go sleep. At work or doing chores all I would think about is getting back into it. Why is that?Because this game has got style. Alan Wake has got to be the most beautiful game I have ever seen, and hooked up to my home movie theater surround system, I felt the horrors were in the room with me. The gameplay itself is also very cinematic. The enemies are hordes of possessed townsfolk called \"The Taken\" and they like to ambush you as you follow the dark forest trails. Before you know it you're dodging axes, chainsaws, and sharp projectiles--each successful evasion played in slowmotion. You have to weaken them with your flashlight before you can shoot them, so you'll be doing quite a lot of evasive movements. You also have flares that you set off when you find yourself cornered and completely surrounded. Flash bang grenades for the real big guys. Once you exercise \"The Taken\" using all the illumination at your disposal (which sometimes include flare guns and spotlights) you blow them away with either a revolver or shotgun. The beam of your flashlight is your aim. So combat is very tactical. You have got to have a plan for any given scenario, using and sparing the weapons you find.When being bombarded by enemies become tiresome, they step it up a notch with you being chased by a possessed bulldozer, streets and bridges blowing up as you try to cross, the sky raining cars and other heavy metal objects.I personally feel that a true horror game is played mostly in dark, silent environments, but when Ozzy Osbourne starts to play in the background as you're taking off heads, that was awesome too. Like I said, this game has got STYLE.Even the story segments (that you play and interact with as well) are very stylish and cinematic. Often times when you are walking around and Alan sees something like a prominent building across the lake on the side of a mountain, the screen prompts you to hold the L button so the camera will pan out and focus in on what he's looking at and he'll start to narrate his thoughts. Really neat how they did that.Being an American horror game, I'm not surprised or disappointed that it didn't do for me what Silent Hell did for me when I first played that a decade ago. Yet Alan Wake feels new even though it borrows old subject matter (did I mention you had to use light to survive in Alone in The Dark as well?) I thought I've seen the end of Survival Horror with Fatal Frame III, but Alan Wake has brought it from the depths where it has been buried for so, so very long.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"Bearcat","summary":"FIrst portable console, what the psp should have been.","reviewText":"So I've had the first edition bundle since last Wednesday.  The Vita is stunning, the bundle not so much.  The 4gb memory card is one you will quickly outgrow.  The card should have been at least an 8gb but more like a 16gb.  You can't fit much on the 4gb, especially when you start downloading demos.  Little deviants, while not the best game ever, does a good job of showing off the vita's various input methods.  It's a nice title but it won't wow anyone really.  The Vita case that is included is actually really nice.  It has little slots for game cards and you can put the cord in also.  The case is a semi-hard case meaning it's not plastic on the outside but you can feel something solid inside the felt, probably a plastic shell.  For protection and aesthetics it is the best case you can get in my opinion.This brings us to the Vita itself.  It is a beast of a machine.  If you buy the 3g version you do not have to sign up for the AT&T; monthly service so I did not.  You do have to have the 3g version to get GPS though and you need GPS to use the \"Near\" software which is pretty cool.  The near software allows you to see other Vita owners, how close they are to you, the games they have played and other cool things.  The web browser is good for quick looks at your favorite sites.  It's nice to be able to see your friends list and each game will tell you what friends have/are playing it and their various accomplishments they have gained.  The real star of this piece of equipment is the OLED screen and the dual analog sticks.  The screen really is as good as everyone says.  It's stunning.  The dual analog sticks, while small, work well and allow the Vita to play games that other systems just couldn't do comfortably.  The Vita feels solidly made and the size feels good in the hand.  Not to big, not to small.The front touchscreen is among the best I have ever used, and I use a lot of apple and samsung touchscreen products.  The back touch area takes some getting used to but is a nice touch and I think it will be used for some neat innovative game play as more games utilize it.  About the games....the Vita has a really great release lineup of games.  I personally own Uncharted, Wipeout, Lumines, Hot Shots Golf and the download only Escape Plan.  Uncharted is the first game I have ever played on a portable that has drawn me in like a console game.  This sounds stupid but I honestly didn't even think about the fact that it was on a portable as I was playing it.  I was just that much into the gameplay.  Yes there are a few things that feel gimmicky on uncharted where they want you to use the touchscreen but overall this game is top notch.  Wipeout is awesome too and cross platform play with the PS3 is a great feature to have available.  Lumines is great and has great music, Hot Shot Golf is basically just the normal hot shots game but it looks awesome on that big 5 inch OLED screen.  Escape plan is an original downloadable title that is well executed but not for the fast paced gaming fan.Overall the Vita is awesome.  I have owned literally every single portable gaming system I can think of...from the original game boy to the Atari Lynx and now the Vita.  The Vita is the first portable game system that actually has the firepower to change the portable gaming market.  Call of Duty, recently announced for this fall to hit the Vita, could be a huge game changer for the Vita and portable gaming in general.  The Vita has the muscle to pull it off and has every opportunity to succeed and have a long life as a portable system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

Batica","summary":"Great for all ages, especially for kids","reviewText":"Pokemon Stadium is a great game for all ages. There really is no vicious violence and the game is very easy to play and any kid can get used to this game and get good at it. For the rest of you parents out there, if there was any game that you could chose for your kid, the Pokemon series is a good start.Pokemon Stadium plays just like the Gameboy version except with no adventuring. Basically, this is where you bring the Pokemon that you have raised on your Gameboy and put them to the test in several Pokemon challenges from tournament style challenges on 4 levels of competition (easy to hard) and become a master at the game.I know I said there was no adventuring but there is one and that's the Gym Leader's challenge when you take on all of the Gym Leaders from the Red and Blue series like Borkc, Misty and many more until you reach the Master's Gym where you take on the final four and I assure you on this one, they don't roll over for anyone!The one thing that I really didn't like about the game was that the rental Pokemon are for the most part, really weak. Seriously, I could do without having 2 defensive moves or 1 really good move and 3 kind of in between ones. But then again, that's why you raise your Pokemon on the Gameboy Red and Blue. That way, you know what you're fighting with.The other thing that I thought was pretty cool was all of the Kiddie games and stuff. It was nice to see another set of games inside of an already good game.Again, if you haven't gotten into Pokemon, it's a good start for any parents who are unsure on what to get their kids and it's very good for kids because us parents don't have to worry about any of our kids testing new moves they saw on a game on each other. Again, excellent game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGXM","description":"Nintendo Fortune Street RVLPST7E PC Games","reviewerName":"credit risk","summary":"More in depth Monopoly","reviewText":"This game is (roughly speaking) Monopoly with some strategy.You do buy properties in the game.  It is best if you own multiple properties of the same color.  You do go around a board.  There are random events that happen.But there is much more to this game.  There is a stock market in the game that allows you to buy and sell stock in the various property districts.  This gives you another way to make money in the game.  And will make a player who has multiple properties of the same color think twice about improving them if you own a ton of stock in them because your stock will go up when they do improve the properties.You can also buy out properties from players for multiples of the original price if you really need to break a hold they have on a district or if you want to get 3 or more properties of the same color.  You can make trades with other players too.  And there are plenty of random events that drive stock prices up or down or force you to sell your property or give you a chance to buy unowned property among other things.  There are also boards with unique property spaces like a tax property that taxes players 10% of their net worth.  And much more.As an adult I got into this game and thought it was great.  My kids didn't quite get all the strategy to the game.  My 11 yr old did a pretty good job of \"getting it\" actually.  My 5 yr old didn't get it.  And the game can be trying when playing with him because wrong button presses can have him selling property accidentally not to mention he has a short attention span.  But after a few games he got into it and got the basics.  He knew you wanted as many of one color of property as possible.  He knew it was desirable to improve properties.  And he liked to buy stock.  I helped him with the numbers in the stock market and took over the control when purchasing the stocks to help speed things up and prevent a mistake, but he liked it even if he fully didn't understand it.  It helps that Dad and his brother were enjoying the game as well.Now the game took a long time to play the first time around.  But as you get a few games under your belt you can cut your time playing drastically downward by just being familiar with the gameplay and rules and boards.  You can also speed up any computer players you play with and speed up the messages as well.  Also the board you choose to play on determines the game length.  Smaller boards take quite a bit less time to play as you will get paid quicker (sort of like passing go in Monopoly) which in turn gets you towards your goal quicker which is to accumulate x amount of money and make it to the bank first. Last you can choose the money goal in the game.  The lower you set the goal the shorter the game will be.I do think they should have let you save local multiplayer games.  They do not.  The graphics are serviceable.  But won't win awards.  The backgrounds to the boards though are a nice touch.Oh and let me mention that I didn't play single player at all.  Neither have my kids played it.  WE also did not play over the wi-fi connection.  I can't comment on those aspects of the game.But for 3 players plus a computer player it was a blast.  We played 10+games over a month or so.It is a bit steep for $50.  AT $37 it is more tempting.  This game could be too much for many young kids.  The game is more for older kids and adults or for young kids if you have a patient adult.  Don't let the cartoony look of the game fool you.I recently bought Mario Party 9 for my kids.  But I have had way more fun with Fortune Street and I think my 11 yr old did too.  Maybe my 5 yr old.  It is more mentally stimulating to me than MP9.  And it is something new compared to Mario Party.  Note:  MP9 and FS are completely different games other than both are board games.Anyway take a chance on this game if you like board games.  And if you want some mental stimulation and have family and friends to play with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

Taking the point and click genre to different levels on the DS, Hotel Dusk makes you turn your DS sideways to play it, making it look like you're playing an open book instead of a video game.  And book is the word to describe this unique game, as Hotel Dusk pays numerous odes to the crime-noir fiction of yesteryear with it's engaging story, colorful characters, and dark and mysterious atmosphere.  Hotel Dusk: Room 215 puts you in the shoes of Kyle: a disgraced and grizzled former detective trying to piece together a puzzle surrounding the people staying at Hotel Dusk.  There is more to the story, but revealing any more would ruin the surprises that are abound throughout this game, and the intricacy of the game's story is probably the most surprising thing of all.  The character designs are wonderfully drawn and utilized, almost looking like an interactive comic book.  Also, Hotel Dusk is easy to pick up and play, even for gamers who have never played a point and click type game before.  If there's any drawbacks to Hotel Dusk, it's that it's slow pace will be a major turn off for many gamers.  While the game is easy to pick up and play, not everyone will stick with it due to it's pacing.  Also, on occasion, the game's story does suffer from some typical puzzle and adventure trappings, and does feel linear to a point.  Despite all that though, Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is yet another unique and exclusive title for Nintendo's wonderous, dual screened handheld, and if you own a DS, you should definitely check this game out; you'll be pleasently surprised.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2007"}

When I ordered a second controller (for co-op), though, I couldn't stop playing it. I began to understand the objectives and collecting stickers and it's also cool how you can customize your character any time in the game (with outfits, skins, glasses, hats, hair, etc. that you've earned) and you can even customize your space pod with all of the decorations and stickers you've earned. Create-a-level mode is also pretty cool, you earn tools and contraptions and then you get to place them in your own level. The game starts out really easy but it gets much more challenging after that. If you have a PS3 and don't have this game, you have to get it. It's impossible to have a PS3 without this.

Usually, it happens in the beginning.  If I can get past that, I'm okay.  Sometimes, it happens when I'm almost finished with a level.WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT SWAP FORCE?The new thing is the body parts can be swapped so I can do bonus missions.  When I upgrade, I can upgrade either the top or bottom of the body.I can finish the game with one Skylander.  To do the bonus missions, I have to buy more Skylanders SWAP Force characters.

{"product_name":"B000GH3PYA","description":"Building upon the addictive and easy-to-learn gameplay of a puzzle game by integrating story and character progression elements found in RPGs.  Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords delivers a brand new type of game that pushes the puzzle genre to a previously unseen level.","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Refreshing take on a crowded RPG scene for the DS","reviewText":"In a genre that has been rehashed and redone ever since Final Fantasy appeared on the NES, along comes a game like Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords that challenges your perception of what an \"RPG\" is.For starters, you literally are building not only a character but a city which helps build your characters.  Eventually in the game you'll be forging runes you've earned from searching into new weapons, armor and accessories, training \"mounts\" which boost various combat skills, and being able to lay \"siege\" to kingdoms which are the BEST way to raise gold in this game.  Everything ties in together seamlessly, and all are very important to make the game easier to tolerate.The main quest, if that is your interest, can be quite short; however, this game has serious legs when it comes to the side quests, probably the biggest set of those on the DS.  Not only do those side quests add additional experience and gold as rewards, but you can also earn weapons and armor from them as well, saving your gold for upgrading your abilities.Who hasn't played an RPG that requires a great deal of \"level grinding\" in order to complete?  You can actually get around this in PQ:COTW by simply \"donating gold\" to increase your abilities, in fact, I would recommend you do this for abilities that normally would require 2-3 upgrade points and use your normal \"level up\" points for the ones that require only 1.And now, the thing that makes PQ:COTW most unique is the way you conduct battles, in a \"bejeweled\" format.  I didn't get \"super powerful\" until near the last 1/4 of the game, and up until then you have to use strategy properly.  I've read a lot about \"cheap\" combos the computer seems to get, but if you are playing the boards properly and managing your battle this should not hurt you very often.  It's critical to not only have the right spells with you, but match the correct mana needed to cast them.  All in all, just this part of the game alone make PQ stand out from the field.I got my copy at Best Buy for only $15 and it's one of the best purchases I have made in a video game.  I still have plenty of side quests I haven't accomplished yet, and there's 3 other characters to take through!  If you are an RPG fan, this is a must buy.  If you are new to the RPG scene, and want to get a taste of it without insane level grinding and mind numbing puzzles, this is a great place to start as well.Hopefully there will be a sequel soon.

The first truly next-gen Spidey title is a can't-miss experience for fans of Marvel's web swinging, crime-busting hero. Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, DS, PC, Activision, T.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A great game for fans of the classic Spider-Man 2","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying thatSpider-Man 2, one of the best \"movie\" tie-in video games ever, was one of my all time favorite games of the original Xbox's lifespan. I always saw Web of Shadows, but ignored it for whatever reason. I started paying more attention to it recently, and decided to give it a shot. It seems to be fans' favorite of the current generation of Spider-Man games, so why not? Is it worth it? Is Web of Shadows the best Spidey game out there right now? Well, it really depends on your perspective.Web of Shadows continues in the tradition of the giant open world tradition started by SM2. Once again, web-swinging is absolute perfection. It's intuitive, it's fast, and the developers at Shaba and Treyarch did a great job at Spidey's animations. For fans of web-slinging, this is thee game to get. It's great. You'd expect that, of course, but Web of Shadows exceeds what I expected in that way. Of note is also the revamped and very dynamic combat system. It makes you feel like a very dexterous superhero like a Spider-man game should. There are various combat styles to utilize: ground, air, and wall. A surprisingly large amount of rpg elements show up, like experience points for defeating enemies and completing bonus missions. There is a pretty well-balanced leveling up system that you have access to which opens up as the story progresses, so there's a lot of balance. You also get access to two suits, the classic one and the symbiote, which both play different enough to compliment different play styles. The gameplay in WoS is very, very comprehensive and pretty huge. It's impressive.UnlikeSpider-Man 2andSpider-Man 3, this game is not attached to a movie and instead features an original story that bears a striking resemblance toPrototype, just with symbiotes instead of a Resident Evilike virus. It's actually pretty decent, and interesting enough that I cared to play through the entire game twice (as well as see all four possible endings). You see, like InFamous, you have to make moral choices in this game. Be a hero by choosing the red suit path, or give in to power with black suit choices. The moral system is implemented well enough, I guess. Sometimes it really feels inconsequential and forced though. I mean, c'mon, why would Spider-Man ever choose the \"evil\" choice? It doesn't really make sense, but can be fun if having fun is your main priority. The graphics are not bad at all. In fact, they're pretty good, with some of the common open world game problems though.I really loved my time with Web of Shadows, but as much as I want to, I just can't rate Web of Shadows 5 stars. There are multiple issues that do keep it from perfection, here are some of the most notable problems: There are problems with loading and clipping. You would expect that from open world games, but Web of Shadows has some serious issues there. I noticed this especially in the last act of the game, where all hell breaks loose in New York. When you level Spider-Man up enough that his web-slinging is very fast and there's a lot of stuff going on around you, Spidey would reach a point in the city before it had time to load and I'd literally hit invisible walls and freeze there midair for 2-3 seconds at times, until the environment detail finally loaded. It got to the point it was almost unplayable, with frame rate barely chugging and freezing often, I kid thee not. That really broke up the awesome web-slinging and immersive nature of the game. The voice acting is absolutely horrendous, most of the time. Spider-man is by far the worst offender in this way. I usually don't mind cheesy or poor voice acting, but this was so bad I couldn't help but cringe. The writing for dialogue was pretty bad too (if you want a Spidey game with awesome dialogue, style, and voice acting, check outSpider-Man: Shattered Dimensions). Also, I found the music to be super mediocre and really boring. What I did, and this actually turned out to be awesome, was plug my iPod into the Xbox and listen to my own music while playing. If you thought web-swinging through virtual New York was awesome, trying doing it while listening to Dntel, Errors, Secede, or Faunts (all bands/musical artists I highly recommend looking up if you want great music to web-swing to). Seriously, it's amazing.Something I must note is that lot of the bonus goals/missions were extremely repetitive and merely act as filler. My first playthrough, I did most of the bonus goals and got almost all 2000+ collectables (2000 maxes out Spidey's web-slinging/dexterity), making all black suit decisions (I couldn't resist Black Cat, she's in this game, and she's awesome) and got both possible black suit endings. It took me at least 20-25 hours to do this. My second playthough, I made all red suit choices and got both red suit endings, and ignored everything but the main story. missions. It took MAYBE 5 hours maximum total to get through all three acts(the first two acts took me about an hour and a half). That should show you how much filler is in the game. Stopping crime is fun, killing symbiote zombies are fun, but there should be more variety in a game like this. It's an issue you see a lot in open-world games like this, but Web of Shadows offends more than other games in the genre. Even Spider-man 2 had more variety in its distractions.So there you go. Web of Shadows is a fantastic game with some notable shortcomings that keep it from absolute perfection. It may be the last open world Spidey game for a long time, and therefore the best, since Beenox is now thee exclusive Spider-Man developer and their focus is much more linear and focused. In my opinion, Web of Shadows ties in quality withShattered Dimensionsfor best Spider-Man game on the current generation consoles. It's strengths are SD's weaknesses, and vise versas. I'd definitely recommend Web of Shadows to any fan of Spider-man and open world games alike. It is exceptional in the ways you want from a Spider-Man video game, but you have to go in with the right mindset so its problems don't grate too much on your patience. I certainly enjoyed it, enough to actually get every achievement and 1000 gamerscore points, something that merits mention because I never enjoy a game enough to do that. Only my favorite games get that time and attention from me. My recommendation: rent it or buy it cheap, let the virtual breeze pass you as you swing past skyscrapers, and immerse yourself in it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2011"}

OP weapons like dual FMG9's and the Striker. last but not least, the campers are the WORST. it's an epidemic. Every time i get into a match it's not 30 seconds before I am killed by some lowlife social degenerate head glitching behind a vehicle or crouching in a corner aiming down his sights waiting for someone like me (who actually plays the objective) to walk in front of him. I am not a KD person, but I go positive at least 50 percent of the time in Black Ops 2, but I go negative almost all the time in MW3. Oh yeah, death streaks. That's nice too.

To me, the things that matter most are a strong sense of speed, good handling of the vehicles, and graphics. I have played Ridge Racer games on the original Playstation, and I admit that they sucked...bad! However, I picked up RR7 on the launch day of the PS3, and I will say that I made the best choice! RR7 has realistic looking graphics, great music, fun controls (albeit with a moderate learning curve), and a good sense of speed. I highly recommend it for people looking for a racing game featuring modern, realistic vehicles. There are no weapons or anything, this is pure racing, but makes extensive use of the online Playstation Network, has free downloadable content, online rankings galore, and countless modes of online competitive racing, complete with online gambling (with points). I could go on and on about it, but the best thing to do is just buy a copy. You will not be disappointed if you enjoy pure racing games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2007"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

No longer do you need to destroy the brain or burn a zombie to destroy it completely and while no storage crates is more realistic, it just creates a lot of needless backtracking to get a certain item you left somewhere. Also, while having two playable characters may sound good in theory, soon enough you'll just play as Billy thanks to his ability to take more punishment and use Rebecca as a sort of pack mule since she can carry more items.

{"product_name":"B0050SXU3Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"The best platformer/adventure game I've played on the PS3. PERIOD.","reviewText":"This is the only Sly Cooper game I've played. I gave it a try because of all the great things I heard about the previous games. This is one of the few games I've purchased on release day, and I'm glad I did!Combat - Honestly, I didn't expect much in this department. Afterall, this is a platformer that's not known for spectacular fighting sequences. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Sly starts off with one or two basic melee attacks, but you'll be able to acquire more moves as you progress through the game. Keep in mind that this is a stealth game that doesn't really 'encourage' the player to engage in combat, but you'll have a few attacks at your disposal if needed. Although the moves are simple in their nature, they're pretty fun to execute. If Sly was the only playable character in the game, I probably would not have enjoyed the combat as much as I did. Luckily, I had the opportunity to play as 9 different characters! There's a nice balance of melee and long-ranged attacks (some players only have melee attacks, while others have long-ranged attacks in addition to their melee attacks). Don't get me wrong, while you probably won't confuse this combat with DmC or God of War, you'll still have a fun time fighting.Weapons - Sly only has one weapon (a cane) that he primarily uses. But, once you enter a new area/map you'll eventually uncover a new costume that offers it's own very unique weapon. I'll refrain from commenting on each specific costume because uncovering these is part of the allure of the game - So I don't want to spoil any surprises. Earlier, I mentioned other playable characters in the game. Each character has his/her own weapon. Five of the characters are Sly's ancestors, which means they look similar to him, and they all have some variation of his cane. One ancestor's cane has a special attack that changes it into a sword, while another ancestor's cane can transform into a gun, and so on. Although the weapons are simple, you'll enjoy them more than you think.Enemies - Fortunately, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time doesn't suffer from some of the problems that other games of this genre fall victim to. The enemy formula here is pretty straight forward - you'll find brand new enemies with each new area/map you encounter. Wow, what a novel concept! Here are the types: Large (difficult to beat), average size (puts up a good fight), and small (easily defeated). Although each area has 3 enemies types, they all look different and offer up different attacks. Since this is a stealth game, you will not have to fight anyone unless discovered. Finally; boss battles that are reminiscent of those old school Nintendo and Sega Genesis games! None of the boss battles were strictly hack n slash. Each boss had a particular weakness, and it'll be your job to figure out what it is. There are six bosses in total, and each 'weakness' is vastly different from the others. I'll warn you, these battles are anything but easy (regardless of what some reviewers may say). I can pretty much guarantee you won't beat any of them on the first attempt.Miscellaneous - There's no tracking in regards to how much time is spent playing the game. I'll put it this way: If you're the type that takes your time and enjoys exploration, this will be a long game. However, if you're the type that likes to go from mission to mission, it may not take you very long to beat. One of my favorite things about this title is that it encourages exploration. If you get lost, you can press a button that's results in an on screen arrow pointing you towards your goal. Hmm, if only other adventure games did that *ACHOO spyro dawn of the dragon ACHOO* sorry, I forgot to take my Allegra...In conclusion, this is a fantastic game. This game is special because each new map feels like you're playing a brand new game. As with most of my reviews, I do have one minor criticism. There are quite a few mini-games throughout the experience. Most of them are a nice change of pace. I ran into a few that were downright annoying and unnecessary. Any mini-game that requires you to move your controller (not analog sticks, the actual controller) and tilt it in a certain way just to complete the challenge is just dumb. This is the only game I've played that in my opinion, is worth more than the release day price tag ($39.99).

I would not call it a kiddy game though.  I am 25, and at first I was having a difficult time figuring everything out.  But once you get a couple of hours into it and get aquainted with everything it gets great.  It just takes a litle bit of time to know what is going on.

Is that saying much?  Well, yes and no.  Overall, the game is good.  However, when stacked against its PS3, 360, and PC brethren it fails to compare, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.The plot is your standard alien invasion story/government cover-up.  Nothing new, but it's still intriguing.  The graphics are nice to look at, considering it's the Wii.  However, I really don't think they are that much better than Metroid Prime: Corruption's.  It does have a solid framerate with decent shadows and particle effects.  The controls are similar to Metroid's.  Aim with the Wiimote and move with the nunchuck (pretty precise).  I like how you can throw grenades using the nunchuck, but it takes a little practice (I usually end up throwing them way over the enemies heads).There is a nice assortment of aliens/enemies.  Environments are a little bland (again, it's the Wii).  Maybe it's me, but sometimes the AI can be brutal.  Enemies come in waves and there's no cover system, so you really have to keep moving.  In that vein, the game really doesn't have much that's innovative.  Even the All Seeing Eye (A.S.E) doesn't do much more for you than expose switches on the walls or explosives on the ground.The Conduit was the main reason I bought another Wii (I had previously sold my first one because it was collecting dust).  At this point I'm probably enjoying House of the Dead: Overkill more than The Conduit.  It's not that I don't like The Conduit.  I just may have had overly high expectations.  At some level I'm probably comparing it to Killzone 2, Gears 2, and COD4 (which I know I shouldn't do).  As a Wii FPS, it's a definite 4 stars.  In the vast realm of FPS's, it's more like a 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}

This is a game from the guys who brought us the excellent Heavenly Sword. When it first came out , it did not support Dolby DIgital on the PS3 only which was a bit of a let-down but that is now fixed as of the latest patch.This is a meaty 10 to 12 hr game(if you like looking around for collectable energy orbs and masks like me) and it does have some re-playability a you can reply any level keeping all your upgraded  powers to search for stuff that you didn't find the first time through. The graphics are gorgeous and do not believe the crap about the PS3 version having a spotty frame rate and screen tearing. I did not notice much screen tearing and the frame rate only dropped near the end of the game. Overall, it is very smooth. Load times are not too bad. There is a mandatory install like nearly all PS3 games which will take about 4 to 5 minutes.The only negative was mentioned by most reviewers. The camera can be troublesome sometimes. Especially when you are surrounded by bots and getting wailed on and can't figure out what you are hitting!! My main advice would be to upgrade your block first!! I didn't use block at all in the early part of the game and it really made the combat a lot harder than it needed to be. The block has a limited time but literally blocks ALL DAMAGE so you wait for the bot to do its attack, then beat it up until it starts its next attack block and repeat until all the bots are destroyed.I loved this game but cannot recommend the one DLC for this game(Pigsy's Perfect 10) unless you like stealth which I definitely do not like so I gave up about 45 minutes into it and feel like I threw away 10 bucks.

The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"O.P.T. \"O.P.T.\"","summary":"Pretty freakin' sweet","reviewText":"I'm about five years late here but better late than never...just bought and played this game for the first time after seeing a bunch of great reviews for it.

Everyone knows all the good things about the game, so here are my only complaints:--It's too damn long.  The game just seemed to keep GOING and GOING and GOING and after about 20 hours I was ready for it to be over already.--The stupid cut scenes...most of them were pointless and even cheesy at times.  The only thing worse than the cut-scenes were the cut-scenes that would require you to quickly mash random buttons in order to get past the stupid thing.--The ending.  First off the end dude was way too easy--I beat him on my first attempt (yet I can't say that for any of the other bosses in the game).  Then the stupid jet ski part...like I really wanted to spend 20 minutes figuring that out.

Bluetooth A2DP (Stereo Streaming) and PS3 controler is great","reviewText":"If you sign up for a European Playstation Store Account, you get the Gran Turismo for FREE until 10/10/2009.The PSP Go feels so so at first but I'm starting to liking it more and more.  The more I play around with it, the better it feels.I bought the PSP Go in Best Buy at launch. There were three PlayStation representatives talked to me and took picture of me holding the White PSP Go, \"Cheers\".  The time was 1:30PM during lunch time.  I guess I was the first customer who bought the PSP Go Pearl White that day in that Best Buy.  After messing around the menu around, I would really like to say PSP Go is so far the best PSP on the market; however, the UMD to downloadable conversion program is yet to be seen especially for importer like myself has NA, European, Asia, and Japanese UMDs.  I just wonder how Sony is going to do with all the legal and technical issues to roll out a good conversion program.I'm not going to mention the specs of the PSP Go because you can do your quick search in Wikipedia and many blogs such as engadget.  I would tell you my very own PSP Go experience.Appearance:As Sony says, they have to standardize the PSP development kits for the developers, so adding an additional analog stick to the PSP Go may cause confusion to all PSP developers and owners.  I think this is just Sony's excuses to focusing on the PSP2 development instead.The dimension is very close to my iPhone 3GS with InCase Slider.  It's basically about the same thickness but lighter.  The reason I choose Pearl White is because fingerprint is not noticeable on light surface plus it's a metallic color of white with twinkling reflections similar to PSP Slim's Silver edition in white color.There is no removable battery so the only slot for you to open is the memory stick micro M2 which is way smaller than Memory Stick Duo, slighter larger than microSD but twice the price of MicroSD.  Usually microSd prices are $2/GB.  So I assume 16GB should be around $32.There is still only one analog stick which is positioned at the bottom left center similar to a PS3 controller.  I think this is a lot more comfortable than any previous generation analog stick location that I have to cramp my thumb in a very uncomfortable way.To turn on the PSP you can either slide the screen upward or push the power button on the left side.  The sliding screen is very similar to MyLo and there is no tilt like Nokia N97 which makes viewing a little bit not natural when your PSP Go is resting on your hands in a relax position.  You have to tilt your hand upward a little to accommodate the screen tilt.  The upward slided screen is kind of blocking my index finger when resting on the L/R trigger buttons.  I really hope the screen can be tilted.The buttons are more recessed compare to previous gen PSPs.  It really feels like DSi but the buttons are looser not as tight as DSi so it shouldn't be a problem for long playing time.  The sliding screen is quite close to the Up and Triangle buttons which sometimes bothers me.  The bumps on the WiFi and the Power switches on the left and right respectively, may cause some pain for long period of intense gaming.The screen has the same resolution as previous PSP models with aspect ratio 16:9, resolution 480x272.  The same resolution as the Zune HD OLED screen.  I would say the smaller screen size does make the screen look sharper.  However, some games with small font sizes may be too small on PSP Go's screen.  About the dark color bleeding problems on previous PSP versions LCDs, the PSP Go does really solve it and a small screen hides the interlace artifacts quite well.  Same as older generation of PSP LCDs, the PSP Go has four degrees of brightness with the brightness setting still limited to AC Power mode.The volume, screen mode, and audio mode buttons have moved on the very top of the PSP Go, which is kind of inconvenient during gaming especially with the screen slided out as I have to look it up or when I'm using the new Sony PSP Go leather case with the front cover kind of blocking me to access the buttons on the top.The Home button has on the bottom left of the sliding screen which is not bad.The WiFi and Bluetooth LEDs on the left and right of the slider screen are quite disturbing in dark places.  When you are using the WiFi, the quite bright green LED just blinks very fast that might cause epileptic seizure.  When the Bluetooth is turned On with device connected, the blue light is solid.  While if there is no connection, the blue LED flashes consistently for every 3 seconds.  I have tested the battery life with Bluetooth turned on, but I assume it shouldn't be too bad compare to corded device.  My car Bluetooth stereo system automatically catches the PSP Go's BT signal and plays music right away!Interface:One noticeable advantage of the slider design is the screen changes to an analog clock with waves moving in the background when pressing the L or R triggers.  To activate the calendar, press L/R trigger simultaneously, you will get a very artsy transition with date numbers shuffle around to form the monthly calendar.  Pressing L or R trigger in the monthly calendar allows you to change months.  The entire interface is just so fluid smooth.  You will also see the PS controller button icons: X, O, [], and Triangle floating behind the calendar and clock.The XMB (Cross Media Bar) is the same as older PSPs so I'm not going to talk much about it.The Internet Browser is as pathetic as before.  It doesn't display any Adobe Flash websites, namely Youtube and Hulu using the latest version 10.  Ironicly, the [...] website NEVER LOADS!  I guess so far there is no any mobile browser as good as iPhone's Safari on the market with Palm Pre and Android closely following behind.There is an option to search for updates for your software automatically without any sweat.PlayStation Store and Media Go:Just like previous generations of PSP firmware, the store interface is the same.  Some other reviewers say the download and install speed via WiFi is slow, I think it's quite impressive for file size most of them more than 300MB to more than 1GB.  I'm using Comcast cable with average 12 Mbps downstream.  My download speed from my PSP Go WiFi is around 400 to 500 KB/sec.  So a 800 MB file should take around 1600 seconds which is around 26 mins.  After the download, just like iPhone/iPod touch, it has to install the software which takes quite a while but it's faster and save more overall energy than buying UMDs either getting it shipped by UPS/Fedex or drive by yourself to the store.  I should say, it's a lot greener to download games online.  Severs and electricity to download games are still far less than driving.Sony did a great job in it's media conversion and syncing tool for your PSP GO.  Media Go is an iTunes like software to access the PSN store.  Sony really replenish the old Sony Connect and PSP Media in terms of functionality and accessibility in the latest Media Go with the added SensMe to accurately recognize songs' moods and tempos.  It works very similar to iTunes but I think it is easier and less confusing than iTunes.  It automatically reads all the directories of your music, pictures, videos, games, and podcasts in your PC and sync with not only PSPs, but any mp3 players even my Zune HD!  The interface is better than iTunes but still behind compare to Zune Software 4.0 with all the Flash and Silverlight artsy UI.  The UI of Media Go is solid.  It does show the memory usage in bar graphs of each devices into different categories: Audio, Videos, Photos, and Others.  For music, the software automatically identifies the mood and the tempo of the songs which is a very unique feature compare to iTunes and Zune Software.  Does Media Go support iTunes music?  Yes it does and in a very very good way by automatically detects DRM free songs and videos from my iTunes and Zune Software, basically my PC harddrives.Upgraded Hardware Features:- Built-in 16GB Flash memory for storage.- Game Pause: this feature is a must have for all portable devices!  It works the same as the PC's hibernate mode where it stores your current state in game into an image file.  This file can beresumed and you will get back to the most intense battle in game immediately even when you are right in front of a bullet, the moment right before your death -- Game Over.  Before your PSP Go battery runs out, it automatically backs up your game state into the image file inside the 16GB flash memory so you can resume it anytime once your battery is charged.  This feature is way better than any standby or sleep mode where you lose all the state when your PSP battery is completely dead.  PSP Go does have sleep feature though.- Built in battery that should last 5 to 6 hours of continuous gameplay.- Built in microphone same as PSP 3000.  Best for Resistance Retribution VOIP and Skype.- Bluetooth 2.1 + EDRThis is the best feature that I have been hoping for since PSP released back in 2005. It is compatible to any Bluetooth headset for VOIP in game and Skype. The A2DP supports Bluetooth stereo audio streaming.  The audio quality is decent with little white noise and I have tried to connect to my Sony Bluetooth stereo dongle and car's Bluetooth system easily.  One thing I need to mention is even though you can set the A2DP device to automatically do stereo streaming or mono headset profile, the PSP Go does not really switch profiles correctly.  I tried to use my A2DP dongle to listen to music and turn on Skype to make a test call.  The A2DP's microphone was not picking up my voice at all, instead it was picked up by the PSP Go's built-in microphone.  The only way to solve it was to manually switch from A2DP to Mono Headset profile to use the microphone.Firmware 6.10 Features:- One of the coolest thing I think for the new firmware update is the SensMe Channels which automatically senses your music tones and beats and categorized into different mood channels in a coverflow 3D way.  One category reflects the time of the day.  There are Energetic, Relax, Mellow, Upbeat, Emotional, Lounge, Extreme, Dance, Newly Added, and Favourites.  I really like this feature and I enjoys this more than my iTunes genius and Zune HD's SmartDJ as it has very beautiful interface with iTunes coverflow but with water moving on the ground. The music mood recognition is pretty accurate!  You really have you try it to truly experience the effects. Below is the link to check out the really elegant SensMe interface[...]Debug and Improvements:- Bluetooth not automatically switches audio profile.  It doesn't change to mono headset mode when using Skype from A2DP automatically.- Built-in camera for video conference and facial recognition for games.- GPS- Browser that can compete with Safari- The USB charging feature seems not working at all!  I can't charge it using my PC USB port. It requires 1.2A or 1.5A at 5V to charge the PSP Go.  My USB mobile charger also doesn't provide enough current to PSP GO.  I really hope Sony can fix this issue in the next firmware upgrade.Final Thoughts:PSP Go hardware is sleek and have solved most of the issues from older PSP.  The price is quite steep; however, you also need to factor in the built-in Bluetooth, 16GB, way smaller and lighter form factor if it's really worth to upgrade.  [...].  It is still up to you to see if you want to experience the future of gaming -- digital download that is going to destroy any trade-in systems.  Sony is still trying to figure out the best to to allow customers to convert their current UMDs into downloadables.  I do have one concern, I have UMD games from all around the world: NA, Europe, Asia, and Japan.  How's Sony going to convert my UMDs from different regions to downloadable games?  Games do rated differently world wide, but PSP and PS3 games are always region unlocked, so I don't see much problem both legally and technically. Sony really needs to figure all the legal and technical issues god speed. UMD ripper as kiosk is a good idea but it's bad when people are trying to line up just to convert their UMDs to digital downloads.  Hacking communities have been ripping UMDs since the dawn of PSP, the technical and legal challenges that Sony currently faces is a convenient anti-piracy UMD conversion system for all loyal UMD owners.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2009"}

I own a \"fat\" a \"slim\" and a Go and what I've noticed that truly sets the go aside from the others is its loading speeds since it's got internal storage I imagine that's a factor, web pages and the Playstation store load much faster, I can't describe how annoying it would get when my 2000 would take forever to load a page and all the broken link pictures for thumbnails. I have yet to have this problem with the Go and being it's all digital I have spent quite a bit of time on the PS store browsing.But yes, I do get the gripe. Why are they charging retail price for digital downloads. To be quite honest, I have never bought a new 40 dollar game for any of my PSPs, as portable equipment I always thought it was a little ridiculous having price points set that high. But the PSP has made it through four generations now so I guess someone out there is buying these games. The prices are outrageous considering that digital games neither need to be pressed, printed or shipped, they might as well add a charge for shipping as well. The current set up of the PS store doesn't allow previewing or demoing of games before you buy them, you have to just buy them and hope you like it, thus far I've purchased a couple PS1 classics MGS and the original Blood Omen: Legacy Of Kain, and Echochrome which is an exclusive game to the network and I have a download going at the moment of this writing for Justice League Heroes which was an awesome Xbox game that I've always wanted back since my original Xbox died. Every game I just mentioned is under $20 But if you're looking for something new like Assassins Creed: Bloodlines then you had better get ready to fork over $39.99 just like you would in a shop.It's true that the network store doesn't have the entire library available for download but would you honestly want to dig through all those crap games just to find the good game that you're looking for? That's why I'm not complaining there are currently many titles I plan to purchase for $20 or less and hopefully by the time I have all of those some of the more expensive titles will have gone down in price (take the hint Sony).Ok, truthfully I have never paid for a brand new PSP, my fat I got at a Gamestop, used, my 2000 I got at a pawnshop and it was very used. I got my Go right here at Amazon used for $[...]. Which is a very fair price for this piece of equipment. I'm imagining that all the bad reviews the Go has received here were from people who paid the $[...] list price and got the same piece of equipment I did, a PSP with no UMD drive and 16 gigs (14 usable actual) memory in place, a store that is, at first glance, a total ripoff that seriously lacks very basic features that any online store has for example, gameplay footage, demos, screenshots, detailed synopsis' and customer reviews, heck they don't even have magazine reviews. Reviews aren't such a problem a quick search on Google of any title will provide you with all the info you need, or at least it has been that way for me so far. But it's, at it's core just another webstore and I imagine that if we all gripe and moan enough Sony will recognize it's flaws and hopefully improve it.Overall, don't buy a Go at list price, it's really not worth it, I'm still feeling the sting from the $[...] I paid. Unless gaming is not what you want it for like me. I wanted a portable media device with storage to spare. The 16gigs onboard and up to 16 gig M2 memory card is enough for lots of video and audio. It browses the web as good as I've ever seen a portable device do and with the gaming it makes it an all around sound device. It's also tiny, it's only slightly bigger than my LG UX700 cell phone and I can actually cram it into a large cell phone holster making it a portable 16gig MP3 player. What it really needs is better support from Sony, or maybe that worded wrong, maybe it's not the equipment but the costumers definitely need to be taken better care of by this company. Ok, so if you already have a slim and you think the Go is something that you would want, then get it. It does everything it was designed to and it does it all quite well in my opinion. But if you're new to PSP, then just get a new slim because until Sony gets their heads out of the collective you-know-whats, this piece of equipment is not so much a gaming solution as it is a portable media solution.Kudos to Sony on this awesome device and I also give Sony a big EPIC FAIL for their \"supporting\" infrastructure that is a big turn off for this device.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}

You walk around, randomly you're attacked, and you do a lot of battling to level up and become more powerful.Without wanting to ruin any details, much of the plot is great.  Squall is a fun main character, mainly because he's such a withdrawn character that he rarely seems to desire to be the center of attention and the leader of everyone, even while he's clearly brilliant at it.  I did find the romantic subplot to be a bit of a stretch at times, but it wasn't too terrible.The only major problem is that special ability system they designed for this installment of Final Fantasy tends to encourage an awful lot of wandering around killing huge numbers of enemies, so there are larger blocks of time than I'd prefer which are devoted to mindless battles rather than the plot itself.  This seems to be a style that SquareSoft has moved away from in later games in the series.Still, on the whole I enjoyed it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2008"}

I finally did some research into the series, and was  amazed by what I read about FF8. I went out and bought a copy right away to  see what it had to offer.I was extremely impressed. Usually games offer  something to adults, or to kids, but rarely do they get a combination that  intrigues both. This has a training system that makes you figure out which  kind of fighter you wish to be, what you want to earn points towards, how  you want to talk to people, and which of your friends make the best allies  against a certain situation.In addition, an embedded card game series is  quite complex, almost chess like. Often we were hard pressed to beat some  of their masters, but winning the games brought great advantages going  forward.The combat and movement wasn't arcade like, where you had to hit  the joystick just right in Spot A to hit the enemy in Spot B. It mostly was  figuring out the right combination of healing, attacking, and defensive  spells to cast to keep your party alive while taking out the enemy. There  was little if any blood and gore. The aim of the fights was to outsmart  your enemy, not to hack ribbons of flesh off of it.And did I mention the  cinematics? The dance scene in particular stands out in my mind as  completely amazing. I would restart there on purpose to see the detail they  put into the movements. If you love good animation, you could buy the game  just to go from scene to scene.If you enjoy role playing and graphic  adventure games at all, I'd highly recommend this one. It does truly have  something for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2000"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

It hinders the game so much and is what really hurts the game.Sometimes things like Magic and Fight will be outlawed totally for a fight. Which means you cant Fight or use Magic for the whole fight!!If you do use an outlawed command then you are penalized by things like taking away 5000 gold or taking away the battles reward which really stinks. And if you use an outlawed command twice in a battle than your character goes to prison and is taken away from the fight. Fun stuff...And what penalties do the enemies get for using outlawed things? Nothing! They are free to do whatever they want without consequence. Wheres the fun in that?All in all the game is still fun with its millions of classes, weapons, skills, characters, and gameplay but it couldve been perfect without its slow, tedious gameplay and without its flawed law system.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2005"}

It also adds a bit of story to altair's past before he died.Unfortunately the game is quite short I felt. It felt like it was only half of a regular assassins creed game. I think because they were already working on assassins creed 3 when they were making this and concentrated more on that one and wanted to rush to get this out within the each year a new assassins creed formula.It had some interesting new additions like bombs which make it a lot more fun making custom bombs. It also added little things like the ability to get into a crowd of people and become incognito and you can usually just let go of the joystick and he walks with them himself without you having to keep up the pace being either to fast or two slow like the previous games.There is a game crashing bug though that annoyed me to no end. If you wanted to play the Desmond stories about his past in this animus type puzzle things sometimes (at least for me and many other players on the PS3 at least) when you try to go through these rooms to enter that part of the game your system would freeze up and you would have to restart the whole system to get it to work. Some people found ways to get around this by not accepting to enter the first time then going through and accepting it. Or some people found if you ran into them it would crash the game instead of walking. I only made it through the first 3 before not wanting to keep going. It mainly just tells the story of Desmond's childhood but its kinda forgettable.You also meet subject 13 which he is a very intriguing character. I found myself wanting to know more about him during the game then of Desmond (which is funny cause most people seem to be disliking Desmond's forgettable character). I actually was sad later at what Subject 13 ends up doing. I am not going to spoil it here you can either look it up online or play the game if you really want to know.At this time I already bought the third game and played this one through a bit faster so that I could play the games in order and unfortunately found that the third game kinda doesn't include these interesting things that this game has. Like where I mentioned when you enter a crowd of people walking the character automatically keeps walking with them. Yeah that's gone in the third game. Seems like they had completely different teams working on these games and didn't allow these improvements to go over into the third game and make it even more polished. I wont go to far into that cause this review is for this game not the third one but I will say the third game wasn't that great to me.This games story was quite good but again like all the assassin creed games it ends on a cliff hanger like usual. But only for the Desmond story. It kinda seems like a good ending for Altair and for Ezio.Conclusion:Fun assassins creed game like its previous ones but unfortunately feels shorter (like by half a game shorter) then the previous ones. I account this from the fact they were working on 3 at the same time as this one I believe. The story is great and its a nice ending to Altair and Ezio. The Desmond stories were forgettable like usual which is a shame. But the introduction of subject 13 was really interesting and a surprise. I dislike the fact he is only around for this game but I guess ubi soft can't make good decisions all the time. Also the game crashing bugs from the Desmond stories is a really bad part of this idk how ubi soft let this ship without noticing that huge bug that's happened to many PS3 players. Really stupid on their part.For around 20 dollars you can't really miss with this game it is short but the story makes up for it I believe.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"Excellent new rythm genre but disappointing song selection","reviewText":"I think everybody has played or at least heard of Guitar Hero, where you smash different colored keys on a plastic guitar replica in rythm to a song. Good fun but it really was just a game.Now Rocksmith has a delightful twist to the genre, rather than playing on a replica, how about with a real guitar?  The game is really a mixture of the Old Guitar Hero type games and also a Guitar tutor.The game comes with a USB cable that plugs into your Xbox or PS3 and the other end is a standard amp jack that plugs directly into your guitar (note you do need to have a jack on your guitar for this to work, so will not work with some acoustic guitars).  Once hooked up and the game is running the first thing it does it to tune your guitar (actually you have to make sure your guitar is tuned before every song, lesson etc. which after a while gets to be a pain but I understand why the game requires it).  Once tuned, you can launch into tutorials on chords, playing scales etc. or launch into playing the game.  It starts off fairly slowly with just strumming a single note but goes all the way to full playing including hammer ons, pull offs, bends etc.The biggest problem with the game is as you progress through it, you cannot change the difficulty level, so you may have progressed to a certain point in the game but just want to quickly play a song on a slightly lower difficulty for fun, tough you can't.The other big disappointment with the game is the song selection that it comes with.  Most of the songs I had not heard of although the bands I had. You can purchase downloadable content to extend the game just like you could with Guitar Hero and Rock band.Overall I think this is an excellent idea and a welcome addition to the genre of beat games.  Not only do you get to play along with various songs, but you also learn to play a real guitar in the process. Much better than Guitar Hero or Rack Band and worth buying if you own a guitar or want to learn to play one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

This one revisiting the original story of Silent Hill. You take the role of Heather your typical sarcastic hormonal teenage girl. Unfortunately Heather's past is about to come back to greet her.Silent Hill 3 is just as good as the last Silent Hill 2. It's graphics are amazing and just as shocking as Silent Hill 2 was. Extremely well designed and very realistic. The game play is the same as SH2 so if you played the previous game you shouldn't have any issues with this one at all. Your back in the same spookie town only this time you take a different path than James did. This time around your actually retracing some of the steps Harry from the first game did. It adds a bit of nostalgia but then again the town has been overhauled for PS2 so this is a whole new ball game.The only problems I had with Silent Hill 3 is that is can be more difficult than it needs to be... meaning \"difficult\" level in this game = impossible. Unless you know to save your ammo and health for certain bosses you might be up a creek without a paddle. If your a \"hardmode\" gamer just be prepared that this games hardmode is more like \"extremely difficult\" which is unusual for SH since it's hardmode is usually a bit more fair on the player. Challenging, but not impossible. Fighting the last boss will be a hair pulling battle as it's impossible to do unless you saved just the right amount of ammo and health items and if not that your left to hand weapons (good luck with that).I was really dissapointed with that part of the game. It's almost similar to finalfantasy where in the end you fight 1 boss,then another boss, and then another boss, and never have the chance to re-up on health or items. Well it's sort of the same here only you'll be flooded with a challenging boss and difficult monsters with few health and ammo items to your availablility.Aside from my rantings on the missleading \"hardmode\" the game is just what a SH fan can expect. It has a deep plot with references to things that only rewards players the are familiar with the past games. This I like because it doesn't stray away from the roots of the game. It almost makes you want to play the first game to see what they're talking about which is how sequals or threequals should make you feel). Silent Hill is a game to be absorbed and isn't exactly a pick up and shoot instant thrill game like Resident Evil is made to be. It's more story than action which is where the phsycological aspects of the game kick in. I was surprised to see that the series never strayed away from these(speaking of the games leading up to the 3rd).Silent Hill 3 is something you should pick up if you played the first and loved it, and if you havent played the first then trust me PLAY THAT FIRST! then play Silent Hill 3 you will appreciate the game more.Overall Silent Hill 3 is an awsome game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2010"}

Well get this game!","reviewText":"Need a reason to buy a WIIU, look no further.At first play, I freaked about a bit. A kitty powerup??? OH NO! Where are my fireballs and raccoon suits? Don't worry, they're all still there too! But I thought finding out about a peculiar \"kitty\" power up that was a staple in this game. I really thought this idea was going to be a downer for me.  I didn't like the idea and was concerned I was going to turned away from it.  Well, Nintendo proved me wrong, trying something new in mario is a risk, but when done right, it turns out to be the right decision. But don't worry the classic fireball is still there too! The cat powerup is the most useful powerup I can ever remember in a Mario game. You can climb to places you never thought you could before. Also as a cat, you can really punish the enemies in this game, and it's a blast doing so with those claws of yours! Meooooooow! The cherry powerup, the most unique addition to the franchise, lets you multiply your character. I've had up to 4 at once. You'd think that controlling 4 clones of your characters on-screen would be a total disaster, but guess what? Nintendo pulls it off brilliantly. When you're cloned, you can cause a lot more damage on enemies and you can really rack up those coins in a hurry when you need to. It's really one of the coolest powerups I've seen a long with the cat.  &lt;3  That said...Mario 3D World is one of my favorite mario games of all time. I thought MarioU and my beloved Super Mario 64 was pushing the bar for all time, but this one has to be up there for most fans.  The game looks cutesy, sounds cutesy and is beautiful at the same time. A lot of worlds paying homage to the likes of Mario Kart and some new amazing levels taking after a Circus or carnival! The Ghost houses are the most unique and entertaining ghost houses I've ever seen in a Mario game before.  Beautiful HD graphics in pristine color 3D mario worlds. I can honestly say, Mario has never looked better.  If you played the handheld version of 3D Mario on 3DS, consider this it's big daddy. Bigger, better, and multiplayer too! You can play up to 4 people at once. I personally recommend the ProU controller for any mario game, but the standard controller equipped with the WiiU works fine too. Some worlds actually require the regular controller because you need to use some touch controls to move blocks and things. So keep it handy when you want to attack those.Playing with 2 people is your best bet for this game, I feel that if you play with 3 or 4 people tend do want to do their own thing and people get left behind trying to look aorund for other secrets and getting all those stars. If you insist on playing with others, communicate! Things get crazy on screen, but there are no hiccups on this game whatsoever, everything plays flawlessly.While I haven't beaten the game yet, I can honestly say I can't find anything truly wrong with this game. From what I've read, it's one of the highest rated Mario games of all time and it's only been out a few days! If you like Mario, why are reading?? GET TO PLAYING!!! Waaah HOOOO!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

Take a wild guess what game I bought first for the system? That's right, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, that's what game.  I won't lie to you, I was expecting ALOT of the first PS3 iteration of R&C.;So, what do I think of Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction? Well- if you look at how much fun I thought the game was & how I rate the game overall, you'd have a pretty good idea. First and foremost, I was impressed by virtually everything about the game. Even though it's alot more of the familiar territory that the Playstation 2 games were, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destructiondoes it on a much grander scale. It, definitely, has a much more epic feel to it. In what other game could you grindrail with a building coming down around you, anyways? Another thing, the newer gameplay mechanics introduced into the game felt natural yet innovative at the same time(like, for example, tilting your Sixxaxis Controller to control Ratchet through a bunch of flying cars after he jumps from a building). Graphically, this game is simply amazing. It's vibrant and colorful and is like you're playing a Pixar movie. Sound is top-notch. Gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect for a R&C; game but it's riveting and, above all, fun.The only fault I found with the game is, if you're a seasoned R&C; vet, you're going to blow through the game rather quickly...and that's even with rounding up every last thing in the game and doing everything you need to do. I clocked in, roughly, 10 to 12 hours on the game. The difficulty is pretty easy for one who's played the series before.Otherwise, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is a game that every PS3 owner should add to their collection,...especially if they love Platformers. You can't get much better than this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

The tools at your disposal are vast and ranges all manner of melee weapons, armor and magic. The possibility of being invaded by other players at any time is exciting and the online pvp is incredibly addictive.But...Dark Souls is challenging in the same way a fight with a world champion would be if your hands and feet were tied and someone sprayed mace in your eyes. Suffice to say, it can be a little unfair. Problems include unresponsive or delayed controls, magnetic cliff edges when hit (trajectory be damned) and very poor instructions as to how things work. Most of these would be forgivable in any other game, but DS punishes you so severely for dying that these minor nitpicks become huge grievances. The story is half-arsed, the characters are dull and the game world is so dismal and unpleasant that I dreaded every step I took away from a bonfire save point. Constant dread is not something I wish to experience from an RPG.And then there's multiplayer, the place where fairness and logic go to die. Victory is gained not by who is most skilled, but by who can best exploit the games numerous irregularities. Attacks register as hits despite the noticable gap between blade and victim (looking at you Murakumo), some magical attacks completely ignore shields and armor ratings (looking at you Crystal), and some attacks don't register at all. Often, the game rips control of your character away from you either by randomly switching your equipped weapon mid battle or becoming unresponsive due to an opponent's back stab or stun lock (an animation loop that prevents you from moving while being hit).Problems aside, Dark Souls pvp (PlayerVsPlayer) is addictive and will keep you coming back for more and asking why. Outside the multiplayer however, the game is too dreary for me to enjoy. If you're looking for a typical RPG (bright and beautiful vistas, fun characters, epic story), then look elsewhere.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2013"}

I played for about 2 hrs last night and so far it's not bad but you still kind of feel that it's still not the FFVII that you have been waiting for on the PSP. BUT....it's still worlds away much better than the last offering. So far playing, there are a lot of very well rendered CG cutscenes from the beginnign an excellent tutorial telling you how everything works, and a nice intro to the characters and an early appearance by Sephiroth!!  (Not a spoiler because it's not what you think!)So far, the story is pretty good (due to the cutscences). My only gripe is, for an action RPG, there is a lot of extra button pushing you have to do to play...X controls your attacks but instead of having another button to use your magic attacks, you have to use the bumpers to slide to  the appropiate spell you want to use and...hit X... ...and that can be very critical when fighting a boss! Nothing worse than thinking one thing and your fingers hit another at a critical moment. I think that Square should have considered putting a Spells button elsewhere.The DVM is actually kind of fun but I wish there was a bit more control over that.But still, if you loved FFVII this is the game you wanted...I give it a 4 out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2008"}

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Jeff \"Jeff\"","summary":"Resident Evil newcomer... sort of","reviewText":"When I first heard of Resident Evil, I played it on my friend's PlayStation (having never owned one myself).

The graphics and sound really are fantastic, and the mood that is set by the whole thing keeps you tense until the end.  I can't wait for the sequel.

Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

You can no doubt learn all you need to learn about the game's mechanics, story, etc. from other reviews.  But here's what I can add.When the Wii first came out, I tried 2 minutes of a golf demo and found the controls difficult to use.  I was used to button-based controllers from competing console systems.  For example, with Mario Golf on the GameCube, I could hit a perfect drive easily.  There was skill involved, but not a lot of skill -- you setup your shot, then press the buttons with the correct timing, and the ball goes where you want it to.  But with the Wii golf demo, skill was much more important, and I was unable to hit a perfect shot.  This 2-minute experience was a bad first impression, and lead me to believe that Wii controllers would be difficult to master, imprecise, and frustrating.  I assumed Super Mario Galaxy would also be hindered by this controller system, and it was not clear from the literature if I could \"fall back\" on using a classic controller.These fears kept me from buying a Wii for a year, but turned out to be completely overblown.  Super Mario Galaxy requires one Wii controller (which is a cross between a more traditional console game controller and a remote control such as for your TV) and one \"Wii nunchuk\" add-on controller -- it does not work with the \"Wii classic\" add-on controller nor does it work with your old GameCube controllers (which are still necessary to play your old GameCube games on the Wii).  However, the new Wii controllers work great and in no way hinder the enjoyment of Super Mario Galaxy.  In fact, they greatly enhance it, with controller-based sound, motion-sensing, pointing, etc..Bottom line:  don't avoid buying a Wii or Super Mario Galaxy because you're concerned about the funky new controllers -- they're both awesome.Plus, Super Mario Galaxy is soooo great that you will feel compelled to come back to Amazon and rave about it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2008"}

Where it is located causes major arm and shoulder fatigue. Holding the weapon under its center of gravity is just not a comfortable position for posture. The navigation controls should have been mapped to the back of the handle wher your thumb could control them , or the either side of the muzzle under-mount. This is where you would normally hold a weapon in the first place.

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done. Alas, pretty graphics  and a great multiplayer game don't quite make up for an exceptionally average  single-player experience.--William HarmsPros:Amazing graphicsGreat level design (including secret passages)Awesome multiplayer modeCons:Lackluster AISingle-player game is very short","reviewerName":"Pangloss \"soldierblue\"","summary":"blast away at the nazi hordes","reviewText":"This is one of the best FPS games I have played. I just recently completed Red Faction and Max Payne, but I find that Wolfenstein is superior to both.  Be warned that this is not an easy game. Some of the levels require considerable strategy and not just a quick trigger finger and excellent aim. The AI seems to be pretty good. I have had enemies toss grenades back at me and dodge my sniper rifle. They also tend to hide and surprise you. Sometimes they can be quite aggravating and difficult to eliminate.I would like to have a function key assigned for save and load operations. As it is, you have to escape to the menu screen and save or load from there.  There is a qucksave/quickload function key that is quite useful. Otherwise, I have no complaints. I am about half-way through the game and I hate to see it end.  I hope there will be additional missions released before too long.I have not experienced any problems running the game. I am running Windows Me on a 1.4 Ghz Pentium with a 32 Mb Nvidia video card. I have not had a single lock up during the time I have been playing Wolfenstein.  Although this is a fairly fast system, I have had lock-up problems with other games, so having a new, fast system doesn't always mean perfect operation.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"Take from: Mass Effect: Limited Edition","reviewText":"I will simply say this game is awesome! It's intensly epic and if you're a fan of the RPG format, this is a must play. There are naturally some comparisons being made to the two Knights of the Old Republic video games. I think these comparisons are very appropriate because the general game design is a fairly similar, though I'm sure many Star Wars fans are disappointed to not see laser swords in this game. Anyway, both games are very epic in scale, however, I think Mass Effect improved and built on from some areas.Now anyone who plays RPG styled games HAS to realize that the screen view offers quite a bit design limitations. For example you're not going to have super high-detailed characters that look life-like all the time, though Mass Effect does a damn good job. People have to remember you're not seeing things through a first person view, so those who complain that it's not as \"detailed\" need to get over themselves, I grew up with Diablo, which I still think has a pretty good design. The screen interface to me is one of the most important, however, Mass Effect is a little hard to figure out at first. Such as when you want to change weapons quickly or use your special abilities. After having gone through the game, I realize now that it is by far the absolutely most logical control development for the user to interface with the screen.Everything is in 3rd person view so the user is sitting sort of \"far away\" in perspective, aside from video sequences of course. Despite this, I think the graphic design is very well done. I see people complain about things not being \"Next Gen\" on a Next Gen console, seriously, what do these people expect to see? Graphic design wise Mass Effect is probably comparable to Half Life 2, and really, is that such a bad thing? I'd rather have developers spend their time developing a really epic game with an awesome story line than spend all their time amping up the graphics to the point where systems can't process all the detail so they have to shorten the game to compensate for data overflow. Which, is something I will complain about in Halo 3, because it was far too short, despite how beautifully designed the game was.Another thing that was really interesting was the weapon designs. You get new weapons as the game goes on, but they're energy based weapons so you have unlimited ammo. I thought this was a really interesting way to treat the weapons, granted I enjoyed the unlimited ammo because running out of ammo in a game really sucks. You basically have access to all the weapons from the start of the game, but you have to put points into being trained on them to actually get good at using them. If you don't have access to build up points for the Sniper Rifle your character will always be really bad at using that weapon, but each character has the ability to build up at least one of the options!The real part to focus on in Mass Effect is the highly original world and engrossing story line! You're thrust into a future universe of humanity where we have contact with other alien cultures and we are trying to work our way into the politics of the situation. I would say the story line is somewhat influenced by Carl Sagan's \"Contact\" because it starts with teh discovery of something called a Mass Relay, which can send vehicles far into distant reaches very quickly... yeah, kind of like \"Contact, but this takes place long after that initial contact. I found the story-line very intelligent and very well thought out, to the point where it's believable in that situation. I haven't played through that many excellent Science Fiction RPG's, but this is probably my favorite as much as I liked Knights of the Old Republic. The story line does have a serious shock ending that I really didn't predict in the least, whereas I found Knights of the Old Republic II's story line slightly predictable.Mass Effect really shines in my book. I was one of the lucky few to pick up the Limited Edition version and it comes with a bonus disc, which I haven't watched yet, but I will add to this review when I see it. It also comes with an added booklet with extra information about the historical time-line, which I thought was a really cool game addition.As anyone can see, this game is VERY highly rated by users and I personally have no complaints about this game whatsoever. I found it to be challenging and intriguing. I don't have a lot of time to play games and this thing kept me occupied for two months (I do spend most of my day at work and only can play like an hour or two a night). Most games I can beat pretty quickly, but the grand scale took me as long as Knights of the Old Republic. Seriously, get this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"For anyone who has played Bioware's, \"Knights of the Old Republic\", \"Mass Effect\" will be somewhat disappointing. Though there are some positive attributes in the game, the many unpolished components really take away from the whole experience. I believe that another 6 months of refinement would have resulted in significant improvement. Also, the decision to design this game as a combination of \"Gears of War\" with some elements of KOTOR failed. I was also disappointed in the length of the game; finishing it in 30 hours, and that included completing all of the boring side missions. This is certainly not the immersive RPG that was advertised and even reviewed by some game review sites. It do not believe it even has 20% of Oblivion's content and complexity.Graphics - Mixed bag. The dialog scenes have unprecedented amount of detail in the face models as well as impressive English language lip-synching. However, the in-game details are just decent and quite repetitive. The frame rates come to an almost stand still when there were more than a few non-player characters on the screen during skirmishes. That had a significant negative impact on game-play.Sound - The best attribute of the game. Great voice-acting, ambient and weapons sounds, and musical score.Game-play - This aspect basically destroyed the game for me. While trying to be an action game, Mass Effect failed miserably. Horrible frame-rate drops, uninspiring magic (biotic) powers & weapons, and hokey \"Halo\" vehicle ruined the action elements (Halo's jeep vehicle is hokey even in Halo. I don't know why anyone would want to copy it!) Inability to directly control your partner characters and clunky menu system used to assign weapons & upgrades limited the RPG elements. KOTOR's RPG battle system had a significantly positive impact on other games like Final Fantasy XII (Square Enix basically stole the system and improved it. I am not sure why Bioware would actually destroy their own milestone setting RPG battle system.Story - Mixed bag here as well. The main story was good, but nothing we haven't heard already. KOTOR's story was superior. The side missions were exceedingly repetitive and boring. The amount of written material was impressive, yet, it doesn't compare to a less detailed, but amazing creative story of the original God of War on the PS2.Clearly, Bioware was pressured to hand this game into production for the holiday season and it shows. I actually chuckled watching the closing credits on the screen and seeing over a dozen names in the QA department. I believe they could have learned from Rock Star's wisdom (since they delayed GTA IV for next year), and took more time to refine this title. I am wondering if any NPV analyses would have forecasted higher revenues for a first quarter 2008 release being that there would be less competition? I read somewhere that that was Rock Star's strategy for GTA IV.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"fallowstarz","summary":"Brutally Honest Meditation on Moral Decay","reviewText":"This Konami game, which has become a new classic since its 2001 release, is tied with Square's Final Fantasy Tactics, Silicon Knights' Eternal Darkness, and Konami's own Shadow of Destiny, for the distinction of being the most literary video game of all time.The foggy atmosphere and desolate aura of the New England resort town of Silent Hill, which has inexplicably become a ghost town by the time that protagonist James Sunderland visits it in desperate hopes of discovering a reincarnation of his dead wife, reflect the foggy confusion of James' own mind, and the curse lingering over the town allows it to conjure personalized avatars to haunt those who enter its boundaries with a guilty conscience. In trying to discover the truth about his wife's death, James will therefore encounter physical manifestations of psychological phonomena related to his regret over how their relationship unfolded while she was still alive, along with four other travelers who are lost in their own nightmarish versions of the town. If this summary seems to place the plot dangerously close to horror cliche, the execution of the story, realization of the town's creepy atmosphere, and final resolution of the plot prove that this game is an original work of art. Inspired less by Stephen King than David Lynch, whose film \"Lost Highway\" featured a defeated man creating an alternate self-identity which allowed him to become the hero of his own story, until the dangerous re-invasion of reality, Silent Hill 2 is a character study masquerading as horror, and the true horror is not the grotesquery of its monsters or grimy corridors, but the reality, and the commonality of the profoundly oppressive and inhumane events which haunt the characters' backstories.This might be the only game that is painful to play by design rather than as a biproduct of ineptitude. The arduous, repetitive combat, slow-paced \"action scenes\" and excessive empty distance between places of significance combine with the headache-inducing dissonant soundtrack to make the player every bit as anxious as the protagonist, and if one is to accept that any form of stimulation, not just positive stimulation, validates the quality of a work of art, then it follows that Silent Hill 2 is an incredible success. Form echoes content, as the game itself is as sadistic as its characters. Its goal is not to challenge the player to overcome its trials, but to challenge the player to experience it, and one ultimately walks away from a day in the life of James Sunderland with a newfound appreciation for one's own life. Unless, of course, one has just lost a spouse.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

As a matter of fact, I'd recommend you play GTA3 first because both games use the same engine and have similar mechanics but Vice City is an improvement over GTA3.  While still a fun game no matter what, you may enjoy GTA3 cold more so than someone who has played Vice City first.  Some of the improvements to the GTA series include new vehicles such as motorcycles, a payment system that allows you to own illegal businesses in Vice City and earn profits, and a vastly improved soundtrack that contains several hits from the 80's.  If you remember the old television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; then you already know the story for Vice City.  Only this game allows you to play as the bad guy rather than Don Johnson.  If you're a Playstation owner and considering buying the PC version, just know that it's the same game only with better graphics and the ability to record your own MP3's for your in-game car radio.  GTA Vice City is good ol' fashioned entertainment at its best and a highly recommended for any gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2003"}

As a band, the six members often play their special parts at the same time, though each player can jam however and whenever he or she wants. Play all at once. Take turns in the spotlight. Pair up in creative ways throughout the song. You can bring the band to life by yourself, playing one part at a time-or with up to four players. See game mode below:Solo Play: When you play by yourself, you can add one part at a time to arrange the whole song exactly how you want. The Tutes are on hand to back up your band in any parts you need filled.Multiplayer: When in a band with friends, up to four people can be band members.Wii Friends: Using WiiConnect24, you can send your jam videos to Wii Friends who own Wii Music. They can then watch your performance, modify it to their liking and send their jam videos back to you.Tutes: Your Own Private Back-up BandWhen not playing with friends, you can invite jam masters known as Tutes to play with you. They'll join a session playing an instrument that each thinks is strong for a specific song. You can simply enjoy the musical camaraderie, or pick up instrument tips by watching them jam. If you choose to watch, the Tutes will show you lots of techniques for many of these instruments, then ask you to follow their examples. They'll start with the simplest techniques, then as you master each one, show you even more nuanced ones.Key Game Features:Easy to Play Improv Jams- All members of your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content.

Unlike most music games,Wii Musicdoesn't make you use many complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument.Virtually Endless Ways to Make Music- You choose the song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform Nintendo classics like theSuper Mario Bros.theme into Latin-flavored numbers. The song list is only a takeoff point-it's how you improvise with the songs that matters.Share Your Band Jams With Friends- They'll see your Mii band members, your players' improv styles and your instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you. So you can send improv jams back and forth over WiiConnect24, changing them again and again.60+ InstrumentsYou can play most of the 60-plus instruments inWii Musicusing simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.

Everyone on the team has a job to do: play one of your notes only when the tune demands it.Pitch Perfect: How good is your musical ear? In this whimsical musical quiz, you'll have to solve challenges, like putting note-playing Miis in order from lowest to highest pitch.Drum Mode: In the one mode that uses the Wii Balance Board accessory (sold withWii Fit), you can feel what it's like to play a real-life drum set.

I was skeptical of this game from the get go, but now that I've seen it in action, I can definitely say it is not the game for me.  The gameplay is extremely simple, except for the simulated drums using the balance board, which turned out to be a little too complicated and awkward.Overall, a lot of the motions and actions are kind of fun, but the game honestly feels like one decent mini-game idea that could have been pulled out of Mario Party or Raving Rabbids.  Then the mini-game became bloated, over-hyped, and then was slapped with a [....] price tag just in time for the holidays.  In fact, if parts of the next Mario Party or Wario Ware titles were to include a Wii Music mini-game, I think that I would enjoy them in small bites.Most disappointing is the selection of music and the sound quality.  It's not terrible, but it definitely isn't great either.  Part of that probably has to do with making the game so flexible with the types of sounds that can be used to play a song, but the music is rarely emotionally satisfying.  A lot of classic Nintendo tunes I was hoping far aren't even in the game and everything else just feels kind of tacked on, although I admit having fun messing around with the Zelda theme song.I can see the appeal that this game may have for children and families, but as a male adult gamer without children, this game has very little to offer me.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  If my were friends playing when I visited them I would probably join in for a few minutes and have some fun, but the overall experience feels full of potential, but ultimately lacking and definitely not worth the full [..].  This almost feels like a pack-in product, a game that should have come free with every Wii this Christmas like the Wii Sports game.  It's not bad, but it definitely isn't great.I personally recommend either Rock Band 2 or Guitar Hero: World Tour instead if you have the extra cash to spare.

I decided to finally play it because I was in the mood to play a new Resident Evil game but there's not one yet.  I decided I would finally give this game a shot in the meantime.  After playing the game I do have to say that I enjoyed the game a bunch.  As a fan of Resident Evil, I enjoyed the gameplay and atmosphere very much so.  Im not saying that DS copies RE but you have to admit that they share a few similarities.In my opinion Dead Space features the best made environment and atmosphere in a survival-horror game.  You can tell that the developer put a lot of effort to create a game that entertained and offered a chilling and thrilling experience.  It delivers exactly that.  You are stranded on a massive spaceship trying to find a way to escape while cutting the limbs off of creatures to survive.This game is visually impressive.  Even today it stands up really well.  The gameplay is fun too.  Shooting off limbs of enemies is a blast.The story is probably my favorite in the genre as well.  It not only pushes you along from objective to objective, but you actually want to know what happens next.The only thing I didn't like about the game, though is that it can get a little repetitive after a while.  You'll backtrack through the same areas now and then to complete an objective.  It does make sense within the context of the story but it still is too bad that they didn't find a way to let you explore more areas of the massive ship.I recommend this to anybody who hasn't played the game and feels like a good survival-horror challenge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

I saw quite a few favorable reviews (especially from gamers), but I remained hesitant and wasn't particularly impressed with the demo.  Someone finally talked me into getting it, and I have to say it far surpassed my expectations!  This is absolutely the best \"horror\" game I've played on the PS3.  The visuals are solid, not on par with the best the PS3 has to offer but pretty good nonetheless.  I noticed a little bit of slowdown when a lot was happening on screen, however.  The physics were effective, but at times seemed a bit off to me.  I felt the gameplay was excellent, with only a couple of nitpicks (the tourret sequences, for example).  The developers deserve major kudos for the clever manner in which HUD, objective and item information was integrated.  Dead Space may have a few minor flaws, but then again what game doesn't.  For setting, story, creepiness and infusing just the right level of tension, I would have to recommend this one as a must play and can't wait for Dead Space 2!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Saikron","summary":"Guild Wars Roots Completely Forgotten","reviewText":"When I read that GW2 would be changing up the RPG formula to make more party compositions viable, I was both disappointed that my favorite profession (monk) was gone and excited that something new and possibly better was coming to the genre.ANet was hands down 100% successful in making any party composition effective, but this came at a huge cost. If every profession is supposed to be basically interchangeable in a party, then it's by design that no profession has an overly important job. This makes differences between characters' roles extremely subtle and relegates everybody to doing basically the same things in slightly different ways.Besides those types of simplifications, the skill library in GW2 has seen major \"streamlining.\" In GW1 PvP, an entire match could rest on how PRECISELY a person used their character because so many of the best skills were conditional and CC. One ranger could cause a team wipe by correctly interrupting a healing spell and then interrupting several resurrection spells in a row. A monk could successfully counter a follow up spike by identifying the target early enough to cast protective spirit, or a mesmer could preempt that with diversion, or a warrior could disrupt that spell, and on and on.Again, in GW2, designed around the idea that nobody is too important to replace, no profession has that kind of power any more. CC is still around, but who cares? Nobody has skills that are really that important to winning or losing; all you can do is hamper their DPS efficiency.This change in focus from \"precision\" skill usage to \"efficient\" skill usage makes GW2 less like the trading card games that inspired GW1 and more like something somebody should write software to do automatically: tab, 1,1,1,2,4,4,3, repeat.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2012"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Better than expected","reviewText":"Classic movies are turning up remade into video games more and more lately (From Russia With Love, Scarface, Reservoir Dogs) with varying degrees of quality.  The Godfather on the other hand manages to offer a bit more than the typical GTA style of play though, thanks to the labor of love put into the game by the developers to involve you in the world of the Corleone family as much as possible.  You play as an all new character who is an unofficial enforcer for the family, and as you play through you get to see how seamlessly weaved you become in the story of Francis Ford Coppola's classic film.  The game utilizes the GTA-style of gameplay, but not to utter ridiculousness.  There is a small bit of strategy involved here throughout the game's legthy missions, which feature enemy AI that fluctuates between dumb and incredibly difficult.  The game's interrogation system is unique, and the 1940's New York you travel through looks great.  Not to mention that the main character models look very good, and the voice acting is great too.  All that being said, the Godfather is not without it's share of flaws.  While driving around New York is great, the insides of areas all pretty much look the game, while there is a choppy frame rate and occasionally glitchy camera too.  That aside, the Godfather is a better than expected game that does it's license justice, and one of the all the more rare times that EA has put a lot of effort into one of their releases.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself.

With EA's uber success with thier game adaptions of the movies, poor Vivendi had the unenviable task of competing with thier own games that could not look or sound anything like the movies.  It may have been too tough, because the second and third books were never made into games (what a shame).  But we still have the Fellowship of the ring game to go through.The Fellowship of the ring is a third person action adventure game that allows you to take on the role of Frodo Baggins, Aragorn, and Gandalf as you play through the story of the first Lord of the rings book, which means that you get to visit areas that are not in EA's game, such as the villiage of Bree, Rivendell and Lothlorien (granted, its only one room in the latter two, but they are pretty).  You also get to meet Tom Bombadill, fight Barrow-rights, and even fight the Balrog!  (which EA did not have until The Third age)The gameplay here is very simple.  You move your charachter around an enviornment while solving a task or a puzzle.  You shoot projectiles, swing your sword (or stick), and can jump (only while playing as Frodo).  Nothing too fancy or complicated.  Perfect for young gamers or those who dont want to memorize dozens of moves.  I personally loved playing as Gandalf, who gets to use magic to kill his foes (and lets face it, playing as Gandalf is going to be cool no matter what).The fighting is simple as well.  You can run up and attack with a sword, or weaken a foe from a distance by firing either rocks, arrows, or bolts of fire.  You can also reduce damage by blocking.  Thats it.  No combos to memorize whatsoever.  I do like this simple combat scheme, as you dont have to memorize lots of moves and try to recall them all in an instant.You'll face lots of dangerous foes on your journey as well.  There are lots of orcs, lots of wargs (but why do they look like oversized rats?), some rather mean towns-folk, the Nazgul, and the fiery Balrog.  The AI of your foes is rather basic.  Combat for your foes consists of running towards you (\"Charge!\") and swinging away.  Orcs do try to block your attacks, but thats it as far as defense goes.  I found that almost any foe could be beaten simply by running in circles, slicing at them one blow at a time.  They would stand there, andy by the time they got around to fighting back, I attacked and stunned them again! Simple, and a little silly.Thanks to the book liscene, you get to visit a lot of places in the game that were not in the movie based games.  The green and happy shire, the slightly gloomy woods between the Shire and Bree, Bree itself, the troll-shaws, Weather-top, and Rivendell are but some of the places you'll visit on your journey.  Every location is rendered well and the looks fit the atmosphere well.  The shire is bright and cheerful while Moria is dark and forbodding (Skeletons on the walls are always good at conveying gloominess).Graphics for the game are pretty normal.  It's not flashy or wonderful, it just gets the job done.  There are some great locations, such as the bridge of Khazad-Dum and the river Anduin that look really great.  The audio is pretty good.  The voiceovers are for the most part well done, but at times they feel very unenthusiastic (\"Gandolf.  No.\").  The music is quite catchy, especially in the Shire and Moria.However, the game suffers from some big problems.  There are no bonuses for finishing the game, aside from playing it again.  The camera is tricky to get the hang of, but can be managed with practice.  At some points the game feels a little amaturish (such as text that says \"The next day\"), as if the game were made by people who just finished gaming school and were unused to making games.But in the end, I enjoyed my trip through the game.  I thought it was fun, and had some great elements in it (such as fighting the Balrog in real time combat instead of an RPG battle).  I personally recomend it, but you should rent before you buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2005"}

The hype has come and gone.A lot of PS3 models are currently sitting on shelves at retailers because people aren't interested in buying an overpriced system.  Yes the PS3 blows away the competition in terms of bells and whistles graphics, but it's way too far ahead in terms of consumer marketing.  I can't personally justify buying a system and a game for this, when I could buy an xbox 360 and a wii for the same amount, and still have money left over for games.  360 has some very established titles on its shelves, and a very good online system that has kept its user base coming back for more.After buying this product and being turned off at spending close to a grand for a couple of games that I really wasn't enjoying, I quietly repackaged my PS3, and took it back. Most of the technology in the PS3 can only be enjoyed by top-dollar entertainment systems.  Most of it I don't need.  I don't have a 7.1 surround sound system, I don't have HDMI, and while I do have HDTV, I don't feel the need to upgrade as all 1080p TVs do is make the resolution smaller than 480p, 720p. The PS3 feels like it should have been released 2 years from now, so consumers like me who don't have thousands of dollars to blow to just play games could buy systems like this.I was a huge Playstation fan for over 8 years, but I'm putting my investments on xbox and wii.  The xbox is  more developer friendly, (windows NT based games, C++) and while isn't as flashy as the PS3, I believe will do just as well later on and eventually surpass the reputation PS2 got when it went toe to toe with the original xbox.When you look at the PS3, it looks destined to go the way of the Betavision.  They want to market blu-ray, but forgot to establish something that sells systems: fun games.My prediction:  If Sony loses its exclusive license for Final Fantasy XIII with Square-Enix and other RPG makers, you'll see Xbox boom in popularity.  Sony will also develop a new controller for their system to compete with Wii.  While the advantage of the PS3 is its sustainability of its system as being \"ahead of the curve\" in technology, people will not buy it until it drops to the price of an xbox 360.  While the PS3 sales may bomb in the US and Europe, they will linger in Japan.  They are well-known for supporting their own home-grown products.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"The weakest in the Uncharted series but still awesome.","reviewText":"I've played Uncharted 1-3 on the PS3, this certainly is not the best in the series however that's not to say this isn't a great game. My gripe list is short but overall this is a really great game on the Vita.The game does just about everything you expect of Uncharted, fun platforming, good gunplay+platforming, nice cutscenes with unique motions and dialog for every scene, variety of guns, solid voice acting, great music (play this game with headphones!!!).The game is the best looking on the Vita that's for sure, in some ways it certainly looks better than Uncharted 1 on PS3 but not better in others, difficult to explain. The games writing isn't as strong as the other titles but is by no means poor, Drake isn't any less nimble than his PS3 counterpart as he can do everything minus tossing grenades back at enemies.My gripe list:-Motion controls- going over a log will undoubtedly trigger you tilt your vita to regain balance. Needless and irritating.-Touch screen controls- this is fine for assembling torn papers in the game but when they put it in combat or when a platform breaks it really takes you out of the gameplay.You can also use the touch screen to do all of the platforming for you, if for some reason you just felt like skipping the main appeal of the game, however this thankfully they let you do with buttons.You need to mimic arrow motions in the middle of combat, so you'll have to counter a guy by swiping up or something on the screen.-Camera use- you need to use the camera to see a message through a piece of paper, this would be fine if the room I was in had a light the game thought was bright enough, I put the system right over a bulb and it didn't go any higher, I had to wait to use my desk lamp for this to work.*Note that with the exception of touch platforming, none of these are optional, you need to use them to progress in the game.Overall: Despite the gripes, it does do everything you'd expect of Uncharted as a series, it's a really solid game if you can ignore the stupid motion/touch controls forced into the game. It's no means a slouch of the series, if you liked the others it's worth it to get this because it's basically identical but portable. It's top notch and there's no game like this on any handheld device currently, it's damn pretty, sounds great, does what the series is known for and it wont disappoint.Note: You'll probably want to buy this game as a physical copy because it's massive, it's about 3.2gb.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Grand Theft Generation","reviewText":"There's honestly no point in giving a huge introduction to this franchise. Divisive and controversial, yet deeply important and innovative to the video game industry, Rockstar's \"Grand Theft Auto\" series has been riveting gamers and pushing boundaries since 2001's \"Grand Theft Auto III\", and hasn't let up its hold on the industry yet. But to me, this franchise has always had a tad bit of immaturity in its veins, even with the sobering ballad of Niko Bellic in IV. So, to my surprise, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" represents a new direction for the series, mature in every sense of the word, its humor deeply biting at pop culture, society at large, and even the series itself. Oh, yeah, it's also incredibly fun.Our \"heroes\" this time around are three incredibly different and eclectic characters, with years of trouble and experience written on their faces. There's Michael, a former thief who's been relocated via witness protection and has fallen into a retirement with a family that he now hates. Michael, through a series of circumstances involving a crash through a storefront, meets Franklin, who is a young street hustler that begins to learn tricks of the trade from his new acquaintance. And then there's Trevor, a former acquaintance of Michael, who is completely unhinged and running a meth enterprise out in the middle of the desert. They come together, somewhat reluctantly, to pull off a series of increasingly ridiculous heists, along with dealing with their own personal motivations and past demons.As you probably know by now, you control all three characters, which is an ingenious little system at first. After a few hours of gameplay, you can start cutting between characters at any time you want to for the most part, which can lead to some hilarious results. Cutting to Trevor may find him waking up on a bridge in his underwear nursing a hangover, or Franklin might be admiring the intricacies of a new house he's been given. Not only that, but there are certain missions and side-missions exclusive to each character, and certain strengths and weaknesses attributed to each character, along with unique special skills. That all being said, the gimmick wears off after a while, and it gets to the point where switching characters is only fun in missions, while the game begins to limit what you can do based on arbitrary reasons. It's a cool system, and it's definitely solid on a conceptual level, but it often feels like Rockstar didn't know what to do with this new mechanic.However, the elements at play in the narrative are incredible in every sense of the word. Part black comedy, part introspective drama, and part bitter commentary on the state of American society, everything about the overarching story is impeccably written. Dialogue is terse, and the situations grow increasingly unpredictable and shocking. This is definitely Rockstar's writing team at their best, yet even then, remnants of their past games remain. Women are still relegated to fairly unimportant roles, and the portrayals of racial minorities are still pretty cliche. Now, this isn't a dealbreaker, and I'm not personally offended by any of it, but it's definitely something that should be addressed and considered. Personally, I wonder whether or not Rockstar is making a commentary on how the industry portrays those demographics, or if they simply struggle to make compelling characters in that range. Ultimately, it's up to the player to decide that.No questions should be cast on the gameplay, though. Every major complaint received on the past entry (and there were plenty) seems to have been addressed. The gunplay is tight and flawless, taking cues from their work on \"Max Payne 3.\" Driving feels fluid, every car driving in a completely different fashion, but all of them bound by racing game-like tightness and control. Not only that, but they are much lighter and more pliable for doing insane stunts that are much more in line with \"San Andreas\", which has been my golden standard for this series. Flying helicopters is much less cumbersome, as well, and the planes handle like a dream. Even walking, running, and climbing has a fun, parkour-like feeling to it. Playing the game is a total joy, without a doubt.Missions are a vast improvement over IV, presenting a massive amount of variety and challenge. Sometimes, you'll be stalking a target and killing them, a la every sandbox crime game ever. But mostly, you'll be chasing down a plane that your partner has shot down via motorbike, jumping frantically over trains and narrowly missing being smashed by a passing bus, or smashing into an armored van while wearing wrestler's masks, then proceeding to mow down 50+ cops with multiple weapons. The game is immediately fast and furious, throwing the shoehorned realism IV attempted to maintain by dripfeeding players missions that were only marginally better than the typical \"drive and shoot\" ones.A great addition to the series are the Heist missions, which are set up by a series of side-missions (gathering a submarine, buying boiler suits, etc.). After that, the player selects their approach (stealthy or violent), picks their cohorts (who will have their own cuts, and bring their own liabilities), and sets up other miscellaneous elements, like vehicles and weapons. Then, after pulling off these missions, which contain death-defying stunts and high-adrenaline chases, among other things, players get their cut based on how much loot they stole during the whole process. Everything about these missions is left up to the player, which is a fantastic element that adds an entirely new level of depth to the overall experience.That same depth applies to most of the missions, though. This is not a game that holds your hand and tells you how to do certain missions. Do you want to storm into a meth den and run over the rednecks who run it, then proceed to use explosives on the rest of the inhabitants? Or do you want to stealthily dispatch each guard, and instill a sense of unease in them as you gradually proceed? If you're hijacking a submarine, do you snipe it down from the ropes, or do you shoot up the entire ship? Kill or spare? Sneak or destroy? Everything is entirely up to you, and the game unravels entirely based on your choices, including your characters stats in various fields, another element that returns from \"San Andreas.\"All of this, and the game is just a joy to look at. Los Santos and all of its locales and inhabitants is an entrancing, beautiful map that is immensely expansive and fun to explore. The textures are clean and colorful, with the dull, grey tones of IV long gone. Character animations are astounding in their dynamism, with even things like hijacking cars possessing a unique set of involved and nuanced animations. Even the cars get realistic damage and scrapes based upon where they get hit. It is beautiful to look at the entire time, and you will become immersed in the world the more you play. Don't be surprised if you even start dreaming about the place. I know I did.Unsurprisingly, Rockstar wins once again in the audio department. The voice acting, always a series strength, is excellent here once again, with the characters of Trevor and Michael being the indisputable highlights of the cast. Also nice is the amount of effort put into the NPC dialogue, with every pedestrian seemingly able to engage in pretty involved conversations with you (or about you), depending on which character you're playing as. And to tie it all together, the soundtrack is certainly the best in the series, with a disgustingly copious amount of radio stations containing around 240 licensed tracks, with well-known artists like Rihanna, Queen, and The Game, and a cornucopia of indie outfits with a massive amount of variety in terms of the genres at play.So, Rockstar's latest opus is certainly a great game. In fact, it's easily one of the best of this generation, and one which redefines sandbox games. However, my primary issue with it, and the reason I hesitate to call it \"perfect\" is that... well, nothing is tonally new about it. Sure, the gameplay has been refined. Sure, the narrative is more mature and biting than past entries. Sure, it may be one of the best games I've ever played, and it may be the culmination of everything this console generation has been working towards. But things that I've always complained about this franchise are still here, and the fact remains that every narrative device at play here has been done before in other media, and done just as competently, if not better.Yes, this is a very good game. In fact, it's a great one. Almost everything about it is fun, outside of some mission repetition as the experience wears on. However, despite how good the characters are, and how lovably biting the satire is, the narrative itself is still pretty trite, and explores themes and elements that have already been done several times over. Which puts this whole game in an awkward position. This is a fun and fast game, and everything it does, it does right. But outside of a lot of great missions and dynamic set pieces, and an ungodly amount of polish, there's a certain \"been there, done that\" feeling about the whole thing.\"Grand Theft Auto V\" is, with no hesitation, one of my new favorite games, and one of the best games I've played. But it's not the best I've played this year, and certainly not the most innovative. It's worth every cent, due to the fact that you will have fun with every hour you spend in it, but if you want narrative innovation and unique gameplay, it's not the best place to find that. However, if you pass up such a well-made genre piece because you solely seek innovation, you'll be missing out on a fun, snide, and vitriolic takedown of everything America holds sacred.Plot: 8.75Gameplay: 10Graphics: 10Sound: 10Overall: 9.75","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2013"}

The hype machine took its toll on this title but I think it will stand on its own over time considering that LAIR delivers on many levels the production values as is standard on PS3 from my experience are top notch. Voice acting,cinematics,storyline,ambiance all rate above average.There is a nice set of 12 tutorials that allows everyone to get a feel for the mildly complex controls.  The game is set up like and plays somewhat like ROGUE SQUADRON different level medals for each mission etc,unlockable dragons etc. With God of War style button matching combat and other varied moves such as TAKEDOWN,  The controls are smooth and responsive, firmware 1.93 is recommended for best results.(THIS IS POSSIBLY WHY SO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS) however in the heat of action the 180 degree turn just doesn't want to work for me and usually sends me dashing instead arrggh!  If you can embrace the somewhat shallow arcade like feel of the game overall and not long for the RPG like qualites of say a DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN  then you will find a satisfying meal of mead and meat at this gaming table. My biggest compaint is that rider and dragon appear small and I wanted more of feeling of being on the dragon.Other than that though a great fantasy setting and flight controls with a nice variety of missions will hold your attention rapt.

The game has all the original characters from the Mortal Kombat series and even characters from other series such as Kratos (from God of War) and Freddy Krueger (from A Nightmare on Elm Street). So no need to worry about WHO you can be. Each character, as far as I know, has different controls and personal attacks (at which point becomes a pain b/c you don't know which combo leads to which attack). Most people who don't have the game would miss the \"mini-games.\" One of them is like a fruit ninja spoof (a very poor replica, but still fun). Lastly, there's the option to buy other bonus content such as alternate clothing, original pictures of the characters, finishing fatality moves, etc.Bad:On the off-hand, this game has some off-putting features. To start off, the graphics could use a lot of work; a LOT of work is needed. I don't know how it compares as a port of the PS3/Xbox 360 games so I won't go over that; I'm just saying that the graphics is highly noticeable. Chances are, they did this to improve the frame rates in the game. It looks very much like the graphics was limited to the PS2's system capabilities. In terms of difficulty, this game is questionable. I was playing on normal and I felt as though the fights were designed to be easy in the first round, then hard on the second round, and easy on the third round so that you'll spend more time playing it. The story revolves around a character (I won't name him/her to prevent spoilers) and this character has to be one of the worst characters to play with. The last boss (also won't name) is overpowered to an unfair advantage, just check guides online for the \"view count\" and you can see that many people are having problems. Difficulty, clearly, is \"flawed.\"Edit: There's also an odd sound issue where the cutscenes are very low in volume (even at max) and the fighting is significantly louder. Not a big issue because of the subtitles, but is a nuisance if you're lying down or in a bad surrounding.This game is playable and has brought me much fun. Story will take a couple of days to finish and the Challenge Tower & Bonus Challenge Tower (options in the game) has over a 100 levels I believe. I'm sure you can find this game at a decent price online now since it's nearly 2 years into release already.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Game Boy Advance SP costs the same price, but a console is much cooler.I found tons of deals. At one store there was a mail in rebate, but I also found a deal to buy this system for 50 bucks. I simply trade in an old system, like my old Playstation. Also, i trade in 7 games. You could trade in your N64 and games, but you need the boxes and manuals, which you might not have. But if you have a ps2 like me, then you can simply trade in your old one with some old games that your done with or bored of. I did this at Electronics Boutique.The system doesn't have as many games as Xbox. PS2 has tons of games compared. This system does have better graphics than the PS2, but not as good as the Xbox. Also, my ps2 can play dvds. This system can't. What is good though is that I got it for about the price of 2 games. If you trade in 2 new playstation games for 50 bucks, tahts like, 50 dollars less towards your Gamecube.Gamecube has also sold more than the ps2 because of the price drop. What can this mean? Since it has sold more than the ps2, it will probably have more popularity among companies, and produce more games. I would buy this system while it is cheap and get some games.I reccomend: True Crime(comes out november 7th), Animal Crossing, Metroid Prime, and Burnout.Overall---&gt;5 Stars___&Uuml;l&dagger;&iacute;mt___","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000LSJKAM","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Another hit in a great series","reviewText":"This is the 8th installment in the Mario Party series from Nintendo.  Like its predecessors, Mario Party 8 features tons of mini-games (some new, some variations on older games) and a board-game style competition for anywhere from 1 to 4 players.Audience:  This game truly has the potential to be one of the select few that is fun for nearly everyone.  Gamers and non-gamers alike, of all ages, will find the mini-games very entertaining and the competitive boards a lot of fun!  I should also note that the \"audience\" here is really a multi-player audience--it's much more fun to play with other people than against a computer player.Graphics: 'Cartoony,' typical Wii graphics.  The graphics are actually quite beautiful, though obviously not realistic.  Very pleasing to the eye though.Gameplay: Gameplay is simple and easy to get the hang of.  You choose a board, everyone picks a character, and then the fun begins.  Like previous Mario Party games the object is to complete some objective on each board (stars or coins or whatever) while competing in various mini-games and activities along the way.Control: Even non-gamers will find the mini-games pretty easy to get the hang of.  The Wii remote is put to good use here--as a lasso, a flashlight, a hammer or mallet, and many other things!Challenge: The challenge from this game comes mostly in the form of competition from the people you're playing against.  It is what you make it, I guess.  There is a single-player competitive mode as well, though I haven't gone far enough in it to know if it becomes more difficult as it progresses.Storyline:  Well, there really isn't one.  It's just a...well, a party.  Hence the title.  You do earn carnival cards and can use them to unlock new games and to buy floats for a parade.  Not much more to it than that.Overall:  This is a great first Mario Party installment for the Wii.  It manages to capitalize on all the Wii's strengths--the unique controllers, the cartoon-like graphics--and should be great fun for quite some time (until Mario Party 9).  And unlike some of the Wii release titles this game seems very polished.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"DL","summary":"Highly anticipated, but then!","reviewText":"I remember seeing the press release for Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One and having been a huge fan of \"Tools of Destruction\" and \"A Crack in Time\" I was very excited to get my hands on this new release. In fact, I had been such a big fan of the earlier releases of the series that at midnight on release day I skipped \"Batman: Arkham City \"and picked up this game instead.If you have played the previous installments you will immediately notice that something is very different about All 4 One. Sure, it's still got bright and vivid graphics and plenty of humorous cut scenes but the main focus of this game is the new co-op feature where you can play with up to four players total. You get your choice between Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious. In some ways playing four player can be very fun as you watch everything on screen explode when you get all players firing at the same target...at other times you find yourself being stalled because you can't advance the camera while one player holds up the group in an attempt to collect bolts. This annoying issue leads to many deaths by falling or getting trapped in the path of rocket launching baddies.  Then there are the mostly fixed and poorly aimed camera angles. For the most part this leads to a camera view much farther back than we have seen in Ratchet and Clank. Then there's the new and much shallower weapons upgrade system. All upgrades must be purchased and can only be purchased at weapons vendors that are usually located at the beginning of levels. Once again there's even the foundation of a well imagined and intricate story, but it gets muddled repeatedly by pointless twist and turns.It's not all bad though! There are still bits and pieces of classic Ratchet and Clank mayhem in the form of insane looking bosses, elaborate set pieces, awesome looking levels, incredible graphics and occasional laugh out loud dialogue. Much of that humor comes from the brief interactions between arch rivals Qwark and Dr. Nefarious. Another good thing about this game is its very kid friendly. No cursing or gore and the missions are mostly easy to complete. Jump, dodge, shoot, collect bolts...repeat x10,000.As a longtime fan of the Ratchet and Clank series it pains me to say that I'm disappointed in All 4 One. I completely understand that Insomniac Games tried to take the series into uncharted territory, but way too much focus was put on the co-op aspect rather than content. The game does have its fun and interesting parts, but just not enough of its old self is there to make it great. For some reason this game just felt more like it belonged as a $14.99 PSN download rather than a full-fledged $60 disk release. I have no doubts that the next Ratchet and Clank game will be absolutely flawless. 3.5/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2011"}

While not the first game to offer enhanced control with Sony's  dual-stick analog controller,Ape Escapeis the first game to require either an analog ordual shock controllerto play. That requirement  ensures that players will have full control of their hero, Spike. One stick moves Spike in any direction,  while the other swings his monkey-catching devices.InApe Escape, a circus monkey named Specter stumbles upon a scientist's prototype  intelligence-enhancing helmet, turning him into an evil monkey genius. As Spike, the professor's young  friend, you must travel through time to clean up all of the monkeys Specter has sent back in his attempt to  repopulate the world. If that's not enough to make you laugh, then chasing his goofy monkey minions as  they scurry from your clutches will certainly tickle your funny bone. You'll discover a variety of gadgets to  help you in your quest, including monkey radar, a slingshot, and a propeller for flying. Spanning 25 huge  levels,Ape Escapeis approachable for novices, and offers added challenges for veteran gamers.  One such challenge is to lure a dinosaur near a rocky cliff, and then jar the monkey off his back and into  your net.

Since my game play style tends towards using the analog controller whenever I can, this game seems to be custom made for myself. And of course it is. It's a pretty neat concept having the monkeys (I don't think the manual writer did a lot of research on monkeys since the book uses &quot;baboons,&quot; &quot;apes,&quot; and &quot; chimps&quot; interchangeably)  escape from the zoo and having your job to chase down and capture them. Nice non violent plot really, one of the very few games that I buy and my girlfriend is willing to play.And while the game has a nice plot, the programmers also spent a little time on the graphics in the game. Since the PSX is showing its age there is only so much any programmer can do. But the programers did a very good job. The smooth graphics, &quot;large&quot; worlds and a grand variety of scenes make this game a delight to explore (Never mind the obvious use of some of Sony's stock SDK files, usually evident by the &quot;Pa Rappa&quot; look in some areas). Throw in a huge variety of weapons and usable &quot;tools&quot; make this a winning formula indeed. In fact it is likely that after the PSX goes the way of the Atari 7800 that this game will be one of the reasons that die hard fans of the PSX will dust off that gray box (Or blue if they upgrade to the PSX2) and play a few levels. However, I have one major gripe.It shocks me that many people consider the Ape Escape camera to be nice and well behaved. This camera is one of the most ill-behaved I've come across in a long time. Just what are some people comparing this camera to? Super Mario 64? If that's the case, then that's a hard judge. SM64's camera was pretty bad but at least it was aware of walls and didn't go behind them too often. Ape Escape's camera not only goes behind walls but it goes through them as well! Haven't the programmers at least heard of a &quot;Jelly Cam&quot;? C'Mon, there are numerous examples out there of what to do and what not to do with the camera. Ones with decent (mind you, decent, not perfect) camera's include Spyro 2, MDK 2, and Zelda 64. All of these games had cameras that were somewhat well behaved (although none show the classic &quot;Jelly Cam,&quot; A Jelly Cam is a camera that when it goes through a wall turns the wall, or anything else, into a semitransparent entity. You know it's there but at least you can see what's going on on the other side.) AE does not fall into that category. I can't tell you how many times I've run back and forth in a level looking for a way out only to discover the camera wasn't &quot;swinging&quot; in an appropriate direction. Some pundits may tell you that only adds to the difficulty of the game. Someone should remind them of the difference between skilled difficulty and annoying frustration. Never, Never should any one ever lose a life because the camera wasn't doing a good job of showing what is happening around you. &quot;How about blind spots?&quot; Some may ask. What about them? It is very possible to design a game and camera to allow the classic &quot;leap of fate.&quot; My gripe lies with the camera refusing to shift at appropriate times so that I can at least survive the darn jump! Or Shifting to an appropriate angle to allow a fair fight against a baddie. All to often I'm getting pummeled by a monkey with a machine gun or rockets simply because the stupid camera doesn't know enough to swing around a column. And using buttons to &quot;fix&quot; the camera's faults is a cheap trick. Sorry Sony, A big company like your self should know better.This game gets three stars due the rotten camera work. If the programmers spent more time with this crucial element then the game would certainly win five stars. Too bad Sony, the frustration with the camera is simply too high. For those who think the camera works &quot;perfect&quot; play a few more games for comparison.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2000"}

One tremendous improvement takes place in Resident Evil 5:  splitscreen co-op play.  For generations raised on 2-player Ataris and Nintendos, it is surprisingly difficult to find games that actually let you play with your friends in your house, rather than get yelled at by strangers over a headset (some might even argue this is why the Wii is so popular).Resident Evil 5 intelligently makes this not only available, but a centerpiece of the game.  It is far more entertaining and enjoyable to deal with zombies/infected with friends, and the ability to provide covering fire for each other, scout routes, swap weapons, and generally back each other up makes this a really fun game.The primary negative is that the truly cludgy \"classic\" RE control scheme remains.  I guess at this point being unable to, say, walk and shoot at the same time, is part of the \"true\" RE experience, but some of us are sick of it.  There are tons of games out there that have amply demonstrated that you can get scared while also being able to actually move like a human being.  So often, Resident Evil 5 devolves into the typical \"run, creakily turn in place, aim, shoot, try to run, get eaten\" sequence that -- spread out over 10 deaths -- makes you want to put a foot through the screen.  Imagining RE5 with a smoother combat system (like, say, Vegas Six 2) really lets your mind wander into what a glorious game it might have been.Frustration also sets in with various \"set piece\" levels common to RE5 where unless you know the specific sequence of events to engage in, you will die repeatedly pursuing the \"wrong\" but usually much more obvious approach.  A monster might seem like he is a mini-boss that needs to be killed, but in fact is invincible and must be avoided.  Yet the next boss seems insanely powerful, suggesting flight is the answer, yet actually you are supposed to stand and fight.

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"Dubyac99 \"Dubyac99\"","summary":"Becoming wooden, and a bit boring","reviewText":"Yo!

Just like Rome Total War, it is barely historically accurate, but at least goes further than RTW.  The morale system is typical arcade style in which the most hardened and disciplined troops will piss themselves and flee the battlefield after about a minute or more of actual combat.  Everything below that will be even worse.The graphics and music are great.  The voices are great and accurate (I love hearing my Holy Romans call me Kaisar, or my Seljuk Turks say Salam Alekum to me).Whoever set up the configuration for the game is quite frankly an idiot... the game can and does have a section to show the year and the season, but by default, it is DISABLED.  Meaning unless you know how to edit the Preferences.cfg file, you will not know what year it is in the campaign map.  Not only that, but some idiot thought it was a good idea for each End Turn to have 2 years pass in the game... despite the fact that the game is still operating under default circumstances, in which 1 End turn = half a year.  This means that while the game will process 4 years having gone by after 2 turns, your leaders will have only aged 1 year.The game also, in true Rome Total War fashion, gives the factions highly informal and almost offensive names that factions of this period of grandiosity would never call themselves...For example, in the early period there is the Seljuq Empire in Turkey, and in the late period there is the Ottoman Empire.  The entire faction is just bluntly and blandly labeled \"The Turks\".  The Almoravid Dynasty is just \"Moors\".  The Duchy of Milan is just \"Milan\".  The Republic of Venice, the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France, the Egyptian Sultinate, the Mongolian Empire, etcetera, are all base \"Venice\", \"England\", \"France\", \"Egypt\", \"Mongols\", \"etc\".  Considering how formal and grandiose the leaders and such were at the time, this is almost as insulting as a game featuring Canada calling it \"up there\".And then comes the big EFF YOU! to the modding community.Rome Total War was not at all a perfect game, but with all the game files layed out neatly and nicely in the data folder, you could easily modify what you wanted, replace unit textures, download massive and expansive mods like Rome Total Realism, or Europa Barbarorum, which could not only make the game historically accurate, but seem to completely change the game itself in the process.RTW was released by Activision.  M2TW was released by Sega.  It's probably not Sega's fault, but all the game files are now packed into massive files, making them unreachable.By patch 1.1, an unpacking tool was released, letting you unpack the game files for modification.  HOWEVER, the tool openly admits that it's not fully effective, and may DAMAGE YOUR GAME INSTALLATION.Modding the game is outright hell, as the preferences file which must be altered RESETS itself every time you open and close the game.  This means you must make ANOTHER preferences file and create a .BAT file to link this preferences file with the game file.  If you have no idea how to do that, you're completely lost and will have to rely on downloading someone else's mod to change the gameplay even slightly.THEN you must create a new mod folder if you don't want to alter the game files and have to unpack them again (7 gigabytes worth of stuff, long time) when (and it WILL) go wrong.  You must then copy the \"text\" and \"world\" folders from the Data folder into the new mod's Data folder with your included changes.  The text files in the \"Text\" folder are not even in .txt format, so you must download a utility to convert them---then the game thankfully re-converts the .txt file to its original file extension.After all this is done, it's really a crapshoot whether or not your modification will even work; thus far, I've attempted to mod the game and have had to reinstall it once.  Right now, a problem is occurring where HALF the game's text is missing.  Missing.  Just not showing up at all.  And the game is not at fault---I can play the original game just fine, but god forbid I should try to change it easily like I could with Rome Total War; it seems like the makers of M2TW are strongly encouraging their way or no way.  I'm very likely going to have to reinstall the game for a SECOND time just to make the little changes of renaming the factions (like I mentioned above) and fixing the timeshifting (like I mentioned above) and improving morale so my battles are more fun and don't end in 6 or 7 minutes.  And the game hates me for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}

Cooper","summary":"Addictive gameplay, nosy Pope, and a feeling of strategic brilliance with well-timed victories","reviewText":"Graphics:Having played every Total War game since Shogun, I knew what to expect going in.  This game is quite an improvement over the original Medieval graphics-wise.  The graphics are slightly better than Rome Total War - with an included option to select widescreen or fullscreen format, something that I wish more developers would include in their games these days.  (Here's looking at you EA).That and the fact that your individual soldiers within a unit have a randomized appearance put this a step above Rome in the graphics department - especially with the sheer number of units that can be in a battle.My verdict?  A+Gameplay:While I can only speak to the single player portion of the game, I have found myself playing 5 - 6 hours at a time, and have had to begin pacing myself.  The politics, intrigue, and of course - warfare wrap things up into a nice little package of fun.One thing I have found annoying (albeit probably realistic) is that the Pope - if there are lots of cardinals from an enemy nation, or if he is from one of the enemy nations can be downright hostile towards you.As England, I was minding my own business - when France and their ally Denmark invaded me and declared war.  Although I was caught by surprise, I was not off guard thankfully as I had just landed an army commanded by my best general in the general area they were attacking.  This was a fortuitous coincidence as I was mainly getting him out of the mainland because there was an inquisitor poking around and executing my generals and family for heresy - and my best general, a \"Pagan Magician\" was someone I didn't want to lose despite his religious failings.In short order, I beat the invaders out of my country and was on the outskirts of Paris - when the Pope told me to \"quit spilling the blood of your fellow Christians with your aggression.\"  I was perplexed long enough to realize that between them - France and Denmark made up half of the college of cardinals.If they wanted to play dirty, so could I - as I began grooming new priests as candidates for cardinals - and assassins to open up the college itself.Brute force isn't the only strategy in this game, and the politics and intrigue add a whole new level of depth to this series.My verdict: A+Overall - I am pleased to see the return of special mission videos that have been lacking since Shogun, although these are not quite (but almost) as interesting to watch.  I have had an excellent time with this game, and recommend it to old fans of the Total War series - as well as new fans alike.From Europe, Africa, the Middle East - and I understand America can be opened up... prepare for Total War.  Crusades and Jihads abound during this representation of a tumultuous time in human history.  The mongol invasion is represented as well - adding more and more levels than existed in the earliest Total War games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2006"}

The setup is way too familiar, and all of the puzzles are portal puzzles. Granted, the game is called Portal 2, but it'd have been nice to have some variation away from the portal gun, possibly to do hacking or exploration of areas where the portal gun could not go. While audio was great, there were some fantastically wasted opportunity's to include video that would've been fantastic, namely in the Aperture Science Innovators areas.

I've bought every game except Shadow the Hedgehog, and my biggest frustration with Team Sonic is that there have been some truly awful releases in the series.My daughter learned to love Sonic, but she's the newer generation that can enjoy Sonic Heroes and Sonic Riders more than I do, while I'm still more of the side-scrolling 'classic' Sonic fan.Sonic Generations is wonderful for us both:  it's a blast from the past that's also a breath of fresh air.  We have many different creative levels that borrow from the older games in varying degrees:  some look dead-on like the original, but the gameplay has been improved, while others are creative and new.The beauty of Sonic Generations is that it intentionally gives you both ways to play the game:  every level has a 2D, mostly-sidescrolling version that resembles the Genesis classics and a 3D version that's like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Heroes, etc.  My daughter and I take turns playing each type and we love watching each other and giving advice.  My daughter loved watching me zip through a city that resembled San Francisco, and I loved watching her speed down the side of a skyscraper pursued by police-bots.As you play each level, you unlock challenges to the level that really do encourage re-play:  some are timed races, others are \"finish the level with only one ring left\", and more.  Everything you do gives you 'money' that you can take to an in-game shop to buy various upgrades:  for example, one is \"start each new life with 10 rings; costs 40 coins each use.\"  You can activate whichever add-ons you wish and turn others off, and then there's \"The Sega Genesis Controller\", which apparently lets you use an in-game Sega console to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog game from 1990 (but it costs 7,777 coins!)In between stages you get the cutscenes that children enjoy.  My daughter loves watching each segment as we 'free' Rouge, Knuckles, Cream and more.  So there's a story element to it too:  and as usual Dr. Eggman (a.k.a. \"Robotnik\") is behind it all...or is he?If you want a Sonic game that pulls the best of the past into one place, Sonic Generations does a great job of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Fun Game,Different Experience, Not Call of Duty and Amazing Graphics!","reviewText":"Battlefield 3 has been feverishly hyped as the Call of Duty killer (not least by EA itself), but in a sense it is a very different beast. Despite EA insisting that Battlefield 3's campaign would be a shining light in military first-person shooters, the reality is that it churns out all the familiar Call of Duty clich&eacute;s in a linear parade, albeit one that looks stunning and is fun to play through.Thankfully, though, Battlefield 3 comes with a seriously world-class and totally distinct multiplayer game that fits with the series tradition of epic warfare on a massive scale, and provides a challenge matched by few other shooters. In addition, a suite of co-operative modes are engaging and support fresh tactics, although it would be better if there were more of them. This game may not be the slayer of Call of Duty, but that's probably missing the point anyway - instead, Battlefield 3 is a hugely worthy game that any online shooter fan should pick up. Battlefield 3's multiplayer excels by taking a more open, almost sandbox approach to online warfare that majors on player-led tactics and exploration. Whether it's ruling the skies in jets, raining down fire in an attack chopper, or stomping the ground as a grunt; the game always makes the heat of the battle challenging and enjoyable. Battles unfurl on huge maps in a variety of rural, urban and military locations that are beautifully recreated and designed.The console game has been slimmed down slightly from the PC, including the cap of 24-player matches and modified maps (the PC game also has better visuals, of course). But the console version is still incredible engaging, competitive and expansive; recreating virtual warfare on a scale that few other online shooters are able to match. There are also some great new ideas, such as an in-game server browser for console matchmaking, which enables players to easily locate the exact type of game that they want to play (particularly useful as EA was having problems with the Quick Match at the time of writing). Vehicles are the biggest differentiating factor about the Battlefield series and they are just as crucial in Battlefield 3, whether it's assaulting a target or simply moving around the huge maps. The rewards and progression incentives are spot on in Battlefield 3, making it consistently rewarding to put in the hours and always feel like you are moving forward. All the core classes - Soldier, Engineer, Assault, and Recon - have different skills and unlockable advantages that are essential for the fight, meaning the process of levelling them all up is a must. And just like a kid in a candy shop, the next reward or unlock is dangled like a delicious treat, well worth earning your pocket money to afford. But for all the individualism, Battlefield 3 is all about being part of a fighting force waging large-scale operations against the enemy.From the Battlefield staple Rush mode to the new addition of Team Deathmatch, the game encourages people to help out their teammates not only by racking up the most kills, but also by assisting in others areas. Heal a teammate, get a damaged tank back into the fight or resupply a sniper team, and you are rewarded appropriately. This means you can top the scoreboards simply by being the best team player, regardless of how times you have perished in action. The game has various features to encourage team play, such as multi-passenger vehicles, squad support and target spotting. This all adds up to a genuine feeling of being in a war with many others, ready to help out and change your tactics towards the greater good. The fact that the game is individually rewarding a the same time is a testament to developer DICE.The expansive, open and highly customisable fighting in Battlefield 3's multiplayer is in stark contrast to the single-player campaign, which treads a familiar path of linear scripted action and clich&eacute;d storytelling.Think of all the most tired and obvious military stereotypes and they are all here - nuclear warheads, international terrorists, Middle Eastern conflict zones, murky Russian involvement and a crisis that threatens the very future of the world as we know it. Sergeant Henry Blackburn is at least a vaguely interesting and multi-dimensional character, but he inhabits a world portioned out with the cookie cutter. Just how many more times are games like these going to use the interrogation-flashback structure to tell their story? Is this really the best we can expect? You know the formula - the game unravels in stages as you are interrogated about some mystery incident. It was an innovative approach at first, but that was a long time ago and Battlefield 3 stumbles blindly into overly familiar territory. The vehicle sequences are well constructed and fun, but there are not enough of them and the lack of free control feels like a let down. Battlefield is so intrinsically linked to vehicle-based warfare, but only a sequence driving a tank through the desert features full control and other missions, such as in a fighter jet, relegate you to the gunner seat. There are way too many quicktime events and they all lack any real punch. The button prompts feel imprecise, making these moments unnecessary breaks from the action. One particular section stands out the most, but it is difficult to discuss this without giving away the story.But despite these criticisms, there are a few positives to cling onto. The campaign admirably attempts to introduce some sense of moral quandary and reflect the many grey areas involved with international military operations, particularly against trans-national terrorist groups. There is a stronger sense of realism and threat to the story, making this feel more true to the subject matter than Call of Duty.Battlefield 3 is also a stunning looking game thanks to the Frostbite 2 engine. The character animations are fantastic, while the lighting and shadow effects add extra dimensions, from the shafts of light spearing through broken windows in the back streets of Iran, to the billowing spray kicked up around an aircraft carrier. There are a few bugs, such as characters popping through walls and various screen tears, but not enough to completely ruin the experience.Alongside the single-player and multiplayer modes, there is also a co-operative game that adds an extra dimension. The co-op is based on the main campaign story, but takes its lead from the engaging gameplay approach of the multiplayer. These six missions again focus on teamwork, but this time on a much smaller scale than the multiplayer. Working with a teammate throws up a range of great tactical options, such as one person flanking while the other draws fire.One mission puts you in control of an attack helicopter, the only time outside the multiplayer where you can practice your skills in a chopper. Unfortunately, a few of the unsatisfying quicktime events from the main campaign bleed through to the co-op game, which can lead to a few frustrating deaths. It's also a shame that the co-op is disappointingly brief, adding only around three or four hours to the six to seven hours that it takes to beat the main campaign.Overall, Battlefield 3 is an excellent shooter that makes up for the shortcomings in its single-player campaign with exceptional multiplayer modes and a solid co-op game. The campaign falls down by trotting out the usual clich&eacute;d events and action sequences - military shooters in future simply must do something different with single-player, because the end-of-the-world international terrorism scenario is getting remarkably tired.But the lack of sparkle in Battlefield 3's campaign is offset by engaging and addictive large-scale multiplayer battles that have few equals, along with a co-op game that is thoroughly enjoyable while it lasts. Comparisons to Modern Warfare 3 are going to be inevitable, but it is impossible at this stage to know if Battlefield 3 is a better and more successful game. It seems clear, though, that the game's online multiplayer will give Activision's 1,000-pound gorilla a serious run for its money this year.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a different, non-call of duty type of experience. The graphics will blow you away and it was an enjoyable game overall","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Brilliant fun","reviewText":"Once again, Batman has defeated his arch-nemesis, the Joker, and returned him to incarceration at Arkham Asylum. Unfortunately for Batman, this turns out to be a trap. The Joker's men take over the prison and release the insane inmates, including several of Batman's most dangerous foes (such as Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and Bane). Evading capture himself, Batman has to regain control of the prison and stop the Joker's plan to create an army of insane and powerful soldiers loyal only to him.Ah, Batman. The Dark Knight, who takes on a host of villains with a combination of martial arts, impressive gadgetry and cool vehicles. You can't get a superhero (even if his superpower is merely being incredibly rich) better-suited for computer games. It's a surprise, then, that very few games based on the character have been much cop.Arkham Asylum makes up for a lengthy run of mediocre to poor Batman games by being very good indeed. The developers, Rocksteady, haven't hit upon this by accident, but have apparently looked in depth at a whole host of titles whose game styles could be adapted for a Batman title. Playing Arkham Asylum, it's impossible not to be struck by echoes of older titles. The physicality of the combat recalls Starbreeze's superb Riddick games, whilst the drug-induced hallucinatory levels are reminiscent of the Max Payne series. The use of Batman's growing repertoire of skills and gadgets to cross seemingly impassable areas, complete with the camera hinting at what to do next, has more than a touch of Prince of Persia (circa the Sands of Time games) to it. The heavy emphasis on stealth and silent takedowns also hints at influences from the Splinter Cell and Thief series. Yet, whilst Rocksteady clearly have been making notes, they have still created a game that feels like it builds on what has come before, rather than ripping it off.Gameplay-wise, Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game where the player guides Batman through the asylum and the surrounding buildings on Arkham Island, which the Joker has sealed off from the mainland. The main storyline sees Batman pursuing the Joker through the Asylum, but being sidetracked by confrontations with both the Joker's allies (most notably Harley Quinn and Scarecrow) and other supervillains he has put away over the years. Most notably, Killer Croc, Bane and especially Poison Ivy also interfere with Batman's mission. Though the game has a linear plot, the setting is open, allowing Batman to deviate from his main mission to revisit previously-explored areas. In addition, Batman is not alone in his mission. Commissioner Gordon is also trapped on the island, along with a large number of security guards and Asylum personnel, whilst Batman is helped with certain puzzles and objectives by Oracle (a former Batgirl paralysed in a shooting, who oversees Batman's progress from the Batcave).The game has a notable combat focus, which allows for complex fighting moves to be executed using a simple system (one button to attack, another to counter an enemy's moves, telegraphed by symbols appearing over their head). This system is well-implemented, with combat given a heavy, physical feel to it. Unusually for an action game, there is no option to use firearms. This is of course in keeping with the Batman mythos, but it means that a strong emphasis must be placed on stealth and the use of gadgets to separate and overcome enemies, especially those armed. Batman can take a few bullets but is relatively fragile compared to many gaming protagonists. Refreshingly, there is no in-combat regenerating health (though his health does return once the area has been cleared of enemies), forcing players to adopt a more thoughtful approach to playing Batman.Arkham Asylum's greatest success is making the player actually feel they're playing Batman (perhaps to the point of screaming, \"I'M THE GODDAMN BATMAN!\" after pulling off a particularly awesome 25-move combo. Erm, not that I ever did that). He's formidable but not immortal, and solves a lot of the problems through ingenuity and detective work rather than head-on confrontations. There's also a lot of use of gadgets, including grappling hooks, hacking tools (to short-circuit control panels and open doors), ziplines and batarangs. Vital to the game is a visor which allows Batman to see enemies through walls and doorways and assess their threat value before engaging them in combat. Particularly satisfying - if somewhat implausible - is the ability to hang upside down from ceilings and snatch passing enemies, knocking them out without alerting other foes nearby. Entering a room with a dozen gun-toting villains and then taking them out one-by-one, hiding in the shadows, executing stealthy knock-downs or hiding under floor grills and then emerging to strike, is ridiculously good fun.The game features universally great voice acting, particularly from Batman: The Animated Series regulars Kevin Conroy (as Batman) and Mark 'Luke Skywalker' Hamill, whose performance as the Joker is nothing short of stunning throughout. Arleen Sorkin also hits the right note between annoying and accomplished as the deranged Harley Quinn. Paul Dini, a veteran writer for both the animated Batman series and DC Comics, does an excellent job with the dialogue for the game, tailoring it to be more expositionary than normal (for the benefit of gamers not particularly versed in the intricacies of the Batman world) whilst still feeling relatively natural. It's one of the more accomplished transitions of a prose writer to gaming we've seen recently (certainly better than Richard Morgan, whose gaming work on Crysis 2 was unremarkable).The game is also brave for not trying to establish a new canon for the Batman mythos. Instead, it takes place firmly in the DC Comics universe, making continuity references to earlier comics and stories (the Joker references the events of the Alan Moore-penned The Killing Joke several times). Yet the game does not expect players to be fully versed in the backstory. Instead, it provides fact files on Batman's allies and enemies for the player to read, and interview tapes from psychiatric evaluations of the villains can also be found lying around the Asylum. These do an excellent job of bringing the player up to speed on events without bogging things down with lengthy explanations of what's going on. The tone is also well-established, with things definitely being more grandiose, funny and colourful than the Christopher Nolan films, but avoiding a descent into out-and-out camp.It's hard to think of any major problems with the game. It's well-written, well-acted and relentlessly enjoyable. Combat is well-executed and the use of stealth and gadgets is perfectly executed. It has a plethora of optional side-missions, achievements and collectibles for those who want as much game as possible for their money, but the central plot is compelling and long enough (at roughly 10-12 hours by itself) and features some genuinely surprising twists (including a late-game event that completely changes the nature of the environment). A repetitive nightmare mini-game featuring Scarecrow feels a little bit out of place, and the running battle with Killer Croc in the sewers is a bit tedious, but neither are particularly major features of the game.Batman: Arkham Asylum (*****) is terrific fun from start to finish, an accomplished and smart game that distills 100% pure comic book fun into a great gaming experience. Recommended. The game is available now in the UK (PC, Mac, X-Box 360, PS3) and USA (PC, Mac, X-Box 360, PS3). A sequel, Arkham City, was released last year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVS3","description":"Mega man 2 nes cartridge","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"The quintessential Mega Man game is perhaps the most overrated Mega Man game","reviewText":"Like most fans, I love Mega Man 2. No ifs, ands or butts about it, Mega Man 2 single-handedly spearheaded my interest in the blue bomber and video games in general. But as simple of a joy as the game is even today, there's something my ever-evolving self has to ask, has Mega Man 2 been hurt by the hype?I ask this question because over the years I've seen other gamer's continuously put other landmark titles I grew up on unrealistically high pedestals. Final Fantasy VII may have been great, but does a sealed black-boarder copy of the game really warrant four hundred dollars? Xenogears may have had a psychotically layered narrative that turned it a playable anime, but was the game really perfect? Metal Gear Solid put you in the ever convincing shoes of a professional killer but can its aging gameplay match the cinematic quality of its story? It's rampant fandom that ignores such obvious questions that makes me wonder if such views are damaging.Damaging or not, even after replaying Mega Man 2 for the first time in the last few years, I can't even begin to tear this game down. Sure, it's rather lax in the difficulty department, but that's an area I've never been too concerned with when it comes to games in general. Even running through the game like I was on auto-pilot wasn't enough hurt it, which leads me to wonder how one could even take down Mega Man 2? A stake dipped in holy water? My guess is a good as any.Regardless of my ranting, Mega Man 2 is the hallmark everyone remembers it being. Despite my attempt to approach the game from safe vantage point to avoid the disappointment that sometimes comes with reminiscence, my worries evaporated quicker than a snow cone on a hot summer day. Relieved as I am that the game is more-or-less timeless, I'm still uncomfortable tooting the game's horn, something I'm not afraid to do for the also stellar Mega Man X4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

MM1 is missing many of the features that was introduced in Megaman 2 - namely the power to gain different weapons from the vanquished Robot Masters along with the assistance of the robotic dog Rush.The points/score system has been eliminated, which is good since it didn't really serve a function in MM1. This game would actually set the tone for the rest of the series - cans of Energy, the help of Rush, and the fact that the number of Robot Masters were upped to 8 as opposed to the original 6. The graphics are also a step ahead, since MM1 had fairly simpler graphics - but then, comparing MM1 to the rest of the series is like comparing the first Legend of Zelda or the first Super Mario Brothers game to the rest of their respective series.

The epic story line will reveal secrets about Riddick's past and cast light upon his future. Features the voice and likeness of Vin Diesel.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Welcome to Butcher Bay -- Enjoy Your Stay...","reviewText":"\"Pitch Black\" was a good movie, despite what it obviously owed to films like \"Alien,\" but its sequel, \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" felt like it took place in an entirely different universe, and traded its predecessor's character depth and moody tension in for choppy, overblown action. In case you're wondering, the Xbox shooter \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" takes place in the latter setting, but at least it allows Riddick to curse and kill in a non-PG-13 environment (a luxury the edited film didn't have). On top of that, it offers some very fine first-person gaming. Even so, despite much of the recent hype surrounding it, it has more than its fair share of problems - not unlike the movie to which it's tied.You're cast as Richard B. Riddick (of course), recently captured and imprisoned in the maximum security prison that is Butcher Bay. The order of the day: escape. That's easier said than done, of course, what with the fact that you're virtually unarmed and faced with an army of armed guards and angry prisoners. The storyline does its job well, and the game's to be commended for not trying to merely recreate the movie's storyline (see \"Van Helsing\" or \"The Return of the King\"). A star-studded cast ups the production value and manages to make you feel like you're actually playing a pequel movie, but the story never really hits its stride and it scarcely meshes well with \"Pitch Black.\"Gameplay-wise, \"Riddick\" is a real winner. Despite the fact that it's played almost entirely from a first person perspective, it feels like a third person action game. Gunplay aside, you'll find yourself going hand-to-hand with some of the game's enemies and performing \"Tenchu\"-like stealth kills. The FPS stuff isn't half bad either, and owes a serious debt to \"Halo\" (even if it never attains that game's greatness). I'd go so far as to say that \"Butcher Bay\" offers the best combination of stealth and action gameplay that I've ever seen. If you've played the recent \"Breakdown,\" you have an idea what to expect - but as far as the game's controls are concerned, it easily surpasses the aforementioned title.What \"Butcher Bay\" lacks are unique and varied environments. By choosing to set the game entirely in a prison setting, the developers obviously limited themselves. Even so, the mostly cramped indoor environments are highly atmospheric - it's just too bad you'll feel like you're moving down the same hallway over and over again throughout much of the game. Some creepy caverns and abandoned mines come into play (and offer opponents that are less than human), but there's very little to break up the monotony.Visually, \"Butcher Bay\" is a mixed bag. The game's engine allows for some very moody lighting, and its character models and textures are particularly impressive. It's actually one of the best looking Xbox games ever made, but there are problems as well. To keep it from chugging, some distant objects and/or characters become extremely fuzzy, or even pixelated. Sometimes it's hard to notice, and other times you'll find yourself rubbing at your eyes. At its worst, it can be a little disconcerting.\"Butcher Bay\" is one of those games that starts off with more promise than it ultimately finishes with, but despite its shortcomings it's easily one of the best video game/Hollywood unions ever. The action and stealth elements make for equally effective bedfellows, and demand that you play this game.Final Score: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Major Improvement over original","reviewText":"Like many I was first introduced to the concept of Aliens vs. Predator through the Dark Horse comics.  While I found the comics fair at best (movie to comics adaptions are rarely good) I am a huge fan of the Alien movies (except for the god-awful \"Alien: Resurrestion\") and to a lesser degree, the Predator movies.  The concept was awesome, but an Alien isn't an Alien unless it's screaming that high pitched Godzilla whine and a Predator isn't a Predator without those weird clicking growls.  There have been rumors of an Alien vs. Predator movie for as long as I can remember, but so far no cigar.When the first PC game came out I really looked forward to it. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into it.  I thought the plot was mindless the controls were wacky and the multiplayer was unbalanced.  The novelty of controling an Alien or Predator wore off pretty fast after a few frustrating minutes.  Once again, a great concept was put to waste.For the first time, we now have a quality product from the marriage of two great film creatures.  This game rocks.  The last shooter that I got this into was Clive Barkers Undying.  Before that it was System Shock 2 (a fantastic and highly underrated game).  They all have one thing in common: tha ability to scare the crap out of me.  The ambiance and tone of the game truly does the movies justice.  I can think of several instances were I thoguht I was going to jump out of my skin.This game has it all: great story, great graphics, great sound (I should put specific emphasis on this one.  I have surround speakers and the ambiance and sudden noises kept scaring the crap out of me) and a lot of action.  What's more, they manage to capture the tone of each individual race and balance some of the issues that AVP1 suffered from.  The Aliens were mincemeat in the first game, but they're much more frightening in this installment.  They're treated more like the Aliens in part 1 and part 3 than the cannon fodder of Aliens.Even if you're not a big fan of the movies or the comics, I encourage you to try this game.  It's rare for a franchise game to please more than just die-hard fans, but this is one of those games.  Not since \"Jedi Knight\" has a movie based game captured the essence of a film so perfectly.  If the single player games had been a little longer I'd probably give this game 5 stars.  Instead I can only hope that an expansion is in the works because I want more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2002"}

Yes!","reviewText":"I've played the vast majority of racing games, dating back to Pole Position on the 2600, and if I've learned one thing, is that they all start to look and feel alike after a while.  When the original Gran Turismo came out, it innovated thanks to its immense car list and realism.  Project Gotham brought the Kudos system, and online integration.  So why am I declaring Forza better than Gran Turismo 4?  Well, since both games are visually stunning, play impeccably and have immense depth, it must be because Forza has...1.  Better AI.  This is actually quite staggering, for while GT4 claims to be a driving simulator, it really has brain-dead computer opponents.  They drive as if on rails, cannot crash, and contribute to the robotic feel of the game.  Not so with Forza!  The CPU controlled drivers can crash on their own, actually drive fairly and realistically, and generally feel more like human opponents: ie: some are good, some are bad, some are erratic.2.  Damage Modeling.  Yet again, the \"realistic\" driving simulator comes up short to Forza, because in this game, when you crash/sideswipe/scratch you car, you can see AND feel it.  It's realistically done (ie: one scratch won't cause your car to die), and also brings a financial element to the game, as you win less money for each race with each crash (repairs, one assumes).3.  More soul.  This is hard to define, but GT4, while a fine game, is really robotic and dry.  It's beautiful but not enthralling, well-made but heartless.  This is not the case with Forza, which has much more emotion (see the AI part above), drama (see Damage Modelling above) and soul than GT4.  You get into the races, as opposed to slogging through them just so you can unlock the 17th variation of a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo.4.  Online play.  No brainer.  GT4 promised, but ultimately scrapped the online component.  As if the Xbox were lacking great online racers (see Project Gotham 2/3), here comes Forza, which further defines the integration of online and offline play.5.  More cars available from the start, fewer hoops to jump through.  This is one of the reasons I get bored with GT4 (and GT3, for that matter): you have to \"pay your dues\" and most normal people (ie: with jobs, loved ones, etc) will never, ever have the time to get to the good cars, because you have to race for days with a crappy 4-cylinder before being able to afford a minor upgrade.  Forza gives you more available right from the start, all the while maintaining a healthy amount of unlockables.6.  The Drivatar.  Terrific, innovative and revolutionary.  The drivatar is an AI version of you that you can train to race for you, in the event that you find an event too hard, too boring, or you just want to race it again to build up your bank account.  It's eerily effective, and while it is weird to train a video game to play itself, it addresses a need players have had for a while, something to help them get through the duller races.Overall, Forza is an amazing experience.  The gearheads will love the tweakability of cars (as deep as GT4), the Need For Speed fans will love the custom vinyls and paints, and anyone looking for a fun, deep but accessible racer will adore this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2005"}

No matter how well it did, people are going to judge its \"wow factor\" against how amazing the original Halo felt to play back when it first came out. Now that we are used to the weapons, races, environments and plotline, nothing is as cool as it was that first time. It's the same issue that plagues any series, be it Dune, the Matrix, Star Wars, etc.Halo 3 does get a boost in that it is released for the 360, so you get an automatic upgrade in abilities there. We're playing on a high end HD TV, and yes, it looks really nice. The backgrounds look like a painting in motion, with swirling clouds and dancing dust storms. From the light glinting off the metal surfaces to the detailed shadows in the rocks, it can be really gorgeous. Is every detail as beautiful as every detail in, say Gears of War? Maybe not. Different developers focus on different items.  There are always trade-offs for speed and visual appeal reasons. For a Halo world, I think they did a good job.The sound and dialogue are really great. I like the background music, and I find much of the dialogue hilarious. There are some conversations that have me laughing out loud. This is a good game to play with your surround sound stereo system hooked up, and of course the subwoofers.I hated the ending of Halo 2. I dislike it when a story finishes with a \"and now wait a few years to find out what happened.\"  They can at least have you feel like you achieved something, and ended a chapter. For that reason alone it's good to have Halo 3 here to wrap everything up.Unfortunately, with all the time they spent in development, this third outing is a bit predictable. I really enjoyed the multi character play in Halo 2. I thought that was a great touch. They completely removed it for Halo 3, setting you back into a Master Chief only mode. To be honest, I really thought we'd get THREE races this time around, and get to play as the Flood too. Why reduce ourselves to just one?Also, while there are a lot of \"missions\", some of them are maybe 5 minutes long. That's a bit on the short side. I realize you can go back and replay on harder and harder levels to challenge yourself - but they could have put more depth into the basic story line.Now, all of those things being said, the key to any game in modern times is its multiplayer ability. No matter what single player game you play, it's pretty much a limited time game. Multiplayer is completely unlimited - and you're not stuck with the formulas built into the AI brains. Halo 3 is definitely the best multiplayer experience of the three games - the most balanced, the most fun, the best graphics. You could literally play this for years and not get bored of it.So to summarize - if you don't have XBox Live, you could rent this game for a week, get through it and have a lot of fun. You'll be able to see how the story ends, get your Halo fix in and be happy. But if you do have XBox Live, you'll want to own this. Between replaying the base game on harder levels to improve your skills, and playing multi-player in a variety of maps and set-ups, you'll be happy for a long, long while.There are many games we write a walkthrough for that we have to push ourselves to get through, but when we did our walkthrough for Halo 3, we really did have fun :) So that's always a good sign!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2007"}

You have a squad of officers at your disposal, and you must get within range to attack your enemy.  From there it's a paper-rock-scissors sort of deal to determine if your attack will hit, and how powerfully.  Your enemy might dodge your attack, even counterattack depending on the type of unit.  All of this lends itself to overall strategy, not bullish tactics, to win the war.Everything is situated like a story is being told.  You navigate through chapters and various battles as the story unfolds, meeting different characters and recruits.  Underneath this is a deeper understory about races and a terrible disaster that occurred many years ago which has caused violence and mistreatment of a race, and the praise of another.  You start as a very benevolent nature loving young boy in a quiet town, until fate forces you to fight, as your father did before you.TO be honest, the first pieces with you and Alicia aren't all that great, but they're a precursor to larger scale warfare whose purpose is to teach you what you need to know to survive what's coming.  As time goes forward, you'll eventually be put in charge of a squad.  Each member has their own strengths and weaknesses which you'll need to exploit to survive.  Imbalance in any area can lend itself to failure in one or more battles, so you need to choose wisely.  As you proceed through battles, you earn experience and gold for your trouble, which can be used to manually level up your squad, learn new orders to use in battle, and buy new weapons and upgrades.  Each scenario gets more and more challenging as you proceed, under the base assumption that you've been getting better and better.  It seems SEGA has thought of just about everything.  Unfortunately, while the concept is an excellent one, there are some issues.First, \"CP\", or Command Points, are used to determine how many turns you and your enemy get.  Your CP is compiled based on how many command-level officers you have in your unit, including Welkin (the main character).  Initially, you'll have two of these officers, Welkin and Alicia.  Once you get to the squad, that number doubles to four.  Near the end you'll get one additional officer, for a total of 5.  According to what I've read, you should get 3 CP per command officer, but in my experience that's not always true.  There are some scenarios that force you to use Welkin and Alicia only, so you should have 6 CP, but end up with only 4-5.  Additionally, there is one scenario in particular where you only have Welkin and two other command officers, which of course should be 9 CP, but you only get 6 total.  If your command officers get defeated in battle before you save them, they have to retreat and won't come back for that battle.  You then lose their CP permanently.  This in of itself isn't a bad thing; it forces you to make smart decisions with what you have.  The problem I have is the fact that the enemy's CP doesn't work that way.  You'll take out all of the enemy's command officers (who are in red, so you know who they are), yet their CP doesn't go down.  If they had 15, they stay with 15.  This is an unfair advantage, in my opinion.  The only way you can counter it is to stockpile: if you don't use all of your CP in a round, you can save it for the next round and have extra.  Of course that means you don't get to take any action, offensive or defensive, so you run the risk of getting hurt or killed.Why do I make such a big deal about that?  Because...The game's one true negative is this: it rewards you for rushing through things, and punishes you for completion.  Meaning, each scenario has a set number of turns, generally 10 or 20.  You have only that long to finish the scenario; I'm fine with that.  What I'm not fine with is the fact that if you take your time to enjoy the game and destroy every enemy on the map, conquer every base, etc...you get punished with a low grade.  The game wants you to complete every scenario as fast as possible: I'm talking 1-3 turns, generally, with maybe one or two scenarios allowing up to 10 (when they really should be like 20).  That often means rushing to the final base, clearing everyone out of it with a grenade or mortar, and taking it with one of your scouts.  Now I might be alone in this, but I DO NOT like being forced to rush through things; part of my enjoyment with games is the idea of completing everything, especially when it's a game as fun as this one, I like to take my time and enjoy every aspect of it.  That means using my snipers to pick off every visible enemy.  That means using my tank to destroy every tank on the field.  That means using my scouts to take every base the enemy has.  Truly DESTROY my enemy, in other words.  The game discourages that.If you get a low grade, you get screwed on experience - thus, not able to build up your squad.  If you rush through it, you don't actually get \"better\" at doing the scenarios because you didn't take the time to defeat all of the enemies; thus, when you get to one of the later cheating scenarios such as Chapter 7 or 14, you're getting whooped initially, because you weren't adequately prepared for what you got.  I really dislike that the game punishes you for being thorough, especially since so many other war games encourage it.Bottom line: if you're a completionist like me, and like to do everything there is to do, and destroy every single peon on the field, you can...just be prepared to be punished for it.  That's really the only issue.  It's a fantastic game otherwise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2008"}

I play exclusively 1P games, I don't use the multiplayer functions of this game at all, so I write my review from this perspective.Clearly, AW:DoR is the best, most refined AW game to date, and so far, it's the best strategy game I've ever found for the DS.  It definitely deserves a full 5 stars, as I've been glued to it non-stop for about a month.  If you enjoy strategy games at all, pick up this title, you definitely won't be disappointed.And yet I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed.  The two major improvements were to the touch screen control system and to the online capabilities, both taking greater advantage of the DS platform.  Unfortunately, I'm just not that interested in either advancement.  I do not use the touch screen for this game at all, I definitely prefer the direction pad and buttons (though I have to admit, the touch screen option is very well done and fun to use).  I also don't use the wireless options of any DS game.  It's not that the wireless options are bad, just that I prefer single-player games in general as there's no need to coordinate schedules, no delays at all.  The DS in particular is an excellent system to fill dead time during bus or air travel, neither of which work well with other players.  The multiplayer options of this title are actually very tempting (not only can you compete against your buddy in another location, but you can voice chat while doing so!), but multiplayer gaming just doesn't fit well into my busy life these days.As a 1P game, AW:DoR is the best 1P strategy game that I have yet found for the DS.  But it's just not better *in every possible way* than the previous title, Dual Strike.  This is disappointing, and I considered rating the product 4 stars.  But given how well designed it is, and that I've enjoyed 100 hours of gameplay already and look forward to more, I feel it deserves the full 5 stars.The rest of my review is a detailed wish list of ways the 1P experience could be improved, along with some praise for noteworthy improvements over Advanced Wars: Dual Strike.  If you're not interested in those details, my bottom line is that I highly recommend this as the best strategy game available for the DS today.Wishlist for improvements:The campaign is linear, with no optional side quests to explore.  I miss the little secret labs, and the ability to unlock special unit types for later in the campaign!  I wish there were more optional goals, side quests, and perhaps some strategic choice about how the campaign proceeds.The game no longer keeps track of your score for the extra \"free play\" maps, nor do you get medals for solving them, nor do you win points for solving them, nor do you have to win access to unlock them.  In short, the designers basically gutted all the reinforcers that made playing the extra maps fun!  This is my single biggest complaint about the new game.I wish free play maps came pre-configured for different default scenarios (e.g. this one has fog of war, this one has snow, this one uses these COs, etc.).  It's great that the game allows you to tweak all settings for every free play map, but provide interesting and unique defaults for each map so you can more readily compare your experience with others.  (Note that this also undercuts the fun of trying to complete a \"checklist\" of beating all \"free play\" maps, because now every map has identical defaults unless you expressly choose otherwise.)Like other reviewers, I miss the Shop.  Basically, the previous game required you to rack up points by playing the game, which could be spent to unlock various things (maps, CO uniforms, etc.).  Human nature being what it is, having to win these little things is more fun than being given them up front.  In this title, all the free play maps and CO outfits are available immediately, which is slightly disappointing.The one multiplayer / community aspect I'd love is some sort of scoreboard, or score comparisons with your friends.  This would allow me to play at my own pace w/o having to coordinate schedules with others, while still competing on the big board.But even given the above limitations, the 1P game is still better than AW:Dual Strike.  I love the new CO system, whereby the CO is attached to a specific unit.  I prefer having a single CO over having tag team pairs like before.  I like the fact that the units have been streamlined (stealth units weren't that interesting), though I would like the occasional oddball unit in the campaign mode.  I love the fact that units can gain experience -- an excellent gameplay mechanic.  I love the new tutorial screens, as well as the strategic advice screen.  All in all, this game is extremely well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

It looks and sounds great, but ends up as a pretty shallow experience beyond that. I am honestly shocked this game is actually shorter than its predecessor! The gameplay has its moments, and you definitely feel like a beast of a force user. It does have one very cool boss battle. However, it very quickly becomes repetitive...similar environments, enemy types, and nothing but one brawl after another. There are essentially three environments/levels, with two being used twice.  Honestly, TFU II doesn't quite even feel like half a game. The story is woefully inferior to that of the first one, and ends abruptly just as it begins to get slightly interesting. It is a graphical showcase and the rendered cut scenes are amazing, but if you ask me this one is stricly a rental for anyone but the most rabid Star Wars fan.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Not only is the player playing through a storyline, but most of America is decimated from this thing. Buildings have fallen, things have been abandoned, nature is taking over. Because the Infected far outnumber the people, areas are blocked off. Sure, open exploration might have made the game better, but the closed-off feeling makes the player feel trapped.You can barely run away from enemies. They usually outnumber you or they continue to chase you until a certain point. I'm halfway through and I've managed to run away twice. Living through that was luck. Ammo is scarce for a reason. Sure you can fight often, but bullets run out, weapons break (realistic), and sounds alert enemies. You can die from swimming underwater for too long.Post apocalyptic games/movies/TV shows are hugely popular. This is NOT a zombie game.The storyline is great. It's long and for good reason, especially for the two main characters. Control is similar to Tomb Raider Unborn, but TR has more freedom.You can find Parts which can be used to make health kits, shivs, Molotov cocktails, and even a melee upgrade. You can play and fight, sneak, or a combination of both. Straight fighting will get you killed ALOT. You can do sneak kills which strangle/break the neck of whomever you catch. Unfortunately, you can't move the body and hide it; if it's found then enemies know something is up. You can pick up bottles/bricks and throw them to distract enemies.So far a very fun game. Enjoyable. Scary. Gory. Frustrating. Challenging.08/09/2013I retract my review from 08/02. I completed the game early this morning after 5a.m. I enjoyed the game immensely and I will very honest in my opinion. There are many emotional highs and lows and all in between. You can actually feel for the characters in the game. Real people were used in performance capture and voice-overs. Still the story line and all is well done. The end will put your heart in a vice in front of your face. The challenge on normal isn't as easy as your might think. The bad guy will actually call for help if he sees you. I'm not going to ruin it for potential players who haven't started or who are playing. It's well worth it.I am a fan of these types of games: Storyline. Post apocalyptic. Zombie (Fungus in this case). End-of-the-world. Survival.This game delivers on all at maximum levels. No, there are no bosses to fight, no 'levels' to complete. This game was made as realistic as possible. Melee weapons broke after so many hits forcing you to fight with your hands or use louder weapons. And just like any post-apocalyptic world ammo is scarce. Loud noises travel much further than they would today.Playing through this story reduces it's replay value for a game. For a game, that means it will be some time before I pick it up and play it again. There are harder difficulties, but that just changes how much harder the enemies are to kill. What is the reward? Different clothes and backpacks for Ellie and Joel which you have to buy with virtual money. WTH Naughty Dog.I pre-ordered because I did my research and this is the type of game I'm going to keep unless this actually happens. (Kidding)I got some free bonuses anyway, including a few skins for each char and some wallet cash.I haven't played the multiplayer, but I supposedly got some extras, special guns, etc too but I haven't looked in to that.I don't like multiplayer.Too many people spending their lives ruining a game or parts of for others.It's not my decision if someone should buy or rent. If you're a fan of the above genres like I am and plan to keep those games around and not sell them, by all means buy it. If you're lucky you could find a used one. Either way, its a really good game. I'd say top 2 slot in the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Albert N. Carranza","summary":"Best game on PS3 so far that I played","reviewText":"When I first heard about The Last of Us I knew it was one of does games I most play. Especially since its being made by Naughty Dog. If you ever played any of Naughty Dogs games(Uncharted series) you know you expect a lot from them. This games never disappoint from start to finish. From the start the game leaves you emotional and wanting to know more. Just like the game Heavy Rain. The story is character driven about a plague outbreak and which the world has come to an end and survivors most fight to lice on. You play Joel and your mission is to smuggle Ellie across United States. As you go on Joel and Ellie meet new people in which working together to stay alive. At the end of the game you will feel so happy because you just played an awesome game.The Gameplay is like any other uncharted games a third person action adventure game. You have to stealth, shoot and explore new ways to cross your ways to cross infected and enemies. One feature is making weapons and tools from stuff you pick up. finding ways to kill your enemies. With the live inventory makes it more challenging and keep you on your feet.The graphics on this game are great just like uncharted it beautiful to detail. could possibly be the best looking game of this console generation. you wont be disappointed.Overall this game will keep you busy for hours and really in do the game. The online mode is a fun and with Naughty Dog having full support for it. I will recommend this game to everyone with a PS3 or if not anyone who love a good story driven game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Pretty good.....a refreshing spin on a long-running series","reviewText":"I have to admit, I was a little wary of this game after hearing a lot of not-so-positive reviews. I will say that most of the criticism this game has received is pretty on the money. The atmosphere is creepy, but not very scary. The controls are a little uneven in a lot of points (you have to be standing just right to open doors and examine objects). And the story is very straight-forward compared to Silent HIll's 1 & 2 (they're the only one's I've played before this one).Now that that stuff is out of the way, let me tell you why this game is actually worth owning (or at least maybe a weekend rental). The soundtrack is excellent. A lot of reviews, even the one's disfavoring the game are pointing out Akira Yamaoka's musical selection and it's some of the most eerie and rousing I've heard in a video game. It almost seems in-tune to what you have your character doing. The sound effects are perfectly tuned as well, from footsteps, to creaky metal sounds.The story in this game comes across as a bit typical at first (the nightmare intro is VERY slow), you're a war veteran coming home to find your hometown empty of people and your brother and father missing. What I didn't expect was to be swept into the story and I actually wanting to keep playing to find out what happened next.Another big criticism of this game was the fact you are playing a combat heavy character making alot of enemy encounters no where near as scary as they were in the previous titles. This is true. However I personally find this approach a bit refreshing. It took some getting used to, but once I tried out all the combos I actually had fun in fights. Again, not everyone's cup of tea but it's different.The graphics aside from some clipping errors (and the sandy cam filter and lame water animation) are VERY good. You can actually look off in the distance and pick out locations in the game you've been to or are going to. The cemetary's, playgrounds and other outdoor locations really bring you into the world. It's no GTAIV, but you can pratically BREATH the fog and stale air.Anyway, I hope this helps you decide on this purchase of the game. It's not perfect, but it's fun and unique enough that it kept me hooked.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2008"}

I liked the campaign.","reviewText":"Nothing in-depth here, just some comments and observations from one of those rare \"single player campaign only\" freaks, believe it or not there are still some of us who have managed to survive this long.I fell in love with Call of Duty way back when the first one came out for PC, it went hand-in-hand with my Band of Brothers DVD box set. I'd watch BoB, think \"Man, WWII was awesome\" and then play CoD. The expansion packs were great too, as was CoD2. CoD3 was the first time I thought \"Hmmm, this is getting kinda old.\" So naturally that was when they changed things up with CoD4 Modern Warfare, and it was exactly the shot in the arm the franchise needed. I didn't care to go back to WWII, so I skipped CoD World At War. And Modern Warfare 2 didn't do much for me, so with that I decided I was finished with the franchise.Long story short, a friend recently strong-armed me into borrowing his copies of BlackOps and Modern Warfare 3. I really didn't want to take them, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. I sat on them for a while and finally decided to just get it over with and play them so I could honestly tell him I did so and give them back. Surprise surprise, I actually enjoyed them quite a bit. Particularly MW3. It's been fashionable for a very long time now to diss or straight out ignore CoD SP campaigns, and personally I blame the particularly lackluster ones like CoD3 and MW2. But MW3 is quite good. Lots of great set pieces that haven't been done before, e.g. infiltrating a Russian submarine in NY Harbor. A little OO7-ish for what was once a straight-faced WWII game, but I suppose if you're going to shake things up... It's good enough that I've actually decided to buy my own copy. I really thought I'd never buy another CoD. Never say never.Though I must say I did have second thoughts when I noticed they'd done away with Price's trademark mega-handlebar mustache and replaced it with a regular full beard. Bastards... broke my heart.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2012"}

Not much more I can add here as alot of the other reviews have done said what needs to be said.The same eye candy has been reused. The Sounds of war are somewhat muted. Multiplayer maps seem small. And its still the same run and gun since MW2. I myself enjoy the team concept. Not the rambo run and gun.This is just turning into a cash cow. Being sold for the name itself. Alot of these game companies are guilty of this nowadays.Due to Amazon price match $51.99 for release day and the $20 promo credit I got from BF3. I got mine for a price equal to the price of an expansion pack $31.99. If I Paid full price for this I would be disgusted like alot of people are.

But Myst III is nothing new, albeit probably an improvement over Riven...which isn't saying a whole lot. (Riven was too lengthy and cryptic regarding the puzzles to enjoy in my opinion).Exile did a good job of adding to the Myst series, it actually is an enjoyable adventure game.  Don't listen to the pretentious people out there who call themselves &quot;gamers&quot; and steer you away from it if you liked the original. It's just that the awe of Myst has worn off after so many new steps in technologyand newer 3D games that blow it away in terms of it's engineering and multimedia immersion since 1993.But I commend UBI Soft for not putting out a complete piece of garbage just to make some money off of the franchise name, which they could've easily done.

If you never played a Metal Gear game, you might find it quite a challenge, since there isn't much hand-holding from the game itself.

{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Cinematic Masterpiece, with Issues","reviewText":"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is one of the most cinematic games ever made.  However, the linear mission design and inconsistent rule set makes you feel like you are being micromanaged by insane mission designers.High Concept: 10/10Take the Castlevania Franchise and make it a rich cinematic 3D Action game similar to God of War.(Actually, when I first played God of War 1, I thought that they out Castlevania'ed Castlevania, with their bladed whip weapons, horrific enemies, and magic spells.  So, I don't see this as a God of War ripoff.  I just see this as two franchises that evolve together.  Besides, Castlevania has been around since the original Nintendo Entertainment System.)Story: 9/10Gabriel Belmont is avenging his beloved wife after she is slain.  He is on a quest to confront the dark forces responsible.  With the aid of a mysterious creature known as Pan, Gabriel will battle his way through the realm as he tries to find the God Mask, a holy relic that can restore life to the dead.  On his quest, he battles against werewolves, zombies, vampires, spiders, ghouls, necromancers, goblins, titans, trolls, and just about any other evil creature that you can imagine.  The story is beautifully presented in hours of cinematics and beautifully rendered levels.Gameplay: 7/10The game itself feels outdated / very Japanese.  In this day and age, games are all about making the player feel like a hero in an adventure.  Whether it's Assassin's Creed Brotherhood or Call of Duty Black Ops, the player is made to feel like he or she is immersed in an interactive adventure and they are the hero who battles through the challenges to save the day.  Castlevania is a linear adventure, but the adventure takes a back seat to the \"Levels.\"  Players are encouraged to replay past levels to farm XP or to find items that make Gabriel more powerful.  Here's an example.  In Chapter I, there is a chest that you can't get until you finish Chapter XIII and get the double-jump.  Also, Health Power-ups are incredibly rare in the game and the only way to regain health is in combat, by using Light Magic on enemies.  But you will encounter some bosses when you have 10% of your health remaining or no magic and you just can't beat them.  This forces the player to go back to the easiest level, Chapter I - Mission 1, and quickly beat it to replenish their health so they can fight the boss and not die in one hit.  But this also breaks the story.\"Gabriel defeated the Werewolf Lord and battled his way through the spider caverns, but returned to the village and defeated the Werewolf Lord again, then returned to the Spider Caverns, but later ran into trouble when he fought the goblin tribes, so he returned to the village and defeated the Werewolf Lord again in the exact same way... etc...\"It's just better to replenish Gabriel's Health at the beginning of each Chapter if you want the story to flow.  Or at least give him a way to regain health outside of combat.In a highly scripted, very linear, story based game, emphasis on replaying levels over again, clashes with storytelling.  This would be different if it was an open world game and you performed an Assassination Quest on a random target to gain XP.Your upgrades also clash with the storytelling.  In the game, once your combo counter fills up, you gain mana as you hit enemies.  You can also overfill your mana to 200%.  As time passes, your combo counter and mana overflow slowly deplete.  Unfortunately, they deplete during cutscenes.  This was a horrible design decision because it forces the player to choose between enjoying the cinematics and having a powerful character.  The player should NEVER be put in this situation.  A simple timer pause on your gauges during cutscenes would have prevented this.Combat: 9/10The combat is similar to God of War.  It is fluid and feels brutal.  It's also difficult, especially if you just want to button mash.  There are a ton of different types of enemies, that have their unique combat style, making all of the encounters feel exciting / interesting.Gabriel is armed with a Combat Cross / Whip, which is used for navigation and combat.  The Combat Cross can also be infused with Light or Shadow Magic which allows Gabriel to perform special attacks.  The combat system is fairly simple.  Press X for a powerful linear attack, good for inflicting more damage on a single target.  Press Y to perform arcing attacks that do less damage to multiple enemies.  Mix the X's and Y's to perform multi-hit attacks.  Hold down an attack button to hit the enemy harder.  Press A (Jump) during combos to launch an enemy into the air, so you can isolate them and inflict more damage to them.On Defense, Gabriel can block, parry and counter, jump, roll to evade, or dash to dodge enemy attacks.It wouldn't be Castlevania without magic items.  Gabriel is armed with silver throwing daggers, nude fairies that distract enemies, Holy Water for Splash Damage... literally, and a Dark Crystal that does serious damage to all enemies and bosses.  Some enemies are resistant to the special weapons, but this is fairly intuitive.  Holy Water does nothing against werewolves, but a silver dagger to the chest hurts them quite a bit.  The game features a beastiary that tells you how each weapon affects each enemy and boss.The Boss Battles are fun, cinematic, and fairly difficult.  There are fast paced battles against large enemies.  There are Shadow of the Colossus battles that involve 200 foot tall enemies.  All of the Boss Battles feel cinematic and satisfying when you finally beat them.Missions: 6/10Although the levels are beautifully rendered and masterfully storyboarded, many of them aren't fun.  There are enough invisible walls in this game to start a San Diego Mime CON.  So, the levels are beautiful, but you never really feel like you can go where you want to go.  Here's an example:  In Chapter II, you need to get to a lower ledge, so you try to jump down.  Gabriel jumps straight up.  So you start thinking, maybe this isn't the way.  You walk around and explore for a while, eventually returning to the cliff.  You try to jump down 1 step from where you were, and it works.  Gabriel jumps down.  But there are no visual indicators that tell the player where he can or can't jump.  It ends up being really frustrating and confusing.  You end up throwing your hands up into the air and saying, \"Ok Designer Guy, where exactly do you want me to go?!\"Another major problem is the inconsistent rule set.If Gabriel is rappelling down a cliff and the Whip extends to its maximum length, he falls and dies, except when he doesn't.  There is no way to figure the maximum whip length either.If Gabriel needs to grapple onto a hook and swing across the chasm, sometimes he needs to jump, then whip to grapple, or he falls and dies.If Gabriel needs to grapple onto a hook and swing across the chasm, sometimes jumping deactivates the hook and he can't grapple, so he falls and dies.There are also some navigation mechanics that are only used once in the entire game and are never taught to you.  (I'm talking to you (double X, jump, rappel) in the Clocktower.)There are some puzzles, involving switches, riding large enemies, and light beams.  These are just difficult to make you feel clever when you solve them.  If you don't want to deal with puzzles, there is usually a scroll nearby that gives you the solution, but you don't get XP for solving the puzzles.Then there are the balance beams.  Ok, God of War, Dante's Inferno, Wolverine, Castlevania...We don't like these.  They are as epic as hop-scotch and do nothing but stall the pace of the game.Stop adding these in for the sake of adding them in.God of War sold in spite of these.  Have you ever heard of people talking about how cool the balance beam scene was?No!  You haven't!  Because they aren't!Here are some tips for Mission Designers:- If the Player can Fail a Mission within 1 second of starting it, it is a bad mission.- If you need checkpoints every 10 meters with tutorial text explaining what to do, it's a bad mission.- If there is only 1 way to complete the mission and 25 ways to fail it, it's a bad mission.- If the Player doesn't know how they died, it's a bad mission.- If Gabriel can fall 100 feet in a cutscene and survive, this shouldn't kill him in the game.- If the Player has no idea where to go, it's a bad mission.Checkpoints:  4/10Yeah, these get their own section.Most of the Checkpoints are pretty good, but some...  You walk up 100 steps, climb on 8 ledges, traverse 2 balance beams, watch a cinematic, then die fighting a sub boss, the check point should be right before the sub boss or at the nearest power up fountain before the fight.  It should not be 100 steps, 8 ledges, 2 balance beams, and a cinematic away.  That part is not fun and it's not why I died.  I died in the fight.  I should only have to do the fight over.  Thank God the cinematics are skippable.The checkpoints in boss fights are nice, but you should get 1-2 seconds of invulnerability when you spawn.  Too often, have I respawned with 5% of my health right in front of a boss who is already swinging an axe at my head.  Players need about a second to set their bearings and it's not cool to kill them as the screen is still fading in.Graphics: 10+/10At first, I thought the art was mediocre, the rain looked odd, the characters' faces were bland, but the Art Direction and Cinematic Presentation made up for this.  Castlevania Lords of Shadow is one of the best looking games ever made!  The environments, character designs, and creatures are all top notch.  I swear the team hired one of Guillermo Del Toro's guys because parts of this game have a similar style to Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth.  Some of the cutscenes and environments will take your breath away!Sound: 10/10The music is great, even though it doesn't sound like the old school Castlevania music.  It's epic and definitely adds to the atmosphere.  The voice acting is very well done.  The sound effects punctuate the action and really contribute to an epic experience.Note:  There is one modernized Old School Castlevania Track in the game.  If you are a true fan, you'll recognize it when you hear it.Replay Value: 8/10The game is about 20 hours long and for a linear game there is quite a bit of replay value.  There are 4 Difficulty Levels and Challenge Trials for each level.  The Trials might be time based or a condition that makes the level harder.  (Defeat the Boss without using Light Magic.)  Once you get over the initial frustration of the invisible walls, and learn the basics of combat, the game becomes very fun.Maturity:  MThere's violence, gore, horror, and some fantasy nudity.  This is not for kids unless you want them to grow up all creepy.Overall: 8/10Castlevania Lords of Shadow could have been a 10 if there was more consistency in the level designs.  The game is challenging, fun, visually impressive, and it has a good story.Buy it if you want a fun action game and can overlook the invisible wall syndrome.Buy it if you love Castlevania or God of War games!Rent it if you have at least 20 hours.  It's a long game!Avoid it if the navigation problems are a deal breaker for you.Avoid it if you hate linear games.Avoid it if you aren't impressed by hours of cinematics and character design.If you liked this game's linear level design and combat:Bayonetta has a fluid and deep combat system.Ninja Gaiden 2 looks great and has a great combat system.Dante's Inferno doesn't look as good, but it will satisfy your God of War type cravings.Devil May Cry 4 is older, but you can get it super cheap!If you finished all of these, you should still avoid Golden Axe Beast Rider at all costs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2011"}

Every detail right down to the rusted bolt. The water in the game, the best EVER! Finally, the game play is phenominal! Characters, story, plot twists and never tiring gameplay puts this game in my top 10 must haves. You won't go wrong with BioShock.- Dan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2007"}

This is a long game. Basically, you are trying to find a way off a beautiful tropical island infested with zombies. There are four different characters to play as and each has their own speciality. You mosty use melee weapons to slice or bash the brains out of the undead. Later in the game you get access to some firearms and the always enjoyable method of running them over in a vehicle. The main story and sidequests are at least 25 hours of solid zombie killing goodness.The graphics are okay, but not in the league of the top PS3 games. At times there are pop ups and slight glitches in the graphic department, but it doesn't ruin the experience. The voice acting and story are average, but most of the quests are pretty fun. I haven't had a problem saving any games as most people have complained about. From what I read, only people playing multiplayer have been having this saving issue.It's not worth full price, but around $40 sounds about right.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2011"}

It's fun, no doubt about that, but it's almost too familiar.  I feel that they're really capitalizing on the \"Don't fix what ain't broke\" school of thought here.  If they keep making the same game over and over again this is eventually going to become somewhat of a Dragon Warrior 8 where I am just bored to tears by the same gameplay mechanics over and over.WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS GAME:It's fun and you will like it as a Pokemon fan or a new player to the series.WHAT MAY DISAPPOINT FANS OF THE SERIES:Same tinny music that's only increased marginally in quality since the first entries in to the series.Not much of a graphical update since the the gameboy advance.Only small changes and tweaks to the game mechanics.Still only one save spot.WHAT FANS AND NEW PLAYERS ALIKE WILL APPRECIATE:Wifi, if a handheld game ever screamed wifi then pokemon was definitely one of the loudest.  Easily the best addition to the game.Along the lines of the wifi, having the use of a headset is also pretty useful and fun.New pokemon, duh.IN SUMMARY:I really can't knock this game too bad because ultimately it's really fun and it's nice to finally have Pokemon on my DS but I'm a little bitter because I feel they could have done SO much more with this game.  I would rate the game itself probably a 3.5/5 if Amazon would let me but a 5/5 for fun.

Wires intersecting each other, making a mess of things.Enter the Logitech Cordless Action Controller!! This is without a doubt one of the best controllers I've ever used! The controllers is very well made. The feel of it is very natural in your hands, though slightly different than the original PS2 Dual Shock. There's a nice satin like finish that prevents alot of dirt from your hands from making the controller too slippery. There is literally no notciable lag or delay in the controller's operation. The controllers 2.4 ghz signal ensures that you won't miss any of the action. Every function of the original is reproduced faithfully. Installation is extremely simple. Plug the reciever into your PS2's controller port and simpley press the action button to get a signal. There is also a button on the reciever to make the connection if needed. The battery life (the controller takes two AA batterys) is approximatley 300 hours without the vibration mode and 50 hours with the vibration mode on. A small sacrifice to make for a great product such as this.I really can't say enough good things about this product. It's great if you have small children in the house especially. No more worrying if they are going to trip and drag the console across the room. In fact this is such a great controller I'm considering buying a second!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2004"}

{"product_name":"B001COV1CY","reviewerName":"Txiab \"txiabxyooj\"","summary":"MAG Just Feels Wrong","reviewText":"MAG is an interesting idea for a game. The core of the game are the massive boards, and that armies, squads, and units work together in concert to accomplish a larger goal. Also, there are some elements of RPG character development in game (I am level 15 SVER grunt at the time of this review). First, let me start by saying that you can never control other players, and working as a unit in this game is actually difficult due player limitations/inability. There is nothing the developers could do about player skill. Hopefully over time people will start to figure things out. However, the second problem with working as a unit rests squarely on the developers shoulders. Re-spawning tends to separate you from your unit, meaning a long run to get back with the unit only to find that the rest of your unit is dead and waiting to spawn, or in the process of running to catch up with the squad after a spawn. It is really difficult to stay together for a meaningful length of time. The only way to do so is by relying on others to heal you. Given the hectic nature of the battle, field healing can either be great or worthless. Spawning is often obnoxious especially if you are on the attacking team as it means a long wait followed by a long run. This is a small thing, as there are larger game play elements that fall flat on their face. I can't put my finger on it, but MAG reminds me of the bad game play presented by Haze some time ago but with a different gimmick. It almost feels like Zipper spent so much time on the larger game play elements that they forgot to put the same level of attention into the little stuff like firing your gun and how it feels to be in the world. At times it feels like I am gliding through things, and not actually present in the world.Many have focused on the graphics, and they aren't cutting edge to be sure. However, graphics aren't everything, and are only one piece of a larger puzzle. There are some positive elements in the game. Zipper did a good job designing the levels, as they are interesting and well suited to this type of game. I also really like the idea of picking a faction, and the loyalty that this creates. Zipper did a good job giving each faction a unique feel. However, they didn't spend enough time on game play. In many ways this feels like a shooter from 2001, not 2010. The controls are awkward (not being able to toss a grenade on the fly, really?). The guns are uninspired. It is especially embarrassing watching explosions from RPGs and grenades. The game could have been brilliant, but I wonder why it feels so antiquated? There is just something off with the game. I own many games, and usually find that I can switch between them, and with a small learning curve, get right back in the action. MAG just feels wrong. Maybe the problem is that the game just feels too clean? To the point of detaching the player from the game world.On a final note, others have been very concerned with lag. I have experienced some lag, but nothing significant or noteworthy. Although, the other day I did play in a game where after I was killed I became a floating zombie (not the undead, but the un-spawned?). I couldn't shoot, interact with anything, or even kill myself through the start menu. I floated around for a while just exploring the board until the game ended, because I was already dead nobody could kill me again. It was frustrating, although amusing to watch other players shoot at me with no effect. Also, I have only managed to play one game larger game because the server keeps timing out. I don't count this as lag, but it ties back to server speed and connections.There was so much potential for this game, but Zipper missed the mark by just a bit. Hopefully, another developer will pick up on some of the great ideas presented in MAG, and design a game that also plays well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

The visuals are gorgeous, especially if you have a huge TV. The music is an integral part of the game, which adds to the experience.Gameplay:This game is somewhat different than the typical video game offerings we're used to, which is not surprising since Rez and Every Extend Extra (another Mizuguchi game) aren't exactly mainstream either. The plot, in essence, is simple.  The key aspect of the game is the unfinished Project Lumi. Once complete, Project Lumi would generate a human personality in Eden, the same AI world where Rez unfolds. You need to save Project Lumi from a virus attack. Press \"Start\" to begin.While Rez exclusively used the controller, in Child of Eden thanks to Kinect you use your arms, and control the action. You point to aim, lock on to targets (or fire a continuous stream), and clap to change weapons. You can also use the controller to play this game, but it's really designed for Kinect and a huge aspect of gameplay is lost if you don't use your arms to conduct the action. There are only five levels, and the game is somewhat short (as was Rez), but replayability is good since the game is adaptive.Summary:If you liked Rez or Lumines or Every Extend Extra, you will love Child of Eden (you probably bought it just to check out what Tetsuya Mizuguchi was up to). Yes, you destroy things, but surprisingly this is not a violent game. The music is well suited to the visuals, which are  a psychedelic treat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

You can only start a career basically, later you get neighborhood thingy, but right now, im trying to beat the missions. Ok I have noticed some good and bad things.Setting up walls is frustrating, takes a while to master, its the drag feature like in pc, cept feels extremely awkward. Putting on wallpaper is even worst, and you probably can't master it that well ever. Sometimes I think the wallpaper is on this side, then bam it appears that I just wallpapered the OTHER side of the wall? Huh? Ok so it's really poorly done with wallpaper, but on a side note, theres a big selection. The icons are a little small, but you can see the design. Quite a few things to build, not as much as the pc, but still theres alot of objects.Characters can now be customized alot more, making it more fun to create characters. Problem? Probably it would be the thingy. You know, your energy, food, fun, etc. I had my energy and fun down, and because of this, it is extremely hard to play. I got so frustrated when I lost my job in career mode and it was \"game over!\". Whenever I try to raise my fun, my energy goes down like a frenzied pit bull. Then when I try to look for a better job, my character is way too depressed to do that. Then I need to get more social points, so I call someone over, they about 3 hours over and I have only raised social level a little, ok so fun is down, energy is down, im eating, peeing, sleeping, showering, then BAM I gotta go to work, and it just is too much. I wanted to tell my sim, \"Shut up, stop being a baby, do some work, and try to be happy so you get promoted.\" The fact is, in real life you are going to have hard times, and the sims just are babys, they won't do anything unless you constantly are feeding, playing, talking, and letting them pee. I got so frustrated that I started over, this time I got farther, but again, once my stats go down, it was painful to bring them back up.On the good side, it is like the pc in most aspects. You do things like pc, but still that stupid \"needs\" stuff. I like the game, I like cooperative, although the split screen is a little awkward, it is alright. Instead of being seperated through the middle, it is a diagonal slash, which is a little different for most multiplayer games on consoles.Then there is time, the time moves extremely fast, having one minute=one second. This means, whenever I want to go to the bathroom, it takes 20 minutes. Getting into the tub takes 5 minutes, turning on the tv takes 5 minutes. It takes 20 minutes just to walk around. I honestly think there should be a \"slow down idiot\" option, in which the game actually makes a minute equal a few seconds.I still enjoy living though, if you can get past the fact that your sims need constant pampering, and that you have to hold down quite a few buttons sometimes(speeding it up, looking at need bars) you can probably have fun with it. If you have the computer version, you may want to pass this one up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2003"}

I recently sold this game to someone as well.I loved this game, there was a lot you could do, the whole Jordan mode was one of the greatest things this franchise could have done. NBA Live should quit making games because they cannot match 2k in basketball. The Jordan challenge would get a little annoying because it did not really offer the freedom you should be allowed to have.However, your own legend (which I played with Jordan) was one of the most fun things you could have done with a sports franchise. I loved the game and highly recommend it to anyone that likes to play older games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Great graphics, storyline, music and best of all the game play using the Wii control. You fight using your sword while moving the Wiimote. Great puzzles, the storyline is superb. You can do so many thinks like: fighting, fishing, rolling, horseback riding, be a wolf. As a wolf you have new animal \"senses\" you can view trails, traces, even spirits that you can not view as an human, you can dig the ground to find valuable things or to create tunnels to escape.Simply impressing. This is one of the games that gives Nintendo the edge in console playing. Including a solid console that works without problems like the Wii.Every adverturer with the Wii must get this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Works for me","reviewText":"Pros- Good story and voice acting- The visuals are magnificent- I found my self looking outside of Cloud City rather than killing stormtroopers at one point- When you fight a jedi boss the game switches to a wide-angle pulled-back cinematic camera reminiscent of the duel between Dokku, Obiwan and Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. This is one of the best ways I've seen of taking advantage of the HD screen format and resolution. When you Force push your enemy across the room it really does remind you a lot of the movies.- Sound track is good- some new themes and old themes are enhanced.- Even though NPCs appear to have the ability to block your force powers or lightsaber blows, each one of them has a particular weakness you can exploit - so it's not really a problemCons- Locking on to objects is sometimes clumsy- PsiOps did it much better- A few bugs here and there- As compared to say Jedi Outcast / Academy it doesn't have as rich a Force upgrade mechanism- mainly because the story doesn't really lend itself to it- Camera needs to be manually adjusted frequently- Too short- There are some frustrating jumping puzzles - especially with a problematic cameraConsidering I've been waiting since Jedi Academy for another Star Wars game, and the fact that the average budget for a video game is over $40 Million, spending $60 on a decent Star Wars game seems like a bargain to me. I have no complaints.Comparison to the Wii version:- Wii version uses canned Star Wars musical score. Reminds you of playing the old Jedi Power Battles game.- Wii controls are quite well thought out and does make Force wielding fun.- But over time the Wii interaction does tend to get fatiguing.- The visuals between the Wii and PS3 are night and day- including the cutscenes which are rendered using the in-game engine. The Wii's visuals just look really dated/primitive compared to the PS3's. E.g. on the first mission on Kassyk, if you look at what's happening in the background on the PS3, there are stormtroopers on a beach-head in the distance slowly advancing, and shooting and then dying. It's gratuitous but it's beautifully done. None of this made it to the Wii. Of course this is understandable since the Wii is a less capable system.- Wii provides additional game levels not provided in the PS3 game.- The Duel Mode on the Wii can only be played with another player, rather than with an AI- too bad.If you own both the PS3 and Wii, I recommend buying the PS3 version and maybe the Wii version when it goes on sale. TFU is visually the most stunning Star Wars title to-date and missing the opportunity to experience it's full visual splendor would be a shame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2008"}

Convery","summary":"Strategy, vehicles, huge maps!","reviewText":"How is Socom 3 this good?  What has it done better than Socom 2 to still earn such a high score?  I'm only going to discuss the ONLINE portion, aside from saying that I did play the first couple of single-player missions.  I found that quite fun.  Hadn't done that with Socom 2.  Nope, went straight online with that one.  Funny, never even read the Socom 2 instruction book.  Ok.  Back to Socom 3 Online!!It's really the maps and vehicles that make Socom 3 a five star game.  People complain about graphics, but I disagree with that.  More on that later.The maps are huge.  32 player huge.  These are beautiful maps and well crafted with tons of nooks and hiding spots.  I don't find myself looking for anything less than 20 people.  This right here is an achievement.  No other console game has it ( i don't think).  And it runs so smooth.  I'm sure that many haters are in disbelief and/or don't want to believe how good this works... and on the ol' reliable PS2!!  Some arguers may say that 32 players loses the intimacy the 16 player games of Socom 2 had.  Socom 2 is a much different game when you talk about online play.  Smaller maps, no vehicles.  Anyway, larger maps (with multiple spawn points) support teamwork and planning strategy for attack with teammates.  When you're alone in these large environments, separated from your team, hold that M16 tight to appease pangs of solitude and fear.  They will creep your skin.So let's talk about the vehicles.  They're a lot of fun, a great added addition if you want vehicular assault or if you need a quick lift to your favorite sniping point.  But there's another important thing vehicles have done for Socom 3 versus Socom 2.  They've made it fair for people to carry RPGs or M203s without the other team crying \"cheap\".  Hey, if you try and run me over, what's unfair about me shooting your tank rocket launcher?  The playing field is evened in that respect.  Having some Halo experience has helped me avoid getting run over multiple times.Last, I'll talk about the graphics.  They're fine.  People feel the need to complain about something.  Let's face it.  Graphics have come a haul's ass further from what they were ten years ago.  Pretty much all games have damn good/realistic graphics nowadays.  Do some games have better graphics than Socom 3?  Sure.  Somewhat better.  But that begs this question.  Do any other console games have 32 player online?Why rush out to buy a next-gen system when we have this?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2005"}

Buying this on the cheap, I really didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did. I don't particularly care for games that have you level along with everything else too, I like to be overpowered and murder things. But here, it was just fun and exciting to find new things to do. There is barely a plot anywhere in this game, but I'll be damned if it isn't fun to shoot up and loot everything you can set your eyes on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

I simply was not in any way disappointed, the campaign mode and the online mode combine to make an excellent gaming experience.The campaign mode although short, is nothing short of un-eventful. From start to finish the game is non-stop action and intensity, the AI seems to be spot on this year with the enemy recognising your fire and acting accordingly. The story itself is quite an intense and thrilling setting which seems to fit in perfectly with the current feel of todays conflict.The online mode, now theres something to scream about, people will have you believe that peer to peer connections are a bad thing but I simply don't see the problem. Sure there are times when a host would simply end a game and admittedly it would become annoying, when you get into the gameplay however you simply come to forget about the lagging or problems that may appear on the rare occasions. The whole XP points in the gameplay that allow you to unlock extra weapons and perks are an extra initiative to have you enjoy the game further as you continuously play to complete your challenges and reach the next level. This rewards system would have some people complain as it is seen as unfair to the new players of the online game as they have a significant disadvantage. This I have to disagree with, if you're a new player to the game and there are a ton of people who have all the perks and all the best weapons this gives you a better learning curve as you become educated in how the game works and how to defeat those who have better guns than you.This is genuinely an extremely good game and one that should be a part of every PS3 owners game collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Surine \"Stanley\"","summary":"Best racing game in decades!","reviewText":"After playing a disappointing Need for Speed Undercover, I was excited to see that EA was coming out with what appeared to be a new and improved NFS.  The game exceeded my high expectations.One thing that made me extremely happy is the cars.  Often times, you'll notice racing games coming up with fictional cars to avoid paying car companies for the game.  But Hot Pursuit includes all the sports cars that you've dreamed about owning.  Even the cop cars are the newest and fastest vehicles that you've read about in Car and Driver.Hot Pursuit also added new road hazards to stop cars in front or behind you.  With a push of the D-pad, you can deploy a helicopter or set up a road block ahead.  But since you have a limited number, you must be careful about when you use these things.The graphics are impressive, the sound is great, the controls are perfect, the list of great things just goes on and on.My only complaint is that \"Rapid response\" event is an absolute pain.  This is an event where you're supposed to respond to a call within a certain amount of time.  Since you get time taken off whenever you hit the sides of the road, the event becomes more a game of \"don't hit the sides\" than a matter of how fast can you drive.Also, I do miss the open world environment from Undercover since this added strategy to evading the police, but in a way, to make use of spike strips and road blocks, this had to be cut.My few complaints are so minor in comparison to how incredible the rest of the game is.  Pick up this game.  Period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2011"}
