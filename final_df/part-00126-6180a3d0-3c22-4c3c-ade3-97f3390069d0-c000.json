I need to buy books and talk to people to get formulas to gather plants and monster parts from defeated monsters to make super-potions so Geralt can use them  to kick  butt instead of getting his butt kicked? ) gradually became interesting ... the complexity of the game, the depth to it will  either be a turn on or a turn off for you.. I found myself having to resort to walkthroughs for the game on the internet on a semi-periodic basis ... but that very same complexity is what makes the game fun, at least to me, a certain amount of strategy and planning becomes involved - ok which potions should I create to deal with \"X\" situation in the future?  (and make no mistake though the game claims that you can take medium level difficulty and not need the potions - aka alchemy - to survive you WILL need  those potions to survive the more difficult battles) .... I  also liked how it gives you no easy choices.. in most games there's a \"route\" you can follow that pretty much makes all the NPC's happy , one big happy family.. they don't make it that easy for you in Witcher.. sooner or later  you'll be forced into a situation where your actions will endear you to some NPC's and majorly piss off others - and to me that gives it a more realistic, enjoyable  feel .. what was  initially an annoying game for me became fun, even addictive.The price on this game has dropped  since the release of the Witcher 2 (which I will probably grab as a Christmas or birthday present for myself later on ) so you can get a used copy of it for a really good price - unfortunately the amazon bots automatically \"X\" out any dollar amounts typed in here so I can't recommend a maximum amount you would actually spend on it but I'd definite recommend grabbing a used copy , installing it on your PC and , most of all, patience... stick with the game for a while and see if it grows on you or not.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Excellent puzzle designAesthetically and stylistically brilliantAppropriately understated soundCons:Most players will finish it in fewer than 10 hoursBattles are too easy","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"A good little game, but not for the die-hard RPG fans.","reviewText":"To be honest, I am not sure how you would define what genre ICO falls into. It has some RPG elements, but is mainly a puzzle-based action game. But whatever it is, and despite the lack of action, I really enjoyed ICO. Here's why:The pros:1. Puzzles. While some people might consider puzzles to be the worst part of any  game, I think they ae a major strength in ICO. The castle your character is trapped in is huge, with many winding staircases, ladders, traps, and hidden areas. Finding all these is the fun of ICO. To move ahead, you must solve a series of puzzles, ranging is difficulty from very easy, to very hard.Solving all the puzzles is the most fun aspect of ICO.2. Free-roaming. I love the feeling that you can roam free in the castle. Thought the areas are restrictive at first, you have to roam arond and find your way out. The castle is huge, and part of the fun is exploring all the areas.3. Control. ICO is a very easy game to control, which means that you can concerntrate on what you are doing without having to worry about pressing the righ button.4. Graphics. Even people who hated this game acknowledged that the graphics are well above average. The character movement is nice and fluid, and there is minimal popup or bleed through, if any. The details in the castle are excellent, from the shadows cast by the torches, to the cobblestones on the castle floor. Visually, your in for a treat.And now, for the cons:1. Weak storyline. Where ICO differs from your atandard RPG, besides being more action-based, is the minimal attention to story. You are a boy who is trapped in an ancient castle. A young princess is trapped with you. You must rescue her and escape the castle with your lives. That is the story. Somewhat cliches by RPG standards. I deeper story would have helped.2. Length. I found this game to be too short, which might be a turn-off for the gamers lookingto get the greatest value for their dollar. I bought this game used (as I do most video games), so I don't really feel cheated. But I really wanted to keep goingwhen I beat this game.3. Lack of challenging battles. Being a puzzle-based game, the battles and battle strategy are obviously on the back burner. I never got killed once. I think a more complex battle system would have added not only to the fun, but the replay value.ICO is a curious little game. I enjoyed it, though I found it, at times, short and uninvolving. I would recommend it to most people, but not for die-hard RPG fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000KLNLUK","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"I Glaive At The Office","reviewText":"Dark Sector is an amalgamation of many great games, but it still culminates in a unique experience.  There's a little bit of Gears of War, Resident Evil 4, Uncharted, Bioshock, and several others all wrapped up in an eery and exciting game.You play as Hayden Tenno, a black ops agent sent into the fictional country of Lasria to bring down a mad scientist before he can unleash the \"Technocyte\" virus onto the world.  Fortunately for you, you get infected with the virus early on and then benefit from the many abilities it grants you.The infection transforms your right arm into this metallic death dealer that spawns the glaive, a \"Krull-esque\" 3-pronged blade capable of dismemberment, burning enemies alive, electrocuting them, and freezing them.  As the game progresses, Hayden's abilities increase, which involves the ability to form a force field/shield and to detonate the glaive when it approaches a group of enemies.The gameplay works pretty well as a 3rd person, over the shoulder view.  There are times when it takes about 3 or 4 throws of the glaive to kill an enemy (I guess the virus makes monsters glaive-resistant).  Also, some enemies require you to unload a full clip into them to bring them down (humans shouldn't be able to absorb that many bullets).  It can be a little frustrating, but that's not half as frustrating as some of the melee moves.  They are even less effective.  And some of the finishing moves are a bit repetitive.  That being said, Dark Sector still has some of the best graphics in a console game.  The lighting and textures are about as good as Gears of War and Uncharted.  The sound design is top notch.  You are flooded with all these eery sound effects that totally creeps you out.The game is pretty linear, but you never quite know when the monsters will jump out at you, so it keeps you on your toes.  There are 10 chapters in the game, which makes for a medium length story (I'm currently on chapter 7).  Despite a few minor setbacks, I'm thoroughly enjoying this game.  I think if you enjoy survival horror or shooters, you will find Dark Sector eerily pleasing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2008"}

So this is not a \"I love BF, COD sucks\" 5 star review.  This is my HONEST opinion of the game.  Please see my other reviews as I've got no problem whatsoever being critical of a game if it deserves it.I'm a casual shooter player by definition.  I'm more the Borderlands speed.  But I say hey, what the heck, I need a shooter for PS4 and I knew in the BF series you could control tanks, fighter jets and the like, so I went with it.The single player, certainly, is not what people mostly buy these games for, but I have been impressed.  For all the people who have said they lost their single player progress, I have not had this issue.  I make sure to back up my saves both on the cloud and through a USB (The pain of losing a level 60 Skyrim character save will learn you to backup!).  I found it very well constructed with lots of different paths to the goal that you can take.  Is it a little predictable with the set features?  Yes, of course.  But is it fun to play?  Yes, I've enjoyed it throughly.  There are a TON of different guns, and it encourages multiple playthroughs as guns are unlocked based on getting bronze, silver or gold in the various missions.  Unlock the gold=get the best weapons.  Even in my reduced state I've managed to get Gold, which means if you have a girlfriend she can probably do the same if I can do it LOLNow, for multiplayer.  Yes, parts of it are not functioning at optimum levels.  Yes, I would tend to agree a publisher/developer should have a handle on these things.  However, a) it's a brand new platform (PS4), b) situations like this are not uncommon in other console launches and c) EA/DICE have got too much riding on this series to simply ignore it.  They will get it fixed.  That being said, it's not ALL modes.  And in the time I've spent, it's what makes the game.  You're going to have your campers, etc. but there are ways to counteract/take them out if you know what you are doing.  The added benefit of being able to destruct all the environments and force players into new routes (which your team could have covered, making it basically an ambush) adds a great dynamic to the game.BL:  I love my purchase and I'm enjoying a game I thought I would not buy and have no chance to enjoy.

The graphics are great and the game uses all of the DS' features, but there's just not enough reward like there is with WW:Twisted.It's way too easy. There are a couple of minigames where you might be a little challenged, but it only becomes truly difficult when you get into the higher paced levels.The \"souvenirs\" you get are, as previously stated, lame. Plus, there's no good way to keep track of them (did I get them all? Did they just stiff me?) In Twisted the souvenirs are divided into categories, with each filling a slot. Empty slot? Keep playing! Touched just throws them all together. Also, there's something satisfying about getting to use the souvenir dispenser at the end of each level, something Touched doesn't give you.If you're thinking about buying this game, you'd be better advised to go ahead and spend it on Warioware: Twisted.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2006"}

Really, truly, they're crazy cool. Interface is good. The rapid travel system in the game is a big improvement over previous Elder Scroll games. Character customization options are outstanding.There's an immense amount of freedom in the game. You are basically free to follow any number of quest lines at your leisure. At times you definitely get the feeling that you're doing quests for the same of doing quests though. Example: Go to XYZ deep dungeon in a far off land and stealth past the blind order of monks guarding the sacred treasure. Bring it back to me., etc. That's cool once or twice, but I personally feel it's over-used in this particular game.Challenge rating is decent. The game's certainly not a pushover, but it's not impossible either. There's a good play balance there. Voice acting is well above what you would expect.If you're already a fan of the Elder Scroll series definitely pick it up.  If you have a healthy interested in self-guided rpg's that favor live-style combat then you'll probably dig it too. I'd say you could easily get 60-80 hours out of the game before you exhaust all the major quest lines.My only major complaint is the combat system. It's very basic. You hit the button to whack something and hit it again to whack it again. There's some element to blocking and dodging but you can tell those are afterthoughts. I'd like to see a more robust combat system in future installments. But, what they have works decently.Another small issue: When you drop an item in the game it just sort of drops willy-nilly. You can't place items in specific spots very easily. When I finally bought a decent house and wanted to display some of the cooler items I found in the game it was very difficult to do that. I literally spent an hour trying to put stuff in a display case. Like I said, small but frustrating.This really sets the bar pretty high for other RPGs on the 360.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2006"}

Since none of the options are listed up here I shall detail a few here. (all modes collect experience points)OffLine Local PlayerThere are 9 modes here with support for up to 4 players per PS3 system.  All of the perks and even unlockables carried over from online multiplayer can be carried over here.  Essentially this is an experience that all will enjoy.LANLAN support is available too with support for up to 18 players (1 per console)  All modes of online multiplayer are supportedOnlineThe experience reserved for just one player per PS3 system but up to 18 players online.  There are over 14 different games types (with two types set in the third person perspective).  The main thrill of MW2 is this mode and will surely keep people coming back for more. With a release date amount of players exceeding more than 250,000 players online, this mode will never be empty anytime soon.  The addition and expansion of killstreaks (using additional weapons) is a great addition.Special Ops (offline (2 per console), online 2 people), an expansive co-op experience that is separate from that of the single player game.  Estimated time appears to have taken me longer than the 5 or so hour single player mode.  Anyway, without spoiling the story, the game is essentially as great and dramatic as the story mode and gameplay in the single player mode.Single Player:  Features a campaign that appears to continue from the first Modern Warfare though I never played it and the stage has been set up well.  It is a bit hard to follow at times but the action of fighting terrorist who somehow invade the USA and other places around the world is fun and a great extension on reality (fighting also takes place right in northern VA).Mechanics wise, the game features easy to learn  First Person shooter controls with multiple types, there seems to be over 60+ different weapons, some with different modes, area of effect special weapons (like an airstrike missle). AI that seems to still survive after shooting them in the legs and whom will keep firing at you, tons of militia combatants, amazing graphics (bloodsplatter is a nice addition but gets annoying at times when combined with smoke grenades, the area of vision is essentially null.  This game isnt the best looking game on the PS3 but it surely is in the top tier of PS3 and great graphic titles.  Hans Zimmer compositions are perfect for the game and the soundtrack moving/emotional to match the atmosphere, voice actors are on par and not too over the top (McTaverish has an amazing voice actor), the cutscenes during the loading screens are amazing at capturing the mission brief, and some of the flyovers during the game are amazing at showing the scope of the devastation of modern warfare.Needless to say, if you have friends and/or looking for a game to keep you hooked to multiplayer then this is it.

This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options.

Yes I get little sleep because of this game.Initially I played the Campaign Mode to get used to the weaponry and aiming.  Previously I played FPS games only on PC but I got used to it after a few hours.  Like many other people said, campaign mode was rather short yet I found it satisfying.  I don't understand people complaining about the story because this is no Drakes Fortune, you just need basic storyline to get through the game.  There are bad guys and there are good guys, you have some twists towards the end of the game and a great ending sequance, that my friends I think is enough for a game like this.Then there is the Multiplayer Mode, wow.  I must confess, before this game I have only played Burnout online for couple of sessions and I decided I wasn't into online gaming.  Not more than a month ago, a real close friend of mine convinced me to buy and play this game online with him.  Not only it was a FPS but also playing online, I resisted a lot of course.  After a few hours of online gametime, I was unlocking stuff like crazy, never satisfying with what I got, I had to get more, I needed the Thermal scope, the Heart sensor, Akimbo, not in that particular order.  Next thing I know the sun was shining, hitting my eye through the curtains, saying that I stayed up all night playing the game.  I played one more game to unlock Commando Pro and went to work.Playing against real people is so much better than single player mode.  You don't look for a story, you live it.  Every kill, every death is a story in itself, that we tell each other with my friend.  I got into MW2 world late a bit but I enjoy it very much and can't recommend it enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"You were either apart of it, or you found out after someone told you!","reviewText":"I remember when this game first came out. Everyone was thick on \"Resident Evil\" it's all anyone ever talked about. I remember seeing a Silent hill add in game magazine I picked up. It peaked my interest at the time. Survival horror games were just starting thier popularity. I went down to my local \"Funcoland\"(yeah that long ago! remember them?) and picked up a copy. No one knew what Silent hill was about and at that time good luck finding something about it on the internet. All I had to go on where my whims and what the back of the case told about the game.That my friends is exactly how this game was meant to be played. Your not supposed to know what's going on. Your supposed to have it slowly revealed to you as you play the game. It was first love as soon as I put the game in the original ps1 and was greated by an amazing opening screen with an unbelievable and memorable tune. I will never forget it. Even with out pressing start I was already pumped up to play the game.Silent Hill as you already know is the foundation for the series. Staring Harry Mason a man who will go to any lengths to fins his daughter as she is the only family he has left. You really have to play this game to get a sense of just how well developed the story is. This is something that could easily have been a movie (and not that sorry POS Silent Hill movie they made). As you play the game you get a real sense of desperation of a father that cares for his daughter and will go to any length to get her back. Even if it means traveling through Hell itself AKA the town of Silent Hill.The gameplay of Silent Hill is similar to Resident Evil. Pretty much the same controls and but with harder puzzles. It also includes a sense of realism that eludes itself from the typical health bar and ammo screen. Playing Silent Hill 1 you feel more like a detective unraveling a mystery. Your on the edge of your seat the entire way and you just want to know whats going to happen next because you honestly can never predict what's going to happen in this town.The game is more a phsycological thriller and that's one thing resident evil never real had. RE brought the gore and zombies. You know what you were fighting and that it was man made (I.E. a virus). In Silent Hill it's all supernatural and occult related. Even to this day 11 years later this game still haunts me when I think about how scary it was.If your into horror games and don't mind not staring at the \"latest\" of graphics than pick up this old classic. Silent Hill was the one that broke the mold for what a survival horror should be. It combined mystery,action,adventure,suspense,drama, and a story you would never forget. If you played the later Silent Hill games and enjoyed them (specifically 2 or 3) then pick up the original because you will not be dissapointed!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Michael Anthony \"Hybridblues\"","summary":"Disgrace to the original","reviewText":"I remembered playing Shinobi (the original arcade version) when I was a kid and it was the first game I ever beat.

Kirby's never been so fast and so fun!","reviewerName":"Suzanne Amara","summary":"Our most played game ever---Addictive in the extreme!","reviewText":"I am not sure just what it is that this game has, but it's got it!  It didn't get great reviews, but it looked fun to me, and I bought it for my kids---well, it's been played far more than any of the other (too many) video games we have!There are 3 basic modes---a standard racing mode, a overhead view racing mode and City Mode, which takes more explaining!  The standard mode uses Kirbys riding on different vehicles, going VERY fast on different kinds of courses.  Kirby can eat enemies and take their powers for a while.  You can race each other, or the computer.  All you really do is steer and slow down in order to power up for a boost.  It's very simple to control Kirby, and you get a great feeling of being half out of control while still in control!The overhead mode is kind of retro looking.  You race a little Kirby around and around a small track (there are several different ones).  The track looks like those little car tracks from the 70s.  There are bonus items you can eat up as you race, some boost you, some hurt others.The City Mode is what we play the most.  It's WEIRD but fun!  It's a city full of odd things---a section of trees, a section of run down buildings, a waterwheel, a castle, a subway, lots of underground areas---all sort of minimalistically portrayed!  The real goal is to break open all kinds of boxes and get power up items, like better turning or better speed.  In the standard mode, you have 5 minutes to do this.  You can find different vehicles lying around, and ride them instead of your starting one.  Then, after the 5 minutes, you compete in a random pick of one of 20 or so stadium events---a  long jump, a race, a melee match, etc.  It's fun as you might have collected items for a race, which do you no good in what you are actually doing, so all have a chance!The most fun of this game is trying to finish the grids with records!  There are a huge 128 boxes to fill in for EACH mode!  Some are things like getting a certain score, but others are out there, like finishing with your time all a certain number on the seconds!  We haven't filled all the boxes in any of the modes yet!  But we have had fun trying---it's so neat to see after you finish a section if any of the little boxes get filled in!  We are simple people, I guess---we enjoy that a lot!If I had any complaint about the game, I guess I wish there were more unlockable tracks or modes---I love that, although I don't know why---I guess it gives you something to aim for!All in all, a super game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2005"}

As a big fan of Bioware and Bethesda games, I expect a solid amount of gameplay for my money, and the DLC just wasn't delivering.But here my fears were unfounded. A solid 20 hours of fun later, I wrapped up Awakening having enjoyed a full-fledged and very enjoyable Bioware experience. An experience that can change next time around thanks to story choices that impact the game, adding even more bang for your buck.That's not bad at all for a $40 expansion.Adding to my fun was importing my character from Origins and watching as he climbed to godlike levels of power, with equipment that would make the archdemon weep with fear. Awesome.If you're already a fan of Dragon Age or Bioware you know the gist of how their games work. RPG, moral choices, yada yada yada. So let's just cut to the chase and throw out some pros and cons:CONS:The beginning and ending are both a bit abrupt; you're plunged right in with a too-brief intro, and the game ends two seconds after the final battle.You don't see enough of former allies (the one cameo is from my least favorite character). After spending 60 hours with them, I'd like to have seen them again.A few bugs made at least one quest impossible for me to finish.Some \"new\" monsters are just old monsters with new colors. Didn't palette-swapping die in the 16-bit era?The elf chick was a total dud of a character.PROS:Some great new characters; Anders is a new favorite, and the new dwarf rocks.Solid story that adds a lot to the world's mythology. Door is wide open to sequels, yet this story here feels self-contained, too.Cool new creatures keep things varied.Abrupt into and finish aside, it honestly felt like a complete Bioware game, with the traditional multiple paths, ups and downs and twist and turns to the story, many side quests, and an epic finish.LOADS and LOADS of new talents and spells and skills and more. LOADS of them, allowing you to specialize your characters like never before.Those books that let you reset all your stats and skills? Awesome. Big help when you realize you've gone down an undesirable character path.Decisions that actually seem to MATTER to the story.At 20 hours, more gameplay than I expected out of an expansion. And I left several side quests unfinished, too. I probably could have squeezed a few more hours out of it.More side quests than I expected out of an expansion, too.OVERALL:This was great fun. The couple of bugs and such were minor irritants, but easily overlooked in the face of the Dragon Age goodness to be had here. For anyone who liked Dragon Age, this is essential.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2010"}

On the one hand, it's a fun RTS that attempts to capture the spirit and grandeur of Peter Jackson's groundbreaking cinematic epic. Unfortunately, it compromises in too many areas and is overshadowed by other superior RTS offerings - Warhammer 40k and Rome: Total War being the two main examples.Despite EA's attempts to market the 'world map' as a groundbreaking innovation, hardcore gamers will immediately recognise the similarities to the Campaign Map used in Rome: Total War. The big difference is that B4ME's world map severely restricts which mission the player can choose next. For instance, at the beginning you can only play as Rohan (in which case you choose from 2-3 maps) or as the Fellowship (choose a single mission based on a movie scenario).Another criticism I have is with movie-based missions, which don't adhere to the film-based events. For instance, in the Mines of Moria it's possible for Gandalf the Grey to survive the battle with the Balrog. All that would've been needed is a cutscene showing Gandalf and the Balrog falling off the Bridge of Kazadhum - problem solved, and gameplay wouldn't be compromised. Better use should've been made of the game engine during cutscenes - there are several good examples of this in Warhammer 40k.The game really soars in regards to how individual units are implemented. One good example is Gandalf, whose powers are exactly what you would expect from the greatest of the Istari. The Wizard Blast can take out an entire battalion, and you can eliminate half an army with Mithrandir's Electric Bolt. And his finishing moves are perfect replications of what you see in the film. Aragorn's swordmaster abilities are another understimated ability, which is graphically demonstrated during the 'Amon Hen' level, where you can use it to take out two whole hordes of Uruk Hai. Impressive.Another innovation which should've gotten more publicity is how buildings are built. Instead of using peasants to build, certain areas of the map are allocated for base building (outposts, castles, etc...). This is makes base building less irritating as you no longer have to decide where buildings need to be placed, and leaves the player more time to concentrate on strategies and troop building.In summary, B4ME is almost a classic. But compromises in areas like the world map and single-player campaign spoil the atmosphere of the game. If you're an LOTR or Tolkien fanatic, stay clear of this game. If you're an RTS fan not too fussy with gameplay, then by all means, plop down your hard earned money and have a go. However, I do wonder how B4ME would've turned out if Relic or Blizzard had developed it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2004"}

There are so many first person shooter games in the world being played (multiplayer) and i have to say I was once addicted to modern warfare...well now things have changed.positives: The game is very addictive, and fun, its fun to help out teammates, i think thats something valve has accomplished is the expectation of living is keeping your teammates alive. Other fps games like call of duty modern warfare, you really dont care that much how another person is doing or what their health status is because the game itself doesnt give you those details. In other fps games you are on your own and if you decide to help out a teammate that is up to you. In left 4 dead, it is manditory that you work as a team in order to win, and I think thats what makes a great multiplayer game successful is the good gameplay mixed with teamwork.negatives: The campaign is a mixture of \"sigh\" and \"meh\" because the campaign is so repetitive, there is no actual storyline and the game doesnt really take you from beginning to start, you can kind of decide what levels you want to begin and end.The graphics are not the greatest or best, but that shouldnt be an issue because in the end gameplay dominates graphics. The zombies or \"infected\" they call them are not really that scary or intimidating. This is a plus for me because I dont want to be totally scared when im playing a game. I do however think that the cartoonyness of the zombies is unique. I think if valve had gone f.e.a.r, silent hill or DOOM on gamers, people would be frightfully scared to play the game. That is just a personal preference though as I have played games like f.e.a.r., silent hill series and have never gone back!I figure people have so much crap in their life why add more? Another thing is the bots. The bots are really boring to play with, they are in a way lifeless, but I have to give credit to valve on trying because i know it is not always easy to create a.i.Overall left 4 dead is a great multiplayer game. The game has 4 options. Survival. Versus.Co-op.Single player.The majority of the time you spend with this game will probably be versus or survival. I was skeptical at first because i always look at the graphics in a game, which is not important, and turned out to be that left 4 dead could end up being the greatest multiplayer game this year.(thats counting out gears of war,call of duty, halo, etc).

Great gameplay, great graphcis, and solid multiplayer.I'd like to give this 3 and a half stars if I could because despite all that has been said about this game, there are some major flaws which cause the game to suffer and not live up to its full potential on the PC.That said, let me outline the pros of this game#1 NO DRM- Yes, this was released before the DRM craze, but its a solid game on the market that people still play, and a great alternative to Crysis Warhead and Farcry 2 which contain the spawn of evil#2 Very little hacking. I'm impressed by the ability of activision to keep hacking to a minimal. People DO go into the console to give themselves a an edge, but I will outline that later.#3 Balanced. Its hard to find a game these days that one gun or one class or one side has a blatantly obvious advantage over everyone else. CoD4 really impressed me with its ability to do this.#4 Supports 1900x1200- Wide screen fanatics like myself (28 inch monitor here) will rejoyce.#5 Runs well with recommended specs. So many games look very choppy with recommended specs these days. The CoD4 is well coded, providing beautiful graphics with minimal strain on the CPU (ROCKSTAR TAKE NOTE!)Now for the cons, which will ultimately get this review flagged by fanboys and result in massive flamming.My computer well exceeds the requried specs ( two 9800 GTXs running in SLI, core 2 duo 3 ghz with 6 megabyte cache, two gigs of ddr3 ram. This was top of the line when the game came out), and yet the game crashes often. Most of the time it happens when minimizing the window or joining a server. This is obviously a major flaw and should have been patched by now. However, this is not the case.The other major issue is customization. I am not talking about the incredibly well done class customization, but rather the mechanic customization which had been a major problem for the Half Life engine and counterstrike. If you play the game in default manufactor setting, changing only the video settings, you are at a huge disadvantage from other players. People use the console to give them more accurate latency and overall more efficient gameplay. Activision should have set up the game to be more efficient naturally, and older more experienced players now have a huge edge over those who do not know how to safely alter their settings.If it were not for these two major issues, I would have rated the game 4 stars. Solid weapon balancing and all the class skills provide room for expanded tactics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2009"}

Also like FARCRY 2, the storyline is secondary, taking a back seat to action and destruction.\"Money\" is collected in the form of salvage (scrap metal) and here I am reminded of RATCHET AND CLANK and how \"money\" was collected in that game.Having played the full game, I feel that the demo is a pretty good representation of the whole. However the full game has a LOT more weapons, vehicles and missions.Where RFG is weak is in the story department. There are a few cut-scenes at the beginning and a few towards the end. Very little character and plot development although there is one revelation later in the game.The best parts for me dealt with the Marauders--a third faction that reminds me of a mix between the Reavers of FIREFLY and the Sandpeople in STAR WARS.There are a few \"major\" characters and lots of allies, but I really wasn't invested in them as all the dialogue between them and you is pre-scripted. If you like FALLOUT or MASS EFFECT-style dialogue trees, you won't find them here.After a while the gameplay does get a bit repetitive but thankfully there are only a few mandatory missions per sector.The optional missions have more variety, where you race vehicles back to safe houses, rescue hostages, destroy $X million dollars worth of damage by blowing stuff up while riding in a vehicle, defend positions, raid positions, attack convoys and race against time to destroy buildings.The six sectors each have a slightly different look to them but by the time you're done decimating each sector they all look the same: A sandy wasteland that's about as depressing as Iraq. By encouraging such wide-spread destruction one is also destroying the very thing that gives each of these areas character.I was very disappointed to discover that there are no flying vehicles you can take command of.The destruction is unparalleled and the physics would make Isaac Newton proud. The genius of this is that it's virtually impossible to get stuck in this game. Caught in a corner? Just hack your way out!I did see a few glitches: Pieces of leveled buildings that just float and structures that return to their full form and shape even though you decimated them a few missions ago.I would rent this game first and if the novelty of blowing things up five different ways hasn't worn off yet then I'd strongly consider buying it.One thing's for sure: We're all going to be spoiled when it comes to destruction in other games--and for that RFG gets a thumbs up for raising the bar.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2009"}

Bungie basically released an expansion pack but tried to dress it up like a major game.  I suppose the big bonus with ODST is you get all the multiplayer maps, so if you're big into MP this might seem like a good deal.  Personally, I prefer good stories, graphics, and gameplay.  ODST really isn't that different from Halo 3 in terms of look and feel.  For $60?  I just don't know.  To be clear, I love Halo.  I have all the Halo games and strategy guides.  I even have a Master Chief action figure.  But if I want to battle wave upon wave of Covenant troops I can do that with Halo 1, 2, and 3.To be fair, ODST runs well.  The graphics are good (not stellar) and the framerate is steady and smooth.  The gun play is the same as in the previous Halo FPS's (except you can't dual wield).  Not sure what I was expecting, but (dare I say) this game feels a bit stale.  If you are a die hard Halo nut, pick up ODST.  If you are looking for an innovative shooter, look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2009"}

The level design is solid, and the music is very relaxing and well-done. The game allows two players to play co-op together, which is fun for the most part.My only gripe is that some levels are very challenging for the younger player due to the intricate timing required to make certain jumps, which can sometimes lead to frustration. Also a point worth noting here is that while you can start a level with one player, then have the second player join later on, once you start a level with two players, you cannot drop out one player in the middle; you must finish them together.Overall this game is good, clean family fun as long as you are prepared for some tough levels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2012"}

There are secret agencies, blah blah. The plot is complex and this is the first splinter cell game I've played so I have no idea what's going on.The gameplay is interesting to say the least. It is a lot, like I said in the title, like the metal gear games. In-fact, it's a better metal gear game than the last metal gear game which was terrible. There's nots of sneaking around, climbing up pipes, under stuff and around stuff.One nice feature is that flashbacks are shown in the game world for a really neat effect. It's like there's a projector projecting a video of the flashback on the environment itself. Very nice.This game is meant for the bloodthirsty. Sam Fisher is a brutal and merciless killer much like all 15 year old males are when they realize that the girl that they've been fantasizing about really doesn't care about them but instead is going for the football player dude who is bigger and stronger than they ever will be and whose father is connected. That is when you realize that dating is about money and power.So, uh, Sam Fisher is mad. And so you get interactive sequences where he tortures and murders people. I'm up to the point where he beats up a woman, but I'm stuck because I keep on getting detected and then a bunch of enemies come at me.Speaking of enemies, they're not very smart. Sam is wearing these like brown leather shoes with like two inch soles and some how he can like creep by guys from inches away just so long as their back is turned. I can't do that with bare feet. Also, when they detect Sam, they tend to run at him by the nearest possible route: ie through the door where 5 other of their comrades have already died. And it's kind of funny when I go on sabotage missions and then end up having to slaughter dozens of people at the base because I'm terrible at stealth, and then plant a little pack of C4 on a helicopter so that when the enemy flies the bird up, ignoring the dozens of corpses littered around the base, he'll get blown up when I activate the c4.Oh, and the dude moves like a monkey. In-fact, he's better than a monkey. Like, monkeys are good at climbing trees and vines and stuff, but Sam Fisher is better. He's quicker, more silent, and he never ever gets tired even when hanging upside down on a pipe or hanging on a window ledge. For Sam Fisher, climbing up a tree is like a walk to the mailbox.ON to a few technical issues, this game has some weird controls. Like, you hold a trigger to stay in cover. You hold another trigger to shoot. However, you cannot hold both triggers to shoot. You have to let go of the left trigger. Then he'll get up and shoot.And his aim will be like 3 feet to the left. So if you're behind cover, what you need to do is let go of the cover trigger and then aim. Then Sam will stand up and shoot the guy where you aimed.It is very weird and I am not sure if they did it on purpose or not. It makes shooting less smooth, which I\"m okay with since I try to stealth the entire way.Lastly, this game on the PC has terrible controls. THey're terrible because they do not work. I had to edit some .ini file to get the buttons on the controller to work like they should. And there's no remapping buttons so the only way to get a controller working on the pc is to hack some .ini file.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

Herring \"Daemon\"","summary":"Blizzard Failed","reviewText":"You probably already know by my rating that I am not impressed by this game. Maybe I should qualify this with a \"yet.\" I think they are trying to fix things, but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can't give this game a good rating. I have been plagued with problem after problem.I have two copies of this game. My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another. It was very sweet. Well, I also have two computers that can play this game. One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac. Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me. The only problem is... well, we couldn't play the game together. Why, you might ask? Well, I could install it on my Mac just fine. There was no problem other than the considerable lag. I had to drop the video settings of course, but there was just constant lag.No, I couldn't play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC. It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out. You know, uninstall, reinstall, re-download the client. Run as admin. Run in XP mode. Nothing worked. No I had to manually kill the agent.exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it. That made it work. None of the other stuff like updating my system, disabling my anti-virus, running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work. So, Blizzard, you failed big on this one. 3 days without being able to play.What was my next problem? Oh, the constant lag is a constant problem. Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn't fix anything. Checking my channels to find the best reception didn't help. It still lags.The first few days the servers were constantly down. The auction house IS constantly down. The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance. They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much. This doesn't feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game. This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year.Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff. Seems odd, but didn't surprise me too much as he isn't too big on passwords. I knew that. Oh, but a few days later my account gets hacked. Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked. Then another friend was hacked. Does this really sound that common to you? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily? No this was a Blizzard problem. Did they help me out? Sure.. in a way. Let me tell you how they helped me out. First, it took 24 hours to even respond. Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a \"rollback\" was. How insulting to my intelligence. Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours. They didn't offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way. I was out millions of gold in items, 150,000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back, a day lost on a character that I was working on, and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it's all taken care of now. Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly. I basically lost 3-4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised. I made some suggestions for their security, but I am sure it fell on deaf ears. They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100% impossible to hack. Bullcrap. I'm not even saying it was impossible to hack me before, but it shouldn't have been easy.The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways. There are still tons of problems. They are firm on not letting people go \"free world\" in the game like Diablo 2. You have to select a quest and go from there. It's tedious. The farming is tedious. The game is tedious. There is no more rushing really. The leveling is boring.I'll be honest. I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there. I wanted similar characters and play styles. They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious.They were even so arrogant as to point out that \"there is no cow level\" on loading screens. Oh, you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn't in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing? Oh, let me shake your hand. Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious (noticing a pattern here) to get into. I haven't even gone into it yet, because I don't feel like trying to farm the 5-6 different pieces required and the 100,000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn.So far the only words that can describe this game are \"epic fail.\" Epic fail Blizzard.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2012"}

Both are logitech.  Although I thoroughly enjoye the first one, this one is even better.  I can't believe the quality of this wheel.  It has a real leather feel over the wheel as well as steel pedals.  The weight and feel of this wheel is really well built and well put together.  I played Gran Turismo 5 Prologue to test it out and man what an experience.The wheel itself feels hefty and strong along with vibration control as well.  So, when you crash you feel the vibrations.  Another cool thing is that the weel itself has control buttons behind and to the sides of the wheel as well as on the wheel itself.  The front of the wheel looks just like the hood of a car.  Very cool.  The whole thing clamps onto a table so that you don't have to worry about it falling off of your lap if you are on the couch.The stick shift is amazing as well.  With control buttons to allow you to change the menu items and options of the game without relying on a controller or keyboard.  The stick shift has the leather boot on it as well and really looks and feels realistic.  Like the wheel, it clamps onto a table surface so it is secured.The pedals are very nice.  Made from real metal, the pedal and the base are hefty.  They sit well on the floor and you have the option of using the rubber skids for traction on smooth floors, or it has these tiny teeth to grip the carpet and it's going nowhere.  There are 3 pedals; Gas, Brake Clutch (for using the gear shift).  What a great product.I love this unit and highly recommend it.

Having played the entire COD series and KZ series, it's really hard to rate Homefront anything higher than a 3 out of 5 because it doesn't do anything special to make it stand out. The environment reminded me of a mix between COD and Half-Life 2; parts of it are tense, chilling, but other parts slightly bland and uninteresting. Overall the plot was really not thought out as well as I had hoped, but the concept at its core is intriguing for sure.Having only played multiplayer for an hour or so, I think it definitely has potential. The battle point system is unique and helps to motivate you to do well and rewards you for playing hard within the current game. I can definitely see long-term value out of mp mode if you were to dedicate some time to it. In the company of KZ3, COD, and upcoming Crysis 2, it may be hard to stay with this one for an extended period of time.All in all, I would give this game a 75 out of 100.

There are notable exceptions of course (BALDUR's GATE II and MAX PAYNE II spring to mind). However, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers: NEVER had I been so DISAPPOINTED with a sequel more than DUNGEON SIEGE II!Following the innovative and brilliant original DS, the anticipation was so great that minor flaws would be forgiven. With DS2, though, it was one big blunder after another.Contrary to the original DS (for which one had to physically tear himself from the computer screen) this one is a boring chore. Running back and forth to the base camp to barter equipment is a tedious procedure with all the fun sucked out of it. Moreover, no matter how much you improve your character (either leveling up or equipment-wise), your enemies simply match your abilities (or resort to crowding) resulting in NO CHANGE in the gameplay. I am not talking new enemies, but aren't higher leveled characters supposed to easily wipe out enemies encountered many hours before? This way, the whole game is nothing but a even-leveled blandness.On a similar note: why was it necessary for **minor** enemies to have so much life? I was bored out of my skin hacking and slashing FOREVER! Increase the damage they can cause and keep it interesting - do not give them a longer life only to artificially increase the game's duration!Oh, and the enchanting system was a joke - since the items found were much better than anything one could pay to have forged.Graphically, DS2 is not even one step higher than the original DS. Shadows and particles may have increased, but characters (and equipment) have not. As a result, the heat of the battle (even on high-end systems) will find you in the midst of a disorienting...blur.This was the chronicle of a botched job foretold. With the exception of OBLIVION (which was an excellent game), one can count on 2K GAMES to...ruin any game franchise and kill its successful progress once and for all. Gaming history is littered with the relics of their failures: STRONGHOLD II, CIVILIZATION 4 (not until its second expansion did this one become a playable game), SID MEIER's RAILROADS - the list is endless...They should probably stick to consoles.My advice: avoid this stinker and, instead, try the originalDungeon Siege(and its expansion).

I thought the game would be shorter or sloppier because they need the extra budget/time to work on multiplayer that previous Assassin's Creeds don't have. No, the game is as fun as Assassin's Creed2. I feel like playing the same game as Assassin's Creed 2 so don't expect something revolutionary. Control is still a little inaccurate which makes the game frustrating when trying to complete the time limited challenges. Other than that, it works quite well. Side mission feels less repetitive this time. Companion system is almost invisible. I'd say only the single player already worth the buck.Multiplayer wasn't bad either. It requires some patient.However, Ubisoft's server never save my data... I have tons of other multiplayer games. This is the first one that have this issue. I also heard that some can't even log in... Anyway, I'm on Xbox360. I can match making and play with others. I can level up and edit skills. But if I quit the game and come back, everything disappears. I've tried a few times. Trouble shoot with Ubisoft.

Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"A Bloody Little Romp!","reviewText":"Condemned 2 has a similiar format to the first one, but there is nothing wrong with taking a good game and improving upon it.  I had some fun with this title even though the gameplay was repetitive.  You have a first person shooter with close combat weapons and a limited number of projectile weapons.  Just about everything in the game can be used as a weapon and some items deal more damage vs speed and reach.  Combos are not too difficult to pull off with a little well timed practice.  Its a brutal game, enemies will be cursing you while you pummel them with a pipe then finish them off by smashing their head into an old TV.  Its a dark and somewhat eerie game and the flashlight looks fantastic when shining down those dark corridors.  There are alot of those moments where you see a quick flash of someone running around in the dark only to jump out and bust your chin with a 2 by 4, good stuff.  There is also an investigation mode that allows you to study a crime scene and figure out the most probable cause of death which i found to be quite enjoyable and i wish there would have been more crimes scenes to investigate.  I wasn't really wowed by the storyline, but the close combat gameplay is what this title is about.  There isn't too much replay value here, one play through will probably do it for you.  It would be a fantastic rental though, but its only 15 bucks so you wouldn't really be out that much cash for a solid game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2009"}

Take on Co-op and Multiplayer action with your friends and sow the seeds of victory!","reviewerName":"C. Ramos","summary":"Fresh, Fun and Addictive!","reviewText":"(Just so you know, this is an online-only game. Meaning you NEED a reliable internet connection and an Xbox Live Gold account to play it. It says so on the box, but some people failed to see it and were very upset when they couldn't play the game. You've been warned! Moving on...)In a world filled with so called &#34;hardcore&#34; shooters this game feels like a breath of fresh air! The style is lighthearted and comical, but don't let that fool you, there's a lot of depth in it for the more serious gamers. The graphics are quite beautiful on Xbox One with a bright color pallet and an impressive attention to detail. Gameplay is smooth and solid with all the action feeling instantly familiar to anyone who's ever played Halo or one of the many other popular shooters on the market. It's got 2 main modes; Garden Ops and Multiplayer.[Garden Ops]Garden Ops is a horde style survival mode where you fight wave after wave of zombies as a team of up to 4 players controlling various plant types. The goal is to protect your garden from the invading zombies while trying to keep your team alive as well. It's a simple premise, but there are additional elements to mix things up a bit. You can place &#34;dummy&#34; plants in pots located in various locations around the map to aid in the protection of your garden and give you some reinforcement in a firefight. There are also &#34;Boss&#34; rounds which randomly select more difficult opponents to throw at your team.[Multiplayer]Multiplayer in PvZ:GW consists of somewhat standard modes, with the exception of &#34;Welcome Mat&#34; mode. There's &#34;Team Vanquish&#34; which is a standard deathmatch mode where the first team to score 50 KOs wins. Then there's &#34;Gardens and Graveyards&#34; where you have to capture an enemies base in an allotted amount of time before moving to the next round. Both of these modes are also playable in a classic format where the players are stripped of their unlocked items in favor of a more balanced game. Then of course there's &#34;Welcome Mat&#34; which is essentially &#34;Classic Team Vanquish&#34; with an added health bonus given to players who get KO'd. This makes it much easier on less experienced players because they get a bit of an advantage against the enemy team if they're repeatedly dying in battle.[Stickers]In all game modes you earn coins for many different actions. You spend these coins on &#34;Sticker Packs&#34; which are randomly generated assortments of dummy plants to use in Garden Ops, weapon upgrades, character upgrades, custom apparel and character pieces (collect 5 and you earn a new unique playable character). All these stickers come with a value rating ranging from &#34;common&#34; to &#34;very rare&#34;. There is an enormous amount of unlockables in-game, so expect to put in a lot of game time if you want to unlock everything. The Sticker Packs also vary in price with the more expensive packs more likely containing items of greater value.[Characters]There are 4 different classes on each side. A soldier type class (Peashooter/Foot Soldier Zombie). A medic type class (Sunflower/Scientist Zombie). An engineer type class (Cactus/Construction Worker Zombie). And a specialty class (Chomper/All-Star Zombie). Each has unique abilities and strengths. You'll have to experiment with them to find a play style that suits you. I'd recommend trying each class at least once, you might find one you like even if you initially weren't interested. There are plenty of ways to customize your characters as well so don't be afraid to get creative![Extras (Split-Screen, DLC)]There are is an exclusive split-screen mode on Xbox One for 2 players, but it's VERY limited. You can only play Garden Ops and only offline. There is an option for a 3rd player using Xbox Smartglass or Kinect, but that too is limited. The reason it's exclusive and not too fleshed out is that the developers added it in late into the development of the game. It's also limited to 2 players because it runs on a very complicated game engine which has never been used for split-screen before. It's a nice bonus still.As an added value there's FREE DLC out now for the game which adds more maps and a new mode called &#34;Gnome Bomb&#34;. Normally you'd have to pay around $10 for an addition like this, so it's a nice gesture from the devs to do this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0029MAXS6","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"Great System, No Problems With Heat For Me","reviewText":"I decided to purchase an Xbox 360 after doing more research on the RRoD issue that plagued earlier consoles.  I learned that Microsoft has been gradually attempting to completely solve the problem by changing the size of the CPU and GPU with each new remodel they released.  The company also began to shrink the power supply voltage in attempts to decrease the overall heat output of the console.  So, after learning all of this I went out and purchased an Xbox 360 Arcade.  I made sure to look for all of the indicators that point to having the newest chipset, codenamed \"Jasper\".  After purchasing it, and taking it home, I saw the 150w power supply that went along perfectly with the numbers on the back of the console to verify that I had indeed got a Jasper.  After playing the console for several hours, and then pressing my hand against the vents that dissipate the hot internal air, I actually discovered that this newer model actually remains cooler than even my 60GB PlayStation 3 does.  A shocking discovery for me.The Xbox 360 features a unique interface for interacting with the console and navigating through its various fields available, such as \"music\" and other settings.  This interface is known as the Xbox 360 Dashboard, and it works marvelously.  The Dashboard provides the user with various choices such as \"Profiles\", \"Music\", and other settings that allow the player to manipulate the console.  By plugging in external devices, such as a flash drive or an external harddrive, the console is capable of streaming media, and can even play songs off these devices while in the middle of gameplay.  To access the Dashboard, simply press the centrally located \"Xbox\" button on the controller.  This brings up the menu in which a player can navigate through.The controller is also well designed.  With a nice rounded shape to it, my hands can easily, and firmly, grasp the controller.  The shoulder buttons are the perfect distance away from my fingers, allowing for a more natural positioning of my fingers over the buttons when needed.  The analog sticks have a great feel, keeping enough grip to avoid unnecessary finger slipping in the midst of gaming sessions.  The only major problem with the controller is the horrible design of the D-Pad.  The directional pad is designed to be a singular button with all the directions connected in the form of a circle.  This design is the exact same one utilized by Sega for the Genesis.  This makes gaming difficult at times since hitting a mid-direction, such as down-forward (or as I call them, the diagonal directions) usually results in the wrong input.  This doesn't hurt the experience enough to stop the player from using the d-pad though, but it is an annoyance that Microsoft overlooked during the design phase.The Arcade edition lacks a harddrive needed to download Xbox Live Games, or to play emulated Xbox Original titles that may have been missed.  However, these can be found for quite a low price these days, and can be added later on when one has the desire to play old Xbox games such as Halo: Combat Evolved.  The included memory is plenty for saving games, and it has enough to even upgrade to \"The New Xbox Experience\" and still have enough storage free to save additional game saves as well.The Xbox 360 is a great choice for anyone looking for the most diverse selection of games in this current generation of gaming consoles.  From RPGS (Star Ocean, Lost Odyssey, Mass Effect etc.), Shooters (Gears of War, Halo, Left 4 Dead, etc.), Sports, Action (Prince of Persia, Tomb Raider, Ninja Blade), Fighting (BlazBlue, Street Fighter IV), to anything in between, the Xbox 360 has a large enough library to satisfy any genre taste that one may have.Having owned my Xbox 360 for a while now, I can truly say I have missed out on a lot by not picking one up sooner.  Now I use my Xbox 360 on a daily basis, and the large selection of games that I still wish to purchase continues to grow.  My PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 both get an equal amount of playing time, and sometimes it's hard to decide which one to play since they are both excellent consoles with their own great lineups of exclusives.  I'd recommend the 360 to anyone looking for a next generation console since it has the widest variety of games out of the three currently on the market.  My only complaint about the console is the d-pad on the controller.  The d-pad is designed exactly like the one used on the Sega Genesis.  It features all four directions connected as one solid button, whereas other consoles usually have each direction of the d-pad separated from the rest of the directions.  This is a minor inconvenience and can be overlooked since the games are still 100% playable with the d-pad, I just wish it was designed different.  I've been loving the hours of playtime I've received from this console, I just wish I had purchased an Xbox 360 earlier is all!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0001XMA6I","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Star Wars meets Battlefield 1942","reviewText":"Want to pilot your own Landspeeder or AT-AT or blast away from your very own Tie-Fighter or X-Wing?  Want to fight dozens of enemy troops, defending your command post, or go on the offensive with Jedis like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Mace Windu?  No problem. Lucasarts has developed a respectable conversion of what made Battlefield 1942 so popular and put you into the Star Wars universe.Like BF1942, controls are simplistic.  The left mouse fires and the right uses a secondary weapon, usually a grenade.  You choose from four or five different fighter classes.  These range from standard infantry with a rifle and pistol, a missile launcher carrier, a sniper, a pilot class with weak weapons but the ability to fix machines and turrets, and a class of fighter with special weapons specific to whatever map you're playing.  Your fighter starts out at one of the command points you control and you progress to take out the enemy by taking out the fighters controlling an area.  As you linger in an enemy zone, the enemy command center changes from red to white, meaning they can no longer spawn fighters there, to green meaning you have successfully taken over the center and can now spawn your fighters.  Once all enemy command centers have been taken over, you win.Single player mode gives you a feel for the different maps, but is pretty easy to conquer.  Maps are diverse and what you would expect to see, including Tatooine, Hoth, Naboo, and Endor.  Although galactic conquest gives you a few 30 second video clips as you progress from place to place, there's really no storyline.  The main reason to buy this is for online play as you'll get bored with single player mode after a night or two.Online play is the chaotic mess you expect with all the good and bad that comes with it.  You can have up to 32 players online and those with broadband should find surprisingly stable gameplay assuming you're playing on a good server.  System requirements are pretty lax as well.  Even on a mid range system you can crank the resolution up to 1600x1200 if your video card can handle it.  The familiar Star Wars score blasts from the speakers and the sound effects from the blasters and the various vehicles remain faithful to the films.While these types of games are fun to jump into to kill an hour or two, it can get old after a while.  Basically you jump into a map, kill a few, get killed, rinse and repeat.  In Star Wars Battlefront, the heavy equipment tends to be a little too powerful.  If you're on the ground with an with an enemy vehicle staring at you, you're done.  In addition, Jedi warriors, if allowed, are practically invincible.  There is (unfortunately) a lot of incentive to camp somewhere with a sniper rifle and/or man a turret and blast everything that comes your way as in both cases you'll usually last longer.  My last gripe is with the controls on the X-Wings and Tie-Fighters which will take a lot of practice to get used to.  This is the skill item of the game and those who master these will be able to dish out a lot of damage against inexperienced players.Still, it's a fun game if you're a Star Wars fan.  Shooting through the forests of Endor on a Speeder Bike is nice and taking down an AT-AT with a harpoon cable is a difficult, but rewarding thrill.  It's certainly nothing revolutionary, but fans of the genre will find a lot to like.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2004"}

Longer words grants more points.  There are some extra details like burning tiles and building books from sets of words, but really making words this way is the core of the game.  The basic game isn't timed, and I think the best feature with that is that it lends itself so well to being played in short spurts when you might have a minute or two to kill.  You can sit down in your doctor's waiting room, skip the boring out of date magazines (that have been handled by other sick people and aren't very sanitary anyway!) and instead find a few words for however long you have and then tuck it away when your time is up with no concerns that it might be hard to remember where you were in the game later.I think that whether you enjoy playing it for very long is probably just a temperament issue.  Some people enjoy playing games like this or Bejeweled or similar things for weeks or months or years.  Other people are bored within 5 minutes.  If you've enjoyed this style of game (simple rules with many possible configurations for massive re-playability) in the past, then this is a good implementation and you'll enjoy it.  If the repetitiveness of that type of game bores you to tears, then you'll have the same results with this and you should really look elsewhere.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2010"}

Those were the last games written by him. The games may have not been as polished and good looking as they are today with the capabilities of the PS3 but the story truly carried them.The Yakuza series has steadily gone down the predictive path and the storylines are borderline ridiculous these days. Yakuza 3 was not bad but Sega cut some important adult oriented content from the American release. They put said-content back into Yakuza 4 but the storyline once again suffered.A lackluster attempt at a Resevoir Dogs type team-up of four Yakuza muddled with boring and cheesy dialog did not help matters. By the end you really didn't feel for any of the characters like you would in the other games. Yakuza 4 had some moments where I was interested in developments but by the end of the game I skipped a few scenes and truly could not care less of the ending when I watched it. Could it be that 4 characters muddled the games story? Too many main protagonists?Maybe I'm burnt out but I don't think so. I think the writing has turned really bad but the gameplay thankfully is still there.

The series, the characters and the story itself really drew me in in my teen years.  However, I'll be the first to admit I felt no real interest - at first - to play Reach, simply because I felt the trilogy had, in fact, ended quite a matter of factly awhile ago circa Halo 3.  Maybe it's the preconceived notion that any additional titles in a trilogy after said trilogy has been concluded usually come off as second tier to the real thing.  But the fact I knew Halo Reach would be the last game by the original series designers, and the amazing \"Remember Reach\" trailer released before the game, set my heart fluttering with the prospects that Reach could quite possibly be an amazing game.  Sadly, I was left disappointed as I had feared I would be.  Maybe it's because I fell hard for the God of War series on Playstation shortly after Halo 3 and, most recently, literally lived for the epic awesomeness that is God of War 3.  Maybe because I expected Reach to actually contain a story that would make players genuinely feel remorse and sadness over the ending.  Maybe because I expected the soundtrack itself to be much like that in \"Remember Reach\", which, sadly and confusingly, is not even part of the soundtrack.  Maybe because the Halo series just feels \"old\" now.  Perhaps all of these are relevant, but I believe the real reason Halo Reach disappoints on some levels (despite being a beautiful looking game with classic Halo gameplay) is it feels too much like a knock-off rather than a send-off.  I understand this is completely my opinion, but I'm a huge Halo fan and so I think some of what I have to say about the title has merit; for me, and for some other reviewers and critics, Halo Reach (for all its strengths) just quite didn't live up to the hype - simple as that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006W41W82","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"was great at first, but vibrating issue after 11 months (see updates)","reviewText":"A couple of months ago I reviewed theSennheiser X320 Xbox Headsetand came away very pleased with them, once thing I loved about these was that it didn't need batteries to operate as it got power from the XBOX 360 console itself.  I had the opportunity to get these Turtle Beaches with similar features, but unlike the Sennheiser these are wireless.  Even though they are wireless they still do not require batteries because the wireless transmitter itself connects to your console to get power.The first things that drew me to this headphones was the fact that these are fully compatible with both my XBOX 360 and PS3 console.  With it being PS3 compatible that means it uses Bluetooth as well and Turtle beach took advantage of this Bluetooth feature to make it compatible with your Bluetooth phone, meaning that you can receive and answer calls while you are playing the game.  When you receive a call, the headsets automatically mute your in game chat and allow you to answer and talk to the person on the other in through your headphones while still playing the game.  This is a very cool feature because it's very frustrating being in the middle of an intense game having to stop to answer a call.Another cool feature of these is that there is an AUX in jack on the wireless transmitter that allows you to connect your IPOD, phone, or other music device and pipe music into your headphones while you play.Sound quality may be slightly better than the Sennheiser's but I noticed in NBA 2K12, that the announcer volume was quite muffled and drowned out by the crowd noise.  No problem, I just pressed the sound field button and it switched to a different sound mode, and then I could hear the announcers clearly.  This is a great feature because some games seemed to be mixed differently than others and the sound field button helps you get the best sound available for the game you are playing.  There is also an Tone button as well that allows you to switch between different combinations of treble and bass.  It should be noted that I didn't have the same sound issue with the Sennheiser so I am not sure why I did with the Turtle beaches before changing the sound field.  I think the basic sound produced by these headphones is good especially, but if you want true surround sound, then you have to shell out another 70 or 80 bucks to purchase an adapter.  To me, it's not that serious and I only use these headphones late at night when everyone is trying to sleep or when I don't want to be distracted by outside noises.In game chat works well with both the PS3 and XBOX 360 and the fact that the PS3 uses Bluetooth and the XBOX 360 does not is not a problem, instead of creating a brand new interface to work with the XBOX 360, Turtle beach just made the Bluetooth compatible with the XBOX 360 by using an included wireless chat adapter that plugs into the bottom of the XBOX 360 controller and connects via Bluetooth to the head phones themselves.  Pairing was a bit of a pain because sometimes it doesn't always work, but when it does it sounds great.  If you don't want to use the wireless connector, then you can use a wired adapter instead. (sold separately, of course)When fully charged, your headset provides up to 15 hours of gameplay before needing a recharge, but if you run out of a charge, not to worry, you can connect the included extra-long USB cable to the headphones and then to your console or any other USB enabled device and play while you charge.  Keep in mind you don't have to have the headphones connected to your console while charging, in fact I was using these headphones on my XBOX 360 while charging them via the PS3.These headsets are quite comfortable much like the Sennheiser's are, and considering how much time a person will spend wearing them during marathon gaming sessions they SHOULD be comfortable, and where the Sennheiser's  succeed, so do the turtle beaches.  The button placement and volume controls on the headphones do however take a lot to get used to, there are two volume controls for the game sound and in game chat, but there are also other buttons for Bluetooth pairing, power button, chat level, mute button and a couple of others, until you get used to the button placement you will more than likely finding yourself taking off the headphones because you can't remember where everything is.  One area in which I prefer the Sennheiser over these is that to mute your all you have to do is rotate the microphone up over your head; with these you have to physically press the mute button.  However the mic arm itself on the Turtle Beaches is flexible and can be moved around in virtually any position you want, with the Sennheiser, the mic arm is rigid, and may be prone to breakage if you are not careful.While I am impressed overall with the sound quality and extra features there are a few complaints I have that prevent me from giving these headphones a perfect score.First, while I had no issues when playing the PS3, I would notice that the XBOX 360 controller would sometimes randomly disconnect from the XBOX console itself causing the \"Please reconnect controller\" message to appear on the screen.  Every time this happened I seemed to remember the controller reconnecting itself automatically, but even still, if you are playing a game that requires split second thinking, then these random disconnects will almost certainly mess you up.  I am guessing this may have something to do with the controller trying to work with the Bluetooth transmitter, but I am not 100% sure.  It's only happened a couple of times, and hasn't happened since. (crossing fingers)Secondly, on both the XBOX360 and PS3 the game sound occasionally gets lagged and garbled and sounds absolutely terrible.  This more than likely could be caused by interference with my other wireless devices in my home.  Which is another reason why I prefer wired whenever feasible.Finally, when using the in game chat, you can slightly hear your own voice echo while talking to others, the Sennheiser didn't do this, and neither did the standard XBOX 360 mic or PS3 Bluetooth microphones.  It gets rather annoying, and I haven't figured out any way how to turn that \"feature\" off.  To add to this, even with Mute on,  I can still hear outside sounds coming through the mic even though people in the game cannot.Speaking of Mute, Turtle Beach decided it would be a good idea to \"notify\" you with an ear piercing beep every few minutes or so, when you have Mute turned on.  This is a good example of them trying to do too much.  I KNOW Mute is on, I don't need to be notified with this constant beep.  I hate my answering machine for the same reason, the constant beeps are extremely irritating and to me are almost akin to the sound of someone clipping their nails.I also need to mention that in addition to the mute notification, I have also noticed other occasional out of the blue annoying beeps and tones that sound even when I have everything hooked up correctly and my battery is sufficiently charged and I haven't figured out what was causing these sounds.  On quite a few occasions, there also seems to be a persistent buzzing sound that is audible especially when the game volume is down and I have yet to figure out what causes it and and it comes and goes.  Recently it became real loud; even noticeable during game play, and I finally went to the transmitter, unplugged the line jack and reattached it.  I also moved the transmitter away from my consoles and that seemed to resolve the issue.  In any case, with my Sennheiser's, the only sounds that come from them are from the game itself and other players and that is the way I prefer; just do what you are designed to do and do it well.All in all a great set of headphones that work well and produce great sound on both the XBOX360 and PS3, but expected issues with wireless rear their ugly head possibly during the most crucial times of your games.  The voice echo and the occasional buzzing that comes from the headphones can get very annoying.  The button layout on the headphones themselves will not be very user friendly when you first use them.  Finally, the random R2D2 beeps can also get irritating if you are super sensitive to certain sounds like I am.While I like these, they are definitely not a 5 star product in my opinion.  They do produce great quality sound and when they are not buzzing constantly, I am quite pleased with them despite the other flaws.  I went back and forth between three and four stars for this product but decided to bump it up to a four because perhaps I figured out how to resolve the buzzing issue. Even still, I haven't used my Sennheiser's since I got these, but may switch back to them from time to time when the beeping, echoes and especially the buzzing become unbearable for me and I need a break.UPDATE 01/09/2013Over the past month or so, I noticed an annoying buzzing coming from the right headphone.  At first I thought it was due to interference of some sort or a result of the 3.5 mm stereo cable having a short in it, but I replaced that cable, and I still experienced the buzzing.  I later discovered it wasn't electrical, but a mechanical problem from within the headphone as if something has came loose and is vibrating.  I discovered if I squeeze the right ear piece while the music is playing the buzzing stops.  So in order to make this permanent, I just folded up some electrical tape and put it between the ear piece and the bracket that holds it.  (see picture for what I am talking about).UPDATE #2 11/04/2013The buzzing issue has become unbearable, even with the tape fix I described earlier this year, it still occurs.  As a result, I no longer use these headphones and have gone back to using my Sennheisers's exclusively.  These headphones lasted for a little over a year, and of course right after the warranty expired.  Dealing with products that only last for the warranty period is frustrating and as a result I am forced to bump my rating down to 3 stars instead of four.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

The only \"true scare\" would be the \"flashbacks\" that Torque has through out the game, which, i can understand because it catches you off guard.The good thing about this game, is that you have at least enough ammo and guns and medicine to live, which is good, because some games dont offer that. The game has cool graphics and not to sloppy controls at times. However, this game does have very poor camera angles that makes it hard to hit your target at times. It has good gameplay, a nice odd story line and its bloody (which now kids today are going for). However, it is refreshing that there are no \"zombies\" which is true, but, the game with no \"scare\" cannot be in the same section as say Resident Evil or Silent Hill.The creatures to where somewhat lame. For example, here are my veiws on the creatures:1. Horace- sometimes helpful..but only towards the middle of the game2. Hermes - Very cool villian3. Dr. Killjoy- \"Killjoy\"?..what a stupid name for a villian4. Inferna- Very cool creature, but can be a pain in the butt to kill5. Fester- Lame creature, it looks like they \"rip it off\" from another game6. Burrower- Another lame creature, but, tough to kill at times.7. Nooseman- Very, very lame creature..why didnt they just call it \"Spiderman\"?8. Mainliner- Very hard and very fustrating creature to kill.9. Marksman- Very cool creature and are very easy to kill.10. Slayer- Very lame, very boring, easy kills.11. Torque- Why does he look like Wolverine???Anyways those are my veiws on the game.

I was so unimpressed, in fact, that for the last year or so I've ignored it and been playing Civ IV. There were a lot of things I didn't like about 5, like the lack of religion and espionage, the no-unit-stacking policy, the limited number of civs, the strangeness of the naval units and, frankly, I didn't get why everyone went so mad over the idea of the hex grid. I always found it rather annoying.Thankfully while the hex grids and no stacking remain, this expansion adds in more civilizations, more city-states (for them as likes those), more naval units, espionage and religion! And boy, let me tell you about the religion options. They are astounding. First off, you get to adopt a pantheon fairly early in the game, which adds some minor bonuses. But then, once you have a great prophet, you can found an actual religion. There's all the ones from IV, plus ones like Zoroastrianism and Sikhism, as well as Tengriism, which sent me to Wikipedia, since I'd never heard of it before (though my guess on what it might have been was correct. Hooray!).The diplomacy options have also expanded significantly. Now you can establish embassies in other countries, which gives you the location of their capitol and allows for other diplomatic niceties. You can also, if you are playing the Austrians, buy city-states, which is remarkably useful. There's also a large number of scenarios, including a steampunk one that I look forward to playing.Now like I said, not all the \"problems\" I have with the game are fixed. But that said, I find that I enjoy the game much, much more with these features added and it might, finally, be time for me to retire from Civ IV.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}

Wiles Parker","summary":"Entertaining and Nice to Look at","reviewText":"Even though I'm not close to finishing the game yet, I do feel I've played it enough to give a decent review.  The gameplay is  a bit repetitive.  You have to keep going back to the same areas over and over to complete side missions.  It's a first person shooter mostly so you're basically just trying to take down the bad guys in different ways, but you have a variety of ways including melee attacks, guns, and something called the wingstick which is a lot like a boomarang in a way.  So you work your way through and then you get to drive around places and there's some side-stuff to do with that including races and trying to destroy bandit cars.  It's all more or less standard fare these days, so nothing super original except maybe that you get access to all the weapons pretty early in the game which is a nice addition instead of having to wade through hours and hours just to get the best weapons.  Certain enemies definitely need different strategies, so that part is nicely thought out.The graphics are quite pretty.  Very nice to look at until you realize you've been zooming around past the same stuff over and over.  Controls are standard shooter far, so adapting is fairly easy.  I do like the number of stuff you can pick up which includes \"junk\" that sellable for when you need to restock ammo.  And you will need to restock ammo often, for your vehicle included.  As for the story, I'm not really sure where it's going, but it seems almost secondary at times; more like a way of getting from start to finish.  You have a lot of free roam ability and can decided when to do certain missions.  To some degree it is a bit straightforward in the do this so you can do that part and if you don't clear your enemies well enough from time to time you get a little stuck.  Some of the layouts are confusing, which is my one major point of contention.  Why no map when you're on foot?  And finally there's the load times which are mildly annoying, particularly if you're redoing races.  The game grinds to a halt while it reloads everything for you to start again.So, all said and done, there's not a lot that's totally original, though they did spend a lot of time making the game look good.  Plenty of opportunities for fun even in campaign mode.  Overall, I actually really like this game even if I feel like I'm going to be playing it forever just to complete.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"PSP rocks!","reviewText":"Playstation introduced the playstation portable in late 2004 a model that does so much at the time,has so many features and is totaly awesome.Playstation made its first portable game system ever and yet its brilliant.PSP uses advantage of sony to be at the same time a video game system that uses the same graphics as ps2,a movie player and an mp3 so you get the 3 in one that is economic insted of buying a ps2,a dvd player and an mp3 so maybe the price is high but look at what you have for it!Its like they took a sony t.v to make this.PSP can play some tiny discs smaller than the game cube that are movies and the number is growing.I played my cousin`s psp and he had the movies;i robot,spiderman1-2 and some others thats a pretty impressive option and you see like a real movie.The mp3 option is real cool especialy for those who are shopping for one its  bigger but it does it.But you cant just buy it for the mp3 player cmon!PSP has the best graphics for a portable system as it has the ps2 visuals that proves how technology has advance and is definetly a better buy than the ps2.Some comparisons are made with nintendo ds,but psp clearly has it better in graphics,playability,and features.but the ds has a double screen wich is cool and there is pyctochat that is great too but if you want to have the best buy psp!DS is also good but psp is better!I think that the psp is a great buy for what it does and its nice that you can have a portable system,dvd player,mp3 all in one i may be repeating myself but the psp is a great buy if you want to make yourself a favor than you should buy this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Halo Rules","reviewText":"Clearly I'm not the first to jump on the bandwagon, but it IS true - &quot;Halo&quot; is a fantastic game, and is easily the best first-person shooter on ANY console system. For that matter, it's one of the best games on a console system, period, and is the current absolute must-own for Xboxers. Point of fact, it's nearly worth getting an Xbox for this game alone.The single-player campaign warrants the price tag all by itself thanks to its blistering action, wonderful scripting, and interesting storyline (which features a splendid twist that alters the entire tone of the game). But what truly gives &quot;Halo&quot; such a long shelf life is its multiplay. If there's a better way to lose track of time than multiplayer &quot;Halo,&quot; I certainly don't know of one. Killing your friends (or getting killed by your friends) is fantastic fun, and, what's more, you can tweak the gameplay options to your heart's content. To add some icing to this already delicious cake, you can go through the entire single-player campaign with a friend alongside. This cooperative mode is something more games should offer.Despite what you may have heard, &quot;Halo&quot; is not perfect, though. The campaign likes to recycle its settings, and sometimes makes you feel as if you're just going in circles (even though you're not).  The level design certainly could have used some work, and should be given extra attention in the upcoming sequel.In the end, though, &quot;Halo&quot; lives up to all that hype (which is a hard thing to do). Every console shooter from here on has some high standards to live up to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Robin Solsj Hglund","summary":"449 people can't be wrong..","reviewText":"Quite simply (one of) the best (single player) Xbox360 game(s) out there. It's also doubtlessly the best Batman-experience you're ever likely to have (except perhaps watching your favourite movies or shows, or reading some classic comic books). Playing it, I was overwhelmed with how diverse yet balanced the game was - the story (which is solid as a rock for Batman-fans and non-fans alike) leads you through adventure, action, boss fights, puzzle solving, riddles, challenges and exploration - all of it without losing touch or pace. You unlock many diverse and interesting bonuses, including mini-challenges with their own parameters and character related trivia plus beautifully rendered statuettes. Design-wise, the game has its own flair which is very much grounded in the world of Gotham; Batman is muscular yet quick, The Joker is a lanky, hilarious and uproarious Clown Prince of Crime, Killer Croc is actually scary (play the game with surround sound in a dark environment and you'll know my dread), and Poison Ivy is a stylish and glowing temptress. The voice work is as good as it could ever get, and you're in for many surprises if you think you know how it will all play out. Around every corner is something new and different.Are there any flaws to it? Well, if you've made it through the game's story three times (one for every achievement, as it were), and you've unlocked all the many goodies, you might just be stuck with some of the harder parts of Challenge-mode, which are unproportionately difficult in comparison to most of the game. There is no multiplayer to speak of (your buddy can't join in as Robin, Nightwing or Batgirl), and being as gripping as it is, you're likely to engulf most of what the game has to offer pretty quickly. But to satisfy your urges, you could always go for that last achievement, hunt the top spot in the Leaderboards or get some DLC. This game's really such an experience that it should tide us over for the inevitable sequel, which I hope is even bigger in scope (imagine an entire Gotham City full of missions, bonus games and unlockables!) and just maybe might have a co-op or multiplayer mode of some sort.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"mike","summary":"Definately game of the year for 2004","reviewText":"Let me just get the bad parts out of the way first.  Yes, the game is too short again.  On normal mode you can beat it within 10-15 hours so I recommend starting on Heroic for those of you who are familiar with Halo: Combat Evolved.  Yes, the ending does suck and leaves you hanging, but as everyone should know almost all game endings suck.  Yes, there are graphical popups during the cut scenes though doesn't subtract from the experience.I've had this game since the hottest day of the year (Nov 9 of course) so hear are the pluses.  The graphics are awesome.  You owe it to yourself to pick up an HDTV set.  Everything is smooth, hardly any jagged edges are visible.  Animation is superb.  The sound is superior even to the first Halo which is saying a lot.  This game definately has the best soundtrack on any video game.  Martin O' Donnell nailed another one.  The music is real emotional and really gets you into the action.  The story is pretty much the same situation as in the first.  Another Halo ring is discovered and the Covenent want to use it for absolute power.  A bigger cast of characters has been added as well such as the Covenent brutes, prophets, Capt. Keyes' daughter and more.  More vehicles and weapons have been added.  You can now drive the Covenent Wraith which is pretty cool.  The new alien weapons are fun to use.  Now the shotgun has a matcher on the Covenent side.  Can you say \"energy sword\"?  The sword is absolutely cheap but fun.  The Covenent Carbine is excellent in close quarters and medium range as well.  The beam rifle is probably better than the human sniper rifle because it holds 20 shots right off the bat and if you shoot slow enough you never have to reload it.  One last thing...the gameplay is non-stop action to the end.  Now...on to the multiplayer.I just reached level 13 on team slayer and it takes a huge amount of skill to gain levels.  It is good to know a lot of people online because if you join team slayer optimatch by yourself you could be stuck with some real crappy teammates.  There are some extremely cheap players online who like to talk an unbelievable ammount of trash when they kill someone with an energy sword or vehicle.  All I have to say to them is try killing me you coward POS.  Lag is normally not an issue because most games only allow a maximum of 8 players.  The only 2 game types that are available to 16 players are Big Team Battle and Major Clan match.  Those 2 types can create tremendous lag at times and they are both ranked types so it can p*ss you off at times when you die from lag.  Bungie needs to hurry up and make more maps because the included ones are getting old.  Also, when playing team slayer it seems like there are 3 or 4 maps that are played too much - Ivory Tower, Midship, Ascension and Burial Mounds.  The maps that are too few selected in optimatch are Foundation, Lockout and Zanzibar.  I don't know 1 person that likes Midship and it is almost selected the most.  Whoever gets the sword in Midship practically wins so it really is gay.Well, all said and done Halo 2 is the cream of the crop FPS online experience.  If you have an XBOX, a tv and a highspeed internet connection then you must own Halo 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2005"}

Plus the Spin Dash is back.","reviewerName":"Moni R. \"Moni R.\"","summary":"Misunderstood Game","reviewText":"This game does have some flaws but I'm still giving it 5 stars overall because it is a great new direction for the sonic franchise in my opinion. I also feel that this game is highly misunderstood by the game reviews and players alike. If you play this game treating it like a whole new game with new controls its excellent but if you play this expecting a fast paced sonic game you might be disappointed.Yes sonic is slowed down in this game, yes the controls take a little getting used to(sonic has a kick/homing attack/spin dash/climbing), yes some cheap deaths can be expected, yes some parts are difficult and might frustrate you, and yes the boss battles could have been better. STILL this is a great game and I had a great time playing it.I might be in the minority but I felt that the slowing down of sonic just made him that much more precise. Sonic controls wonderfully in this game once you've got all the moves down. He isn't all that slow either, if you want to speed run through the levels you just need to master the spin dash and double jump to blaze your way through if you really wanted to(check some youtube videos of players who are good at speed runs).Sonic has some new moves as well like the ability climb up trees and wall run across walls, it takes some practice but soon enough you'll run across walls collecting rings and climbing up walls to different areas. I really enjoyed all of sonic's moves and felt the controls were spot on.I really enjoyed many of the levels as well and even though some parts in some levels were difficult I surprisingly enjoyed the challenge, others may get frustrated but it depends on the player. There are some cheap deaths throughout the game but nothing that's unavoidable. The boss fights could have been better but I still enjoyed some of them since they had some cool concepts involved even though they were easy. The color powers are okay but nothing special though I did like the drill and a few others.I basically played this game like a platformer, I took my time in some levels and blazed through others depending on the level design. I really liked this game and with the update that gives you a life for every 100 rings and more lives when you get a game over, it is even more enjoyable. I played the game after this update maybe that's why I did not mind the difficult parts. Also the yoshi island dlc is free and was quite cool.I can recommend this game to platforming fans and sonic fans if they treat this game like a new one which it actually is. I liked this new direction for sonic but I understand that some people may not. At the price it is going for nowadays I say it's worth it. Happy gaming.PS-it is one of the games worth playing on Wii U and can serve as a holdover for people waiting for the bigger releases coming this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0009O7HVW","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Excellent sequel, some very minor problems","reviewText":"X-Men Legends was a breath of new life for those of us sick and tired of waiting for a decent adventure game starring everyone's favourite cast of mutants. It was fast, fun, big and challenging, and contained more in-references and playable characters than you could shake a stick at.X-Men Legends 2: ROA takes that formula and tweaks it somewhat, meaning that this is a sequel that essentially delivers more of the same addictive gameplay, bucketloads more of the same straight-from-the-comic-book atmosphere, and a few minor improvements and disimprovements over the original.The plot is expansive and kind of perfunctory: Apocalypse is back and now the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (the baddies from the original game) must now side with the X-Men to remove the threat of immediate worldwide annihilation. This cunning stunt allows you to have a cast of sixteen selectable muties from the get-go, and this is a pretty even blend of both X-Men and BOEM characters alike. Some are strong from the beginning and only get more powerful as they level up (the ubiquitous Wolverine, Jean Grey, Colossus), some of the new characters are excellent too (Scarlet Witch, Bishop, Juggernaut and Sunfire), and some of the characters from the first game that you might not have used as much because of their clunkiness have been improved out of all order - for me, this was Rogue and Gambit, now (thanks to some serious design improvements) a formidable team.There are still some dud characters, though, and these come in the shape of Magneto and Toad. Shame, but what can you do? You don't *have to* use them, so it's not all bad.The only drawback about all of this is the fact that a huge, huge portion of the Marvel cast roster (and even that from the first game, which was by no means exhaustive!) is missing, and while newbies like the really excellent Scarlet Witch and Sunfire more than hold their own, you can't help but miss the presence of the more usable chatacters from X-Men Legends, such as Beast, Psylocke and Magma.A nice touch, though, is if you assemble a team of heroes with matching secondary costumes (e.g. Age of Apocalypse), you automatically get a stat increase. Similarly, it's now much easier to distribute the stat points, with an Auto option that does the calculation for you, allowing you to focus in on the gameplay. Another HUGE improvement is the economic system of the game, Tech Bits are now in far more plentiful supply and items are relatively cheaper.There are some drawbacks: The items system is still as rotten as ever, if you pick up too many things it's back to the Base to unload some in the Hero stash boxes (think Biohazard). But since this box is not bottomless, you need to sell the weaker items to Forge, too. This doesn't sound so bad in theory but it does break up the action pretty badly, and since the rare items are so very useful you do need to keep a close eye on what you're selling, equipping and moving about.Basic gameplay remains pretty much the same, if overall a little easier than in X-Men Legends. It's fast, fun and very satisfying, and while there are some glitches here and there, the plentiful amount of Save points throughout means you never really spend too much time backtracking.Maps are a pain; there's no way of viewing one overall map without loading up a Map sub-screen, so you do get lost sometimes. Similarly, loading times (as before) remain a second or so too long mid-mission, making leveling up and shuffling things about a bit more of a chore than it needs to be.Graphics are much improved, though, with more detailed and colourful powers, costumes, enemies and stunning backdrops than before.All in all, a sequel very worthy of its great predecessor, X-Men Legends 2 deserves a place on the shelf of all action-adventure game fans.

It's almost like it doesn't know what it needs to be - an open-world, non-linear, stealthy assassination game. I still like it and think AC4 will be even better, but I really feel like Ubisoft is missing a chance to make something like Skyrim + Hitman + historical settings and people.As for the Wii U, it really is better on it due to graphics at least as good (maybe slightly better) than XBox or PS3, and the off-TV play is great as usual and an underrated feature on the console itself.

Soul Calibur 2, which made its way to multiple platforms back in 2003, kept it's great gameplay, modes, and other significant features to keep it's the high profile of the franchise. As a major Soul Calibur fan, I'm very disappointed to say that Soul Calibur 3 doesn't have quite the \"caliber\" that made its predecessors such great fighting masterpiece.The graphics, while it's almost identical to that of Soul Calibur 2, is still beautiful and detailed, and I'm actually quite glad that this factor was kept as it is. Last thing I would want to see is Namco trying something new only to end up developing a bad game.The sound is also actually very similar, but you guys should probably don't take my words into consideration (just my sound section) because I am one of those gamers who gets too deeply involved to even worry about sound. I still think that it's done pretty well, considering that I've heard a lot of worse in game soundtracks as well as sounds itself.Gameplay is where many changes have been done. First of all, many of the modes seem new and different, but are badly executed for the most part as the gamespot reviewer also said. Some moves also seems to be changed as my favorite character Mitsurugi was doing some weird moves instead of the old crazy move that I used to do on the original Soul Calibur and on Soul Calibur 2, no matter how much I kept on spamming only to realize a few minutes later that the moves have been changed. This makes me more angry every time I think about how hard I tried to master Mitsurugi's moves. My other big disappointment was the change of modes and menu designs, as it was a lot harder and confusing to access to different options. Speaking of confusing, the mode Tales of Chronicles was also confusing and extremely dull for the most part. Lastly, I noticed that the game has gotten more difficult than previous games but then again, maybe I forgot to change the difficulty setting to easy. Though I remember ignoring doing so because I think I read someone's review about difficulty options not existing. That will be the first thing I'm going to check next time I play Soul Calibur 3. I guess other factors of gameplay such as responsiveness of controls, intensity of gameplay, and addictiveness of multi player mode are all still the same as before.Value actually depends on the person. Personally, I find the new modes extremely retarded, therefore replay value goes down on my part. For someone else who likes to try new approaches might favor the inclusion of new modes. But then again, it's still very engaging to try to unlock all the features of the game and to play with friends. Sadly, I can play with friends only so often as most are PC gamers. If they added an online mode (why didn't they? PS2 is online enabled...) I think I would totally forget about the new uninspiring modes (because I love fighting random people) and therefore, give replay value a full 10/10. However, that's not the case and I'd say it would only be about 8/10 if I had to score it.As for the tilt, being a fan of Soul Calibur series, I'd say I still like it despite the fact that there are some main features (what made Soul Calibur so great) that are missing (arcade mode and battle mission mode from original Soul Calibur) and disappointing new features that are added. I continuously play game since I bought it last month and I am still enjoying it. So I guess I'm more in favor of this game.Finally, if I had to recommend this game to anyone, I would recommend it to only Soul Calibur fans and hardcore fighting gamers who likes variety. If you have never tried Soul Calibur, then you are better off buying used Soul Calibur 2 for $5 than paying $20 to get Soul Calibur 3. (well, I got mine for $8.99 at gamestop because it was in clearance. I don't know about other gamestop stores or gamestores. I'm just assuming that it's $20. but either way, I doubt that used SC3 is $5)BUT...if you have extra cash, try to get a Dreamcast and get the original Soul Calibur because I'm telling you, it's the one of the best damn fighting games ever made. In the end, I'm recommending Soul Calibur 1 to all newbies to this franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2008"}

Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments.

Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges.

Once the PS2/GC/Xbox era arrived, Spyro games suddenly became terrible; the reason for this madness is that Insomniac, Spyro's creators, abandoned the purple dragon in favor of a character named Ratchet and his robot buddy Clank. Much like the Spyro games before it, Ratchet & Clank is a skillfully made game that innovates the 3-D platformer while maintaining simplicity and pure fun, only this time around a new theme has given Insomniac even more liberty to create bizarre yet likeable worlds, characters, and weapons for a game that's every bit as good as their previous efforts.While Ratchet is making some final touches on his ship one day, a small robot, whom he names Clank, falls from the sky after being shot down by enemies and helps Ratchet start his ship. This sends the pair on an adventure that eventually involves deception, vengeance, and an evil chairman bent on destroying the galaxy to rake in the cash (that makes a little more sense in context of the full story). The tale is far better than it needs to be to carry a game like Ratchet & Clank, with a plot that's more than the typical save the princess or kill the villain fantasy. The game also adds an interesting character development as Clank continually tries to make Ratchet see what their mission's priority needs to be while Ratchet struggles with a blinding vengeful attitude. The dialogue also keeps the story interesting with its continual light humor.The story creates the backbone of Ratchet & Clank, but the gameplay makes up pretty much everything else. The game is a unique blend of 3-D platforming and third person action that focuses on developing both elements to greatness. Bringing the elements together is the collection of bizarre and fun tools and weaponry the pair acquires throughout their intergalactic adventure. There are basic weapons such as the Blaster and Pyrocitor (flamethrower), but there is also a Morph Gun, which turns enemies into chickens, Tesla Claw, which shoots thunderbolts, and many more. Tools that aid the platforming area include the Hydrodisplacer, which relocates small bodies of water, and the Swingshot, which helps Ratchet cross gaps. The weapons are fun and effective to use, but switching weapons is sometimes a hazard as the game doesn't pause while players use the Quick Select feature to equip another weapon or tool.Weapons and tools in hand, the dynamic duo must travel the galaxy and visit many diverse planets in their quest to stop Chairman Drekk. Each planet is well designed as a standalone level, but what makes the level design work so well is the way it draws the player back to previously visited planets with a minimal amount of backtracking. Getting from planet to planet is as simple as hopping in the Ratchet's ship and choosing a destination, and after a particular objective is cleared on a planet there is an option to warp to that point in the level. Other missions also use parts of the levels that are unreachable on the first visit due to lack of equipment, but the game never forces the player to spend even 5 minutes getting back to where they were on the level. To top it all off, the various tools in the game call for many creative puzzles, such as the previously mentioned Hydrodisplacer that can be used to reach higher areas by moving bodies of water. For those reasons, Ratchet & Clank is a very well designed game, and the enjoyment factor benefits from that element greatly.The entire adventure can take roughly 15 hours to clear, which is a solid length for this type of game. After the final boss is defeated there are also many incentives to play back through the game with plenty of unlockable goodies, and Ratchet keeps all the weapons acquired in the previous playthrough. There are also gold versions of each weapon, which require the collection of gold bolts (which are very hard to find) and payment of thousands of regular bolts (the game's currency). So in the end Ratchet & Clank has a solid adventure that still has plenty to offer after it has been cleared.Visually speaking, Ratchet & Clank is a huge step up for Insomniac. Of course, the PS2 has a lot more power than its predecessor, so naturally the quality received a huge boost, but the game's visual style looks so much sharper than in the Spyro games. The main reason this is significant is that there was no difference between the graphics in the second and third Spyro games, and suddenly the style and quality improved greatly in the company's next game. Considering it was an early PS2 game it also looks great with nice textures and colors, lively animations, and character models that successfully convey individuality in each character.Ratchet & Clank is, despite being set in a totally different world, still somewhat reminiscent of the Spyro games. It is clear that Insomniac didn't do away with everything that made Spyro great and start over: they even recycled several favorite sound effects from the series. The rest of the game's sound adds nicely to the effects of shooting a gun or using a unique tool. The game's music is good as well in that it successfully conveys each planet's theme, and yet the soundtrack is also similar to Spyro's. Ratchet & Clank's sound makes it clear that Insomniac didn't want to do away with everything they had done well with before, and the result is a sound package that fits the game perfectly while still reminding players of the entirely different world of Spyro.It might seem that I have spoken about Spyro a little too much in a review about Ratchet & Clank, but I think it's important to note that, being its successor in a sense, the game improves upon Insomniac's already proven formula and adds a fresh twist to it, throwing it in a new world on the intergalactic scale. Ratchet & Clank is great fun because it doesn't try to be flashy or revolutionary, yet it innovates the platformer in some unique and exciting ways. PS2 owners should definitely pick up a copy of Ratchet & Clank, because it's a great game that is also sold for a bargain price nowadays.Positive:+ Solid story and character development with humorous dialogue+ Perfect blend of action and platforming+ Plenty of fun and bizarre weapons+ Level design conveniently links all the worlds together+ High replay value+ Graphics are greatly enhanced from Insomniac's previous gamesNegative:- Quick selecting a weapon doesn't pause the game9.0/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

While I enjoyed last years game, there were many flaws that were obvious even to my untrained eye. Biggest complaints for me were AI Receivers would run out of bounds for no reason, while the path ahead was clear (later fixed in a patch) and the punishing Madden IQ system which totally berated me everytime I lost a game.Madden 10 fixes these issues and more. IQ is still there, but it just kind of hangs in the background. There are slider controls to tweak every aspect to AI. Too many fumbles for your taste? Adjust it. Too many picks? Adjust it. and so on. In Madden 09 I've had games where both teams threw 10+ interceptions each. Now I can change that. New animations and things like gang tackles don't do anything for the gameplay, but do add immensely to realism and immersion in the game. Presentation is just top notch - way above 09.My only complaints - the commentary is pretty bad, as a matter of fact, to me it seems worse then last year. I haven't decided yet if I like the new playcalling screen. The biggest complaint I have has nothing to do with this years game, but with Madden in general. The team stats affect the gameplay more then your own skill. I'm an intermediate player (PRO skill level), but I win every single game with Giants, while losing 2 out of 3 with the Saints. This is true this year, last year and I'm sure a few years before. I realise that stats play a role because this is supposed to be a football sim, but there has to be a way where player's skill (rather then team's last year performance) can be rewarded a bit more.I was skeptical about buying 10, wondering if it's worth the $60. Having played it, I'd say absolutely. I wish I could say the same about PSP version, but I guess I'll have to skip that one this year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2009"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Gran Turismo 5:  Is this the ultimate sim experience?","reviewText":"So let me preface this review by stating the following:  I'm not a diehard GT player.  I did beat everything way back in Gran Turismo 2 for the PS1 with the exception of the Super license.  So I'm familiar with the \"gist\" of this kind of simulation game.  After GT2 I dabbled in GT3 and GT4 but never got really in depth.  Please keep this in mind before you just hit the \"review not helpful\" button because I did not give this game 5 stars.Let's start with the great to very good:- Attention to detail:  At least with the premium cars, you aren't going to find better looking ones in any other video game when you include the interiors.  It's as close as most of us will get to these cars and it puts you right there when you're using a driving wheel.  The tracks are a good mix of new with the old GT standbys (Trail Mountain, High Speed Ring, etc.)- Single Player Focus:  A lot of the recent arcade racers have a 10-15 hour single player only.  Heck, it'll take you that long just to get to level 10-11 in GT5.  And since the cars are linked to your level, it's a good bet if you want to get to the best cars you're going to have to invest a lot of time in this game.  There's also the B-Spec mode where you switch places and basically become a crew chief.  It's a whole other experience onto itself.- Modifications:  There is simply an insane amount of things you can do with 1 car.  Now, add to this the 999 other ones, and at least in the open events, the sky is the limit to how you can customize your car's performance, and in fact, this is very necessary to compete across all tracks.  Which is how racing is in real life.Now, here are some things that are less than perfect, at least for a game 6 years in development:- Uneven difficulty spikes:  Ok, so I had NEVER done the carts before yet I blew through the 1st event with no problems on my first try.  Then I get to the Top Gear van race, and if you barely even nudge the back end of the one in front of you, you're disqualified.  I can understand if you smash into them.  But it makes it very, very frustrating.  This also makes an appearance in the final test of every license that I've seen so far.  So you've been warned:  If you're not a \"sim\" racer and don't want to put the time and effort necessary in, do NOT buy this game or you will be disappointed.- A very clunky interface:  For all that's going on, finding out information is a real pain.  If I am interested in a car, it should tell me what events it is eligible to be entered in before I buy it.  If I'm going to make an upgrade that will make it ineligible for an event, I should be warned and not just \"this action cannot be undone\".  If you're a veteran GT player, this won't affect you, but the game doesn't do a very good job of welcoming someone new in.  They will likely do what I did:  See a special event, buy a Mini Cooper 07, accidentally do the weight reduction, and find out that I just wasted 35,000 credits because I'm under the minimum weight for that race!- Lazy scenery/fan design:  Gamesradar.com did a good job of showing this, where instead of making the scenery more random, they just pasted whole groups of trees one after another, and on some tracks they did the fans really well, and in others they look like something you'd see in Madden 2005 when they did a close up of the stands.  In 2010 on a system as powerful as the PS3, there's no excuses for cutting corners like this, other than they figured that hardcore GT fans (their target audience) wouldn't care.The bottom line:*If you've played and enjoyed any GT game in the past, this is a must buy for you, no questions asked*If you've never played a GT game before, be forewarned this is not NFS:HP or Blur...and in order to succeed, it's going to take a lot of work and practice.  You're not going to just fly by the seat of your pants in this game...Final Word:GT5 might not be the knockout that P.Digital was hoping for, but it's a huge step in the right direction.  IMO, if they simply eliminated the B-Spec, put in more A-Spec content and updated ALL the cars to premium, as well as fixing the graphical issues, then you'd truly have \"The Ultimate Driving Simulator\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2010"}

I think I'd classify it as a point-and-click adventure, just because much of the gameplay involves tapping on things with the DS's stylus.  Anyway, there's been a growing number of such games being released for the DS (such as Trace Memory, Time Hollow, Phoenix Wright, etc.), so I decided to pick one up.  Being an avid consumer of RPG's, I knew I could handle alot of text.  Good thing, too, since Hotel Dusk is mostly text.  So, did I end up liking my first foray into the point-and-click adventure genre? Let's find out!Graphics (score 7/10): Graphics are a mixed bag.  On the one hand you have the character portraits which appear during dialogue, and a few cutscenes; on the other hand, you have the in-game environment.  The character portraits look really nice.  They posess a sketchy appearance, and there is animated movement from time to time as they change facial expressions or gesticulate, makng them look like part of an animated book.  The 3-d environments that you explore, however, look rather pixelated.  It's especially bad when you see a character standing in a hallway, because they look like highly pixelated cardboard cut-outs on a 3-d background.  Overall, though, everything is tolerable and doesn't detract too badly from the game.Music (score 6/10): The musical scores are rather generic lounge/elevator type music, and are quite repetitive.  However, this seems to work best in the context of the game.  You spend the whole game in a hotel, so having this type of music works.  However, there's really nothing memorable about the music, so don't expect to add this to your soundtrack collection.Characters (score 8/10): This is where the game shines.  And it should, considering that 80% of the game is nothing but dialogue and character interactions.  Since this is the case, character personalities are fleshed out very well, and everyone gets an adequate amount of development.  Each character even posesses their own unique speech patterns.  Even you main character, Kyle Hyde, has his own distinct personality.  After playing so many RPG's that had the old \"silent protagonist\", having someone with an actual personality was quite refreshing.Story (score 7/10): The story really starts out slow.  The game is divided into 10 chapters, and the first three are rather dull.  However, things start to pick up from there.  I wouldn't say that Hotel Dusk has the best story in the world, but it was mildly interesting, at least.  The story is played out a bit like a murder mystery/detective story.  It should be noted that the storyline is firmly rooted in reality, which is unfortunate because I think a dash of fantasy or supernatural elements would've made this game more interesting.  Oh well, I think the developers were trying to stay grounded in reality to keep to their mystery detective theme.  It's kind of unfortunate that they weren't able spice up the story a bit, since it's still kind of dull even by the time you get the big revelation at the end.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The first thing to note is that the DS is held sideways like a book.  As far as I know this is rather unusual.  The game is almost entirely played with the stylus, which is implemented quite well.  This game is not for everyone because it is really more text than game.  Most of your play time is spent talking to other characters; the other time is spent simply moving from place to place, or doing small minigames.  These minigames are pretty easy, and require no real skill or dexterity at all.  The good news is that since the minigames are so easy, they will not prevent anyone from finishing the game.  My one complaint is that in the first three chapters (and also afterwards, to some extent), the game doesn't provide much direction.  So, you spend much time wandering the halls trying to figure out what to do next.  This is really the biggest flaw of the game; since gameplay quickly devolves into simply walking up and down a hallway knocking on doors over and over again because you have no idea what to do.  That's really what kills the gameplay and drives you insane.  If they'd provided more direction on simply who you should speak to next, this would've been a much more fun game.Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I really enjoyed Hotel Dusk while I was playing it, but I realize that this game is not for everyone.  It will turn off people who like alot of action in their games and people who don't like to read.  I personally had no problems with the slower pacing and text-heavy dialogue.  I don't think Hotel Dusk has much replay value, though; once you've uncovered the story, there's not alot of incentive to go back and play again, even though there are small changes present in the new game+ mode.  I can't really imagine myself wanting to go through this game again since the story is pretty dull.  If you can buy this game for less than $15 then it might be worth it, depending on if you like this genre.  Overall, though, it's a short game and may be better as a rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2009"}

While each following installment has improved gameplay, there is a bit of repetition here which may be off putting to longtime players. Black Flag continues the innovation of AC III, but without the elegance that one might expect.This is a hard game to get into. The scenery is fun, but it has a lot of the same things that have been beaten to a pulp in previous games. For awhile, I could only play for 20 minutes at a time before growing bored.The gameplay improves as the storyline goes on. It gets a bit convoluted, but that's sort of to be expected.

{"product_name":"B004ML44Y6","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Average All the Way","reviewText":"The Darkness, released for the PS3 back in 2007 was a surprise hit at the infancy of the \"next-gen\" console era. In fact The Darkness is the second game I played on my PS3 in beautiful HD glory on a (then) brand-spanking new 46\" Sharp Aquos. It's no wonder I enjoyed the game so much. So when the Darkness 2 was announced for the PS3 I didn't hesitate in picking up the title.What's changed in the last five years? Well plenty in the gaming community but The Darkness 2 holds staunchly to tried and true gaming practices that might leave you feeling like you've done this one too many times before. In fact besides the shift to a cell-shaded graphics style there's not much that's changed at all.The Darkness 2 once again puts you in control of Jackie Estacado who has been living the dream life of a Mafioso gangster in NYC. It becomes apparent that Jackie has been trying to control \"the darkness\" by limiting his usage of the creature. Events quickly transpire that force Jackie to once again release the twin-headed beast and take on an army of magically-infused baddies intent on stripping Jackie of his powers. The Darkness 2 transpires pretty much entirely on NYC streets and buildings with a brief exception near the end of the title. There's not a whole lot of variety to the locations you'll visit in the game but really you won't have much time to tire of the setting because this game is very, very short.Even for a shooter this game can be finished easily in a few short sittings. This in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing. But The Darkness 2 does absolutely nothing new. You start of the beginning of a level and mow down wave after wave of mostly idiotic AI bots that run right at your overpowered character. Once you've purchased enough upgrades (there's a very basic upgrade skill tree) the game becomes ludicrously easy even on the hardest difficulty setting.Once you've finished the 6-8hr. campaign there is an additional mode called \"vendetta\" where you assume the role of one of four generic characters and tackle a series of side-jobs for Jackie. These side missions add a bit to the story but not much. Many of the side missions take place in the exact same levels you've already cleared with Jackie. You can, at least, invite a friend to play vendetta mode with you in online cooperative gameplay which is really the saving grace. But once again expect a very brief campaign.As a shooter The Darkness 2 is a relatively solid title, however, it's clear that there wasn't any particular motivation to innovate or bring anything new to the table. The price of this title plummeted shortly after release and for the right price is definitely worth picking up and playing. However, the lack of any meaningful replay value, the short campaign length, and the predictable story all deter this title from the accolades reserved for the likes of Bioshock.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2012"}

The first game (chronologically) in the Gears of War trilogy! This is how it all began. But how does it stack up against its sequel?GAMEPLAY: 4/5Thankfully, the basic gameplay is intact. The developers adhered closely to the \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" philosophy. Sure, there are a few new things, like more emphasis on vehicles and battles that take place on scripted tracks, but for the most part this is the same Gears of War you were playing for umpteen hours.WEAPONS: 4/5There are some new (mostly enemy) weapons (and one shield). Honestly though, I found the trusty combination of Sniper Rifle/Lancer/Big Pistol/Grenades to do the trick, just like in the last installment. While I didn't find all the weapons very practical, there is a good enough variety to get the job done.ENEMIES: 4/5On the one hand, I was glad to see Brumaks, Reavers and other insanely huge (and nasty) monsters to kill, but on the other hand I found that some of them were pretty easy to kill (especially with the ridiculously powerful but short-ranged Mortar). In particular, I remember how hard it was to kill a Reaver on the ground, but later in the game (at the Queen's palace) I killed flying Reavers with only a few shots.The enemies are just as aggressive as last time, but their AI doesn't let them do more than simple flanking maneuvers.STORY: 3/5If you played the original Gears of War, you know that you start the game with our main character, Fenix, in prison. I was really hoping GoW2 would explain WHY or HOW Fenix got into prison in the first place. Unfortunately it doesn't.This game also tries to pull off a sad moment that didn't really work due to a lack of character development. I consider a particular scene in LOST ODYSSEY to be the standard for emotional moments in a video game.In general, this game is very light on plot or story. If you're looking for a game that is like an interactive SF novel (like MASS EFFECT), this is not it.SOUND: 5/5From the sound of your rusting and bloody chainsaw to the sound of bullets ripping through flesh, this game has great sound effects. The voice acting is consistent, using the same voices as last time. I'm especially glad to hear the voice of \"Terry Tate Office Linebacker\" as Cole Train. He really acts that part well.GRAPHICS: 5/5The least important to me, but more than once I found myself rotating the camera around just to marvel at the spectacular environments around me. Most impressive was the ending level of Jacinto. Quite a skyline!OVERALL: 4.25 / 5If you want the same basic gameplay but played against different backgrounds and occasionally have to use a vehicle or scripted track to fight your battles, this game should do the trick. This game is definitely addictive (I beat it in three days in 3-hour blocks) and then there is Horde mode and multiplayer (neither of which I really bothered with, but they're there). A good game if you're looking to blow stuff up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2008"}

This is NOT fallout.  it's \"like\" fallout, but the world isn't nearly as open, there is very little hording to be done.  The missions are fairly linear, which I like (you can't really get lost trying to find an objective, the level designers lead you directly to the prize).  The driving is fun and incredibly, um, realistic, considering you are using a game controller.  Bouncing over rocks and against the walls of the race course, you actually fell like you are in the dirt buggy getting bounced around.  Hard to explain, but somehow they nailed the driving controller action.The graphics are amazing for the PS3.I'm totally enjoying the game (I'm not done yet).  It does not feel like a chore to slog your way through the game, which can happen with some of these type of games.  This one is actually FUN to play.  If you like Dirt and Fallout3, get Rage and drive around the wastelands instead of walking!Cons:  long load times, long game save times, and save screen is on the menu so it takes away from the action to save your game.  The game does do an auto-save when entering a new area, but you can sometimes be in that area all night and die near the end and have to start over.  In other words, there are no checkpoints during a mission, only when entering or exiting an area (or mission).  It's hard to die on easy or normal mode, though.  there is a way to revive yourself, and as the game goes on your revive thingy recharges faster and faster.  But the long level load times take away from the reality suspension.Overall, its fun and worth playing.  After you finish Fallou3 and New Vegas, and Skyrim (if that game has an actual \"end\"), Red Dead Redemption (ditto for the \"end\" thing), Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Infamous and Dirt, and Battlefield3 and Modern Warfare3, then play some Rage.

{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Kimberly Hoye","summary":"Great game!","reviewText":"Join Sonic on this great adventure game!

And boy it does!Following on from the GTA's groundbreaking no-rules gameplay, Mercenaries allows for complete free-roaming non-linear action. The first time I exited the campground I wanted to see just how much freedom the game would offer - so rather than go an speak to whoever it was the game was directing me to, I decided to try to steal and enemy vehicle and go off on my own adventure. After finding a North Korean jeep and 'acquiring' it, my road journey began. Before I knew it, I was deep in a North Korean compound apparently having convinced the NK's that I'm one of them. The sensation of knowing I might be caught at anytime is just one of the thrills the game serves up. I took out bunkers, subdued guards, stole tanks destroyed entire buildings - all without being instructed to. Marvellous.Sure, like with GTA, the game has certain plot points and story quests that will allow your character to progress and use bigger and better weapons. But you can do them in your own time when you choose - I love that. Even when you die all is not lost - unless you're on an ace contract all that happens is you resurrect in the ally campground and lose some money; just like a hospital visit in GTA!The graphics perform well although there is a mist that's obviously covering up pop-up. Understandable though given that massive terrain you can traverse (with NO loading). And the game does have a certain dark brown feel - but again it's in keeping with the theme of the game. The physics of the game is incredible  though, with almost everything destroyable, moveable or stealable. I was shooting some rockets at a guard tower and upon the third hit the whole thing fell. And it didn't just go 'pop'... it slowly FELL, with dust, bricks and debris flying off it all acompanied by appropriate bone crunching audio. It really took my by surprise at how it all went down, and since then I've been blowing up everything I can by using hand-planted C4 or even laser-targeted airstrikes for the big stuff.Overall this game seems quite shallow initially, but after scores of hours playing I can say this is every bit as deep GTA3 et al, and worth every penny. Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2005"}

However, the similarity to Bio is quickly dispelled after completing the introduction sequence. It feels a lot more like Fable when you start interacting with characters and the environment (ie. play Hide and Seek with little Emily). Things do take a more interesting turn once you begin taking missions. Powers are great - just don't ask me how I got them?! Just woke up and had them; maybe, Corvo can dream about Kate Upton next time. So, once things get rolling this game is much more in the Deus Ex (HR)/ Thief (1,2,3) wheel house. Fortunately, I really liked the Thief series and don't mind the helter skelter pace of a game that forces you to think things out; but, then execute them quickly. It is a rush trying to save Corvo once a dozen thugs start coming after him. The main critique being that the controls do feel clunky and a bit retro. Unfortunately, do not believe that I'll be going back for all of the ghost and shadow bonuses. This game is a little too 'cute' for me to invest that kind of time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

There are some funny immature moments in the game, but the gameplay is just too frustrating. The first half of the game is incredibly easy, but then at a certain point there are incredible amounts of cheap deaths, most memorably a many times repeated chase scene from your girlfriend that result in an instant kill if she comes close. Every boss fight essentially resolves around firing at weak points either normally or in life draining darkness. The gunplay is similar to the recent Resident Evil games, but I felt like the aiming was a little off as way too many times I would just barely miss the enemy (like between his legs, between the arm and body of the demon, or grazing the head). It's just a very lack luster game, there's nothing special about it, the gameplay is weak and has been done multiple times before, the graphics are average, the story is ridiculous, and the weapons are average and stagnant.

You are an EX Jedi Knight who served with Reven(in fact you WERE his right hand man so to speak). You and Reven ended the Mandalorian battle(not the war) at Malachoir V(That snowy Scutta says that name alot). You were cast out of the Jedi order for your misdeeds(you were awair it was wrong but used your own judgment anyway).- This is all BEFORE your main plot in the game as a player character. Dialogue choices(in flash sequence) determine WHY your character faced trial and did what he did as well as the nature of his doing this. In the present: Your dialogue effects not only you but your past KoToR 1 character as well(I won't say who he is but you wanted the plot). You can chose a man a woman either benevolent(as in Good and Kind) or Malevalant(as in Mal-adjusted misfit) as Luke-like Anakinsh or the female varient of both such as: Luke's Neimisis in Heir to the Empire sort-I like cats and in sentinal/assasin garb and grace. Superfically you chose your Light saber color and style(no 2 separate whepons but who cares, you can chose a new one(s)) As the \"Plott thickens\" and it does, believe me, Kriea gives a lot of info and finally spills her guts about the nature of things.(you do need high charisma and influence for this to happen propperly) Visas Marr is an added character for your power and Love life, but not much in the way of YOUR personal history Plot. The most pivotal character(for YOUR plot) is Bao Dur. He served with you and was YOUR right hand man.(Holding a bit of bitterness if you rub him the wrong way). You'll have to influence ALL of your crew in order to advance the plott to a coherent understanding, Otherwise, it's just a RPG hackn slash with attack bonuses and Force powers. If the credits roll up to fast, just start over and try to please your crew for more plott. Be a Sentinal for persuasion and use Charisma(not normally associated with this class) for heavy influence beyond \"Persuade\" Skill. Your compainions and NPCs on other planets alinke will break down and cry at your feet. The plot is superb!and now part II of this long review(as long as a letter I sent ot Lucas and Obsidan via snail mail). The bugs are numorous, anyone not experiencing them Bravo, it goes without saying, I don't need to give you a cookie; but for the rest of us, It is a severe drawback and the company(s) need to fix them instead of blaming the other like finger-pointing kindergardeners they are(a trend in most big business Video game companies) Fanboys just make them work less and flaming a player instead of a company is feeding the Dark side. Green is Greed. Red is just Mad as hockey stix. And both are bad. Only True blue(truth) and Mellow Yellow(diplomacy) will work this out. I sugest buying the latest and greatest computer rig(despite what people think or tell you in locals shops) that means the Top of the Line PC and Video card(not ATI there terrible). YOu will have little problems if your Co prosessor(dual prefferabley) works them out and less likely to crash the system. Twin vid makes any failing of the drivers irrelevant as the speed is inormous(with all graphic settnigs at max). Cool your system to freezing(figuratively) as in proper fans and fan positons(not just the hardware but stradegy) Lower the front and make it suck raise the rear and make it blow. OR go watercooled as a Voodoo or a Falcon NW. Only NVidia offers Twin cards also go RAID 0 prime Hard disk(s) and a separate HD for games is a must for both stability and speed.(despite what the techs say). Taking the load off the main HD(2xRAID0) makes it focus on the OS, not the game then drive D:(so to speak) can access the game.Finally go pentium for less cooling problems(unless water cooling your chipset --AND-- CPU BOTH). I have blown serveral AMD's bye the fact that thier fans suck and they don't sell them(for the older MB) after a year. A20mm Chipset fan is impossible to find for a AMD K7M266 for instance. KoTor 1 as well as 2 has problems on ATI drivers(not hardware) XBox also has it's share of problems(that cannot be fixed with patches) so Go nVidia to get these games running right.Final part: The game is broken down in to serveral worlds and the sub-plotts tie in to the main plott well. Nar Shadda is a very elaborate planet in it's self and so are the others. IN KoToR 1 the pre-spaceship trip(as in Taris and Dantooine) were the big parts and the other worlds were too short and simple in KoToR 2 this is not the case, you spend endless hours on EVERY world you explore plus you have to return later to touch up on things before final confrontion. Malachoir(Mal=Messed up I guess) is your last stop(as you sort of crash there). The game uses a SIMILAR not exact 20d system as in Dungeons and Dragons. Thier is no logic in why wielding two lightsabers is penalized by your strenght lightsabers weigh nothing. Also 1.5 in the main hand for a double-blade or a single with no other is not logical. Stength in a beem of light doesn't come in to play. The attribute should be used for other things as in ship maintianence or hauling stuff(in this game only) or in Melee combat at first or heavy rifel use, not in sabers. The game is potintially(thought Obsidan has no interest in working the bugs out)the best game on the planet and it is a shame and a crime that the bugs are not corrected NOW!

My first impressions were how little the game has really progressed since that one. Graphically, it's almost identical. The AI is tweaked a bit, and there are obviously new rosters, but it's clear that I wasn't missing out by skipping '09 and '10.The analog hitting and pitching is a neat concept, but to me this is evidence that some innovation, even if great in concept, isn't necessarily a real improvement. After trying out the analog batting and pitching for a few days, I really felt that the classic controls provided more precise input, and switched back to them. Which made this feel even MORE like the '08 edition.Still, it's a fun game, and I have to give it 5-stars on that front. However, it is not without its shortcomings and glitches, some minor and some major, including (note that I primarily play Road to the Show mode):-Home crowds booing their own pitcher after throwing for a strike out of the zone-When loading/saving, the progress bar (which is the default PS3 version) tends to zoom to 100%, only to spend another 20-30 seconds finishing the process. In other words, they mean nothing. Very strange for a game this late in a series and this far into the console's lifespan.-CPU hitters almost NEVER hit line-drives. Everything seems to be either a foul down the line or a hit towards the middle. Even when I adjusted the slider for this, it changed little.-It's seems far too difficult to judge ball speed as a hitter. It's hard to explain, but I have never had this problem to this extent in baseball video games. Fastballs and curve balls are often indistinguishable until well after the point-of-decision for swinging, even when the pitcher is marginal.-Even unskilled pitchers are at times far too good at painting the corners.-The instructions are absurdly light, and nowhere in them or in the game are the player attributes sufficiently described, leaving the player to wonder how improving stuff like \"BR AGG\" will really help his game. Very strange indeed.-Your manager will sometimes tell you outside of a game that he doesn't want you stealing bases until he says otherwise. Then, in the middle of a game, the 3rd base coach will signal a hit-and-run to you. If you do what you're told, after the game your manager will BENCH you for trying to steal a base. Not cool.So, it sounds like I really hate the game. On the contrary, it's a lot of fun...as it's always been. But I have to dock 1-star for some of the issues. Some are minor, but some are silly glitches that have no right being in such a mature series.If you're focusing on RTTS mode, and you DON'T like the analog controls, it's hard to justify this game if you already have a prior edition. But all in all, it's still a lot of fun, and still the best series on the market by a long shot, warts and all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}

Not to mention you can enter and exit levels as you please so you get to see the concept of all levels from the start of the game. I was interested in seeing how much more this classic franchise had to offer and I found out it doesn't have much.  Konami might think about retiring this franchise and really focusing on Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill.The final verdict here is that swinging that whip provides some fun, you should rent this game a couple of times and finish it but it's definitely not worth buying.  If for some crazy reason you haven't played the original Devil May Cry yet, I'd suggest you buy that for about $9.99.  That's of course if this kind of game interests you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2003"}

This innovative action-strategy game is unlike any other game you've ever played, and with remastered Wii controls, it has never played better!","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"Aside from new controls, nothing new to see here.","reviewText":"If you haven't already played Pikmin on the GameCube, this game is an excellent opportunity to catch up with a great game.  If you've already played this game there is literally nothing new here besides the controls.  No new extra modes, no multi-player, no extra levels, no noteworthy graphical upgrades.  Just new controls.For those of you who haven't played the game yet, it is a very solid game.  To sum it up simply, you take control of Olimar, a diminutive space explorer that crash lands on an earth like planet filled with hostile bugs and critters.  You control a small army of Pikmin that do your bidding by fighting and carrying stuff for you.  Red, Yellow, and Blue Pikmin have different abilities which you must take advantage of as you traverse the terrain of each of the levels.  In typical Nintendo fashion, there is a great deal of exploration where you can see an area of the game but can't get to it until you unlock new abilities which require you come back to previous levels.  Gameplay is broken into thirty 15-20 minute \"days\" in which you frantically try to cram as many accomplishments as possible into the short time frame.  It all works very well, although I wish the 30-day limit wasn't in place.  I found Pikmin to be quite entertaining 8 years ago, and still like it to this day.THE NEW CONTROLS: The new controls work extremely well.  There isn't any pointless remote waggle and the pointer controls work pretty well.GRAPHICS: Aside from progressive scan support and 16:9 wide screen support, there isn't anything new here.  The artwork was gorgeous years ago, but nowadays it's only pretty good.  Textures look low res but the art style makes up for the deficiencies.  The sad thing is that this two generation old game still looks better than most modern Wii games.SOUND: Time has been kind to me because I apparently forgot how cheesy parts of the game are, and sound is simultaneously a strong and weak point for the game.  Some of the music is very pleasant and relaxing while the cut-scenes have some extremely annoying music.REPLAY: Aside from a points mode at the end, there isn't a whole lot of replay value to the game.  It can be beat in about 10-15 hours, including time spent having to replay levels due to unfortunate death situations.All in all, I recommend this game to anyone that didn't get the chance to play the game on the GameCube.  The new controls provide a superior experience.  There really aren't many games like Pikmin which makes even this remake feel unique and fresh.  For those of you who have already played the game on the GameCube, this game is pretty much just a pure nostalgia purchase.[Edit: Fixed some embarrassingly bad grammar]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2009"}

But I think it is a great game with an endless amount of fun. I first purchased this game back when it first came out and played it until I beat it which is a job in itself. I thought the storyline was very cleaver and well thought of.Graphis...I think the graphics in this came are amazing in a big scale. I mean when you walk around looking at all the people you very rarely have people in the same area that look the same, I think the buildings the water everything from big to small is amazing. They all look real and have a good glare of realism to them as well. Overall I give the graphics 5/5Gameplay...The game play is pretty good. I mean there are endless posabilitis to what you can do with your character. All ranging from the single player to the muliplayer you can do an awful lot with this game, the gameplay is pretty straight forward not moving much from the older games so that is a good thing for people of the franchise. I rate this catagory 5/5Audio/Sound...I think this is a little lacking, The sounds of the guns sometimes don't fire, and sometimes i hear things that just don't make sense I mean I just can't put it together. Other then that the sounds of crashes and driving are all very good. I think they did a pretty good job with the whole game overall. I rate this catagory 4/5Final Thought...I think this game is a great one to have becase it deals with a lot of diffrent things you can do from single to muliplayer like I stated before. The graphics and audio are good as well. You can sit dowe and play this game for hours on end if you so well pelase to. There are many things ranging one what you can do. There are many weapons as well. This is a good game to have to play by yourself or to play with friends.

The graphics, the sound, the ambience were all top-notch. Never before (with the exceptions of the Myst games on the PC) had I been so totally immersed in the atmosphere of a video game before. RE was thrilling and frightening.All of that returns in Resident Evil Zero, a prequel about the events leading up to the T-Virus outbreak in the Umbrella Mansion in the Arklay Mountains. There are a few differences though.This time around you are in control of 2 characters. One is Rebbeca Chambers, the medic girl from RE. And the other is Billy Cowen, an escaped convict who teams up with Rebecca when they meet on an abandoned train.Together they take on Zombies and giant insects as they try to figure out what has happened in the Umbrella training facility. It's a lot easier than the first one. Though there are far more enemies to blow away, there are way more bullets. So you don't have to be so careful about reserving ammo. The Crimson Heads are also gone (thankfully) so when a zombie is dead it stays dead. And lets be honest, those Crimson Heads were terrifying.Originally this game was made for the Nintendo 64 but was never released so they just remade it for the Gamecube. I wise choice as the game fully shows off what the Gamecube is capable of. RE Zero is full of ominous camera angles, dingy locations and a dark atmosphere extending all the way down to the tiniest detail. Though I did particularly like the bright and somber (?) ending.Complete this game quick enough and you'll unlock a bonus game called Leech Hunter in which Rebecca and Billy (now in different clothing) can run around the training facility blasting at things. It's just for fun but it's still quite cool.If you're a fan of RE 1 then RE Zero is a must have. Not quite as good but still a damn cool game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

There are so many other battles and wars out there why do they keep coming back to this one? Because it kicks butt! Call of Duty World of War a sequal to 2007 best seller, comes back with a new story, some new improvments and ready to kick butt.You will find out that the story is played from 2 different side. the American forces and the Russians. You will get to totally experience the difference and the combat uniqueness of each. Form the momenet you start this game it is non stop action and is very addictive. You find out that the action is very detailed and exciting. You will play thru the entire game in a day, ( yeh its a little short) but you will not want to put down the controller. After you beat the game you will receive a bonus game known as Nazi zombies. which OMG is very addicitve. You will put as much time or probably a lot more into playing this level.You will get lots of trophies with this game. None of them are that difficult to get. You will enjoy the replay of the game as much as you did playing it the first time.BUT, one of the biggest reason that people buy this game is for the online play. Because of COD4 being so big online then they had to up the anties on this one. Which you will find that the online hasnt changed that much. But, it still is very addictive and fun. One of my favorite things about the game is the controls, you can actually just pick it up and play it, no wasted time learning controls. What I like most about it is the feel and the graphics, its very realistic.Bad things: If you get a bad copy of this game you will find that your data will be erased some how. over and over. The game does have some major glitches and I have to say the most I have ever seen in one game. That can take the fun out of online, how can you play against a \"glitch master\" when he's under the map shooting up at you. But they have went back and fixed some of the glitches, still many more.The co-op could have been done a lot better, kind of dissapointing.Overall: its a great sequal, it improves in places, (minus the glitches).

The story is absolutely riveting; without spoiling too much, being an old Batman-fan I'll just say it opens even more dramatically than I'd expected, and doesn't let up from there. The archvillains of Gotham are having territorial disputes within the megaprison of Arkham City, and Batman ends up caught in the middle. If you've got the Catwoman DLC (comes free with any of the special editions), you'll also get Catwoman's mission sprinkled into the campaign. They're few and far apart, but it's a great changeup that lets you explore even more of the city, the characters, and feels very rewarding upon conclusion. The main story campaign may feel just a tad short though, but that's probably because you're glued to the screen every day while completing it. And don't miss out on the end credits, there's more than one surprise awaiting you there.However, the story campaign doesn't even begin to cover this game; there are Riddler trophies, balloons, riddles, augmented reality training, gadgets, attacks, side missions (building upon the campaign in style), fights, predator missions, combat missions, artwork and 3D character models to be discovered and explored. And that's not including the DLC (play as Robin or Nightwing!), the new game plus mode and all the little details they've snuck into the game itself. Beyond just the scope and well written story, you can tell that the game is more polished than before. The graphics engine may be the same, but small details such as snow, birds, lights, helicopters and roaming guards gives it an atmospheric edge over the previous game. The voice acting is superb as always, and the score is similarly gothic and gloomy, worthy of any Hollywood adaptation.IfBatman Arkham Asylumwas a strong indication, Arkham City once and for all proves that a game doesn't need multiplayer functionality to be fantastic. It may not be something for friends to gather around, but as an experience for one player it's riveting, rewarding and addicting all at once. Even more so if you're already a fan of Batman.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

I can't say how far backward it's gone, because I don't have the early CoD games, but it's well below the 4 most recent ones. If you think you might want to play it, borrow or rent it to see if you like it. Or wait for the price to drop. That should happen pretty soon.On the negative side, I'm playing \"Campaign\" mode at present, and it makes no sense. It bounces around like a Mexican jumping bean with an interrogation of the character \"Mason\" interspersed at frequent and annoying intervals. And the interrogation sounds like a script out of a \"C\" grade movie. Whenever I can, I skip that because the voice of the interrogator, the \"flashbacks\" and Mason's lines and delivery are mediocre, ridiculous and irritating. I probably won't even try multiplayer; I'm too disappointed. If I hadn't paid so much for the game, I wouldn't even finish it.On the plus side, I enjoyed the gunboat and Hind episodes for the variety, so I'm hoping for something that makes playing the rest of the game more fun, although I have to be near the end by now.I'm neutral about the graphics, because the game's action is really what video gaming is about.

Currently, however the main contenders are the Virtua Fighter and the Soul Calibur Series with Mortal Kombat and Tekken's dissapointing showings putting them just out of the bubble, though that could change with a good future release.  Anyway, I have played both Virtua Fighter 4 and VF4 Evolution as well as Soul Calibur 2, and while Soul Calibur 2 is the best weapons fighterin its class(though to be fair there arent very many weapons fighters), Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution takes the cake.  Now for the features of Soul Calibur:Characters: 9/10(simply because I have no need for Heihachi in a weapons fighter, 10/10 for Xbox and GC)VF4:10/10Controls: 9/10(Clunky as you get used to them but easilly adapted when you get the hang of it) VF4 9/10(same reason)Moves: 10/10(Perfect combinations of easy and difficult moves with a simple yet complex system) VF4: 10/10Special Mode(overall): 10/10 (Slightly edges out VF4's quest mode because the weapons you acquire effect you in combat) VF4:9/10Special Mode system: 8/10 (while some of the fights are fun and innovative, like one in a windy area where you have to knock your opponent off a windmill, it can be a pain going through the dungeons, fighting drone after drone, while gaining back minimal hitpoints to sustain you from some of the massive attacks, unrewarding ranking system with no real base) VF4:9/10(easier to sustain, many fighting modes, relatively easy to unlock things, good ranking system, can always take a break but still be able to fight new people, very long)Replay Value: I decided not to count the replay value, because in fighting games that is hard to judge but I would mark them about even.Graphics: 10/10 (superb, easy to move around in, great environments) VF4: 10/10 (similarly flawless)The winner: Virtua Fighter 4/VF4 Evolution!  Both franchises will hopefully be making admirable fighting games down the road and both games are worth getting but VF4 slightly edges out SC2 to take the prize.  Though this did not effect my decision in any way, as a bonus, Virtua Fighter 4 and Virua Fighter 4 Evolution both are only $19.99 while SC2 is $37.95.  Simply put, if you are strapped for cash and can only afford one, get Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution, but if you can spend a little money, then get both of these masterfully rendered fighting games.

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Rex","summary":"Another Zelda Masterpiece...","reviewText":"The Zelda series has always had it's ups, every game they have made has gotten 2 thumbs up. This ranks as one of the best ones, behind the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. This game, with major changes to the graphics, making it more cartoony, has made it seem better because its something different. A lot of complaints come from the graphics, but if it's something different, then it can be a little better. And I kind of like the cartoony Animal Crossing graphics, it makes it look a little better. But, they can try the old way if they can improve them.As for the important part, the gameplay, this game rocks. The gameplay is like any other Zelda game, the best. The story goes that your sister is kidnapped by a big bird, so you go with pirates and kill it eventually. It is an adventure game at it's best. You can sail around trying to get pieces of heart, and a new thing, the treasure charts which you can dig up buried treasure from the bottom of the ocean. If you don't want to do that, you can take pictures of people and try to collect all these little figurines. When you are not beating levels, you can go around taking over islands and collecting jelly and other cool stuff.Now as you play this game you may say it is similar to old Zelda games, like Phantom Ganon throwing the light balls at you and the same type of weapons. Old weapons like the Master Sword, the big hammer thing, your bow and arrow come abck, and bombs come back, ON BOATS! The sailing adds all new depth to this game, even though it gets annoying going back and forth before you get the song. New weapons like magic armor and shooting bombs from a boat.But, as in every agme, there is some bads. One, the sailing is one big pain the the you know what, and if you never get the song where you can warp anywhere, you will have to sail... and sail... and sail forever. But, I don't see anything else wrong, and there is absolutely NO GLITCHES, which makes this game a instant classic, the best GC game ever made, and well... who knows.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2004"}

Mario Kart 8 is the most fun I've had with a racing game since Double Dash. The reason is the anti gravity aspect, it is not just a gimmick but adds so much to the experience. It adds a strategic element when in anti gravity mode since bumping into fellow racers when in anti gravity gives you a speed boost. In some races I bumped into the racer in front of me and got the speed boost to go on and win the race. Riding across walls is super cool as well and gives you many route options depending on the track.The graphics are just OMG!!! The game is beautiful and everything just glistens and glows...it has to be seen in person the online videos do not do it justice.Visuals aside the racing controls are tight and responsive, the game is easy to pick up but you still need skills to master. This makes the game perfect for all ages and skill types.The tracks are all wonderful, the new and remastered. I almost had tears in my eyes playing rainbow road from n64.The online is the best online Nintendo has to offer. It is very easy to join races/battles and I have yet to have any major issues. The online should keep me busy for a long time.Now a lot of people are bashing the battle mode and while it is disappointing somewhat it has started to grow on me. I view the battle mode as a supplement to the core racing anyway so maybe I don't mind the battle mode as much.Overall this game is a BLAST to play and is a great game for all ages and skill levels. I mean how can you not like Mario Kart 8? It has that Nintendo polish that you can't get elsewhere and is most fun I've had in a while.If you have a Wii U Mario Kart 8 is a must and if you don't own the console it is a great time to pick that awesome Mario Kart 8 bundle. Mario Kart 8 is one of the best offerings on the Wii U only behind Super Mario 3D World. In my opinion of course.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2014"}

Malone","summary":"Be prepared","reviewText":"I've been playing the Japanese import for a couple of weeks. First, the bad news.- SH3 is short. Shorter than SH1 and SH2, at any rate. Both SH1 and 2 took me almost exactly 10 hours to complete my first time, according to the internal game clocks. SH3 took me 5 hours and 52 minutes. (Some have said that this is because SH3's internal game clock behaves differently, pausing at any time a cinema plays or the menu is opened. This is true of SH3. However, after personally testing the games myself, I have found that it's true of SH2 as well. SH3 is simply a shorter game.)- SH3 is constrictive. You're never really set free to explore a huge deserted town as in the previous two games. For most of the game you go from one enclosed location to another. The mall leads to the subway, which leads to the sewers, which leads to an office building, etc. When you finally do get out in the open, if you try to wander away from your goal and explore the town, your character will say \"I don't need to go this way,\" and automatically stop and turn around. Really lazy game design. Having the freedom to explore the empty town until you hit a physical road block of some kind was a hallmark of the previous SH games. Not so in this installment. Disappointing. This is surely the primary reason behind SH3 having a shorter play time. I definitely spent a few hours in SH1 and 2 exploring all of the streets and back alleys, checking every dead end for ammo and health items.Now, the good news.+ SH3 is scary. REALLY scary. I thought SH2 was quite mellow compared to SH1, more of a slow burn with a growing sense of dread rather than the aggressively oppressive atmosphere of the first game that got right in your face from the very beginning. SH3 returns to the original's oppressive style and ups the ante a notch or two.+ Fans of SH1 who were disappointed that SH2 had no direct connection to it will be pleased to know that SH1 and SH3 are very closely connected.+ Bosses are back, after a hiatus of sorts in SH2.+ (or - ?) SH3 is the most challenging SH yet. Monsters are aggressive and harder to kill. Ammo is very scarce. You'll want to rely on melee weapons usually and save ammo for bosses.+ Lots of different monster types. Lots of weapons. Lots of unlockable bonuses. Lots of replay value.If you can get past the short length and constrictive nature, it's a great and worthy addition to the Silent Hill series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"super mario craziness!","reviewText":"For me Super Mario 3D World is only a passable sequel to Super Mario 3D Land.  The biggest problem is that despite the staggering amount of ideas found throughout the game, most of them are only encountered a couple times, or never last long enough to leave much of an impression.  This makes the game feel less of an adventure and more like a series of mini games, which is what Galaxy 2 mostly suffers from.  The clear pipe concept is a new addition to the series, but it's actually overrated because it's never particularly fun for one thing (except for level 6-3 which uses the pipes more than the other stages) and also because it's hardly ever used extensively.  For 90% of the time you encounter clear pipes, they only serve a brief purpose of going to a new area which is basically a similar idea to the launching stars from the Super Mario Galaxy series.  Hopefully people are exaggerating when they say it's innovative- all you do is automatically go through pipes, and rarely collect items or dodge traps and enemies.  It's not very interesting, trust me.  Then again, something other than the standard green pipes is a nice change of direction for Mario I suppose.  I can understand people defending it entirely for this reason.Another problem is that many people assumed with a new Nintendo console we'd have an epic and original Mario adventure on an innovative scale like the Galaxy series, but 3D World falls incredibly short in that regard.  A sequel to a handheld game being advertised a a mega Mario adventure on Nintendo's relatively new Wii U console has to be considered a disappointment.  Not exactly a brilliant way to show off a new gaming system. The good news is that you can play as four different characters each with their own unique moves- Luigi jumps high, Toad moves fast, Princess Peach floats a great distance, and Mario is the most well-rounded character of the bunch.  This feature was first introduced in Super Mario Bros. 2 for the NES and, even though most of the stages in 3D World are easily beatable regardless of the character (which could be considered a flaw as well, since it means these levels weren't designed with each characters strengths and weaknesses in mind) the choices in playable characters is a nice feature.While the cat suit is a unique suit that moves realistically to an actual cat, it's probably the most broken item in the Mario series due to the fact you can not only attack with it, you can also climb walls and skip portions of levels.  It's really fun to mess around with don't get me wrong, but it's also overused like mad since at least half of the stages in the game use it.  The \"double cherry\" concept where you have more than one Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess Peach on screen at the same time is somewhat enjoyable, but also distracting and often times confusing as well.  Too much of a good thing.  Also, small complaint, but the flagpole finish has been used way too often by this point, and I'd like to see Nintendo offer more in the way of variety and other options because jumping on a flagpole and being encouraged to reach the top is not only tiresome and overused, but needlessly nostalgic.  Maybe something like matching 3 mushrooms, flowers or stars like in Super Mario Bros. 3 would be a more interesting way to end a level in the next Mario title, or better yet, the flower roulette wheel from Yoshi's Island (a personal favorite of mine).  Or perhaps something else entirely.  Something other than the dang flagpole all the time.The one really bright spot is the music.  I'm someone who can live without most of the music in Mario games but Super Mario 3D World is a major exception.  The variety is astounding, but it's also the type of music never heard before in a Mario game.  Some people argue whether catchy music or more classical compositions are more appropriate for the Mario series but the truth is, what *really* matters is whether the notes are good or not.  In this case, the music is constantly terrific.  It's jazzy but not in an annoying and distracting kind of way like in Galaxy 2, but in a more upbeat and memorable way that fits well with the level themes.  The water levels jazzy music is amazingly good for example.  There's so many excellent theme songs in this game that it's ridiculous.  An *incredible* well-done job there.  Also the green star concept has returned.  You have to collect 3 green stars per stage to open up other levels later on.  It's important to try and make an effort to collect *all* of these so you can see all the levels the game has to offer.Now let me describe each level in specific detail.  I will rank the amount of enjoyment each level provides using a familiar 1-5 scale, and mention how difficult the stage is for me using \"easy, medium or hard\".  This is going to be fun!  Hope you like reading!  Please note that the rest of this review from here on out can be interpreted as major SPOILERS.  Please keep this in mind.  If you haven't played the game yet and don't want to know what happens, don't read the rest of my review.1-1.  Generic grasslands stage, first appearance of the cat suit, sparse enemy-wise, catch rabbits (2-easy) 1-2.  Underground stage with purple bricks, goombas, green koopas, a cool infinite 1-up secret, same underground music since the original SMB on the NES but of course remixed (2-easy).  Love how the sunlight shines through the cracks.  1-3.  Another grasslands level with piranha plants that recalls Yoshi Star Galaxy from Super Mario Galaxy 2 where you climb higher on generic building blocks, and a cloud world similar to the ones you experience in 3D Land is found here (2-easy).  1-A.  A room where you have to battle charging chucks, a returning enemy from Super Mario World (3-easy).  1-4.  Riding a big dinosaur creature (NOT Yoshi) through rings and across ramps over a river of water.  Too short but fun while it lasts.  It feels like a less adventurous version of the Manta Ray levels from Super Mario Galaxy due to lacking the adrenaline rush of surfing the big waves (4-easy).  1-5.  A carninal/palace type setting that's very colorful.  You have to jump on blue tiles and turn them yellow while climbing through the stage which is a clear Galaxy reference- magikoopas first appear here too (3-easy).  1-Toad.  This is the first of many Toad levels in the game where you're in a tiny cube-shaped geometrical maze building and you have to obtain all the green stars.  You will be constantly rotating the camera around to get a better view, believe me.  In fact you HAVE to rotate the camera.  This one consists of green platforms and it's painfully simplistic (1-easy).  1-Castle.  You basically have to toss soccer ball-like cannon bombs at goombas while jumping across easy platforms and raising building structures.  While Bowser's car chase battle is barely strategic here, it does intensify later on in the game.  Love the jazzy/heavy metal music combination of the two styles during the Bowser fight (4-easy).2-1.  Egyptian/sand themed level with big pecking birds as enemies, quirky-moving platforms that can be quite the intimidating spectacle at first, and a cool bonus stage with falling coins as the Super Mario Bros. 2 character select music plays here.  The violin music is great in the main area of the stage (4-easy).  2-2.  Beautiful nighttime and pink/purple platform setting with ambient piano.  Reminds me of Sweet Mystery Galaxy from Galaxy 2 in both level design and music.  The glowing debris particles provides beautiful eye candy.  Another cloud world as well (3-easy).  2-3.  Underground level surrounded by silver bricks where you can pick up and carry a piranha plant and make it munch/eat other enemies which honestly makes it comparable to using Yoshi.  A fine substitute to Yoshi.  Love the way you can walk behind walls and see nothing but the shadows of yourself and the enemies.  Can you say \"crumbling Bowser statue?\" (3-easy).  2-4.  The most popular level in the game due to it being the example level we've been seeing for months illustrating the cat suits abilities.  Grassland level with decent design- an improvement over the similar grass-themed levels in World 1.  Monty moles everywhere, and the underground portion's too brief (3-easy).  2-A.  Battle 3 large monty moles (2-easy).  2-B.  Battle a variety of enemies in succession (4-medium).  2-5.  A pink Barbie doll-type level.  Very straight forward with the ability to collect the double cherries that I mention in paragraph 3.  Platforms comparable to skateboard ramps but it's a dull level without the use of the double cherries.  Makes me think it's a deliberately unspectacular level designed just so Nintendo can sell the double cherry concept (2-easy).  2-Castle.  Scrolling diagonal tank level with bullet bills and smashable crates where you have the ability to shoot cannonballs wearing a suit.  Cool concept.  Boom Boom fight identical to 3D Land's except he turns invincible sometimes (3-easy).3-1.  Straight forward snow level with snowman enemies, ability to pick up and toss snowballs at enemies, ride iceskate-shaped snowmobiles, knock out goombas riding in snowmobiles and chase rabbits.  Winter music is heroic and memorable (4-easy).  3-2.  A scrolling grassland level where you have to jump over (or climb with the cat suit) upright-moving gates.  The big band music is somewhat inappropriate for such a stage, but still a pretty good theme.  You encounter donut lifts later on (2-easy).  3-3.  A ghost house.  LOVE the violin classical music.  Floating couches can be found, as well as a cube-shaped rotating green star room that's enough to make you dizzy!  Boos and big boos, library setting in the background- surprised the books don't fly off the shelves!  Love the giant mirror, falling escalator steps and the surprising fake flagpole at the end (4-easy).  3-4.  A short timer level where you have to jump across platforms that resemble a cake with one or more pieces missing while collecting 10-second timer-increasing clocks like in Galaxy 2.  Avoid piranha plants and goombas, find another cloud bonus and search for more catchable rabbits.  It's too short (3-easy).  3-Toad.  Less generic than the Toad cube house in World 1 but still easy (2-easy).  3-A.  Defeat 3 magikoopas (1-easy).  3-5.  Beach level with goombas floating on rafts- more jazz music that's even better than the music found in 3-2.  LOVE how the music changes to aquatic when you're underwater and avoiding spiked puffer fish.  The sunken ship background while flowing through clear pipes is *unbelievably* pretty (4-easy).  3-6.  Fast-paced running/jumping Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario Kart-type level with speed boosts and ramps and making sure you cross donut lifts and avoid piranha plants with care (5-medium).  3-7.  More jazzy instrumentation.  Unique level in appearance- Autumn-like setting with brown platforms, shallow water, bee enemies, electrical amp enemies from Super Mario Galaxy 2.  The waterfall portion is effectively atmospheric.  Love how you jump inside the waterfall in one part and move around on those returning left/right green arrow platforms from Super Mario 3D Land.  Avoid the rolling caterpillars!  A nice challenge of a stage (4-medium).  3-Castle.  You have to ride a train avoiding homing bullet bills  (some of them big) and avoid floaty-type enemies.  The battle with the female boomerang-tossing Boom Boom and her clones is easy but the level itself is hard (5-hard).  3-B.  A carnival level where you have to battle a purple snake- this is famous and familiar due to all the previews of the game showing it constantly.  Climb on top of the cymbal-like platforms attached to the heads of smaller snakes that pop out of the ground while avoiding boulders (3-medium).4-1.  A sandy level where you have to climb across platforms avoiding/defeating purple ant-like clingy enemies that can walk around platforms (Metroid Prime 2 influence no doubt).  Later on you have to bounce on top of super-sized ants to avoid dropping into the spikes below (3-easy).  4-2.  A beautiful jungle theme with pink-headed vined piranha plants slithering out of walls, ceilings and floors like snakes.  Strange level, but awesome in appearance.  The green platforms mixed with purple lava (or dark matter) is a sight to behind (3-easy).  4-A.  Simply throw boulders into the lava (2-easy).  4-3.  Similar to Beat Block Galaxy from SMG2 with the disappearing platforms.  You have to avoid boomerang brothers.  The level is bland and derivative except for the long slide at the end which makes the challenge go up a tad (3-easy).  4-4.  Grasslands stage with bounceable platforms and spinys.  Fun but very easy except for the enemy-populated area near the end (2-easy).  4-B.  A series of easy tasks- bouncy grassland platforms, running up a ramp, being chased by big homing bullet bills, avoiding the dropping thwomps, riding across swingable platforms, avoiding rolling spiked logs, etc.  Medium challenge due to so much taking place.  Admittedly it can seem like an overwhelming series of incoherent chores until you get the hang of it (4-medium).  4-5.  Stone structure level where you must avoid rolling spiked logs, climb ramps, turn blue panels yellow, deal with swinging platforms with rolling spiked logs on top of them (VERY tricky part here if you're too slow) (4-medium).  4-Castle.  Disappointingly short level with boulders you can pick up (like in 4-A) and toss them at stacked goombas walking around and very little in the way of threats.  Giant boulder boss is fun but way too easy (2-easy).5-Toad.  Toad ghost house-themed cube level with trippy and awesome music.  Collect the green stars.  I can tell these type of levels are getting more elaborate with each one (3-easy).  5-1.  Beach level with green koopas and charging chucks.  Memorable jazzy beach music like in 3-5.  You can experiment with a wide variety of power-ups including koopa shell, goomba and boomerang brother constumes which are all really fun to use.  The rainbow-colored underground floor panel segment is cool, as is the dinosaur water ride.  The variety is really solid (4-easy).  5-2.  A carnival castle level with upbeat carnival music and a dark cloudy background which makes the level unusual to admire.  You have to swing across colorful panels that basically serve as vines like in Donkey Kong.  The piranha plant merry-go-round is neat to see (2-easy).  5-3.  100 seconds to grab green stars/reach flagpole.  Really short and bland with very little danger (1-easy).  5-A.  A room filled with charging chucks.  Easy and short (2-easy).  5-4.  Grassy level with a beautiful shade of yellow due to a sunset in the background.  Avoid fuzzies between clear pipes and more purple ants.  The second half is better with rotating platforms and a wide open grassy/bushy Zelda-like section chasing rabbits and avoiding a trail of coin-carrying ants (2-easy).  5-5.  Underground bob-omb level with rotating platform rabbit chases, and having to toss bombs at stacked goombas to create explosions and open new areas and secrets.  Simplistic floor panel puzzle (3-easy).  5-6.  Flippable blue/red panels from 3D Land and Galaxy, electrical round currents return from the Galaxy series too.  Really unique platform jumping puzzle can be found here that involves properly rolling a boulder to a location at the bottom in a screen that resembles the original Mario Bros. arcade game from the mid 80's.  Pretty fun level despite being generic and familiar (3-easy).  5-7.  Weird robotic snapping-type square enemies that are pesky but can be picked-up and carried, or used to bounce on top of as a way to reach higher areas.  Homing torpedoes, lava and crumbling bridges are a few of the dangers found within- avoid being detected by Bowser's spotlight as much as you can!  Not technically a castle level but it sure feels like one- the torpedoes definitely boost the challenge but it's fun (5-hard).  5-Castle.  Avoid upright square-shaped spiked platforms that flip forward on the path you're walking on as well as charging chucks which is basically the entire theme of the level.  Eventually the platforms alter the way they move and there's a clever green star that's very tricky to grab later on- very tricky Nintendo!  Clever boss fight too (a giant spiky square-shaped upright-moving platform like the rest of them you see throughout the level, but this one's strategic with a weak spot.  Fast movements and accuracy are requirements to conquer it) (5-hard).6-1.  Finally a level that really takes advantage of the clear pipes!!  Popular preview level too, so I already knew what it was like- dodge fuzzies in pipes, a cloud level where you have to pick up a piranha plant and eat enemies with it as you race towards the end, etc.  Clear pipes are everywhere in this stage and it's pretty cool (3-easy).  6-2.  That eerie violin music from the ghost house in 3-3 returns however the concept here is to walk across a broken ship while absorbing a depressing tone overall.  Bullies from Super Mario 64 return.  Such annoying enemies they are too!  If you're not familiar with bullies, they make you bounce backwards when you bump into them which can be quite the hassle when all you're trying to do is avoid them.  This entire level is like a radically different perspective on the Super Mario World sunken ship stage.  The uniqueness of this stage gives it major points (4-easy).  6-3.  The craziest setting for a Mario game yet- a castle... but not any ordinary/redundant castle.  A Chinese pagoda castle!  With gongs and red sheets hanging across the walls in the background!  It's sort of maze-like where you have to hit switches to open/activate doorways and stairways while unintentionally releasing goombas.  After a while you go outside to the rooftop while hearing crickets chirping in the night background, and you use propeller blocks from Super Mario 3D Land to spin around and collect green coins and stars located in tricky spots while avoiding thwomps.  Eventually you arrive to a place where you have to avoid more rolling spiked logs (this time even trickier than before).  There's even a boomerang brothers suit.  Favorite level in the game (5-medium).  6-4.  Purple dark matter surrounds gated platforms that you have to walk across in addition to more colorful swingable vine-like panels and snake-resembling piranhas coming out of walls- the isometric design of this level makes it easy to miss where you need to go which can result in several unnecessary deaths.  The raft ride is too much fun to end so soon (3-medium).  6-A.  A clever boss fight involving a bully but colored gray and much bigger.  The clear pipe strategy is pretty cool and had me stumped for a little while.6-5.  A snow level with some really bizarre enemies; one a cloud that blows gusts of wind and subsequently blows you off the path and two, some kind of sidestepping brick foe (perhaps a miniature thwomp).  More snowmobile riding fun around the icy ponds avoiding snowmobile-riding goombas.  Beautifully created level.  This is a tricky level for a few reasons, mainly the wind-blowing clouds, slippery snowmobile controlling toughness, accidentally taking damage from slippery goombas on ice, a VERY tricky and short-timed green star area using the snowmobile, and a part where you can easily fall to your death if you don't properly time the rising wind (5-hard).  6-6.  A drab (brownish) setting where you climb the outside of a building using cloud platforms and make your way up higher.  Bullet bills occasionally make it hard since it's sometimes confusing knowing where to go (3-easy).  6-7.  A climbing/scrolling level that's sort of scary because of the approaching black mass (that sort of resembles a swarm of bees) that can instantly be the end of your life if you fall too far behind.  The closing trash-compactor like platforms at the end are quite tricky too.  I like the fluttering winged dry bones (4-medium).  6-B.  A series of snowball (or baseball) tossing tests to acquire a green star- one of them reminds me of basketball trampoline which is a creative idea for a Mario game.  The 2D ball-tossing thwomps room is fun too (4-medium).  6-Castle.  A scrolling stage where you have to toss bob-ombs to explode new areas and avoid fireball-shooting brothers.  Easy Boom Boom fight too (3-easy).  6-C.  A giant stone creature that reminds me of an identical-looking statue creature in the room before entering the snow area of Metroid Prime 3.  You have to avoid his pounding jumps and his round uh, rock bubbles? (2-easy).By the way I LOVE how frightening the world map looks in world 7.  Incredibly dangerous and threatening, as well as deceiving since it makes you believe it's the final world in the game but it's not.  7-1 (Castle).  When you first arrive, up ahead you will see fireball brothers shooting fireballs through clear pipes.  Eventually thwomps, stacked goombas, and generic clear pipes can be found.  It's boring and short (2-easy).  7-2 (Castle).  A top-down view in an underground stage.  Very similar to Galaxy 2's Boo Moon Galaxy.  You have to light blue panels yellow by walking on top of them while avoiding spinys and fireball-spitting piranhas.  Terrible stage (1-easy).  7-3 (Castle).  You have 100 seconds to run forward through rings, speed boosts, clear pipes, spikes... incredibly short but fun (4-easy).  7-4 (Castle).  The light blue matter that surrounds the stage is beautiful and reminds me of the Phazon in the final stage of Metroid Prime 3.  You have to climb across purple rock platforms with arrow-providing directions on top of them showing where you need to jump.  Expect to see flying dry bones, dangerous spiked logs rotating around, and being encouraged to push more bullies off the sides of the cliff (3-medium).  7-A (Castle).  Return of the boulder boss, this time much harder since you have to dodge fireballs that crawl on the ground AND fireballs that shoot in the air (4-hard).  7-B (Castle).  A return of the bully boss from 6-A.  This time he shoots blue fire (2-easy).  7-5 (Castle).  Climbing the inside of a glass building avoiding giant-sized thwomps, flying dry bones and magikoopas while surrounded by lava outside as heavy metal/slow moving music with a hint of Santana's mid 70's jazzy rhythmic period and particularly reminiscent of the song \"Dance Sister Dance\" serves as the main theme.  I LOVE it!  Anyway, guess what happens when you reach the very top?  You quickly have to run back down again to avoid an approaching cloud of dark matter (4-medium).7-6 (Castle).  Underground water stage with bloopers and purple fish with spiked logs.  A stone structure in the middle presents a dilemma for the player because it's hard to properly swim around the beautiful (but deadly) purple fish.  After this you're above ground temporarily to participate in a little koopa shell action and bounce around eliminating foes until you're underground again dealing with tougher fish due to an even tighter area compared to the fish-infested area in the beginning of the stage.  Love the flying fish near the flagpole finish (4-medium).  7-7 (Castle).  Intense lava-rising/lowering stage and avoiding a persistent type of fireball that shoots out of the lava and leaves a trail of hard-to-avoid fire.  Lots of fire dangers throughout this stage (5-hard).  7-Castle.  Another lava stage but this time with normal shooting lava balls (like the ones from the original NES Super Mario Bros.).  You will encounter boomerang brothers, spinning fireball rods, having to knock flame boulders into walls to open bridges, avoiding more of those upright-flipping square shaped platforms, hammer brothers... basically a VERY chaotic stage.  Love the cool \"James Bond meets heavy metal\" theme song during the Bowser fight.  The objective is to punch giant flaming boulders at Bowser's car while dodging fireballs and spike traps.  It's pretty hard.  REALLY awesome level overall (5-hard).  7-Toad.  This Toad level is really fun since it's the most challenging one so far- thwomps, conveyor belts, bullet bills... an abundance of obstacles with little room for error... yeah, best one yet (3-medium).The beginning levels of World 7 are sort of disappointing since those particular levels hardly ever match the intimidating fire-drenched presentation of the world map but the good news is that World 8's map has some catchy carnival-like music.8-1 (Bowser).  Expect to see spikes rotating on floors, flying dry bones, fireball brothers, and a cool setting with metal platforms above the sky.  I appreciate the detail of showing realistic raindrops dripping on the camera making it look like it's raining on our TV screen.  Mostly easy (3-easy).  8-2 (Bowser).  Flying fast-paced dinosaur-riding action across several patches of sky sand (yes, sandy skies!) avoiding goombas and wigglers.  Really fun.  Too bad the annoying hayride-like music from Super Mario 64 and again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Rolling Coaster Galaxy returns for this stage.  Worst. Music. Ever (5-easy).  8-3 (Bowser).  Platform-dominated level with barrel (cylinder) and Clockwork Ruins Galaxy-type wheel-shaped rotating platforms (from Super Mario Galaxy 2) but significantly toned down in difficulty and confusion in comparison to *that* extremely hard Galaxy (4-easy).  Bowser (Train Level).  A scrolling train level with long-necked birds, bullies, a fish tank (cool idea there) and swinging spiked logs standing in your way.  The female Boom Boom fight is surprisingly easy (2-easy).  8-4 (Bowser).  This level is made up of beautiful purple clouds with very dreamy Sweet Mystery Galaxy-like piano ambience and a similar concept in design- magical light blue portions of platforms that only become visible when you walk on them, giant thwomps, tricky placed rolling spiked logs and bullet bills.  Basically a Super Mario Galaxy ripoff with the floors and music, but it's fun at least (4-medium).  8-5 (Bowser).  In the first half you arrive to an underground water level where the water rises and lowers with huge spiked balls standing in your way.  You will ride a dinosaur in the second half, but unfortunately it's a horribly underused concept this time around- you ride him for what, 10 seconds?  Disappointing level overall. (2-easy).8-6 (Bowser).  Ghost house where you walk around inside a box costume with a ghost-destroying light attached to it.  You ride around on platforms, some of which are broken, and you're encouraged to make ghosts vanish the entire time.  It gets hard on the final platform ride due to so many ghosts appearing at once (2-medium).  Bowser Mystery Room (Level).  A series of 10 rooms with 10 green stars where you have to conquer several wall jumping skills that require fast movements and fancy accurate moves in order to be successful (4-hard).  8-7 (Bowser).  A lava stage where you have to make your way across by riding giant block-shaped platforms that literally flip back and forth across a path approximately every second.  You have to adjust/prepare for each flip accordingly because if not... down to your death you go.  Luckily there's a pattern to this.  Later on they become rectangular shaped.  This is *insanely* hard and requires absolute patience on the part of the player with an extra alert attention span.  Also you have to avoid fireballs that come out of the lava, crawl around on the ground, and leave a trail of fire behind (5-hard).  8-A (Castle).  A repeat of the 6-C boss, this time shiny bronze-colored and much faster.  Same strategy (4-medium).  8-B (Castle).  Repeat of 3-B boss with no noticeable differences (2-medium).  Bowser Final Castle Stage.  This is certainly a disappointment in both the level itself and the Bowser fight.  It begins on a rooftop with fireballs raining down from above (avoid them).  Soon you arrive to the Bowser fight.  It's a slow-moving scrolling climb up the outside of a building while wearing the cat suit making for a superhero-like (Spiderman) comparison.  You have to avoid Bowser whenever he appears on screen.  The second half of the battle is slightly harder in both avoiding Bowser's clones and the remainder of the climb to the top with the occasional twists and turns, but nothing too overwhelming, threatening or challenging.  POW!  So cheap!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

Unfortunately, I feel the campaign and multiplayer are both a step back from the other games.  My favorite thing about the series has always been the epic 30 minute online warzone matches.  And it's been stripped down to it's core.  It's still a very fun experience.  But gone are the mechs and jetpacks of Killzone 3.  You don't even level up.  Very basic stuff.

It's just a downright, Carjacking Romp. If you haven't played this game yet, you MUST play this before you play it's sequel GRAND THEFT AUTO: SAN ANDREAS.To be honest, I thought this game would be a terible game, Infact, I was avoiding buying this game. Man have I missed A LOT! Honestly, I's not that bad, to all of you &quot;uptight&quot; mom's.  Ofcourse the premise of the game is to steal cars, but it's still very tame for it's mature rating.Alright, first of all, the ability to just jump grab any car you want and just jump right in, is AWESOME, I mean it really doesn't matter, as long as it has wheels and doors, you can drive it. From Station Wagons to Stallions and Ambulances to Firetrucks.When you're in a Firetruck or a Policecar  can do these vigilante missions where you foil crooks, put out fires and rescue the injured.In this game there are 3 islands you can travel and roam in, irst of all there's Portland which is pretty much the same as New York. You get you're street reputation in Portland.Alright this game has it all, the violence, the story and even the hot chicks. And something that is really different is that the game is just enjoyable all the way through and you look forward to your next mission and you're always suprised and amazed by the bizarrely fun missions you have. From running away from the Triads is a Souped up Mafia car, to crrying a dead body to a car crusher, it's just all out F..U..N!The story evolves very well, and goes up as you would expect it, you start out as a lowly guy and work for Luigi, a pimp (to certain rights) and then, as your reputation gets better, and word starts to spread on your feats, you get contacted by Joey, Toni Cipnelli and Diablo himself. Wow, I want to play this game even more now that i'm writing a review about it.Oh, and the game has pretty much infinate replay value becasue of (1) it's length (by the time you beat it and star over again you won't remember most of the missions) and (2)Ther's just so much to do in between missions. From beating innocent civilians to &quot;'Jackin' some sweet wheels&quot; you can make a day out of it.(Honestly).Breakdown:Graphics: 15/10 Great, really crisp and really responsive, from busting up a car to shooting people...it looks real alright!Gameplay: 15/10 TONS of Fun, yet still simple. Of course it would deserve a 20, if you could crouch and commit drive by's.Fun: 25/10 This is THE best game EVER (well so far) you get to run around and kill hookers and civilians, and get to steal cars...it doesn't get much better than this.Difficulty: 10/10 can be a real &quot;toughy at times&quot;, especially when you're trying to take down an armored car, while tons of cops swarm around you..it's a real nail biter.Overall:65/40 what is there to say, just look at the total. haha.Alright first of all, Buy this game, then play it and the first time you get bored of the game (about 12-18 months after you get it, research Grand theft auto San Andreas, it looks awesome.This is esential to any teen's PS2 game library. It's really a lot of fun to play, no matter who you are. I mean anyone with a PS2 should and must own this game.

The player takes on the role of Captain Martin Walker the leader of a three man Delta Force team made up of 1st Lieutenant Alphanso Adams (a heavy gunner) and Staff Sergeant John Lugo (a marksman and translator whose fluent in six languages).The three are sent on a reconnaissance mission in the United Arab Emirates specifically to the city of Dubai which was devastated 6 months prior by a sandstorm. The objective on the surface is familiar territory for anyone who's ever played a third person shooter. The three man delta team is sent into a foreign country to locate survivors, deal with insurgents, and to find out the fate of the 33rd Battalion of the United States army which went missing while evacuating the city of Dubai.To achieve these goals the player will be able to engage in standard cover based third person shooter game mechanics. This means that the player will be able to use high tech weapons and vehicles. The player will also be able to use team based strategies to overcome enemies and a cover system to safely advance forward in situations where there's heavy fire.There are some very important things that set this game apart from others in its genre. The first one I'll discuss is this game's unconventional take on war. War in most third person shooters is treated as something fun, manly, and entertaining. Also the enemies aren't portrayed as much more than an effective way to test out different types of guns, knives, and bombs. This consistent static portrayal of enemies makes it easy to go through countless games in this genre without a second thought about torturing/killing enemies. This is not the case in spec ops. War is portrayed in a much more realistic and mature manner especially since the enemy is no longer a bunch of unimportant goons. In this game the enemy is portrayed as other human beings with thoughts, feelings, loved ones, whose life also has value.Another thing that sets this game apart from other third person shooters is the gripping storyline. It is filled with enough twists, turns, and moral dilemmas to keep even the most jaded gamer interested from the beginning to the end. Nothing is as simple as it first appears to be. In fact this story and the way it is presented is so effective you will have no choice but to turn on your brain and emotions and question if what you're doing is really the right thing or the wrong thing to do as you realize your actions as the leader has far reaching consequences for your character, his team, and the people around them. This deep-emotional storytelling also makes it possible for this game to have 4 possible endings.Also this game effectively uses weather and the terrain to provide both obstacles and a new way to engage enemies which adds a lot of flavor to the combat.I highly recommend this game. It is a breath of fresh air in an over-crowded genre that's becoming increasingly generic. This game is also visually stunning, with exceptional voice acting, and sound. It is definitely worth the money and the effort to play the game from the beginning to the end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2012"}

At times you feel like you are doing things for no apparent reason.- Controls can get unwieldy at times.

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Smaller yet still powerfull","reviewText":"When I first laid eyes on the new PS3, my thoughts and fears were the same as when the slim PS2 replaced the original PS2: \"will it still be as powerful, will it be as reliable, did they cut anything 'minor' without bothering to tell us?  Well, my fears were false.  It has been a true performer on all counts.  I bought two of these for my kids a few weeks ago (one of my older children is away at school).  They are having a ball playing games like Little Big Planet, Modern Warfare 2, and Madden.  I love the new slim profile. The same PS3 user interface remains.  Everything is still in the same place.  The only major changes appear to be a thinner power cord and the chassis is smaller and matte instead of big and shiny (although it still has a little weight to it).  I prefer the matte because once a smudge got onto the 80GB PS3, I was in for some rubbing.  And if it got scuffed (usually from a wayward controller when moving too fast to load a disk or traveling with the PS3), the attractive shiny finish took a nice hit.  Some other changes include the loss of the back primary power button, the lights on the front of the console now glow white instead of blue when on, although still red when off. The buttons are also round and the touch-sensitive power button on the front is now a soft push button.  The best change from our prior 80GB system is the 120GB hard drive in the base model and the price-drop that ushered it in.  Coming from the 80GB, the 120 is more than good enough for us and we have dozens of games.  My kids have been playing their PS3's nonstop.  We didn't encounter any heating issues with the smaller chassis and even after hours of nonstop game play, the system seems unfazed.  It's also quiet, even after hours of nonstop play.  Connecting to our protected WIFI router was easy, creating a Playstation account was easy, and playing online...ditto, also easy, and FREE.  We connected a bluetooth wireless earpiece to the system and the PS3 installed it quickly and with no issues.  HDMI output is amazing on high def sets.  We don't use the PS3 primarily for Blu-ray watching because we have a dedicated Blu-ray player, but it doesn't hurt to have options if the primary player is in use at any given time.  I also like that HD movies can be played on the PS3 in different formats.  If you have HD footage shot with a hard drive camera and don't have a Blu-ray burner, you can still burn disks capable of being played in the PS3. You can even play from USB drives.  That's a little much to go into detail here, but easy tutorials can be found with simple web searches. I have no regrets about trading up to the newer PS3.  Well, that's just my experience as someone going from the 80GB model to the slim 120GB.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

After all the Xbox 360's I kept buying only for them to die from the dreaded yet completely inevitable Red Ring of Death I knew that there would be not satisfaction with an 'upgrade' to a Xbone.But it was on sale today at Best Buy with this bundle for $450 and i guess i had too long of a day at work and just made a impulse buy.  So i get it home and yep after it completely failed to hook up to the first tv set for no fathomable reason I got it to finally turn on and produce a signal on the other tv set.  So then I plugged in the Internet password and it got all the way to 17% update completion before failing utterly as only a Microsoft Product ever truly can.I tried for an hour to get it to work looking up the steps on various Microsoft help boards.  Nothing worked and then it dawned on me.  Every last minute I waste on this abortion of a product is time away from my precious and much better and more powerful PS4.How is it that something far superior requires less effort?  And this isn't just some inherent Fanboyism.  I would be absolutely thrilled if i could plug this in and have it work.  If I wanted a struggle for a system to get up and running I woulda spent more money on a  gaming computer.I'm too old and far too stressed to bother ever having another Microsoft product allowed into my adobe.  They just don't work.  They are poorly designed.  They are way too fragile and the least bit of modern specifications that attempted to be placed on the silly thing will just make it do a complete nothing.Who needs to spend $20 million to fly for a week up in space to stare into the black abyss of nothing when they can blow $500 on a Xbox One; plug it in and see it do less than the vacuum of space itself?But I don't blame Xbox division of Microsoft.  They've been foisting their garbage on millions and millions of us worldwide.  I guess I coulda lit a match to a stack of twenties and watched the same $509 go up in flames (that includes the 12 month Gold Membership-another scam of the deepest order) and had the same empty feeling as unboxing this spectacular failure.The only  thing that has brought me more unmitigated disappointment was the 4 WCW pay per views I got sucked into watching back during the glory days of the mid 90s.  Or the time I blew $12 on a Motley Crue greatest hits c.d.  Or when I got a subscription of Esquire and compounded that idiocy by accidentally getting the auto-renewal 'feature'.  Or the $90 I spent for a day at a Disney Water park on it was cold & wintery in mid-April last year.  Or the $6.50 each time I go see a Ryan Reynold's movie at the cineplex.But at least most of the time I learned from my brazen foolish.  Why I did it today is a lesson I shan't soon forget and sadly I shan't soon figure out either.

After waiting 3 years we finally get the ending to one of the best video game series ever created. The biggest question that people have is if the game is enough to stand on its own out of the other next generation games. The answer is yes, so let's get down to it.The game's story picks up right after God of War II with Kratos riding on the back of Gaia climbing Mount Olympus. The game starts out on the back of Gaia with Kratos fighting hordes of monsters (and learning the controls). The game starts out more epic than ever with an epic boss fight with Poseidon. Giant water serpents come up and try to kill Gaia, so not only do you have to kill Poseidon, but you have to protect Gaia as well. The boss fights are bigger and more epic than ever with Titans that are miles high (fighting Cronos is the most epic of all) and you really feel like your taking these beasts down with satisfying results.I have to first talk about how the game looks. Yes, God of War III is probably the best looking game made to date and it really shows on every aspect. The sweeping camera angles, the high-resolution textures and models. The gorgeous lighting effects, and everything just feels updated and like it should on the PS3. You can see the pores and details in every characters, the animation is more fluid, the combat even feels better and more fluid, especially if you just played the God of War Collection. I can't really describe just how beautiful this game is. You can see and feel the passion and detail every artist put into the game from the creatures, levels, and even small things like blood, scrapes and nicks on metal just everything.The combat is what has the biggest upgrades. No longer are you confined to having all your magic items come from your magic meter. There are a ton more weapons (four in total) to get, and each weapon has its own magic attack instead of collecting them separately. The Blades of Exile (yes the name has changed again) have the Spartan Army attack, the Nemean Cestus have a pounding attack, Hades Hooks that let you summon different creatures, and a whip type weapon that sends electric shocks. All the weapons are similar to the Blades of Exile, and the Blade of Olympus is now used during Rage of Sparta mode (yes it's changed and everything turns black). There is now an item meter which is used for your bow, Helios head, and Hermes shoes. All these items sound crazy, but let me explain.The bow lets you set certain things on fire and is mainly used during the beginning of the game, but not so much later on. The Helios head is used to reveal secrets and blind enemies, and the Hermes shoes are used during wall running sections. The grapple hook still exists, but all of these changes let you use all your items and weapons all the time, and don't rely so much on just magic. Some other changes to combat were made so everything feels more fluid and you never have to stop fighting no matter where you are. You can evade in the air, there is now a grapple attack that pulls you towards your enemy in the air or on the ground. The combat system is just super fun to use now, and all the additions perfect the combat system and make a fitting end to the trilogy.The QTE's are still in tact, but with a bit of a change. They appear on the edge of the screen according the controller layout so you can now watch what's going on. Using your peripheral vision is see these really helps keep you drawn in, so you don't have to concentrate so much on the buttons. It is a little confusing at first, but after a while you will get used to it. The QTE's are also better placed especially during boss fights. You really feel like your making the big kill this time around with a new camera angle that lets you see in a POV of the enemy your pummeling or in Kratos' view. This adds to the cinematic excitement and brutality of that game.Another thing I need to talk about is just how much more brutal and explicit the game is. The gore is more detailed with guts hanging out, cuts being visible where you slashed an enemy, skin stretching when heads are pulled, tendons popping, veins breaking etc. All this is visible thanks to the power of the PS3 and is really makes you wince in sympathy. The game even has a more explicit sex mini-game that is about mid way through with Aphrodite. Instead of just panning over to a table with a vase you see two topless women talking about what Kratos is doing to Aphrodite and it is both hot to watch and funny.The puzzles in the game are what you would expect from a God of War game: Clever, fun, and unique. Just like all God of War games some puzzles are an entire level with little puzzles within that, and Daedalus's labyrinth is one example. They aren't as confusing as the last two games, and are easier to figure out, but just as clever, and some puzzles are now part of the environment so timing and speed are of the essence.While there are a lot of game changes like the combat, additional weapons, and even Icarus' Ascension (which is a flying section where you dodge falling debris), the game stays true to the series. Everything is just bigger, badder, and meaner but it does have a few slight flaws. The ending story is cut a bit short, there aren't enough epic boss fights, and the difficulty is highly unbalanced. These are really all I could find, but they aren't necessarily flaws. If the game were a bit longer, and those three issues didn't exist it would get a 10. The game is perfect except that little tic-tac sized piece that you feeling is missing and can never pin it. The game has high replay value to unlock trophies, challenges, costumes, and there are a ton of making-of videos for die-hard fans to watch.I just can't describe the improvements of this game unless you play it yourself. It is probably the best PS3 game out there so far, and is so enjoyable and chock full of excellence that it's almost too much to contain. The amazing scale, beauty, and vast improvements make the game worth a purchase tenfold. I just wish this weren't the end of Kratos' adventures or is it...ULTIMATE EDITION: If you pre-ordered a copy or can still find one floating around, and want to shell out an extra $40 you can get the Ultimate Edition. It includes a very detailed Pandora's Box, a code to get the God of War Trilogy OST, the Blood and Metal soundtrack, an hour length making-of video, and  full color art book. The package is a bit disappointing since the box is made of hard plastic and not die-cast metal, the soundtracks were a pain to get during launch day since the site was bogged down and wouldn't load half the time. The Blood & Metal OST is pretty disappointing since it's nothing special. It has a couple of big names like Trivium and Killswitch Engage, but only three of the songs on the album were any good. I also wished the soundtracks came in physical CD format, but digital is fine. The making of video is filmed like a History Channel documentary and can be a snooze fest for hardcore fans who already know all about the game. The Trilogy OST is fantastic and is probably the best part of the whole package along with the detailed art book. Is it worth $40? Sure, if you're a hardcore fan otherwise pass.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00007KUU8","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"The Best Version of an already Great Game","reviewText":"If you haven't played this game before, you don't know what you're missing.  Metal Gear Solid is a video-game superstar, a true original.  The story follows super-agent Solid Snake as he infiltrates an oil tanker to uncover a hidden weapons program, and then another agent Raiden visits the site where the tanker sank and further unravels the conspiracy.  The game focuses on stealth, as you sneak past the guards on to rescue the president and save the world.  And yet there are strong elements of action, puzzle, exploration and pure experimentation that make Metal Gear such a wonderful experience.The original MGS2 was a masterpiece, and it is included, every part of it, within this new version. The plot is Hollywood-quality, the graphics are still amazing, the music and sounds are all top notch, but what I remember the most is the incredible detail in the game, from the realistic way in which guards and items react, to what you can try or what you can use, it always seems to be in the game.  There are dozens of ways you can hide from the guards, distract them, or take them out.  Most every object in the game has a purpose and use in the game, but you aren't required to use everything to succeed.  This isn't the kind of game that forces you to play it's way.  Like Grand Theft Auto or Tony Hawk, Metal Gear offers an open world that you can go back to and experiment over and over.  Play your way, and the game gives you the tools to do it.\"Substance\" refers to the extra missions that make up the meat of this new version.  These missions are very clever and satisfying.  They break down Metal Gear into its essence with short objectives and tiny areas that you can play quickly, concentrating on your performance.  They are usually puzzle-oriented, and rarely focused on pure-action (put action is in there).  VR missions take place in small virtual-reality levels and focus on game fundamentals with simple, focused missions.  Alternate missions take place on the Tanker or Plant from the main game, have broader missions objective and free you to experiment in your methods, kinda like playing the main game.In these missions you work on improving your scores and getting First Place in each level.  Bonuses like \"Stealth\" and \"No-kill\" add to the challenge by rewarding you for playing a certain way.  You can also play through these missions as different characters, like Raiden in a Ninja suit, or Snake in a Tuxedo, ala 007.  Each character's missions rearrange the targets and increase the difficulty of the missions, so you can play through your favorite missions again in slightly remixed versions.  Overall, there are over 500 missions! Specifically, they are:WEAPONS TRAINING:  VR Missions focusing on specific weapons and their strengths. For example, the pistol levels are mostly stationary target ranges, the automatic rifle missions are mostly run-and-gun, the Nikita missions have you guiding missiles through mazes, etc.STEALTH MISSIONS:  Pure Metal Gear, these VR missions require you to move from start to finish without anyone seeing you.  They usually focus on specific tactics, like hanging from rails or crawling in air ducts.ELIMINATION:  These are repeats of the stealth VR missions, except you must eliminate all the guards to win.  This is different from later elimination missions because no one can see you doing it, not even your victims, so you end up playing like a silent assassin.1ST PERSON:  These VR missions take place exclusively in 1st person mode, so the controls are different and the radar is often missing.  Mission objectives alternate between killing all the guards (watch out for the cloaked guards!) and bomb disposal.  The best missions take place in the dark.VARIETY:  Some truly outlandish missions that defy words.  Protect a bag of curry with a sniper rifle, boss-battle with a giant guard with Godzilla fins in his back.  My favorite is the sneaking mission with a bunch of Zilla-sized guards.  Very cool.BOMB-DISPOSAL:  Alternate missions that take place on the tanker and Big Shell, these bombs in tricky locations, and you have to find them before time runs out, while guards are patrolling around you.  Two different kinds of bomb detectors give some variety, and later levels are a huge pain.ELIMINATION:  Unlike the elimination mode in VR, in these missions you can go postal and kill all the guards in a blaze of glory, without worrying about hiding.HOLD-UP MODE:  This mode has you take out each guard by sneaking up behind them and holding them up, one-by-one.  It surprising fun, one of my favorite mission types.PHOTOGRAPH:  This sounds simple- sneak around and take a digital picture - but there is usually some sort of mystery or puzzle involved, like \"Take a picture of the murderer\" kind of thing, where they give you visual clues and you have to figure out what to take a picture of.  Nice, if not very exciting.SNAKE TALES:  You play these missions as Snake, in Big Shell, as an answer of sorts to all the complaints about Raiden in the original game.  No radar or Codec either, so the levels are very difficult.  My only complaint is that these Tales recycle a bunch of existing Alternate Missions, just strung together with a plot, and the plot itself is told entirely through text, so I wasn't that interested or excited by it.BOSS SURVIVAL:  Play one boss after another until you die or you defeat them all.  This features all the bosses in the game, seven total.SKATEBOARDING: Yep, just like it sounds.  There are two levels, one for Snake and one for Raiden, and you complete tricks and objectives, much like Tony Hawk.  Not nearly as good or detailed as THPS, but still good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2003"}

The amount of options, from \"Road to the Show\" mode as a player or franchise mode with a fantasy draft and everything in between is available. It is very similiar to a RPG experience like Dragon Age. You can just keep playing and if you start as a Rookie level player, you can continually add the level to the amount of control you have over your players. It's the type of game that you can continue to work on for several years, not just until next season's update releases.All of would get the game 5 stars ...

You are more likely to rob a HR off the wall than to get the easy out at second on a fielder's choice.The pitching - in a nutshell - If you time the meter perfect, it will probably miss a little. If you don't get the meter just right, it will miss alot. And just for fun, the umpire will call pitches clearly in the strike zone balls to \"add realism\". I was doing my warm up pitches in a particular game and hit the meter perfect everytime. 4 of the pitches were out of the zone.The hitting - It's just hard. Really, really hard. Through my first 10 games, Michael(All Star, Golden Glove - best lead off man in the NL)Bourne had 1 hit. In 45 AB's, 1 hit. A broken bat single at that. Not all K's, just ground ball outs. One after the next. Basically, default setting is you suck.The AI on the other hand is super human. Over and over, I'll get a count 0-2 only to watch the batter foul off pitches, NEVER protect the plate (the ump does that for them) and usually ends up in a hit or HR. After the first couple of games, I started an unofficial tally. The AI hit at least one HR, almost always multi run, in the first 3 innings of 12 consecutive games. That is not a coincidence. You just can't get the outs. Oddly enough, my seem fantasy drafted team went 13-2 in simulated games.That is simply not realistic or more importantly fun.But like the title says, there are sliders. I am still tweaking them after about 15 played games (30 total for my franchise). I'm having a hard time finding that sweet spot. I don't want to lose 15-3 every game, but I also don't want Jay Bruce to hit 80 HR's.Fun is to be had, but it takes some patience at the plate to fall in love with this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2010"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

This one definitely accomplishes that feet.Story: continued from Mass Effect 1, you continue to try and stop the Reapers from emerging. A new race called the Collectors has emerged and are abducting human colonies and you must explore the galaxy once again looking for clues to learn what is going on and try and stop it.Gameplay: Still a 3rd-person shooter. Combat has changed in that there are no more grenades and different weapon classes have emerged. You have to upgrade in order to carry heavy weapons. There are 6 weapon classes now, including the new sub-machine guns. Ammo is now used as well. Healing is now done atomically and you can't use medi-gel except to revive a fallen squad member. Exploring the galaxy for side quests is similar but the main difference is now the mako is gone and you manually scan a planet and launch probes instead of searching it on the ground. You have a scanner that can be upgraded. You also have fuel once you are in a solar system and you need to refuel often and buy more probes if you want to explore other systems. There are tons of side missions as before and a lot more plot-advancing missions. New characters are introduced into your party as well as some characters from ME1. The new Illusive Man is an awesome and mysterious character. Your character alignment can be altered through conversation as in ME1, but you now have interrupting options that can be either good or renegade. Game decisions will affect the ending and squad members as well. Each squad member has a mission they want you to do for them that if done, lets you gain influence on them and will allow you to further level them up. Your ending can be imported into ME3 so choose your ending wisely.Conclusion: Graphics are better than ME1, controls are easy to execute. The story is once again engaging and the game is not a disappointment. It is ranked as 3rd best reviewed game on the Xbox 360 and 14th overall. Pick this one up and prepare for the conclusion to the trilogy in ME3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

I can justify it for myself because I think and pray a lot about my game choices, and this one leans on the unrealistic/harmless side.

My only problem with this game is that I have trouble joining other games since all the ones that display for joining are always full, and no one would join my game when I created one. It would be nice to have a search feature that would allow you to find players of a certain skill level or objective in mind and ensure you can find an open game. They need to work on the search feature for the multiplayer function. The other complaint I have is that the city size is too small. It would be nice if they added a single player option where you could use the entire map for your city. That being said, I think the gameplay is pretty good and a lot of fun. I have found it to be quite challenging if you don't have other people making cities nearby. It would be nice if I could successfully join a game in progress so I could assist/get assistance from my neighbors. It's really hard to please your city with everything they want without having some support from neighbors. The only solution I had was just creating five cities and trying to balance resources to help each city out; this wuold be a lot more fun if it was other people and not me doing all the work. I think if they can improve on the search features to ensure I can join a game, I'll change the review to 5 stars as most of the game is pretty great. I'm seldom away from internet so that wasn't really an issue for me either.****************************************************UPDATE: Starting to understand all the hate.

Roman","summary":"THIS is how you do a survival game.","reviewText":"What can I say about Dead Space? They did everything right when making a survival horror game, and didn't go and turn it into another action game with horror elements. Nearly everything about Dead Space is perfect. You have excellent graphics, one of the best soundtracks to set the atmosphere, a story with a slight twist at the end, and even some fun trophies to go for. I took a chance with buying Dead Space before I even played it, but after seeing one gameplay video, I was sure I'd made the right choice.You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer aboard a ship out in space with just a few other people. Once you go to investigate another ship, all hell breaks loose. Within minutes of entering the ship, blood thirsty monsters/aliens/zombies (you find out later what they are) attack your party, and you're left to get out of there while getting to the bottom of what happened and why. It seems that everyone aboard the ship is dead, what with all the dead bodies and crew logs stating who's deceased, but there's someone else onboard who wants you to stay.While the game's very much survival-based, there's some action to it, since you'll be blasting enemies to pieces, literally. Until you upgrade your weapons a lot, you'll have to shoot off the monsters' limbs. Yeah, just shooting them in the head or body isn't gonna work here. Each weapon has a secondary attack mode- your main weapon, the Plasma Cutter, being able to shoot rounds vertically and horizontally, so one way is good for legs and the other for arms or tentacles. There aren't a lot of other weapons, but enough to add variety and be practical. Isaac can carry 4 at a time, and you switch using the d-pad. If an enemy manages to grab you, mash the X button until you get a cool scene of Isaac bashing them aside, or lose your head. Your inventory is also limited, though as you progress and upgrade your armor, you can carry more. There's also a Safe system where you can move items from your inventory to a Safe located at any Store found on the ship. These are spread out quite a bit, and often times you'll be needing to conserve ammo and health packs as a result.Like I said, nearly everything here is perfect. Get this- if you click the right thumbstick in, Isaac will project a blue light that guides you to your next objective at any point in the game. This sounds like it'll make things easier, but just because he shows a path doesn't mean that it's safe, and a lot of the time there'll be hordes of monsters coming after you. What's great about the enemies is that they never, ever pop out of nowhere like in other games. They use the vents in the ship to travel, and if you see a vent somewhere, there's a chance that they'll get you through there, or use it to get the drop on you from another one. I got surprised a few times when they used that tactic, and got to enjoy a number of unique death scenes. And trust me when I say that there are A LOT of different death animations for Isaac. There's not much music, but more ambiance that makes you wonder what's going on in any given room. There's always a sound of some kind, sometimes the ship, sometimes a creature near or far. I love it.The only problems I have with this game that almost bumped it down to 4 stars are that it's not that challenging, even on 'Impossible' difficulty, I wanted the game to go on longer than it was (I beat it in about 10 hours on the first play through), and of course the turret scenes. I personally hate turret parts in games because of how forced they seem, and how they ruin the flow of things. That tradition continues here, and everyone that complains about it has the right to because of how random it is. Luckily, there are only two of these areas, one being where you shoot asteroids and the other being an enemy fight, but they're so annoying! I hope the turrets are gone in Dead Space 2. Watching a video of them before playing the game, they didn't look too bad, but once I actually got there, I realized that all the complaints weren't kidding. Oh, I do also have to say that the wall creatures have one of the most annoying voices ever. They weren't scary, just plain annoying- so much that I'd turn the sound down whenever I'd see or hear them. They do this stupid sound any time they attack, and they attack a lot. Argh!Dead Space was the first non-downloadable game I beat for the ps3 and I loved every minute of it [that didn't have a turret]. Had I owned a ps3 when the game first came out, I would've bought it for full price back then- it's that good. Please buy this game new and support it so we can get more quality titles like this! Dead Space has the unfortunate luck of being more popular to buy used, so the developers aren't getting anything out of it. Here's hoping for more from this excellent franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2010"}

The game is a lovely mix of Fable and World of Warcraft, and works perfectly. I can't attest to the difficulty as I'm playing on Casual, but the enemies don't seem so hard unless 6 of them gang up, which does happen. Killing monsters fills up a \"Reckoning\" gauge which allows you to enter an almost godly state in which combat is slowed and attack is increased. I played the demos for Kingdoms of Amalur, Asura's Wrath and Final Fantasy XIII-2. I chose this one after rejecting the others, and I would not regret that decision. I don't bother reviewing games I don't like, this game is truly worthy of your attention and your money.UPDATE May 27, 2012Sunk about 100 hours in trying to get all the achievements. This is the only game I have cared enough about to get all the achievements. Currently at 49/50 missing the one for beating the game on hard. The enemies seem to be much harder than on casual; the trick seems to be potions and dodging/special attacks. Playing on hard has caused me to explore the combat system more than I did on causal.

The one thing that stood out to me was all the hardcore mmo players claiming the game sucked. And to find out it was because the game is truly different from other games out there. The reasons most people hate mmo's is because of a few things. Player griefing being top on the list. I have never pvped in any mmo fairly. In 10 years i never once got to play against another player the same lvl as me. I have always been 1 or 2 hit killed by some jerk 10 lvl's or more than me. This made me hate mmo pvper's. My first games were pvp first person shooters and i love them.So in this game if your new to mmo's, take the time to read up on things. The players are already putting together some great guides and fan sites. That's what i did and it helps alot. Once you get into the game you are in for a treat. This game is for me the best mmo i've ever played. I can't remember the last time a game kept me playing till the wee hours of the morning. The combat and storyline are the best i've seen.  Everyone in the game seems really helpful pretty much because they have to. Every race and profession are really fun to play.The one big thing you should do if you've played mmo's before is this..Leave behind how other mmo's work. If you don't you will get frustrated over silly things. Questing and pvp is not the same here. The game really wants you to explore the world. For me that's a great thing. The game have something called vistas to find and get to. I have hit every one that i've found. You get a nice cut scene of your find. You get xp for everything you do. This is really a game about the journey and not rushing to get to max lvl. But of course you have people in this game doing just that. I feel sorry for them. They are missing exploring the world. I really will never understand players like this. You find them in all games. Whats the best class, Whats the best weapon,Whats the best build.

I was gonna buy this game regardless, b/c I love the DC Universe, especially Wonder Woman and Super Man. When I started playing this game I chose to play it in story mode. I of course was the DC Universe and in the beginning I was just excited to play w/ all of my favorite characters and it was intense b/c I didn't know what to expect, but then I started to get a little bored, I'm just a casual gamer and wanted some fun. I think this game is good but it could have been better. I mean the graphics aren't the hottest, the cut scenes are cool, but the fighting gets a little corny, the moves are okay, but it seems to be much slower compared to the AI's combos are moves. My hands and wrist began to get tight...ouch!!! However this is a solid game, regardless I would have purchased it b/c I love DC Universe, but if your not a real fan of MK or DCU you might not wanna spend $60 on this game, maybe get it used or just rent it. The next thing I'm gonna do is go online and then it may get intense again.thanks for reading...good solid game, just gets boring sooner than most!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"The successor to \"Super Mario World\" has finally arrived after two decades!","reviewText":"The successor to \"Super Mario World\" has finally arrived after two decades.  With \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", for the first time since the N64, Nintendo is launching a \"Super Mario Bros.\" title along with its new game console, a 2D side-scroller fashioned after \"Super Mario World\".  Like other Mario titles, \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" is an essential purchase for the Wii U, and brings life and much needed validity to the \"New Super Mario Bros.\" sub-series.  For the first time since the induction of the \"New\" series, 2D Mario is truly holding its own against the truly astonishing and superb 3D titles.Although not nearly as innovative with the 2D \"New\" installments as the 3D installments, the 2D installments have been massive sellers.  \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" sold 26.26 million copies, more than the two Galaxy games COMBINED; so, naturally Nintendo decided to go with a 2D launch Mario title for the Wii U.  However, despite tinkering with 2D Mario games for the last several years, \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" marks the first time Nintendo has truly went beyond what had already been done with 2D Mario into new, exciting territory.Nintendo's modus operandi has drastically changed with Mario over the last several years.Between 1992-2006 (14 years), Nintendo published exactly four Mario games (not counting spin-offs, etc) in the core platforming series: \"Super Mario Land 2\" (Gameboy 1992), \"Super Mario 64\" (N64 1996), \"Super Mario Sunshine\" (Gamecube 2002). However, in 2006-2012, Nintendo published a staggering SEVEN Mario games, and three within a year's time.Previously, an entry in the Mario series was a major event, due to their scarity and how defining each title was to its perspective generation and hardware, especially \"Super Mario 64\".  While Nintendo has released a flood of Mario titles between 2006-2012, these \"defining experiences\" were far fewer.  While the three 3D games have been consistently creative, the previous three \"New Super Mario Bros.\" titles, while entertaining, have been largely retreading ground already covered in the NES/SNES era, especially the two handheld titles, with the best easily being the Wii home console title.  Nintendo designed \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" as a homage to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", with chaotic multi-player added in.  Although widely entertaining, \"NSMBW\" felt like a further extension and refinement of \"SMB3\".Nintendo specifically designed \"Super Mario 3D Land\"as a stylistic bridge between 2D and 3D Mario titles; with \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", Nintendo has shown the world for the first time where they would take Mario series past the enormous shadow of the SNES \"Super Mario World\" if the 3D revolution had never happened, and what a world it is!STORY:  I am not going to waste space with the \"story\".  If you don't know the (apparently) eternal struggle between Mario, Peach, and Bowser by now, you haven't been paying attention for the past few decades.  Abduction is at the heart of the \"narrative\", and we'll leave the plot at that.OVERWORLD:  For the first time in over two decades, Nintendo has returned to a connected overworld map.  The return of the overworld truly brings back the vast sense of exploration, alternate routes, and hidden secrets.  While featuring the usual levels, fortresses, castles, and ghost houses, the map also features new boss fights not tied to any specific level, roving enemies, and special items obtainable only by map.  You can completely bypass Frosted Glaciers.There are eight main areas Mario will travel through: the grassy world of \"Acorn Plains\" (similiar to \"Donut Plains\"), Layer-Cake Desert (a food themed desert world, replete with Moa statues, returning for the first time since the 1989 \"Super Mario Land\"), Frosted Glacier (a snowy night world), Sparkling Waters (tropical paradise), Soda Jungle (a \"Forest of Illusion\" style rainforest), Rock-Candy Mines (a mountainous area similiar to World Six in \"NSMBW\"), Meringue Clouds (analogous to World 7  in NSMBW\") and Peach's Castle.  For the first time, the final battle with Bowser occurs not in his own castle, but Peach's Castle, which Bowser has taken over.CHALLENGE: The previous three \"New\" titles felt tame in comparison, built to appeal to all players and leaving behind those who wanted a true challenge.  Fortunately, the developers were able to achieve a good balance between these two extremes, much better than earlier titles.  Like SMW and SMB3, the game starts out simply enough, and as you progress, the challenge and level complexity nicely ramp up, with some truly difficult sections as well.  The three Star Coins create further incentive and challenge for more competent Mario players to explore all the nooks and crannies of NSMBU's various levels, while more inexperienced players can simply ignore these.MODES: Besides the main campaign mode, NSBMU features three new modes.1.  Challenge Mode: players must complete various objectives (such as jumping on enemies while never touching the ground to obtain 1-Ups).  Some are timed.  Others, you are on small platforms with enemies throwing projectiles that you must dodge, or on still others you must proceed through a level without killing a single enemy.  These challenges are truly testing, and provide welcome relief for those Mario players who want to be pushed to the limit.  Yet these challenges retain their freshness, and while certainly difficult, never appear as too frustrating that they cannot be beaten.  That alone speaks to the genius of Nintendo.2.  Boost Rush Mode: Player must reach the end of two to three selected stages, similiar to the \"Coin Rush\" of \"NSMB2\".  Unlike the Coin Rush, these levels auto-scroll, speeding up everytime the player gets a coin.3.  Coin Battle: Similiar to the same mode from the Wii title, you and another player must battle for coin supremacy.TRANSFORMATIONS/POWERUPS: Small Mario, Super Mario (Mushroom), Fire Mario (Fire Flower), Ice Mario (Ice Flower), Penguin Mario (Penguin Suit, only in challenge mode), Flying Squirrel (Super Acorn), Mini (Mini-mushroom), Invincible (Star), and P-Acorn (special item obtained by capturing Nabbit, a running rabbit).  Like \"Super Mario 3D Land\" and the numerous racoon tails being dispensed at the game's beginning, an Acorn Tree throws millions of acorns all across the realm that Mario is travelling in, resulting in a new powerup: the Flying Squirrel.  Unlike Cape or Racoon Mario, Flying Squirrel Mario only glides , with a one time boost button that allows Mario to go higher.BOSSES:  \"NSMBU\" features the following bosses: Boom Boom and/or Kamek (Fortress).  This marks the first home console apperanance of Boom Boom since \"SMB3\", and only his third apperance in the series in general, after appearing in \"Super Mario 3D Land\".  The Koopalings (who may or may not be Bowser's children, depending on what year you ask Nintendo) and Bowser Jr. also appear: Lemmy Koopa (Acorn Plains), Morton Koopa Jr. (Layer Cake Desert), Larry Koopa (Sparkling Waters), Wendy O. Koopa (Frosted Glacier), Iggy Koopa (Soda Jungle), Roy Koopa (Rock-Candy Mines), Ludwig von Koopa (Meringue Clouds), Bowser Jr. (Airships), and Bowser (Peach's Castle).  Often times Mario's boss battles have been a weak point in the series; however, the developers were able to differentiate each battle to create truly memorable fights.GRAPHICS AND AUDIO: Mario has entered into the world of HD.  The game is graphically gorgeous, yet still does not rise to the level as established by \"Rayman Legends\".  The Starry Night level of Van Gogh is stunning; yet this level of distinction is the exception, not the rule.  While certainly not rudimentary, the HD graphics, while functional, do not often rise to exceptional.  Same can be said for the audio.CHARACTERS AND MULTIPLAYER: In story mode, the game supports four players: Mario, Luigi, Yellow Toad, and Blue Toad.  A fifth player, using the Gamepad, can create additional platforms, but cannot control a fifth character.  Miis are playable in the three additional modes, but not the story mode.  Multiplayer is just as chaotic and unpredictable as NSMBW's multiplayer; in other worlds, you will either find the multiplayer fanstatically fun or rather frustrating, because, let's face it, Mario levels are really designed for one player.  Regardless, I love they included multiplayer again; just be aware other plays may very well be as much a hindrance as a help.Yoshi also appears, but is limited to specific levels, like NSMBW.  There are also three types of Baby Yoshis (appearing for the first time since \"Super Mario World\").  Bubble Baby Yoshi release bubbles from their mouths, first appearing in Frosted Glacier.  Balloon Baby Yoshi function as floating ballons, first appearing in Acorn Plains.  Bulb Baby Yoshis light up dark areas, similiar to Glow Blocks form NSMBW.CONCLUSION: For those waiting for Nintendo to rival the brilliance of Mario's 2D NES/SNES titles, rejoice!  Nintendo has shown dominance in the 3D Marios and unequaled brillance.  While the last three 2D games have been good (and NSMBW borderline great), these games never rose to fantastic, never felt they equaled \"Super Mario World\", the pinacle and logical conclusion of Nintendo's 2D design from the early 90s.  No more.  For the first time in over twenty years, Nintendo has made a 2D Mario game that not only returns to Mario to his 2D glory days, but even surpasses the early titles and also rivals the unmitigated brilliance so often exhibited in their utterly genius 3D entries in this storied franchise.  The true successor to \"Super Mario World\" has finally arrived!..--------------------[Originally written as part of my review for \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\", I wrote this small essay explaining the state of the \"Super Mario\" series from 2006-2012, and how different Nintendo has handled their core franchise in this time period as opposed to their earlier titles}The State of Super Mario:The Super Mario franchise has been in a strange place from 2006 to 2012. There has been an onslaught of Mario games that has been unprecedented during this time frame. We have gotten seven games in six years. These are \"New Super Mario Bros.\" (2006, DS), \"Super Mario Galaxy\"(2007, Wii), \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" (2009, Wii), \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\" (2010, Wii), \"Super Mario 3D Land\" (3DS, 2011), \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" (3DS, 2012), and \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" (Wii U, 2012).Let's compare that to Mario's first titles. From 1985 to 2002, Nintendo released exactly eight games in the core franchise: \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1985), \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (1988), \"Super Mario Land\" (1989), \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" (1990), \"Super Mario World\" (1991), \"Super Mario Land 2\" (1992), \"Super Mario 64\" (1996), and \"Super Mario Sunshine (2002). The only other addition you could make to this would be \"Super Mario All-Stars\" compilation from 1993 on the SNES, where players outside of Japan got to play \"Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels\" (AKA \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" in Japan and first released in 1986 on the Famicom Disk System) for the first time. It is notable however that \"The Lost Levels\" was released in a compilation format and not as a stand-alone title, unlike the other titles.Of course, there have been various spinoff titles, such as \"Dr. Mario\", the Mario Kart series, the Mario RPG titles, etc. Of these spinoffs, there have been some great titles, but they are spinoffs nonetheless (such as the 1995 \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\" and 1993 \"Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land\". Both of these titles are fantastic, but they're not Mario games: one is a Yoshi game and one is a Wario game respectively, and both are their own starting points in a separate subseries of the Mario universe).What's important to note is from 1992 to 2006, a time period of fourteen years, we got exactly FOUR games. Four years separate \"Super Mario Land 2\" from \"Super Mario 64\", SIX years separate \"Super Mario 64\" from \"Super Mario Sunshine\", and another four years separate \"New Super Mario Bros.\" from \"New Super Mario Bros.\"So what does all this have to do with \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\"? Well, simple, really. Starting with the SNES, Nintendo made Mario a one game per console title (with the exception of the Gameboy). Mario games were EVENTS, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. One reason why \"Super Mario Sunshine\" was such a big deal was because it was the first time we got to play a new Mario game in six years. That's a long time.Even with \"New Super Mario Bros.\", there was a sense of momentous occasion upon its release in 2006. Why? Because a full fourteen years had passed since Nintendo had released a side-scrolling Mario.Well, now Mario games aren't really events anymore. We're being saturated with Mario games in the core franchise. From 2006 to 2012 we have gotten a Mario game every year. What's REALLY CRAZY is that Nintendo has released THREE Mario games in a 12 month span (SM3DL, NSMB2, and NSMBU). That is such a contrast from the 1990s.Apparently, Nintendo has decided to go with quantity over quality. With only one exception (\"The Lost Levels\", which is little more than an expansion pack for the first game), each new Mario game from 1985-2002 brought something new to the table and were all pretty different from each other, while still retaining the same great gameplay Mario is known for. Each title was different and unique, while still being brilliant. Hard to pull off, but Nintendo did it.Now, looking at the last seven titles, Nintendo has shifted their MO (modus operandi). Rather than drastically change anything up, they use the same resources and game engines across multiple titles (much like the six NES \"Mega Man\"titles), a thing unheard of in previous Mario games. Four of the titles are \"New Super Mario Bros.\" \\\\The new Mario titles can be broken up into thee groups - the four \"New\" titles (2D Sidescrollers), the two \"Galaxy\" titles, and \"3D Land\". Of these, only the \"Galaxy\" games and \"3D Land\" are truly revolutionary. Strangely enough though, even the \"Galaxy\" games fall into this trend of as much Mario as possible. Never before as Nintendo released a numbered sequel to a 3D game, and playing \"Galaxy 2\" really does feel like you are playing \"Galaxy 1.5\", just more ideas built on the Galaxy theme. Now, to be fair, both Galaxy games are among the highest rated titles out there among reviewers and players alike, both are endlessly inventive, and personally I think \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\", as of 2012, stands proudly as one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, rivaling even \"Ocarina of Time\". In context of this discussion, however, \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\" does show Nintendo in hyper-Mario mode, but when the games are this good, you can't help but smile. Likewise, \"Super Mario 3D Land\", a stylistic bridge between 2D and 3D, along with fantastic stereoscopic 3D gameplay, is another fantastic title as well.That leaves us with the four \"New Super Mario Bros.\" games [of which there are four]. So many gamers were happy about \"New Super Mario Bros.\", simply because we hadn't had a proper 2D Mario in well over a decade. The game was a tremendous seller. Deliberetly styled as a retro-throwback, \"New Super Mario Bros.\" followed the gameplay of the NES/SNES titles we all know and love, yet in retrospect, overall the game was short and easy and didn't really bring any new innovations to the series. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", the first home console 2D Mario game in eighteen years, likewise followed the early Mario titles' gameplay, albeit with modern graphics and some new design decisions to appeal to modern day gaming sensibilies. Still, the Wii version played like a souped \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", this time with chaotic multi-player. For all the hype on the multi-player aspect, Mario's course feel designed for a single player; when you add three additional players the courses begin to feel claustrophobic. However, multi-player is tremendously fun, even though there is no online.While the decision to release three Mario games in a calender year's time is simply unprecented, two of these are for the 3DS and one is for the Wii U. Nintendo has stated that for each console, they plan to make at least one 2D and 3D game. While \"Super Mario 3D Land\" is a brilliant tremendously fun title, releasing \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" a mere eight months after is simply strange, especially given that four months after \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\", Nintendo released \"New Super Mario Bros. U\". The close proximity in which they were released also just intensifies the already gaping differences between the two games; while \"2\" is about the most generic Mario title ever, \"U\" stands as one of Mario's greatest 2D accomplishments.Only time will tell if Nintendo continues Mario's heavy release schedule. While there are no \"bad\" Mario games (with the possible exception of \"Super Mario Sunshine\"), the frequent titles show Nintendo is more interested in monetizing Mario (at least, the 2D titles), than truly innovating. Hopefuly, they will find a way to return to the innovative design that has so defined their Mario output in bygone years. If the \"Galaxy\" games, \"3D Land\", and \"New Super Mario Bros U.\" is any indication, then Mario's future remains as bright as ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

It's not fair to compare them because of budget and Sleeping Dogs was released a year before. I got it as a free download from Xbox Live. After letting it sit on my hard drive for a couple months I thought I'd give it a shot.First off, let's be clear. This is definitely a Hong Kong knock off of GTA, as others have stated. But don't let that deter you from playing this game. I didn't have many expectations when I started playing this game but I have been pleasantly surprised. This game is extremely fun.The big improvement from the GTA series is the combat. I have read that others compare it to the Batman Arkham series, which I have not played. Wherever it's taken from, it is so much fun. It makes me feel like a kung fu master. The combat is primarily hand-to-hang (or foot-to-face!) kung fu based, instead of gun based. It never gets old throwing out a few punches and then finishing off a guy with a Chuck Norris-like roundhouse kick to the face. Simply put, the combat is so much fun that I've decided to buy the Batman Arkham series.The graphics aren't terrible, but they're nothing spectacular. I was actually expecting them to be worse than what they were. It seems like every year the graphics improve 5 years over the previous year's games so after seeing GTA in 2014, I was expecting stick figures in Sleeping Dogs. The good thing about a game like this is that there is so much action that I don't have time to sit and look at the texture on a trash can in a park.The overall gameplay is quite fun.

Easily the best animated fighting game I've ever seen, even moreso than the outstanding BlazBlue, SSFIV is the best fighting game in history and one that you cannot really do much to top.The engine is very similar to the outstanding SFIV, with some of the same glitches and exploits (Zangief's spinning lariat is still able to win almost every single fight with virtually no problems on all difficulties). It's hard to really discuss the game because, in the end, it is a fighting game. There is no plot here. There is just animation and timing, both of which are amongst the greatest that this console generation has ever seen. The character choices are vast and not the usual palate-swap players as in other fighters, such as Tekken VI.Having played minimal online...I am terrible at the game, admittedly...I cannot really say if the game's occasional janky online code has been fixed. The few bouts I had didn' t experience lag, but I am also not good enough to notice the lag that a high level player would notice. It's a bit embarrassing to admit that you're not good enough to notice that there's a problem, but that is the boat we are in.If you like fighting games at all, I recommend this highly.

Fun, ridiculous, crazy, irrational and manic","reviewText":"Simply put, this is a great game.  My review is predominantly about the single player mode.Like many, I play them all, shooters, RPGs, puzzle, etc.  In the past few years, there have been precious few that were exceptional, as well as a couple of fun sleepers that not many people heard of here and there.  I was a huge Painkiller player in the day, and always longed for the day when the edgy folks at People Can Fly would get a chance to put together yet another insane romp for us to play.IMHO, there's not that much objectionable with Bulletstorm.  There's an amazing script, with high quality and hilarious voice acting.  The story is decent, not too original, but definitely a serviceable space marine mutant planet scenario.  The controls are simple, usable and reliable.  Its fast paced and frenetic.  For those that were Painkiller players, there's lots of little, vintage, signature things that our friends at People Can Fly gave us, like screaming hordes of exploding lunatics that will make you smile.  Many of the enemy sounds are vintage as well, and will bring back welcome thoughts of Painkiller.The Skillshot system is really fun as well.  I've played through the whole game on different levels 3 times so far, to see if I can get all the skillshots (some are actually pretty challenging).Its extremely linear, with only occasional nooks and crannies to explore.  There's not too much in the way of weapon customization either.  There's plenty of foul language, so if you're squeamish, well, you might not want to play it.  Its all in good humor, but there is quite a bit (some pretty funny actually!)The visuals are very well done (I still can't believe that people complain about the \"engine\").  The cityscape is huge, the creatures are insane, and the weapons are crystal clear.  There's plenty of ragdoll type effects as well.All in all, I finally found a game that I can play numerous times and still enjoy.

I love the improved design of the analogue sticks which grip the thumbs better to reduce slipping and the fact that it is play & charge so I don't have to waste money on batteries anymore.The main reason I bought it at release day, thus paying full MSRP, was because of the promise of a better D-Pad. I love fighting games; and being raised on the SNES, I prefer using a D-Pad rather than a joystick. It's no mystery that the original OEM 360 D-Pad is the worst-designed piece of garbage, so I have searched for 3rd party Xbox controllers with better D-Pads and even tried a few adapters to use PS2 controllers on the 360. I had not found a satisfying solution, so I was hoping that this would be the answer. I can honestly tell you it is better than the original 360 D-Pad design, but it still doesn't match the funtionality of the PS2/PS3 D-Pad for fighting games. I found that my accuracy did improve with distinguishing down-diagonal moves from directly down and the same with up & up-diagonal. I've gone back a few times to the original 360 controller just to confirm that it's not just a mental impression brought about by preconceived expectiations; and yes, I can definitely see a improvement. This controller would've gotten 5 stars except for one thing: they made it so it can still be transformed back into the sucky design. Why, Microsoft? Do you really think there's gamers out there that really enjoy less accuracy? We are buying this controller to escape the crappy D-Pad design... and you make this one transformable back into suck? So what that translates into is that as I am busting out combos in SSFIV and throw a fire ball followed by dragon punch, the D-Pad pops back up into disk mode and breaks my combo. You cannot do special moves without this thing popping up and down! It's obnoxious!So I almost went with a $200.00 XCM converter, but finally just decided to get a PS3 so I could play the exclusives as well as buy all my fighting games for that system. I will never again buy another fighting game for the 360 until the D-Pad is really, truly fixed.I do recommend this controller, but just not for fighting games. The D-Pad situation has not been rectified satisfactorily. But for everything else, it's great.**Update 6/2/11**D-Pad just broke off tonight as I was playing Soul Calibur IV. It is really too bad that MS took the cheapest route in their half-a**ed attempt to fix their crappy d-pad. Upon closer inspection after it broke off, the d-pad is obviously a cheap, thin hollow plastic shell.This controller was never abused or treated roughly; just normal use playing Street Fighter IV, Soul Calibur IV, and King of Fighters. MS made poor decisions in design and production material for the d-pad. The rest of the controller is great. But I purchased it for the \"improved\" d-pad to play fighting games. Now I am once again without a decent d-pad thanks to MS's production short-cuts and weak efforts to make a decent d-pad. Changing my rating to one-star.**Update 5/4/13**I replaced the broken d-pad usingOEM Chrome Silver/Gray Transforming D-pad for Xbox 360 Controller (Rotating Dpad)and am now once-again very happy with the controller. Other than the d-pad, it is very robust and sturdy. I have restricted use to only games that require no more than light to moderate use of the d-pad.For anyone interested in the best solution that I have found for playing retro/ 2D style games on the 360; I got a couple of the Sega Saturn PS2 controllers off of Yahoo Japan auctions and PS2->360 adapters and they work perfectly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}

To me, this is the best. It fits like a glove to my hands.When you pick it up you feel the perfect weight, very good shape, the dpad and x, circle, triangle and square buttons fall perfectly beneath your thumbs. Both Sticks are at perfect distance too.The only flaw this control has is the shape of the R2 L2 buttons (trigger buttons in the upper back of the controller). When you play racing games and need these as throtle, or even FPS  games and use this buttons to shot, your finger slips and often miss. I believe this is a known problem since there are accesories to fix this, for example: RealTriggersI bought real triggers to fix this only flaw.

Unlike other game environments that serve as nothing more than a visual backdrop, the devastating Helghan climate takes a notable toll. And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle. And you can now drive an array of rugged, sometimes strange, vehicles that expand the gruesome possibilities of war.Guerilla Technology in a Terrifying, Realistic WorldGuerrilla's unique visuals and deferred rendering technology ensure that even the ugliest situations on Helghan are beautifully lit. Ambient occlusion and accurate shadow casting from a variety of light sources combine with gritty textures, detailed environments, and studio-grade special effects to help complete the realistic, Hollywood experience of this first-person shooter.Real-time cutscenes, full-screen anti-aliasing, motion blurs, and internal lens reflections all bring you into the fold and work to maximize the hardware capabilities of the PS3. And the audio experience is no less impressive. 7.1 surround sound capability lend a truly dynamic sound element to your experience, while audio occlusion with wave tracing means that you can hear the difference between indoor and outdoor firefights.Chaotic Multiplayer Drama OnlineWhile single-player mode lets you take on the unique challenges of 11 fully developed levels, online play lets you engage with up to 32 players at a time, bringing the gritty, realistic chaos of war to a whole new level.Other multi-player friendly enhancements in Killzone 2 include in-game clan management, a match wagering system, and the ability to integrate new information and track friends and enemies with the community at Killzone.com.","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Mediocre FPS","reviewText":"I have to admit, after seeing the awards and hearing the raves about this game I was expecting something better than just a mediocre first person shooter.I purchased this as a greatest hits so I only paid $27 which is a fair price.

This game is REALLY easy.  It's so easy, that I'd almost say it's too easy.  I beat the entire game without using a continue.  After you die 5 times, you get a special powerup that makes you invincible, so you can then power through the level and move onto the next.  Despite the fact that it's really easy, it's also EXTREMELY fun!

You get songs like One, Number of the Beast, School's Out, Cult of Personality and more, but they aren't show stoppers like in GHI and II. GHIII, however, has the best song list for more indie music and lesser known covers like My Curse, Stricken, Before I Forget, Through Fire and Flames, Prayer for the Refugee and more. This is also the first GH to be IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT! While the game is hard enough on Hard good luck beating the last few sets on Expert. It'll take you months to master these songs if at all. Through Fire in Flames is probably impossible for most GH buffs on Medium or Hard. Luckily, after hours upon hours of practice, I BARELY scraped through the song on Expert.Some new features are the updated graphics...they're finally next-gen! The game has great physics with bouncing and swaying clothes, high-def textures so denim looks like denim. The characters also get more of a sexual upgrade (thanks Neversoft!) Judy Nails is as hot as ever yet they left out Pandora and added a preppy Japanese chick. There are a few great new characters like Slash, Tom Morrello, and Zeus the Rock God. Speaking of Slash and Tom you now get boss battles. These don't play out like you think. The first few are easy, but the last one, playing Devil Went Down to Georgia, is just pure luck. You have to hit sequences like when you get Star Power but instead you get weapons. These include breaking your string (you have to press a button really fast), raising the difficulty, blowing your amp (all the buttons flash on screen) or doubling the notes. This is fun, but some may NEVER beat it on Expert.Minus all of that you can now play a Co-Op Career which is really fun as well and is pretty self explanatory. Overall GHIII is more for indie and lesser known band fans. If you want famous songs then you're out of luck. Thankfully the game has lots of downloadable songs now. I just wish the GHII songs were compatible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","reviewText":"I just beat this game yesterday, and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot. Even though the game was on the PSP, the graphic was quite amazing. I was constantly surprised on how beautiful it looked on the PSP, especially those backgrounds on the later part of the game.Gameplay-wise, this game is a TPS (third person shooter). Possibly, one of THE BEST TPS on the PSP. Only PSP game that could top this would be Metal Gear Solid: Peak Walker. In the in-game configuration, You could choose \"normal view\" or \"Behind the view.\" For those who like Resident Evil 4 style gameplay, I would recommend choosing the \"Behind the view\" setting. Also, this game was pretty difficult to beat, especially the boss fights. I had to re-try so many times to beat those bosses. You actually need to think and set some sort of strategy to fight those creatures; this game is definitely not a mindless run-n-gun TPS. It took me about 11 hours and half to beat it the first time on the Normal setting. I actually enjoyed this game a lot more than Vanquish on the PS3.Story-wise, it was a little confusing. The plot did not link cohesively between each episodes; however, at the end, the story made sense a little. Still, there was a few missing points in the plot that wasn't explained well, where you have to read through those in-game documents or talk to other characters in between missions. I would recommend everyone to re-play through the game to deeply understand the plot a little better.THIS GAME IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS A PSP!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2011"}

First off, the graphics. I'm not a graphics whore but this game feels cheap in the graphics department. The art style itself is spot on but the game constantly slows down & glitches. It isn't enough to make the game unplayable but it surely didn't help the cause. Another thing that pissed me off was the ending. After you beat the game you save, then you're asked to choose what ending you wanna see, the ending, or the REAL ending. Seeing as I saved I clicked the normal ending thinking I could go back and watch the real ending after. Turns out you can't. You have to play the entire game over since NMH doesn't allow you to load up data after beating the game. It automatically forces you to start over from the beginning.

I had really high expectations and for a while, I thought I liked the game. The art style is unusual. The whole concept is unusual. The task at hand is unusual. The thought of killing a huge colossus appeals to me. So what's not to like?Well, here's what: The game has a few serious problems and then there are some things that are probably a matter of opinion, but I personally didn't like.So let's start with the serious problems: For one, the controls for both your character and (in particular) the camera are a complete disaster. Example: You want to line up to see the colossus. This is a problem because the camera constantly fights you and moves away from how you have aligned it, even if you do not move at all. There is a \"lock the camera on to the colossus\" feature, but it isn't very useful, because it kind of moves the camera off your character, to a point where you can hardly see your own character at times, and you certainly can't do anything useful. But in any event: Let's say you managed to arrange the camera so you can see the colossus. And then, let's say you want to shoot an arrow at it, so you hit the button to aim the bow, and swoooop.... All of a sudden your character turns 90 degrees facing a completely different way. What the...?!? By the time you wrestle the aim back on the colossus he has probably whacked you, or at least got close enough to do some serious damage to you. Not fun.The whole matter of the controls is made worse by the fact that little mistakes are punished severely. You may be forced to swim for minutes and then run up a spiral staircase for minutes just to fall off the top for the 15th time, because you do not know how to get past a certain point. And perhaps you even found out how to get past the point  the first time, but because of the poor controls you ended up making a move that appeared to be so far off the mark that you thought your idea to proceed was completely wrong. I understand that there is supposed to be a puzzle element but how much fun is it to run/swim around for 10 minutes to get back to your 2 second puzzle which you fail to complete because the controls are bad? For me personally: Not even once.Those are some real problems that everyone playing this game will encounter. Apparently some people do not mind so much (or perhaps they haven't played other games that do similar things so much better) and I guess they feel that positive aspects of the game make up for it. Such as the art style and the idea of killing a colossus. Personally, I feel differently. Here's why:I do not like the art style. I thought I did at first, because it is unusual and a bit different. But when you really think about it, then all you get is washed out graphics in slightly different shades of a the same color. It really does not look good (even the gold old PS2 can do a lot better), it just looks unusual and odd. And to make matters worse, the entire game world is completely dead and mostly uninspired. Sure, there is the occasional canyon and the nice bridge here and there, but other than the locations of the colossi, there isn't much going on in between. And there is a lot of area in between. Empty grass lands mostly. Certainly nothing alive. And the developers make you ride your horse around in these grass lands for a long time and for no particular reason (other than making the game longer perhaps). It is really a boring rip-off, especially compared to many other games.I also got to hate the protagonist. Almost to a point where I started hoping he'd fall off the colossus and die. The problem is that he is so clumsy, to a point where he sometimes appears to be handicapped. Now I do not want to upset any handicapped people and I certainly do not have anything against them, but I had not expected to play one in this kind of game. But the way he runs and swims and constantly falls, and how he gets up after he rolls, and how he often jumps instead of diving for safety, and how he jumps head-first against his horses rear end rather than getting into the saddle, and all that, just make the whole thing completely unbelievable.The other problem is that it just isn't that cool to kill a colossus. I had really high hopes for that part, but all you do is try to find a way to climb up (which has a certain puzzle element that might be entertaining... but there always only seems to be one specific way as far as I can tell) and then you try to hold on while the thing is thrashing around, and every now and then, you manage to get a stab in. Trying to hold on however, is not that cool, because all you do is hold down the R1 button until he slows down and then you stab. It isn't like a heart-stopping nail-biter to see whether you can hold on. You just keep the button pressed and that's it. Frankly, it is mostly boring. On occasion you get a colossus that tickles your fancy more than others and that may be a bit cooler, but by and large, I had much higher expectations based on the fundamental idea.So bottom line: The basis for this game is an awesome idea. Probably one that appeals to me more than just about any other game idea. But the execution is done so boringly stupid that I really had not much fun playing this game. Maybe my expectations were too high...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001G3B0HC","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"The ONLY thing that kept me playing through this game was the story","reviewText":"The game starts right off as Kingdom Hearts 1 ended and the story is pretty cool. The battle system makes me think what was Square was thinking at the time. It has the same looks as Kingdom Hearts 2 (Sora still looks like his Kingdom Hearts 1 version though) but doesn't look bad when it's stretched out on newer tv's.Story:This takes place right after Kingdom Hearts 1 ended (literally), and follows Sora as he traverses the floors of castle oblivion. Each floor is a level from the first Kingdom Hearts, but it changes around a bit. Sora is slowly forgetting things along the way, so the levels seem familiar to him, but play out differently than how Kingdom Hearts 1 did them.Along with that, you have Organization 13 running in the way of sora and we get to meet the members we couldn't fight in Kingdom Hearts 2. This is really the strongest part of the game (along with the soundtrack) and its worth finding out what happened in this game, as you get some important scenes at the start and end of the level.Gameplay:This is one of the more annoying battle systems I have played in a while. The idea is to take a card based system and apply it to an action RPG, but fail at the delivery of it. I don't mind games that are based on being as strategic as you can be, but I got really annoyed playing through this game. It does have one improvement over the original game, and that is a controllable camera with the right analogue stick.Battles do start to get annoying because your normal attacks are cards as well. I'm fine with magic, items, and special attacks to be all card based, but I don't like when your normal attacks are penalized by tying them to cards. With all the iterations of the Kingdom Hearts games, this is the only one that doesn't allow you to attack normally.When you level up you get to choose between Hp, Deck increase (more cards) or sleight (Abilities where you set up three cards in a row). Since the attack cards have numbers on themselves, you don't get increases on your strength so that you hit harder. This throws out level grinding before a boss if you're stuck and it does really take away that RPG feel for me.One cool thing is how they control the rooms. You choose how the room is set up based on the room card you use (Like one is a moogle shop or a save spot, while another could have a ton of enemies for farming exp). Only problem with this type of set up is that some of the rooms require a specific number or type card and if you don't have that you're stuck farming enemies until you do get it (or use a roulette card to make that farming easier).Soundtrack:Just as good as the other Kingdom Hearts games, with the same songs from the worlds you visited in Kingdom Hearts 1. Even though I have heard them a ton already, they really don't get old because they fit the worlds so perfectly. The main theme/song are in the game as well and it wouldn't be a Kingdom Hearts game without them. All the spell animations sound great, and the Keyblade hits sound like they always do.While the cutscenes in the worlds themselves are only text, the Organization cut scenes before and after each floor are fully voiced and its really cool to finally have voices to the organization members we didn't get to fight in Kingdom Hearts 2. Sora does sound older but this was recorded a while after Kingdom Hearts 2.Graphics:This game has the same look as Kingdom Hearts 2 and they really did a good job in recreating the entire game from the GameBoy version. All the summons, Sleights and magic looks really great on this game and even stretched out on a bigger tv. Some parts of the worlds in the story sections look the same, but the random rooms have their own distinct look to them.Verdict:The ONLY thing that kept me playing through this game was the story and if you don't care at all about that, than avoid this game. If you do decide to get it, I recommend playing the game twice; it's worth it for story. If you are interested in the story, you could watch a let's play of this game, that way you can find out what happens, without having to deal with the horrible battle system.~ Written: 05-12Positives:* Right analogue stick controls the camera* You can choose the type of rooms that set up the levels* Leveling up only rewards you with HP, Sleights or Deck increase; Nothing else* Still an awesome soundtrack* Pretty good graphics for a PS2 game* Great voice actingNegatives:* Card based action RPG does not work well together* Only Kingdom Hearts game that penalizes normal attacks* Cut scenes in the worlds themselves are only text based","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2012"}

Only by mastering the greatest fighting styles and defeating the most powerful enemies will you earn your place as a master of martial arts in the world of Jade Empire.Features:Epic story set in a world inspired by the myths and legends of ancient China. Jade Empire immerses you in a deep, rich storyline in the tradition of the BioWare-developedStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.Sinister events upset the peaceful harmony of an isolated martial arts school and draw you into a story that unfolds with drama, action, and adventure. Detailed followers and other non-player characters enrich the adventure by providing comic relief, rivalries, flirtations, and hostility. Stare in awe at the sweeping views of the lush environments, sheer vertical drops, and overpowering scale that provide the visual backdrop to the story. Confront wild outlaws, evil magicians, demonic incarnations, and other foul villains that protect the Jade Empire's darkest secrets.Become a martial-arts master. Using the knowledge gained in crafting multiple story-based role-playing games, BioWare sends you on a journey to become a martial arts master. Choose a character with a unique appearance and quirks, a custom voice set, and a powerful combination of ability scores and fighting styles. You can choose to act for good or evil, and these decisions build your reputation, which precedes you throughout the land, changing the course of interaction with other characters and followers. Take the role of a master of martial arts and recruit followers to your cause in an interactive, living world.Innovative fighting system. Master fighting styles and mystical powers. Jade Empire provides a gameplay experience with the tempo and fury normally found in Hong Kong cinema favorites such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Bruce Lee classics. As you journey through Jade Empire, you can upgrade your starting combat style or learn entirely new styles to tailor a character for your specific gameplay preferences. Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"kahohito\"","summary":"Doesn't let go!","reviewText":"I came late to the Jade Empire party, not even knowing the game existed until a couple months after I picked up an X360, but I am hooked!  This game is fantastic!  I've played \"Knights of the Old Republic,\" also by developer Bioware, and I thought that was one of the best RPG games I'd ever played.  Then I picked up \"Jade Empire.\"The storyline is deep, the characters are fully drawn, the side quests are actually fun and interesting (instead of the usual go-there/pick-that-up/come-back sorts of tripe), the graphics are beautiful (especially for last-gen), and the combat system is truly unique and full of variety.  Still being in college, I don't actually have a lot of time to play games, even though I LOVE videogames, but this one easily hooks me for a couple hours every time I sit down with it.  (Which means I don't even turn my X360 on when I have a paper due!)If you want a truly unique and engaging RPG, this is the one.  I've read some of the other reviews, and they have some good points: the load times are REALLY long, there is a lot of dialog, and it is a slower paced game.  The load times become irrelevant, though, once you start playing the levels, and the dialog is interesting and well written (as opposed to KOTOR 2 -- THAT was boring dialog).  As to the pacing, if you're used to beat-em-ups like Final Fight or button-mashers like Ninety-Nine Nights, then this game is certainly not for you.  If you want a unique RPG set in a fully-drawn and incredible universe, then this is the game you want.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2007"}

It is, however, very fun.  Like most people, I had no idea what this game was, because the only thing commercials showed were the cut scenes.  I wondered why were they hiding the game play?  I don't care about some Hollywood reject making his pixelated story, I want to play.So, I gave it a chance by renting it, and it was pretty darn good.  You're in western area, reminiscent of HBO's Deadwood.  You travel town by town, participating in gun and horse fights with Native Americans and Cowboys alike.  You also have side missions, like the Pony express, hunting a wanted criminal, playing poker, or stopping crime.  The game play is neither frustrating, unintuitive, nor gimmicky.  It's basically a third person shooter where you can also ride on a horse.Despite my hatred of cut-scenes, the videos in this game provide the perfect compliment.  Neither too long or too \"artsy\", they give proper reason and explanation as to what mission you are on.The main complaint I hear from people is that it's not very long.  Technically, that's not quite right.  There is not much repetition.  So, while the game only takes 10 hours for the story missions to be completed, about 8 hours is original gameplay.  Most 15 hour games only really have 7-8 hours of original gameplay.  Gun is actually nice enough to not let you repeat the same stuff over and over again.If you want a fun game to play, then this is really the best choice out there.Pros:Fun gameplayFMV and gameplay mixed in wellCons:Not very originalNot much to exploreDifficulty: Low (easy level).Frustration Level: LowHours to Complete: 12 hours (including some side missions)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Better than Wings of Liberty, still lacking in innovation but fun","reviewText":"The dreaded Queen of Blades, the leader of the Zerg, is no more. Sarah Kerrigan has been freed from the Swarm and is now human once again...but consumed by the need to avenge herself on Arcturus Mengsk, Emperor of the Terran Dominion, the man who betrayed her and left her for dead. When Mengsk's troops raid the facility Kerrigan is recuperating in, she finds herself alone and without any allies. Kerrigan needs an army to bring down her enemy and the leaderless Zerg Swarms may be the key to victory, if she can resist becoming part of the Swarm once more.Heart of the Swarm is the rather tardy second instalment of the StarCraft II series of games, arriving an eyebrow-raising three years after its predecessor, Wings of Liberty. Considering the game uses the exact same engine as its predecessor (some minor upgrades aside) and apparently follows a story arc laid down by the guys at Blizzard almost a decade ago, the reason for the delay initially appears puzzling. The answer, of course, lies in the franchise's multiplayer angle. Blizzard have introduced new units with this expansion and have spent months and months painstakingly testing every iteration of the changes, dumping some new units and bringing in others, to make sure they don't upset the multiplayer balance. Given that StarCraft II's multiplayer scene is worth millions of dollars, this is unsurprising, but it does leave those of us primarily interested in the game's single-player storyline hanging in the wind for quite a long time.Still, the game is here, and to a certain degree it's StarCraft as normal. You have a base, you collect resources, you build units and you fight the enemy for territory (control of additional resources areas where you can establish secondary bases) and ultimately try to destroy them. The gameplay is held together by a storyline, in this case one about vengeance and evolution. Kerrigan is out to kill Mengsk and end a feud between the two that began fifteen years ago in the original StarCraft. Blizzard cleverly raise this story - a subplot in the overall scheme of things - to prominence in Heart of the Swarm and push the big-picture storyline about the return of the alien Xel'Naga firmly into the background for the next game to worry about. Giving Heart of the Swarm its own direction and a storyline that does come to a definitive conclusion helps it avoid the 'middle title' syndrome that trilogies often suffer from. Heart of the Swarm also feels like it might be treading over the same ground as the original title's Brood War expansion, which also focused on Kerrigan uniting the Swarm under her control. Heart of the Swarm contextualises this in a different way, however, to avoid repeating concepts already visited in the series.The campaign structure is quite interesting. There are five sub-campaigns, four of them taking place on planets and a fifth in deep space, each consisting of several missions. Between missions Kerrigan is based on board her spacecraft, a Zerg Leviathan (replacing the Terran battlecruiser Hyperion from Wings of Liberty), and can seek advice from her underlings, upgrade units and enhance her own powers and abilities through a levelling system. The unit-upgrade section is the most amusing, as Zerg mutation specialist Abathur (the Zerg equivalent of a slightly befuddled scientist) portentously reveals how he's going to improve the Zerg species, usually provoking a sarcastic response from Kerrigan. Given that the Zerg are the most alien and weirdest of StarCraft's three races, Blizzard draw a nice line here between making sure they stay that way whilst also humanising them enough to give them identifiable personalities. The surprise reappearance of a previous major character thought dead also helps give the game some more identifiable personalities.The writing is as dreadfully cheesy as it was in Wings of Liberty, although the theme of a need for vengeance so powerful it overcomes one's humanity is a bit more interesting than the muddled and overlong campaign of the previous game. Heart of the Swarm is significantly shorter in terms of proper missions than its predecessor (clocking in at 20 compared to 29, almost a third shorter) but makes up for the shortfall with optional training missions showing how potential Zerg mutations will be used on the battlefield. Though entertaining, these mini-missions do feel like an attempt to pad out the length to make players feel they are getting their money's worth, and none will take longer than five minutes to complete.On the battlefield, things are similar to Wings of Liberty. As with Liberty, the game tries to avoid too many build base-build army-kill everything missions, instead peppering some more creative objectives into the game. This is helped by the deployment of Kerrigan herself, a powerful unit with numerous powers (which are upgraded throughout the game). Kerrigan can turn the tide of a battle single-handed, but can't win everything by herself, so deploying additional troops is always necessary. Heart of the Swarm avoids the dull slog some of Wings of Liberty's missions descended into, but sometimes goes too far the other way by making things too much of a walkover. Certainly Swarm benefits from occasionally being whacked up to 'hard' mode on occasion.On the minus side, there is obviously going to be another long wait for the conclusion of the story in Legacy of the Void, and certainly the pricing of this expansion set is a little off-putting. Heart of the Swarm does just about justify it through monumental production values, a decent length (about 10-11 hours in total) and a more entertaining campaign than Wings of Liberty, not to mention the multiplayer enhancements. Also on the minus side, though for an expansion much less of an issue, the game has still resolutely failed to take on board any of the major RTS innovations of the last fifteen years. Proper 3D line of sight, cover and destructible scenery and battlefields are still nowhere to be seen, and the camera is still suspended uncomfortably close to your units and the battlefield even on the higher resolutions. Given that Wings of Liberty was looking outdated in 2010, Heart of the Swarm is looking positively geriatric in the impending face of Company of Heroes 2 and Total War: Rome 2. For fans of the franchise, however, this will no matter one whit.StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm (****) is ultimately a more satisfying and enjoyable game than Wings of Liberty. The writing is still poor on an individual level, but the story is more focused and has a definitive and satisfying ending, compared to Wings of Liberty's cliffhanger. The result is a game that improves on its forebear and makes for a satisfying addition to the franchise, though one that not likely to win over anyone not already a fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVNZ8","description":"","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Nice Versatile Case For The Price...","reviewText":"Okay, so imagine that you are looking for a nice simple carrying case for your Nintendo DS system, and you come across this case.  It has an alluringly low price, but the question remains, \"is this case any good?\".  Let's find out!First of all: appearance.  This case may be an Amazon Basics product, but it still looks nice and official - it even has \"Nintendo 3DS\" printed on the side (you know, so the thieves will know what they're stealing!).  Really, though, it's a decently attractive case, and even though it says \"3DS\" specifically on it, it actually can hold any of the DS range of systems (the old phat DS all the way through the XL).  That brings me to my next point...The size of this worried me a bit at first because I read that it can house a DSi XL and I thought it'd be way too huge to really be convenient or useful.  Plus, a lot of carrying cases have too much extra unnecessary padding adding to their enormous size; they're just not efficiently designed.  I'm pleased to say though that it actually is quite nicely compact!  It even fits in my purse - the ultimate litmus test for whether or not a carrying case is usable.  If I had a DSi XL it would fit pretty snug in the case, thus not wasting any extra room.  The measurements are about 7\" x 4.5\" in length and 1.5\"-1.75\" in width (depending on how full you stuff it).  I have a DSLite right now, and it fits quite loosely inside.  However, before this causes you all to fear that it'll bump around in there, allow me to say that they have thought of this problem and solved it.  There are two sets of elastic straps on one side.  One set is clearly for an original DS or an DSi XL or something fatter, and the other set is for the DSLite and other thinner devices.  I tried the tighter straps for my DSLite and it didn't move at all!  However, I also tried it with the looser straps, and it still did a semi-decent job of holding it in place.  I'll probably end up using the looser straps just because they are more conveniently located for quick insertion/removal of the system.As for the rest of the inside of the case, there's not much.  There is one little divider tab thing that has three little pockets on it that are designed to hold your DS game cartridges.  It works fine, but my real complaint here is that there is absolutely nothing on the inner top of the case.  NO POCKET!!!  Why is there no pocket?!  This was a huge lost opportunity on their part.  They could have stuck a bit of fabric there to make a pocket and it would've added a great extra bit of storage for you to stick more games or put some extra styli or whatever.  This may not matter much to you, but it actually bugs me greatly that there is no pocket.  I have some lovely hard plastic cases that hold extra game cartridges that would've been great to stick in a pocket.  As it is, I may choose to alter this and add in my own pocket using my awesome sewing/craft skills...Lastly, I should talk about the protective qualities of this case.  The description says that the case is firm, and it truly is - up to a point.  It's somewhat rigid, but it still has some give to it.  If an elephant stepped on this, your game cartridges would go SQUISH!  Okay, all joking aside, it really isn't as hard as I imagined it would be.  I imagined an unbendable plastic case, but this case is a bit bendy.  I'm a bit nervous to just put DS game cartridges in their pockets without any extra protection.  In fact, I'd be more inclined to place the game cartridges in small individual plastic cases and then put those in a pocket in the top lid (IF THERE WAS ONE!!!).  Yeah, I guess it all boils down to how paranoid you are about damage.Oh, one last thing, I should mention that there is no hand strap of any kind.  It doesn't bother me much because I never used that anyway, but I thought I'd mention it in case someone out there cares to know.Well, overall, this is a pretty good case.  It'd be a fantastic perfect case if they'd just put a pocket in the top lid.  As it is, it's pretty cheap so I guess if you are craft/sewing inclined you could put in your own pocket.  Of course, if you don't care for a pocket then this would be a great case for you.  Also, it's one of the few reasonably priced cases I've seen that actually holds a DSi XL, a godsend for anyone who actually owns one of those.  Yes, all in all, this case is a nice, well-priced option for anyone who wants a good carrying case to protect their portable gaming system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

I had no real clue of what I was getting into. I was pleasantly suprised overall, the game plays alot like a souped up version of Onimusha on the PS2.The graphics are great, it's all in the little details like the wavy lines from all of the fire in the burning envirnments and the falling petals in the forest section. Not to mention a truly awe inspiring battle atop battleships. The cinematics look fantastic despite being a bit stifled by some truly strange voice acting. The story as it is, happens to be compelling enough to carry you from place to place.The gameplay works well with the exception of an awful camera system. Even still, I was having a blast fighting enemies on huge battlefields in Dynasty Warriors style action set pieces, lots of fun boss battles, and it was fun figuring how to best utilize each of the four swappable characters. Each character has their own distinct play style and the combos are easy to master for each of their five weapons. I felt that it added some great depth to what would otherwise be a pretty average experience.Overall, what you have here is a game that will cost you less than five dollars and it will provide you with the upwards of 15 hours of gameplay. There's really no going wrong if you like Japanese folklore (which this draws heavily upon), and games like Onimusha. The camera issues do hurt the overall experience but not nearly enough to detract from all of the fun this fine game has to offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

The Yokohama docks & Shibuya tracks were my favorites though it definitely took some time getting used to the handling/mechanics of the cars. I really liked how you earn sponsors as you progress through the game and by the time you have a few hours of play time in and have won a few races the sponsorship money adds up fast and you can easily purchase other cars. Plus its fun to play around changing the sponsors whose decals appear on your cars.However, after running through all of the Japanese tracks and events there really wasn't anything left to do because I had ran a few of the American and European tracks and found them quite boring.

It's not a flawless game, but MadWorld is a thoroughly entertaining romp that Wii owner who are not faint of heart should definitely check out.The story in MadWorld follows a sick sort of gladiatorial game called Death Watch. You play as a newcomer to the games, Jack. The story is pretty ridiculous, and not very interesting, but where the game truly shines is its humor, especially from Death Watch's two announcers, who had me laughing out loud through most of the game.The gameplay is fairly standard fare for a Wii action game. You'll use the A and B buttons to perform basic attacks on enemies, and use various objects in the environment in combination with motion controls to perform some more complicated, and brutal attacks. But the name of the game in MadWorld is combos. Sure dicing an enemy up with a single swipe of Jack's handy chainsaw arm can net you some quick points, but when you string basic moves with the environmental attacks, and then end with one of the game's ridiculous finishers, you start rolling in the points.Jack will even take a break from on foot carnage to enjoy some motorcycle manslaughter. These sequences, while refreshing, aren't really very polished, and definitely could've used some touching up.While some might fear repetition after a while, MadWorld's gory mini games found in each level will keep things fresh. Every activity from playing \"Man Darts\" to splatting guys against the moon by hitting them with a golf club is worryingly hilarious, and simply a lot of fun.MadWorld's gameplay also benefits greatly from its numerous bosses and mini-bosses, who serve as a refreshing break from the standard grunts, and lead to some pretty intense fighting. Not to mention that the finishers you get to pull on them are downright badass.Obviously one of the huge draws of MadWorld is its unique graphical design. Every thing is black and white except for the blood red...er...blood. It's not exactly easy on the eyes, but it's definitely cool that the developers were willing to do something so risky. Some will love it, some will hate it, but all can admit there's nothing else quite like it in the realm of video games.The sound department is excellent, the game has great sound effects, and a pretty awesome score of original rap songs, not to mention the pure awesomeness that are the Death Watch announcers (played by renowned voice actors Greg Proops and John DiMaggio.)MadWorld doesn't last very long, only 5-6 hours, but it's definitely the kind of game you'll want to come back to if just to relive some of the ridiculous boss fights. It's also worth noting the game has a multiplayer mode, in which you and a friend compete in the various mini games seen in the game's story mode, but it's really not all that great.MadWorld looks and sounds like nothing you've ever played before. Unfortunately it plays like a lot of games you've played before. But that's not all bad. While it is short, and can get repetitive, ultimately the insane action and awesome production values make MadWorld a game that's definitely worth adding to the mature Wii owner's library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

The first game was a bit restrictive, as far as options on where to go and what to do, but that's to be expected in certain RPGs.DA2 took these restrictions to the extreme. Other than a few exceptions, you're restricted to one city, and the game plays over the span of a few years. This screams &#34;shortcut&#34;. They didn't want to build new areas, so they used the same one with different appearances.The gameplay is passable, nothing to write home about, but a fun experience. I finished this game as quickly as I could, just to get it overwith. Yes, it's that bad.I'll be cautiously optimistic for DA3, but EA's involvement in these titles have been nothing but a setback.

Its nothing extremely special and not as good as uncharted but still very fun. Graphics are fine for the game. The music is amazing in the game. That might be my favorite part of the game \"the score\". Ive only played two levels and they are about 30 to 40 mnutes long so the game probably is only 5 to 6 hours depending on the skill level you play it on. Some of the weapons do sound alike but some are very different as well. The secondary fire on the weapons involve using the touch screen and it works really well. A really fun part of the game for me is quite simple, the grenades. You simply touch the grenade on the side of the screen then touch where you want it thrown and it goes there. I havent played multiplayer yet because i couldnt find anyone so i cant comment on that. Very fun game to play. Easy trophies if your into that kind of thing.

{"product_name":"B00DC7G3Q8","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Everything Old is New Again","reviewText":"There are some Nintendo franchises that I wish they'd experiment with a little more.  One of them is Yoshi's Island.  The original Yoshi's Island debuted in 1995, where Yoshi was the main character while Mario took a backseat to all the action (quite literally too).  It was a fun and challenging game.  Nintendo doesn't experiment a lot with the Yoshi's Island series much.  Case in point, the last entry came out in 2006 on the Nintendo DS.  It was a great game too.  Yoshi's New Island, however, feels like it's missing something.  There's some good charm here and good aesthetic quality, but for the most part, Yoshi's New Island is merely just okay.Yoshi's Island, like the many Mario games, has never really been about story.  It's about the gameplay and the journey.  There are six worlds to tackle in Yoshi's New Island.  Each level is your basic 2D side scrolling platformer.  Some levels are very well designed but there's nothing here that's quite as creative as what you saw in the original Yoshi's Island or its DS counterpart.  For the most part many levels are straightforward without really providing the challenge you'd be used to from a Yoshi's Island game.Yoshi controls as he always has.  You can jump on some enemies, but for the most part you'll want to make them into eggs and throw them.  For the most part, the formula hasn't changed.  This can be a good or a bad thing.  Yoshi's Island has a unique means by which you fail.  Instead of there being a certain number of hits that Yoshi takes, what happens when he sustains damage is Baby Mario will float away in a bubble crying, while a timer counts down.  If it reaches zero,Baby Mario is lost to Kamek.  Yoshi's can still perish by falling on spikes or falling down pits, but for the most part as long as Mario stays on Yoshi's back, everything is fine.  You can increase the timer by collecting stars.  There are also still red coins to find among the yellow ones, and five flowers in each level.  For those who must collect everything finding the red coins, five flowers and finishing a level with thirty stars is important.  Every level has a grand total of 100 points.  And you'll only get the full 100 by meeting these conditions.There isn't a whole lot new here.  Yoshi can now turn some enemies into mega eggs which can be used to destroy walls or help him sink in water when he needs to.  It's not something that gets explored a whole lot, however.  Other than that there really isn't that much which separates Yoshi's New Island from the previous two.  It might not be a bad thing, but what makes it stand out so much is that the game's levels just aren't as clever.  Every now and then you find some good memorable levels or a memorable boss fight, but for the most part the level designs aren't as unique as before.  Likewise, they are also not as challenging.  One of the best aspects about the Yoshi's Island games was that they were not especially easy games.  In fact, they could be maddeningly hard at times to the point of frustration.  Yoshi's Island DS in particular is still a fairly challenging game.  Yoshi's New Island is a little too easy by comparison.  There are some surprises but the game isn't going to test you very much.The ease of the game is compounded by the fact that Nintendo still seems to have this idea that if you ARE failing too much you need a crutch to help you succeed.  Fail too much in Yoshi's New Island and you'll get wings that allow you to pretty much fly all you want.  If you STILL continue to die too much you'll then get a gold wing that'll let you fly around AND avoid taking damage.  Yoshi's New Island is hardly challenging to need such a handholding device.  More than that, as with so many of Nintendo's platformers... extra lives are plentiful.  Even if you manage to fail a thousand times you'll probably never see a game over screen.  It's easy to rack up far too many lives.  In comparison to the two games before it, this one borders on coddling the player.  If the levels weren't so simple and there was a greater challenge the need to provide several lives or a crutch to players might be somewhat justified.  As it stands, however, Yoshi's New Island isn't quite like that.But really the other truth is that after a while the game simply becomes more boring than previous games in the series.  The levels have some creative spark to them but some of the best moments are few and far between.  The new aspects introduced here aren't really expanded on, and at times they aren't even that necessary.  We're introduced to them but the game eventually carries on without them.  After such a long wait it's a shame, really, that there isn't much more given to us.  Nintendo isn't beyond banking on our nostalgia, but usually there's something added to the experience to make sure you know it's about more than just childhood memories.  The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between didn't just bet on your memories of A Link to the Past, it went out of it's way to introduce aspects that played a key role within the game.  It becomes more than just a nostalgia trip.  There's nothing new here, and you won't be too compelled to go after all the points in a stage.  There's a lot of nostalgia and some clever level design in some spots, but for the most part the game as a whole feels a lot more bland.  The vehicle segments in particular, aren't very fun because they incorporate the 3DS gyro controls and they don't always handle so well.  It feels less like a clever ploy and more like a tacked on gimmick.The graphical presentation is charming.  A lot of it looks much more like an oil painting this time around.  In some regards this is fine, but the crayon style of the Super Nintendo game was most certainly more appealing.  It only goes to show that aesthetics matter quite a bit.  That's not to say Yoshi's Island looks bad.  It most certainly doesn't.  The look is charming and detailed.  Although nothing here looks like it's too out of the ordinary.  There are a lot of familiar enemies and objects here.  It's a shame, actually, that Yoshi's New Island doesn't have a great deal of new enemies or even a lot of new design choices.  There's a lot of stuff you'll see here that looks as though it were pulled form the original Super Nintendo game and simply given a polish.  Other times the oil painting can make some of the game look muddied, even in spots where you don't want it to.Let's be clear, Yoshi's New Island isn't a bad game.  In fact it's actually quite good.  It's just that you expect Nintendo to reach a little higher with their platformers.  Especially when handling a property as important as Yoshi.  When Donkey Kong Country returned there was certainly nostalgia, but there were also elements that helped make you realize it wasn't just another Donkey Kong Country game.  It had elements that made it stand out in creative level design, great new mechanics and a challenge that reminded us why we loved old platformers in the first place.  Yoshi's New Island doesn't quite reach that high.  Given how long it's been since a new Yoshi game, it's a little disheartening that Yoshi's New Island only manages to feel like a nostalgia trip.  It's a short game as well, though this was to be expected.  It'll take you perhaps five or six hours to get through it.  And this is where the real issue comes in.  It is not that the game can be beaten in five or six hours that is the issue.  The issue is that Yoshi's New Island doesn't compel you to play it again, nor will you find much incentive to try and score 100 points on every level.  If there were a great deal of replay value here the five or six hours wouldn't be an issue at all.If you've never played a Yoshi game before this certainly serves as a good introduction.  If you have, however, you'll find everything you remember is here, but you'll also find that Nintendo certainly didn't take as much care and devotion with bringing Yoshi back as they could have.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}
{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Riley","summary":"Tremendous Fun To Be Had!","reviewText":"Since I'm not usually a fan of RPGs, I would've turned my nose up at this game...except that it's South Park. I'm not a die-hard fan, and haven't watched an episode in years, but I still love the style of humor the show represents. Apparently, though, this game was in developer hell, but I don't know the whole story about that. Also, despite several major release date delays the game came out, finally, and is near perfection. There is literally only one thing I don't like about it, and it is VERY minor. That minor thing is that when you loot bodies and sometimes boxes and chests, sometimes you get caught on one plane. What I mean by that is, you can only move up and down or left and right, but not both. Most often you can't move left or right. The simple solution to this is to hold one direction (snicker snicker) and then just let go of the stick completely and then you can move freely again. Now THAT'S minor.The game itself feels kind of short, about 13 hours + for me to do everything that i could find, including all quests. The creative team behind the game did a great job of thinking about how to maintain an RPG world inside the already-existent South Park world, i.e. using houses and basements as dungeons or as the Giggling Donkey tavern.Thankfully the two creators of the TV show wrote the script so that, as they said in many interviews, they could create the illusion that this game was really just another episode. And boy does it feel like one. All the best obscenities are used with perfection, all the appropriate racism, potty jokes, fart jokes, (I mean...the magic your character learns is different types of farts!) character belittlement, and gay jokes that we've come to love and laugh at in South Park. Those guys at South Park Studios were pushing the envelope before Family Guy and perhaps much further.The gameplay itself is very polished. Again, I'm not much for RPGs, but they really simplified the RPG concept into just maintaining Perks (additional abilities that are permanently brought into each battle) and Abilities (standard things like magic and special weapon attacks, done, of course, South Park Style). In this game, they have the enemies set up in columns and rows so that other enemies are sometimes stacked above/below or in front of/behind other enemies. Certain attacks affect the whole field, while others only do columns or rows. Having not encountered this before, I thought it to be ingenious. I must reiterate again that I am not a regular RPG gamer so this may not be novel, and may, in fact, be quite old. It is, though, new to me.The missions are usually pretty funny and the sex scene (yep, they did just do that) is hilarious! This was probably the best feature of this game. The humor. Throughout the entire game I was kept laughing and not just little chortles, but real belly laughs. It makes me wish there was more comedy in games. The Uncharted series has some good dialogue/banter, but it isn't as continuous as this game's laugh bucket was.Overall this is my favorite game of the year (so far) and it will be hard to overthrow based on how amazing it is. This is the second game I have beat and then gone back and replayed immediately after finishing it (the other being The Last of Us) because it was so good. If you don't like offensive JOKES then you won't like this. If you are unfamiliar with South Park and it's humor, but appreciate offensive JOKES and what could be juvenile or risque humor, then you'll do fine. There are a lot of references to many things that happened in the television show, but one doesn't need to rent/buy all 15+ South Park seasons to catch up in order to enjoy this game. Seriously one of the best games I have ever played, hands down. You need to play this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

Can you ever do so many different things in this game.  Heck, you can waste (and will) hours just driving all the different cars, motorcycles, boats and helicopters in this game.  There's 100 hidden packages to find.  There's all the rampages to do.  All the stunt jumps.  RC Races.  Or you can just roll around and run over people.  Whatever you want to do, you can!As for the missions:  Most of them are very open and can be defeated in various ways.  Some of them border on insanely frustrating (the R/C Chopper ones especially, and the very last one) but of course some are incredibly easy.  So long as you're exploring, getting the hidden packages, and building up your weapon supply (and NOT drowning/getting yourself busted/wasted) you'll progress through the game quite well.If there was EVER a game for people who love the 80's, this is it.  Think of it as Miami Vice on steroids.  The music is top notch and one of the best overall collections on ANY video game, enough so to be released as a CD set.  Vrock was my favorite station as well (just wait until you hear the commercials, too funny!).The sound effects are all right on as well.  You can tell the voice acting adds so much to the game (Ray Liota=PERFECT Tommy Vercetti).  Even his snide comments (for example, when you're \"carjacking\" someone and he says \"I need this\").  The vehicles, as varied as they are, all make different sounds.The short story, without trying to spoil anything:Tommy Vercetti comes to Vice City to help a drug deal go down.  They get ambushed, and he ends up stuck in Vice City starting to work with his lawyer friend, Ken, to clear his name.  Where it goes from there, is up to you to decide...And in closing, that's what makes GTA:VC so great.  If you want to just drive around, jumping and exploding cars, shooting people or finding unique ways to do it (my favorite:  Stack up around 5-6 cars and shoot a rocket right into them, causing the mother of all explosions), or take on the games well over 50 missions in different ways, you can do it.Few games have revolutionized a video game genre as the GTA series has, and GTA:VC to me is the very best of them all.This game can be had on the cheap and to spend $[...] bucks for 50-60 hours (easy) of gameplay is well worth it.This is one of the few game I've played in my life that truly deserves a perfect \"10\" across the board.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2009"}

This console is definitely quiet, I'd say its on par with the PS3 slim quietness. Its definitely smaller than the previous 360s. The black glossy finish, the chrome like on/off button and chrome trims look very nice. Some will complain that it is a fingerprint magnet, but I actually like the finished look. The controller is the same as the previous controllers, except for some reason I feel the d pad is a bit more accurate. Wi-Fi is included this time around with no attachments. The disc tray is definitely more quiet in operation while playing a game and even opening and closing wont make much of a clank noise. Touch sensitive buttons are nice. Still has a power brick but it is not compatible with the previous models. As a matter of fact, hard drives and memory cards of old will not be compatible with this new slim.

{"product_name":"B0050SWZHS","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"More of the same, download the 60min. Trial on PS Plus","reviewText":"I've never really been a big fan of War games, basically because they all seem to get stuck in the same rut. There are only so many ways to be original with war, melee, shoot, snipe, throw grenades, detonate, kill. That about sums up most FPS war games today. Also games can mislead you when you watch a preview to make you think it's something great, when it's just more of the same. I decided to download the 60min free trial for the game on Playstation Plus, which was plenty of time to get a real feel for the game. I had thought about purchasing the game through Origin for my gaming rig, but said well i need to \"try before i buy\". So i definitely recommend (if you're not, being a member) and getting the free trial. The game looks pretty good on PS3, and the cut scenes look amazing (some of the best i've viewed). That being said the rest of the game, well, looks like Battlefield 3, and if not for the MOH case, and stamp on it, that's what you would think you were playing. This series has pretty much stolen everything it can from all the surrounding competition, so basically to little not soon enough, to late. The controls are a bit finicky, especially when aiming, or turning quickly to shoot. Very unsteady. Also the controls just don't feel like they are solid at all, and it was very rushed, as with parts of the game. For instance when asked to pick up a missile launcher to take down a building (in the first 20 minutes or so), it's no where to be found. Eventually you step across it only after picking up about 3 other weapons. By that time your either fed up, or dead. Targeting is also very difficult, as locking in either works or it doesn't. Takes way to much time. Also i found taking down the helicopter at the very beginning to be very very tedious.As I mentioned the graphics do look good, though there are certain parts that look better than others, and there are actually a few areas of clipping and places of badly popping textures. Remember Rage? That being said when you start a brand new game, and it immediately needs an update, you can tell the developers just didn't take the time and care this game deserved, for enjoyable play. And even if it could have been better, it's still basically to late because anything in this game has already been done. And most of it has been done bigger and better. So as i mentioned, do the trial before you drop 60 bucks, it's just not worth it. The single player campaign is suppose to be around 6 hours, and i also watched the video of the guy from Gamespot playing it on PC to see what he came up with. No major reviews yet. But i can tell you after playing just an hour out of the six, that was plenty enough for me. The multiplayer i can't comment on, if you want another game for that, be my guest. But like i said, there are bigger, better and badder war games out there. MOH didn't step up to the plate on time, and tripped on their way to it. Sorry i can't recommend it. But then again, these games all end up in the same boat. (As for the story, i didn't catch one).Sorry i forgot to mention Dishonored, incredible game, lots of stealth, supernatural possession, great story. etc. Game of the year for me.My recommendations for you war mongers.Battlefield 3Call Of Duty 3 (it's not THAT bad)Bulletstorm-Good mindless shooting funBodycount-Great arcade shooter, with no point. Sometimes that's best.Condemned-1 or 2-Not war games but very clever horror crime solving games.Prey 2 looks to rock as well. COHBO II-Same as this i'm sure.

{"product_name":"B00DHF39KS","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"A novel a day\"","summary":"fun Fun FUN! Game!","reviewText":"Long single player story that is quite macabre and really takes the &#34;What if the Nazis won?&#34; premise to the extreme.  I really enjoy the protagonist's narrative that is almost a whisper while you complete various tasks.  The entire plot is just so cool and such a refreshing take on many FPS ideas, in my opinion.  Be forewarned: there are some gruesome things that you encounter and see, though not extremely frequently they are there.Weapons -- The guns are quite basic, though they are well done (feels like you're shooting, etc): AR, handgun, shotgun, marksman.  But, you can dual wield them, not in combination, but you can dual wield two handguns.  I don't think you dual wield marksman, though I could be mistaken.  My favorite weapon is actually the knife.  Well, dual wielding knives.  Very cool takedown animations that did not get old for me.  You also get a laser-cutting weapon that can be used to shoot laser pulses at enemies that immediately disintegrates them.  Very neat, if a bit OP--but given that it is have limited ammo that you cannot refill all the time and no sight beyond iron sights, i think it balances out quite nicely.  I'm about 12 hours into the game, so I cannot say if you encounter other weapons.The only thing that I would consider a downside is the stealth gameplay.  And not even that the stealth gameplay is limited, it is just a single aspect of it that bothered me.  The game was partly advertised as providing stealth gameplay, but several times after I kill an enemy and they get found (you cannot move bodies), I am immediately being shot at, i.e. the A.I. knows my location.  Not a huge deal by any means, just something that did annoy me... and considering that it IS such a minor thing, I think that it really speaks volumes for the quality of the game overall.What people really want to know, given that this is a single-player game only, is this game worth your time and money?  I say yes.  It is leaps and bounds better than KZ:SF and BF4 SP (though that is not really saying much).  Besides, do you really want them to put together some half-assed MP mode to satisfy the masses, or do you want a unique SP campaign that takes at least 15 hours to beat (based on how far I am now, it may take up to 18-20 if I had to guess)?  I choose the latter, we have our amazing BF4 MP, anyway.Leave any questions in the comments and I'll happily reply.Cheeers!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2014"}

Other people can also \"remix\" memories, most of them considered enemies of the state.- If you enjoyed the combat style in Batman Arkham Asylum, it is very similar.- The actual \"remix\" feature and \"remix\" events are pretty innovative and add a hint of puzzle to this game.- The visuals are extremely nice(but who buys a game for the visuals, just buy a movie instead. After all, it is called a video game)Cons:- Rather short, it's only nine chapters and there aren't more chapters you can get from DLC(Finally a game that doesn't need DLC to play more story mode).- The \"remix\" part of the game is only used a few(I want to say three times, but I am probably wrong) times, which I would have enjoyed the game far more had this been used more in the game.- Major glitches during boss battles that break the game and force you to re-do the boss battle should you did not finish his minions before finishing him.- The Pressen and \"Create your own Combos\" system is rather gimicky, as you can't actually create your own combo, but unlock extra steps to add onto already predetermined combo lists.- Too linear for a video game in this age of technology. You literally have to restart the chapter and get back to that spot, should you miss a collectible. There is not much room for finding things either, it is very straightforward progression.- Crazy amount of collectibles that I'll never collect.- Too much backstory that isn't a part of the actual game.Buy this game if:- It's under $10- You want to experience a compelling story, and don't mind reading bits about the backstory as you find it(collectibles)- Don't mind Quick Time Events because they pop up out of no where in the middle of cutscenes of every boss battle.Don't buy this game if:- You want a game with lots of exploring- Achievement points(Not worth it, you can get about 350G from playthrough on Hard, rest is collectibles and such)I personally give this game a 3, only because of the story and the combat after I had unlocked all the combos.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00DV16N6U","description":"","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"Not perfect, but still brilliant","reviewText":"&#34;Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus&#34; is the epilogue to the &#34;Future&#34; trilogy that began with &#34;Tools of Destruction&#34;, and it is short. There's no way around that fact. However, for some reason, for me, the shortness actually works in the game's favor. The story follows the inseparable lombax Ratchet and little robot backpack Clank as they travel into the Zarkov Sector of the Polaris Galaxy - a sector that is said to be haunted. The story crosses five planets (six if you count a planet where you can replay certain puzzle sections, which I'll go into below) altogether, highlighting the short narrative.The story isn't fantastic. It isn't nearly as good as the trilogy's. Still, it is better than the original games' stories and ties into the &#34;Future&#34; trilogy's story quite well, complete with some fantastic nods to the series' continuity. The loose ends that are left from the trilogy are still here at the forefront, and we even get to see plenty of familiar faces - many of whom brought honest-to-goodness warm fuzzies to my heart! All I can say without giving too much away is that we meet two dangerous new foes who have something to do with the haunted sector, and Ratchet and Clank must once again race to save the galaxy.The gameplay is actually a lot of fun. There's a planet that's mostly swampland where you can hunt gargathons for their horns to exchange for important gadgets, or bolts. There's a planet with a Battleplex-like arena where you can compete for bolts. All the standard/traditional R&C; moves are there, and there's new gadgets and weapons to spice things up a bit. Weapons still level up (only six levels this time). Some moves are mapped to buttons that aren't typical for the serious, so if you switch between this game and one of the &#34;Future&#34; entries, you might have some problems remembering what button throws the wrench. Lock-strafe is still available, although it leaves a slightly annoying crosshair on permanently when it's turned on. Puzzles are back, from platforming to a new 2D segment called &#34;Netherverse puzzles&#34;, where Clank can manipulate gravity to solve intricate, mind-bending puzzles (the ones you can replay by selecting a certain planet later in the game). Skill points have also returned and mercifully have descriptions available from the start to help you out.What isn't so great are the graphics. The difference between this game and the &#34;Future&#34; entries is almost astonishing at times. The cutscenes don't look as good and the character models aren't as polished. There seems to be some pixelation at some points, and there's some evidence that the environments just aren't as meticulously polished as other entries. That being said, the colors pop, the environments are lush enough besides some hiccups, and the atmosphere is perfect. The game has far fewer NPCs than other entries, and even, at times, very few enemies, but this actually makes things work out very well in emphasizing the &#34;haunted and abandoned&#34; Zarkov Sector. Eerie ghost-like entities flying through the air and making soft whispering sounds really add to the creepiness factor in brilliant ways. Being able to go long stretches with only a few enemies and plenty of small puzzles make this creepy factor go up even more. Personally, I loved the atmosphere, and have played the game several times over since buying it on launch day.What surprised me, ultimately, was how hard this game could be! Playing on &#34;Cadet&#34; mode is recommended to get the gist of the story and start leveling weapons, because playing Challenge Mode on &#34;Hero&#34; difficulty was unexpectedly much more difficult than my first time through. By the time I got to Challenge Mode on &#34;Legend&#34;, it caused a lot of deaths and plenty of frustration, particularly the bosses and some platforming puzzles. Yes, this game can be very difficult, but that's rather refreshing, as I haven't had a genuine R&C; challenge since &#34;Going Commando&#34; on the PS2 (and its HD remaster on the PS3).Overall, while not perfect, this game is a return to form that gives me hope for the future of the series. Here's hoping Insomniac gives us another fantastic entry on the PS4, and that they continue the story that really only began with &#34;Tools of Destruction&#34; - there's still lots of loose ends, and still an intriguing story to tell. 4.5/5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2013"}

I think it's odd to slap the Paper Mario title on the game and then make it seem like it's an RPG, but of course, the trailers showed it wasn't an RPG at all. It's like it was trying to combine an RPG and a platformer and you get this weird game that doesn't fit into either category. So expect lots of talking and clicking through dialogue.Super Paper Mario is not known for its gameplay alas. Rather it's known for its compelling story. The story seems to be similar to the first two games. Peach is kidnapped and the Mario brother assume that Bowser the one to kidnap her...only when they get there, Bowser reveals that he was going to but missed her. It turns out Peach was kidnapped by a mysterious figure named Count Bleck. Count Bleck then decides to kidnap Bowser, his henchman and Luigi leaving Mario in a place called Flipside where he's awoken up by a pixl named Tippi. Mario soon learns that Count Bleck's goal is to destroy everything with the Void that was written in the Dark Prognosticus and that the Light Prognosticus was made to counter the end of the world. To do this, he must find the Pure Hearts of every world.Meanwhile, Count Bleck forces Bowser and Peach into a marriage to start the end of the world as a forced marriage with no love (on one side) means the end. Peach later escapes after the marriage and joins Mario in the battle to collect the Pure Hearts (thus setting her off in this game as an action girl and the one that needs saving is Luigi). Bowser would soon escape and join Mario and Peach to get back at Count Bleck while Luigi is...The story is noticeably darker because Count Bleck's goal is the destruction of the universe while previous villains like Bowser was just selfish and wanted Peach or the Shadow Queen being an evil monarch that could only be released with the right vessel and stands out by being the most sympathetic villain while trying to complete his goal. The story is also not afraid to explore all the different types of love. The power of love is the essential theme in this series whether it's romantic love, platonic love, unrequited love, family love, etc. In fact, all the villains are driven by love. Either for the affection of someone, the love of attention or the love of destruction (in Dimentio's case, he would be lust for destruction instead of love).Which reminds me, the villains are the best part of Super Paper Mario. All have very good backstories. While Count Bleck's backstory is fleshed out for every chapter completed, the other characters have to do sidequests in order to learn about their motivation for joining Count Bleck...and of course, you get creepy implications as a result. Still Mimi and Dimentio are still the craziest Mario villains ever created. Dimentio is like the Joker of the franchise and that says something especially with how he's probably the villain with the highest kill count in the franchise.And I swear this game is the main reason why I always assumed that Mario and Luigi weren't as close as the creator would like us to believe. With this game and Smash Brothers Brawl though, I see a lot of self loathing on Luigi's part. But I disgrace.The game is relatively easier than the previous two given it's not an RPG. As a result, it's easy to abuse the level up system (which is set instead of you choosing what you want it to be). You're limited to just jumping and using items which limits your attack method and many of the stages is getting from point A to point B instead of an open area. (Then again it's a flip side/flop side). Mario can switch between 2D and 3D to get past certain obstacles but other than that, its not that useful in boss battles where characters like Dimentio love to follow you around. Peach's special ability is being able to use her parasol as a shield from above and was made to be easy to handle Mimi in battle. Bowser has the special ability of doing more damage and being able to use his flames (which is very broken in comparison) and while you don't get Luigi until near the end of the game, he jumps higher...and that's honestly it. Why Luigi isn't available until the end is part of the plot, but seriously, I like what this game did for Luigi in terms of expanding his personality and giving a lot of implications for fanfiction writers and other people to work with because Brawl took this personality and ran away with it.Overall, this game is great...despite it not being an RPG so while the game is easier, I rated it high because of the wonderful story of love and betrayal making it the darkest Mario game up to date. I swear the things this game gets away with is amazing and that's only because of its cute graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2013"}

The city of Chicago looks great on PS3 and the detailed effects when it rains is here just like PS4. Too many grab this,drive here and then drive here missions which gets repetitive. The hacking is fun and its what really keeps you in the game world. The cops are not like GTA,they will tail you to the death so use barriers on tight corners. The driving reminds me of True Crime NYC, BAD. The NPCs in the game are entertaining and you will come across people fighting,stabbing,robbing and shooting. Up to you to get involved if you want to help. Overall Watchdogs is a great game with tons to do, but some of the missions/side missions get repetitive.

For PS3, in my opinion the titles that really separate themselves from the crowd are few and far between. Either they are multiplatform releases, or have technical issues or bugs compared to their xbox360 counterparts. There have been 3 that really wowed me, though. The first was Uncharted, the second was Killzone 2, and now this title is the 3rd. Uncharted two is everything the first was and more. Graphically this pushes the system to a limit I haven't seen before. From a gameplay point of view, there's intense action, gunfights, racing, and the awesome multiplayer modes. The music is engaging and well-composed and the voice acting is top-notch. This game deserves the high reviews the game sites have been giving it.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A Masterpiece of Gaming - A Must Own Game","reviewText":"Having just finished Uncharted 2: Among Thieves I can safely say it's one of the best games I've ever played. In 20 plus years of gaming U2 has set a new high bar that games will be aspiring to for years. To the people at Naughty Dog, you deserve a pat on the back and a \"job well done\"!To those new to Uncharted the best way I can think to describe the game is that it's equal parts Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider. In U2 you'll be controlling Nathan Drake and partnering up with a cast of characters - some returning including Sully and Elena from the first Uncharted game - and some new. This time Drake and his cohorts are on a quest to find the lost treasure of Marco Polo. As the story goes, after spending 20 years in the court of Kublai Khan, Marco Polo set sail with 600 crew and 14 ships loaded with treasures from the east. However, when Marco Polo arrived at his destination a year and a half later only one ship and 18 crew survived the voyage. In U2 you'll follow in the steps of Marco Polo to try and track down the lost treasure. The adventure will take you from the jungles of Borneo to the mountain peaks of Nepal and everywhere in between.It's tough to pick out what my favorite part of the game is because every aspect of the game is so good. However, what really sets Uncharted apart is the story and the voice actors that turn video game characters into believable people. U2 sets the bar at a new high for quality voice work. From minute to minute the game is action packed as you engage in gun battles in the streets of Nepal or hang off a towering cliff in some remote mountain top. All of that is sewn together by fantastic cut-scenes that further the story expertly. At the right times Naughty Dog saw fit to add just enough comic relief through small gestures or even Drake himself that you'll find yourself laughing out loud. Serious credit has to go to the writers at Naughty Dog and the voice actors themselves.Another area that really impressed me are the graphics. I'm no stranger to PS3 exclusives that push the envelope of console graphics but Uncharted 2 is nothing short of incredible and rivals the best graphics of any game. In retrospect it's a lot of the little things that add up to form such an impressive and seamless experience. For example other than an initial load time when you first boot up the game and in between chapters U2 lacks the frequent load times that plague other games. Couple that with the fact that the game installs very minimal game data and it's an impressive feat. What that adds up to though is a more seamless and thus better presentation when playing through the game virtually interruption free. The environments in U2 are incredibly detailed too. Areas of the game that take place in urban areas feature an almost unbelievable amount of detail from individual bricks to everyday consumer items strewn about the war-torn city. In short this game will impress almost anyone with it's amazing graphics and presentation!New to the Uncharted series is a full compliment of online multiplayer modes. Initially before playing the game I was a bit dubious and skeptical that Naughty Dog could successfully implement a decent multiplayer mode into Uncharted. The game is after all about the single player experience - or so I thought. I can safely say after playing numerous hours online that Uncharted 2 features an excellent, addictive and entertaining online mode. The different gameplay options vary from competitive to cooperative modes. On the competitive side you can choose from traditional game types like 'deathmatch' or modes where every player is individually after a hidden treasure on the map working against each other for it. Cooperative modes include objectives based game modes where you work together to accomplish a set of objectives in a level. My favorite mode would have to be 'arena' where you work to destroy wave after wave of enemies to progress to further more challenging rounds.The online portion of Uncharted 2 features a full range of unlockables including player skins from characters in the single player portion of the game, weapons, boosters (increase the stats of the various weapons), taunts and a range of other options.All told Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a brilliant game from start to finish with plenty of reasons to keep playing after the single player portion is complete. A definite must own for PS3 owners! Buy this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

MGS2 is well, MGS2. Good game, but not my favorite in the series.As far as the HD collection goes - it's OK but has it's problems. First of all, this is NOT the kind of full-blown game rebuild like Twin Snakes was. All that was really done was to bump the games resolution and make it display correctly in 16x9, Enable Peace Walker online play through PSN (which granted is big), and improve the peace walker controls (also big), and add trophy support. MGS 2 and MGS 3 include all the additional content, which includes the excellent original Metal Gear 1 & 2 games from the MGS 3: Subsistence disc.Now, here are my gripes:#1: No MGS1, no Twin snakes. This seems like a major oversight to me, especially given the next issue#2: NO improvements to the graphics have been made at all other than resolution and going to 16x9. The unimproved textures and in some cases animation does not hold up as well as you would think, even for MGS 3, and given this, the next thing is completely inexcuseable#3: FRAMERATE ISSUES. yes, you heard me right. MGS3 has framerate issues. How is this even possible?

I was a little reserved prior to buying it because there are some really wierd scenes I had seen on X-Play on day but I decided to give it a go. The price was really great so I went with it.To say that I had played anything like this would be a straight out lie. This is one of the most original gameplay styles I have ever played. I will admit that I did cut thru all the cutscenes since they were a little over the top for me, but the actual gameplay was truely addictive. While there could have been more levels that were slightly varied, there is a good amount of gameplay available that you won't get sick of for a good long while. The controls are simple enough to use (simply two analog joysticks) and takes about 10 minutes to get a grip with but after that you will be rolling along like a pro. While the object is to increase the size of your Katamari (the little ball that everything sticks to) you can only pick up items that fit and as your ball grows, you can pick up larger and larger items. I literally was able to pick up entire islands and mountains and waterspouts on one level. You have to be careful when rolling cause if you hit something like a wall too hard pieces of your ball will come flying off reducing the size of your ball.The ultimate goal is to put the stars back in the sky and the bigger the ball you collect, the bigger your star will be.

I kept killing my momentum trying to change directions and hitting corners, and unable to unlock 'biggest katamari' content.  Really wish the controls were better.If your hand-eye abilities are superior this is an excellent game.  Rolling up landscape features without progression gets tiresome though, and after continual failures I put down the game.  Because this is the easiest and first Katamari game, I have never bought another.Great for kids, harder and perhaps unsuitable for an adult gamer with limited time.

I've played around with YSF 2012 for a few hours, and I must say it's a big improvement, but sometimes I think Ubisoft is slow. The formula for the first YSF was very good, and this one is better, but the main issues were still not addressed. For instance, if I'd like to have a long cardio boxing workout without squatting, I have only 2 choices. I either have to choose the beginner class over and over, or choose the advanced course and get only half the credit for only punching. As someone who was really into bodybuilding, I know that squats and lunges (legs in general) are the hardest group of muscles to work out. At least, there could be a system incorporated in which you can get credit for a partial squat, but there isn't. This will turn a lot of elderly people off, and people who aren't in shape. I wish Ubisoft would catch on, and realize that some people will never advance to the level of performing lunges and squats.Overall, it's a lot better than the first installment, and I mean A LOT better in regards to fun and moving from one menu to the next. The biggest improvement is definitely in the Wallbreaker and Stack 'Em Up activities. It's a worthy purchase, but I still believe there needs to be more of a fun factor which is missing, but was present inWalk It OutorThe Fight: Lights Out.

It is a remake of the older series of games, but this time around the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL give it a 3D spin that really adds to the gameplay sensation.  The idea behind Kid Icarus: Uprising is simple.  Our main character Pit is an angel who can't fly...until a friendly Goddess comes along and promises to help him get his wings to work.  The downside is, she can't keep him aloft more than 5 minutes before the power starts to overheat and he'll crash.  This makes for a perfect excuse to switch the gameplay with regularity so it doesn't get old.  You spend your flying times whooshing through the air shooting at everything that flies across your path.  There will be obstacles you need to fly through to avoid damage and there will be times you do nothing but dodge anti-air assaults from all angles.  Once you become ground-bound, you spend your time loping along shooting and close-up melee-attacking all sorts of weird monsters, many of which are the same ones who menaced you in the air.  There are platforms and 'springs' that vault you up and there are even quirky bits, like climbing into a tank and running it along the ground while shooting.While playing Kid Icarus feels a whole lot like \"Galaga meets After-Burner\", the 3D aspect really adds to the enjoyment.  The way the depth effects are explored gives you the sensation of peering through a window into the world, and from time to time the soaring and flying portions can be enjoyable just to watch.All is not perfect with Kid Icarus however:  gameplay involves moving the circle-pad, constantly pulling the left shoulder-button above it for your trigger, and using the other hand with the stylus to control your aim.  It's a bit disconnected, using the stylus on the bottom screen to control the crosshairs on the top screen, and using the supplied stand doesn't seem to help this much.  When things get fast and frenzied, it's hard to keep the screen perfectly level to your eyes so the 3D effects don't start to skew and double your vision.  If not for the unwieldy control scheme (or perhaps the 3D effects' unforgiving field of view), this game would be perfect.Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fun shooter with a sense of humor and an arcade feel to it.  It makes good use of the 3D environment offered by the Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL.  It can be hard to control, but ultimately the experience is rewarding.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization.

Grau","summary":"Been done before and done better.","reviewText":"With all the comparisons to Fallout 3, I expected a lot. It didn't come close. Even after adjusting my ideas of what to expect, it still wasn't all that great.First the good. As advertised, there really is bazillions of guns. The vehicles are nice and there is a little combat with them, but they're really just meant to get from A to B faster. It is a good length game and the multiplayer is where the game shines. And the little robots are really enjoyable to listen to and watch, as are the hockey mask attackers. And the RPG-like customization works well for this FPS.Now the bad. I hope you like the desolate wasteland, because that's what you're going to see. The entire. Freaking. Game. There is a moment toward the end it changes, but seeing the same landscape, regardless what area you're in, gets mindnumbing. The story is as shallow as a kiddie pool. When there is a lot of action going on, the screen gets glitchy. The bosses will kill you quick, regardless of your arsenal unless you know the tactic to beat them. And when I say \"them\" I mean that the same tactic is used for pretty much all of them.All in all, it's not a bad game, and if you can get it for cheap or wait until the price drops, it'll be worth it. But unless youre a huge fan of online multiplayer, spend the $60 on something else.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Andrew Hamada","summary":"FFX: Square's response to consumers!","reviewText":"In the latest addition to Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series, Square proves to us that it actually listens to reader feedback.  Numerous changes to the gaming style have been incorporated into this sequel, which I'll talk about as follows:GRAPHICS: The PS2's power truly shines here.  Abandoning pre-rendered backgrounds for the majority of the game, Final Fantasy finally becomes a fully 3D active environment.  Lighting, water/sky effects, and the like all prove that the PS2 is capable of handling graphical miracles.  In what has to be the best choice in the history of the game, almost all of the game's cutscenes are delivered with the in-game graphics engine, instead of repeatedly cutting to FMV.  The PS2's huge polygon support allowed Square to create character models fully capable of displaying extraordinary realism.  Every character moves freely at natural joints, in natural ways, and follow no rigid animations (unlike previous games, where all the &quot;shocked&quot; appearances were the same, etc.).  The FMV, while stunning, is used sparingly, something I think is greatly beneficial to the flow of the game (especially since the FMV in all the Final Fantasy games just seems to lack compared to the movie...obviously).MUSIC/SOUND: Uematsu's finest suite of compositions thusfar debuts in X.  Catchy, upbeat and un-repetetive music makes you want to turn up the stereo system.  In addition to great remixes of old, familiar tunes (the new rendition of the chocobo theme is jazzy, and sounds great), Uematsu included great new music, including a new battle them.  Definitely a compilation that collectors will want to own on CD.  This is also the first Final Fantasy to feature voice acting for every major character in the game.  While a nice touch, I wish Square had included the ability to turn the voices off (Tidus, the title character, is a bit too annoying after a while for me...and I like imagining what the characters sound like for myself!).STORYLINE/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: In my opinion, the best story sequence Square has ever produced.  Although linear (like all Final Fantasies are, and have to be in order to deliver a story effectively), the game focuses much more on character development instead of around the central &quot;beat-the-big-bad-guy&quot; goal.  I really get a feel for every character introduced.  And, unlike MANY of the previous games, there are few sudden &quot;here's-a-new-ultimate-badguy-that-you-never-saw-coming&quot; types.  Hooray!GAMEPLAY: This is where Square proves it listens to customer feedback.  Previous complaints about the series include overly numerous random encounters, complicated development systems, and stupid puzzles.  The random encounters have been greatly reduced (and are easy to escape from should you not want to participate).  The new &quot;leveling system,&quot; while complex looking at first, is much simpler than previous games.  Character ability increase occurs through the accumulation and distribution of AP and equipment, and believe me: much simpler than the junction system or similar.  Much, much simpler.  The puzzles, in the form of temple trials, are challenging but able to be solved by logic, the way puzzles should be.  Square also ditched the Active Time Battle system, allowing you to fight at your own pace and plan strategies with much more accuracy.  Fighting strategies have also changed, since most characters are able to kill most enemies with one hit because they can exploit a specific weakness.Oh, and blitzball is the most addictive &quot;mini-game&quot; (it's not exactly mini) ever.  And unlike the card game in FFIX, you actually get a reward for being the best.The only beef I have with the game is that there isn't nearly as much room for exploration through most of the game.  In previous Fantasies, dungeons were larger and offered you more freedom to explore and find rare items.  In this series, however, dungeons are almost always linear, with one obvious path you can follow and only a few items on the side.Overall, worth buying.  FF junkies and newer gamers alike will embrace this game as a great investment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00004UE0V","description":"Lewis Carroll's 19th-century fantasy has been reinvented many times, most famously by Walt Disney. And now American McGee, one of the designers behind theQuakeandDoomseries, issues his addition to the Looking Glass legends withAmerican McGee's Alice. Players take on the role of a wiser, more industrious heroine who sets out in this third-person 3-D action game to free Wonderland from the tyranny of the Queen of Hearts. Alice will confront a host of weird creatures in surreal settings and solve numerous puzzles through more than 15 levels of gameplay.","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"An incredibly beautiful game with emphasis on the surreal","reviewText":"The initial concern I had with this game is the potential controversy this title could generate.  On the cover you're seeing a bloodstained little girl wielding a knife and lately the game companies have been churning out FPS games that rely more on excessive gore and satanic references than anything else.  Fortunately, I can say this game is a creepy enough to deserve the &quot;M&quot; rating (definitely not for small children), but the emphasis is on the surreal and the violence is not terribly overdone.  Other reviewers report bugs.  Visual glitches?  Haven't seen any.  I have a P266 with 128MB RAM and a Voodoo3. With the settings down to a minimum the game runs fine with the exception of some of the fight scenes where the framerates get choppy. I may have to break down (finally) and upgrade.  I think the system requirements Amazon listed are incorrect.  I wouldn't suggest getting it unless you have at least a P350, 128MB RAM and a fast video card (3DFX or NVidia).Visually, this game is chock full of eye candy.  Clocks sway back and forth, steam churns out of the chimneys of mushroom houses, and Alice makes her journeys through giant gardens, castles, outer space, and swirling tunnels and passageways reminiscent of the Twilight Zone.  Lots of color and lighting effects - I'm going to go out on a limb by saying it's the most beautiful game I've seen yet.The gang's all here - from the white rabbit to the cheshire cat to humpty dumpty, everyone's been rendered and animated in painstaking detail.  Most of the game's characters (and maybe their programmers) have spent less time eating and more of their time in the clubs, tattoo parlors or on drugs as hinted at by the game's L-oad S-ave D-elete screen.  The voice acting is well done and the music, infused with a combination of bells, xylophones, and children's wind-up toys, is especially atmospheric.  Another nice feature is the super-quick quicksave which easily allows you to return to where you last left off.The gameplay, on the other hand, is remarkably normal.  I spent the first part of the game jumping around on all these places I wasn't supposed to be and tried hacking my way into mushroom houses or into caves and passages I thought I could fit in.  Eventually I realized the game plays like your basic linear FPS.  The only difference?  There's a madness meter that drops based on how much she uses her weapons.  If she whacks too many people and it drops to zero, Alice is reduced to just using her knife for reasons I'm still unclear about.  There's a sprinkling of puzzles here and there, mostly platform jumping or switch flipping, but nothing too difficult (good!)  Overall, I'd have to say the gameplay is probably the weakest point of the game.  There just isn't much to do.  Quake or Unreal players wanting fast action are going to be disappointed.  Instead, you more or less wander from place to place, checking out the scenery, defeating whoever is in the room, then figuring out where to go next.That's not to say it's not fun to play - at the time of this review it is still one of my top picks and good enough to deserve 4 stars.  It's just not one of those games that's going to keep you up all night like Half Life, Civilization or Command and Conquer.  Perhaps that's a good thing?If you want the eye candy, get this game.  If you're more into gameplay, check out No One Lives Forever.  Hope my review helped!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2000"}

There's a decent selection of songs, but there could (and should) be more, but that's only a minor, personal gripe.
