{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"A return to the fun that has been missed since AC Brotherhood","reviewText":"O man, this is the closest you will get to play Pirates of the Caribbean without trampling all over the Disney license to do so!  So,  here is the kicker, the plot of the game isn't just about Edward Kenway, Connor's grandfather.  The plot of the game really is how Abstergo is still digging into the memory DNA of Desmond Miles and using them to make an entertainment company as a front to hire people to dig through these memories as they try to find the Golden Apple.  And the way its done in the opening of the game really made me laugh aloud as is was so slickly done.  Truth be told if you have played this series from the very beginning, you will see numerous winks and nods throughout and you will see what kind of work Ubisoft really put into making this game.  But asides from that, yes, you get to play as Edward and unlike ACIII where it seemingly took forever to see what made Connor into what he was, this game comes right out at you and shows how Edward nearly blunders his way into the shadow war between the Assassins and Templars.  As far as i am into the game, it tells the story very well and it was very hard to pull myself away.  As far as the controls, if you played one, then you have played them all and for some reason this time around it seems like the climbing mechanic is more fluid than it has been since ACII. For the few hours that I played last night, the game itself was a big joy because you really feel like you are rooting for Edward because at so many points you know that he got in over his head but its up to you to get him out and it's fun in doing so.  Whether you are escorting governors, or breaking into prisons stealthily, you still sometimes feel like a spectator while simultaneously taking control of the action as you do all that is needed to 'save the day'.  There are other distractions as well. You can gamble, go on contract kills to earn money and much more. This game is so far nearly as good in open world fun as Red Dead Redemption was.  The only mixed feelings I have on the game are the graphics and partly because the PS4 / X box One is right around the corner.  In some ways the game engine is really starting to show its age and while its one of the better looking games in its class, it makes me want to see how the next gen systems will take advantage of the graphics engine and better yet, what's in store for the next installment.  However, if you are a fan of this series and can't wait until next month for the next gen, go on and play this now to tide yourself over until then.  So far it's a great story and a fun way to play pirate without having to watch Johnny Depp steal the spotlight.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000B2YR74","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Still Life in \"Half-Life\"...","reviewText":"For those who missed the PC version of \"Half-Life 2\" (an understandable venture considering Valve's insistence on using their Steam network), the Xbox port is, happily, one of the best shooters available on said console, certainly rivaling \"Halo\" if not out and out exceeding it. While there are some issues that indicate this was a game designed for PCs first and foremost, it is an otherwise exceptional piece of work that truly captures the feel of the original \"Half-Life\" while simultaneously ushering it into the new era.You once again assume the role of Gordon Freeman, a tight-lipped scientist apparently more in his element carrying machine guns around than beakers or test tubes. Awakening some time after the Black Mesa incident from game one, he finds himself in City 17 - a futuristic slum, mostly, overlooked by a massive tower and policed by a group known as the Combine. The game is a little too careful not to fill in all the gaps, but suffice it to say that a rebellion is forming to combat the Combine, and Gordon proves to be their reluctant leader. The characters and the aura of City 17 and its surrounding areas are enough to make up for the shortcomings of the story, which despite being vague is still pretty engrossing.The first \"Half-Life\" is regarded as one of the best games of all time, so Valve wisely chose not to fix something that wasn't broken. True to form, the game never rips you from Gordon Freeman's point of view, choosing instead to convey the story in a realistic fashion devoid of movie style cutscenes. This is perhaps the series' most innovative and immersive feature, and one that has never been replicated as successfully. You truly feel like Gordon Freeman, surrounded by the sights and sounds that are City 17. The game's story appears to flow in real time, so it all just has this cohesive quality that really gives you a sense of being there.The first-person combat is no slouch either. The weapons available all pack quite a punch, and some are truly inspired. The crowbar returns in a nod to the original (and it can certainly come in handy if ammo's scarce), but newcomers like the gravity gun really steal the show. This device is versatile enough to allow you to fling saw blades at approaching zombies or manipulate a stack of crates so that you can build a barricade to protect you from encroaching Combine troops. This is easily the most useful items in the game, as well as one of its selling points. The knockoff in \"Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil\" can't even hold a candle to it. That said, virtually all of the weapons have their place and are satisfying to use - although the revolver is entirely disposable thanks to its lack of ammo.The enemies can become repetitive - much of the game consists of gunning down same-looking Combine troops and, to a lesser extent, zombies (the product of those headcrabs we all loved so much from the first game). That said, there are still some truly inspiring encounters, such as late game battles with Striders, \"War of the Worlds\" style tripods that are essentially walking gunships, as well as a new and frightening breed of zombie that runs full speed ahead while shrieking with abandon. It's just too bad there aren't a few more of these foes in the game, as the Combine make up the brunt of what you'll face, and they're not nearly as intelligent or as crafty as the human opponents in the original game. It's reasonable to expect artificial intelligence at least as good as the first game's back in 1998, but, sadly, it's not on display here.In a conceit to games like \"Halo\" and \"Far Cry,\" \"Half-Life 2\" includes a few drivable vehicles, and while these are a nice addition at times, they certainly overstay their welcome. Some portions of the game just run on too long for their own good, but it's an exception rather than the rule. There's usually some new challenge lurking behind every corner, and it provides that rare addictive quality that the first game had in spades. To top it off, the graphics, even stripped to their basics for the Xbox, are quite impressive. Characters are amazingly lifelike, particularly in their facial expressions. Environments are equally charismatic, each one having that sense of being a real place despite the far-fetched nature of the \"Half-Life\" setting. There's atmosphere to spare. Other first-person games should certainly take notes.The graphics come at a price, however. Unfortunately this port suffers from a sometimes unstable frame rate. It's nothing major, but it can be a little distracting at times. It's certainly the game's chief weakness, but to take a pass on it if you haven't already played the PC version would be a major mistake. This is an awesome game - not \"Best Game Ever\" material, as some legitimate game reviewers have claimed (see PC Gamer) - but nonetheless a worthy successor to a classic that retains the feel of the original in a way that few next generation sequels can. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Good game but bad sequel? Possibly","reviewText":"Some masterpieces/classics seem to be called that because of the massive attention/hype it got. Or people call them successes despite the many flaws(witness Matrix Reloaded, big money maker but totally lousy sequel). Chrono Cross got big marks in magazines on initial release yet people now look at it as a far inferior sequel to Chrono Trigger and just an good game overall but not great. I think it's good but way too hyped and dropped the ball syndrome all over the place.Story: You play as Serge, another silent protaganist, who, on an errand for a childhood friend is swept into another dimension, one where people talk about him in the past tense and soldiers seem to be after him. Like any other game, it's about finding out about one thing but realizing it's far bigger than that.Graphics: Back when the game came out, these were great. Today, they're still colorful and vibrant. Your home village, Arni Village, for example is lush and beautiful that you want it to be actually real since it looks like the perfect vacation spot. Battle graphics are great as well but just like in Trigger, the overworld graphics are poor but that's alright.Sound/Music: Whenever people mention the music, they always mention the opening track as a good \"tester\" for the soundtrack. It's a great track with the others being as memorable as well. A very lighthearted and \"bouncy\" soundtrack. No voice acting though, which is ok since the characters speak in accents/dialects at times so you kind of fill it in in your mind.Gameplay: Like in Chrono Trigger, enemies are on screen before you fight them so you can avoid them but as always, it helps to beef up. Fighting is a bit different where, like in Xenogears, you get 3 actions: high, medium, low. Basically you got 7 stamina to work with and each attack takes away some of it(so you can have a combination of low(which is 1), medium(2) and high(3). Any combination that combines to 7 works but you can defend which'll raise it better for next time.Instead of magic, you got colored techs. Basically every magic attack has a certain color attached to it and characters have an innate color like their own personal color. So if you're a white innate, your enemy is black, red is blue and green is yellow. If there's been 3 colors in a row cast by anyone, a summon can be called. It's easy enough to follow but one event extremely late in the game requires specific order of them and it's oh-so-irritating.Instead of Chrono Trigger's 6 or so characters, you have 40(!) to deal with which makes it awful since many of them don't even have backstory, they just talk in funny accents and that's it. It's very unfortunate since CT had such lovable characters, even Magus was likable, here it's basically favorites. \"She's cute, he looks cool\" etc. In CT, I had to debate who to bring, here it's just whoever looks the best.For best results play CT...then play it again, then play Chrono Cross. That way if you're disappointed, you can just go to Chrono Trigger again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00004TC6E","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"UNO ON STEROIDS","reviewText":"If you've ever played the card game UNO then you already have a small insight into the game that is CHRONO CROSS (CC), a pseudo-sequel to the legendary SNES game CHRONO TRIGGER.COMBAT: 3/5The combat in CC reminded me alot of FINAL FANTASY 8--both games have really original, complicated battle systems that allow for great depth at the price of user-friendliness. Unlike FF8 where magic is \"drawn\", the magic in CC revolves around colors and playing them at the right times--like a crazy game of UNO. Unfortunately, the game doesn't explain the combat system very well. In addition, despite the huge cast of characters, there are almost no double or triple techs--something that would have encouraged mixing your parties up to try different combinations. Even worse, the game PUNISHES you for using your characters in battle--if a character dies, everyone else (to include the guys sitting it out on the sidelines) gets to gain status upgrades except the dead ones. Finally, although almost all enemy encounters can be avoided, one is whisked away to a \"combat screen\" to duke things out. It would have been nice if they had somehow kept the battles on the game screen itself.CHARACTERS: 3/5This time around, it looks like Squaresoft went the way of \"Quantity, not Quality\". There are LOTS of characters you can enlist in your party, but most of them aren't very well developed or very interesting. Serge/Lynx tries hard to be a Magus, but doesn't quite cut it. Also, was Squaresoft so short on ideas that they had to give nearly every character some Earthly dialect? For this being a fantasy video game, there sure are alot of French, Germans, Blonde Californians, Scots, and others running about.STORY: 3/5For me, the first part of the game was really slow and didn't pick up until after the psychedelic \"Pastel-Color\" World. After that, the game really started to pick up pace as better spells and techs were acquired and more characters joined up.On the down side, most of the \"revelations\" don't occur until almost the very end, which seems to indicate to me that the plot was not as developed as it could have been. There are also many times where you will be visiting and revisiting the same areas, resulting in a disappointing feeling of deja vu. A little more variety and difference between the parallel worlds/multiverses would have been most welcome.SOUND: 4/5This is where the game really shines. CHRONO CROSS definitely carries the torch forward with its excellent soundtrack, even despite the fact that some of the better \"tracks\" are only heard once or twice. There are also some GREAT Youtube videos of piano covers of some of the songs.GRAPHICS: 4/5For the Playstation, the graphics are certainly up to par for that era. There are quite a few FMV's and in keeping with the UNOish color-theme, there are TONS of colors used in this game. Sometimes I felt that there were too many colors on screen, making it sometimes difficult to distinguish between objects and characters. There are often objects/secrets one can interact with, but finding them can be a real challenge as they blend in with the environment so well.OVERALL . . .As a stand-alone game, CHRONO CROSS is actually one of the better RPGs one could have bought for the Playstation. As a sequel to CHRONO TRIGGER it is less satisfying, but still draws enough parallels that one can see how the two games are related. In a way, CHRONO CROSS suffered the same fate as FINAL FANTASY 8. After the deafening shouts of approval for FINAL FANTASY 7, it was inevitable that the sequel would fall short, and I feel that this is also what happened to this game. It's not that FINAL FANTASY 8 and CHRONO CROSS are bad games, they just had ungodly expectations to live up to and in the case of CHRONO CROSS, sometimes even met the challenge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}

Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% &ldquo;green&rdquo; habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth&rsquo;s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?KEY FEATURES:Not Just Another Hero&ndash; Brink&rsquo;s advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character &ndash; allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.

Lang \"Chris L.\"","summary":"I don't know what game people are playing...","reviewText":"I must say, this was one of the first games that I've played in single player before online multi.  (I owned Bad Company 2 for 4 months before bothering to complete the short single-player campaign.)  After trying this by myself and reading the reviews, I was really worried I had purchased another Homefront.Then my brother in law called, saying he'd picked it up and had 2 friends who had as well. \"Oh well...\" I figured, and logged onto XBL. Online co-op is a BLAST!!!  Sure, it's a VERY challenging game (the AI on the opposing team is brutal)...but that's not something I write-off a game over.Competitive online multiplayer is hit or miss.  Not because it's not fun, but rather because of some lag issues (I'm rocking 10 meg cable internet with latency under 40, and still get game-breaking lag about 1/4 of the time).  This doesn't affect every game, and I'm guessing it should be resolved soon.Tips:*Completing class-specific objectives is easiest immediately at the beginning of the game.  This is a game for efficient,fast, coordinated teamwork...not plodding, overly-tactical \"clear-and-advance\" gameplay.*Invest early-on in a few specific skills.  One will allow you to see around you while completing objectives...reducing the blindside-kills.  Another invaluable skill will allow you to complete objectives (Hacking, planting explosives, etc.) faster, reducing the amount of time you expose yourself to enemy fire.*Cooperate via microphone as much as you can...this game is ridiculously difficult by yourself.* NEVER STOP MOVING...Sure, it seems that this game is either loved or hated.  It's not Call of Duty, it's not Fallout 3.  What I see is a fairly deep shooter which provides a challenging (yet satisfying) co-op experience.Edited to add:This game truly shines in multiplayer...the single player performs more like Combat Training in BlOps than the \"seamless\" online/solo experience it was billed as.Multiplayer co-op is STILL the best part of this game.  It has me hooked still...although I'm curious to see if this game has any staying-power.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Trevor Larson","summary":"Another good game","reviewText":"Definitely one of my favorites!

Unfortunately, and beyond all expectation, it turned out to be a mediocre bore of a game.The graphics are pretty poor, but I try not to let that bother me. While the gameplay works on a design level -- controls do what they're supposed to -- Prototype just isn't very fun. You may look at videos and screenshots and ask, \"How can a game where you're a nasty superhero in an open city be less than awesome?\" I couldn't answer that for you, but it's true. The boss battles, combat, and story progression are all sub-standard. Even with the ability to purchase upgrades, nothing really drives you to keep playing. The story is quite weak, in the brooding tough-guy vein.Maybe this open-world genre is just getting long in the tooth. Maybe Radical just dropped the ball. Whatever the reason, I really didn't enjoy Prototype, and I wouldn't recommend it over similar games.

Allen","summary":"What a great way to start the new years!","reviewText":"I pre-ordered this off Amazon and I'm glad I did. When I played the first Left 4 Dead last year, I felt many things were missing. Namely the limited supplies of weapons, the lack of melee, the lack of map sizes, and the lack of various game modes. The thing I loved were the atmosphere, the hilarious characters, and just an overall fun way to co-op with 3 other strangers like you're really in a zombie apocalypse.When Left 4 Dead 2 was originally announced, I was a bit surprised that Valve would do that, but I quickly learned that it's really for the better. With Left 4 Dead 2, you get a new set of characters, multiple weapons, and added modes of plays.The new set of characters are great! When you play campaign mode, you are one of four survivors who somehow managed to be immune to the virus causing people to turn into zombies. It's non-stop hilarity as you make your way through malls, carnivals, rollercosters, love tunnels, swamps, hotels, and many other great things in the south. The interaction between the characters are just hilarious. You'll love it for sure.New weapons make this game great! Aside from guns, you now get melee weapons. So you want to run around with a machete like you're in Dawn of the Dead? You can do that! Do you want to run around with a samurai sword like in some bad kungfu movie? You can do that! Or do you want to run around with a chainsaw going crazy like you're some sort of fanatic last stand where the only thing between you and the almighty is your chainsaw? You can do that! The game has so many different melee weapons that it's hard not to satisfy someone's urge.As for weapons, you get many sorts. It's like the original where you get one main, one side (or melee), one bomb, one medical aid, and one medicine. The kicker is that you can choose from multiple main weapons. You can choose between AK47, Combat Rifles, M16, and a grenade launcher. Or if you feel like you're into sniping, you can pick up two different types of sniper rifles. Then there is the shotguns which you can choose from a ton of. So you're never going to get bored with this game. Also, you get an awesome D.Eagle, which just makes this game spectacular!Aside from weapons, there are a few new bonuses. For example, instead of a med pack, you can choose to pick up a defibrillator which can revive down characters rather than waiting until they show up in the next area (or in a closet). You also get a few other bonuses but the one worth mentioning is the new boomer vile which acts like a attraction of zombies so you can concentrate fire on one area, or use it against your enemies.The other added effect is that there are new bonuses to zombie damages. On the original, the explosive effects are fair to best. In this one, you get some cool damaging effects. For example if you tossed a pipebomb, zombies would crowd around it like the first, but the explosion would send them in the air which is sort of cool. Then there is the melee damages which can be awesome like some zombies missing an arm or such.The environment itself is way better than the first. You get multiple ways to go through a level but it's quite disappointing. They say the environment changes like one time it could be open and the next time you play it isn't. I found that this is a minor part of the game and only a few level actually does this. The level itself is way bigger than the original. The area is far and wide with many times doing crazy things. Like on one level you have to get this man a soda and when you do you're attacked by hundreds of crazed zombies. There are many things like it, but once you get used to it, it sort of becomes repetitive than exciting like the first time. Honestly I'd like to see a better system in place to \"renew\" the game. In some cases you get to do some hilarious things like play this shooting game at a carnival where you can win a gnome that if you carry through the entire campaign you get an achievement.The game itself has no story. You can play it offline, but that isn't really as fun as playing it online. Personally I think online play is a hit or miss. In many of the game modes, some people don't use mics to communicate with others. This can be a hit or miss because in most cases, it goes well, but if you get into trouble, like if a smoker pulls you, it can be hard to get help. I've noticed in this version, it occasionally pops up a text on your screen like, \"So-so is attached and needs your help\" or something like that. So it's helpful but sometimes it doesn't show. I'd figured that Valve would put in a redial menu like on the pc to communicate, but they didn't. You can still click the Left Thumbstick to make your character vocalize something like a space med kit or weapon, but I don't think it works as well as it should be.Another complaint I have is the achievement system. On the pc it announces when you made an achievement which is sort of cool because you can talk about it with the people you have. On the xbox, both the first and second one doesn't appear to feature this. I mean sometimes I get an achievement and I'd laugh about it, but then I'd have to explain to everyone about it rather than just talking out loud.Overall though, I'm very happy with this game. Sometimes online can get frustrating, but overall the new campaign system is very nicely done by valve. Hopefully they can start putting out more content next year to include the cast of the original, but that's wishful thinking. Overall if you like zombies, you're going to love this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWSQQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"Doesn't merit the Most Wanted name, but still a very good racer","reviewText":"The first Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2005) is still my most favorite racing game of all time. The police chases were fast, frenetic, and fun and had a pretty decent story that was the first interesting one in a racing game that I can remember (even better one than the Fast and Furious movies). This game is entirely different, which is bittersweet.With that said, this sequel, reboot, or whatever it is defined as has police chases, but they are not nearly as fun or intense as the original. In the original, there were specific sites that your vehicle could hit that would cause explosions, tip towers over, etc. to help lose the police and is sorely missed in this version. The mechanics of the chases themselves just don't feel as exciting. The only way to outrun police in the new version is to find the highway and outrun them. In the older version, going off-roading into the world's golf course or twisting and turning in new directions could lose the police. In typical Criterion fashion, this game does not have any story to it. Also, there is no customization to the cars.When you finally realize this is its own game, you realize how good it is. The game makes up for the disappointments with tons of great ideas. Autolog is back. Unlockables. VERY lifelike city. Very different range of cars from a Ford F150 to Forumala One racing car. You basically had to use a certain vehicle in the original to progress, but you can swap between about 40 or so cars at will using one or many to complete the game. This game promotes EXPLORATION, which is its finest trait. Knocking down billboards, finding cars, and speed cameras are a few of the things that the game rewards you for. With such a nice city, it takes awhile for it to get old. There's nothing like the freedom of an open road trying to find every nook and cranny where a new vehicle may be hiding.Like the previous Most Wanted game, it is just FUN. It is not the sequel I was expecting, but take out the Most Wanted title out and is is very good. Good enough to be my second favorite racer of all time (and I've played alot).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2012"}

MKT does just this, so for people only familiar with the 3D era this is what Armageddon was based off of. Every MK character up to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is in here, plus all the mechanics from UMK3 that everyone loved. The game introduces a new Aggressor meter which is the predecessor of the power meter in the new MK. Getting attacked will increase it (which is just text at the bottom that fills up which I really hate) and then you do extra damage while in Aggressor mode. The combo system is still intact as well as the weapons from UMK3.The 2D games were silky smooth and the graphics look great in Trilogy. Every level as well as a lot of fan favorite music is in the game (you can pull the soundtrack right off the disc.) Using the run button, pulling off a 5 hit combo, and then blocking, jumping around, and using all the signature moves brings back a great feeling of nostalgia. There are some secrets hidden in here such as a special code screen (1 button Fatalities are awesome), plus some original outfits like Raiden, and Kano's original outfit which also unlocks their original Fatality. Of course the game is best played with two people, but single player is also a lot of fun.There are a few minor problems like Shang Tsung's morphs require loading, load times between menu and fights, plus the game will freeze some times which is no good. I also wish maybe Test your Might would have come back, but this really just feels like Mortal Kombat: The Greatest Hits. I also hate how cheap the computer can be on even normal difficulties, plus Shao Kahn is one of the cheapest bosses in gaming history so good luck beating him. Overall this is the ultimate MK experience for the 16-bit era that made history. If you loved the older MK games then Trilogy is exactly what you need plus this is probably the last time you'll see Animalities and Brutalities.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001ZZNNI","description":"Admit it. You played it. You loved it. It might have been that first game that made you realize what was coming in this little hobby of ours. This is a perfect port of the original Super Mario Bros. Every last mushroom and goomba is accounted for, and you'll feel yourself slipping into a blissful recollection of your early days as a gamer. Just don't expect anything revolutionary here. The closest thing to newness is the ability to link up with another GBA to play with a friend, but don't worry. Two-player is still available on just one unit. If you're looking for innovation, check out the excellent Deluxe version on Game Boy Color. But for purists, this is the cream of the crop in retro goodness. So, if you're willing to drop the 20 gold coins for this one, enjoy your trip down memory lane.Rated:9 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:June 2004Subscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B0009WPZPE","description":"Dead or Alive 4 takes advantage of the superior technology of Xbox 360, to redefine 3D fighter games. Go wild with a new fighting system, larger tournament groups, detailed scoreboards and more. Form clans, or just enter the lobby areas to talk with other DOA fans.  Best of all, the fighting system allows even more mastery and strategy of your favorite character -- including the most complex DOA countering system yet!","reviewerName":"DarkDan \"DarkDan\"","summary":"THE WORST 360 game for beginners -- and the worse fighting game for 360","reviewText":"This is, without a doubt, the absolutely worse fighting game ever made. Tecmo has removed all the enjoyable elements including removing a difficulty level for beginners. If you aren't a DOA pro, you'll be pummled countless times while you just try to learn the controls. The computer will pull off 10x combos on you while you just try to land a punch or kick. What's worse, the game has 45 Achievements, including more than a dozen \"secrets\" which you must unlock. But you'll be so frustrated by this game that you won't even bother.The worst part of it is that this is no longer a \"party game.\" Meaning you can't invite over your friends and have fun fighting each other. The few people that master the game's new countering system (which is aptly named, since it's so COUNTER-intuitive) will slaughter the newbies and completely remove the fun of the multiplayer element.Likewise, when you take your game online (which you must do to earn 10 of the public achievements), you'll get destroyed by users who are far better than you, if you haven't dedicated your life to DOA practice.So before you waste half of your life trying to become the DOA guru of your social circle or the entire online world, remember that the only things that are new to this game from Dead or Alive Ultimate (which is 1/3 the cost) is a few new characters, the HD graphics (which are, I admit, absolutely amazing) and a set of new features which only make it tougher for those of us who weren't good at playing fighting games in the first place. Thanks, Tecmo, for completely ignoring the entire gaming community to make another game like Ninja Gaiden Black; a game that no one wants to play unless it's the only game they practice at.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2006"}

The game play is pretty straight-forward.  You arrive in a large city in the middle of all hell breaking loose.  And it's literally, all hell breaking loose.The graphics on the game look great.  There were a few times where I thought to myself that if I were playing a real live comic book, this would be it.  Not to say that the characters are cardboard like.  They're very well fleshed out.  The demons look evil.  The world looks destroyed.  War looks like what you might expect War to look like.The controls didn't take long to get used to.  I am more of a button masher and it's still fun.  The moves that War can make are pretty cool.  Plus you get some neat weapons as you progress in the game to make things more interesting.The game play is pretty solid but is not a solid death and destruction-fest.  Rather, it's interspersed with fighting and then puzzle solving.  Generally the puzzles are all solvable but I've found that as I've gotten tired, I've forgotten to look everywhere and gotten frustrated.  But overall, the designers did a good job not making the puzzles too hard or too easy.  Then again, I'm not a hard core gamer and only play two hours a night max.  I've heard a bunch of comparisons of Darksiders to Zelda games but I've never played any Zelda games.  Basically, it's a hack and slash puzzle solver.  Fun.The story can't be taken too seriously.  The designers took some liberties with War.  And there are a few times where I kept thinking, this is one of the riders of the Apocalypse, why am I not killing everything?  But somehow, after you play for a while, it doesn't really matter when you're having fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

If you played the first game, then you'll have no trouble getting into We Love Katamari, as not much at all has changed in the overall gameplay.  You are still rolling around a nicely sized sticky ball collecting all kinds of stuff to get bigger, and bigger, and bigger; and it's still tons of enjoyable fun.  There are a few new twists on the Katamari formula though, including rolling a sumo wrestler over food items to get him fatter, as well as rolling planets, stars, and constellations to get big enough to roll up the sun.  While the game still provides the same amount of fun, We Love Katamari also suffers from what Katamari Damacy did, the game is too short for its own good.

Smith \"Duster\"","summary":"An Honest Gamers review on Crackdown 2...","reviewText":"Before I get to Crackdown 2, I want you to remember the glory days of games like Metal Slug, Gunstar Heroes, and any type of vertical flying shooter. In these games you have the guilty pleasure of going around blasting like hell at everything to make it to the end of the level. Even if the game had a weak story, it was fun back then... right? Many people won't complain about those old 2D shoot'em ups. What Crackdown 2 is (in my mind) a 3D version of any type of shoot'em up, it is just hidden under the new age of gaming and 3D explorable worlds.If you come into this game having super high expectations and you did not really enjoy the first Crackdown, then steer clear of this game as well. As for everyone else, listen up. Yes it's set in the first city as Crackdown 1, and yes the graphics haven't improved, but I am here to tell you this game has its sights set in the right direction and offers a lot of fun and mindless shooting and collecting game play. (just like a certain generation of older games I already mentioned.) It is great to run around as a beefed up super cop and take down crime, while being steadily rewarded from your kills and driving with the orbs. Seeing your character get bigger and faster is awesome and the power suit he wears even changes as he levels up and looks more badass which each level (think Iron Man on steroids.)The \"Freaks\" at night are fun to snipe from rooftops and blow up, and there are tons of them on the screen at once. The first time I jumped off a tall building and then glided over a swarm of freaks finally dropping 100 feet out of midair and groud-pounding the crap out of them was amazing and never gets old. Shooting swarms of enemies really took me back to those mindless shooter games that I loved and still love today.Every game has its flaws and Crackdown 2 has several. (Things I thought were noticeable)- Auto aim is pretty clunky sometimes, but free aiming is also optional and fun- Melee combat is stiff and needs more combos- Character Customization is very limited, I wish they added some more options to make your agent reflect your own style- No pistols, I really like using pistols- Wish they added a dual wielding weapon option- Shooting from ledges would be sweet- You can't aim down the scope with a sniper rifle, but with crap tons of enemies everywhere it would take too long and I found sniping people from a distance to still be satisfying.- The \"ramming\" ability doesn't look fast enough when the agent is running.- City kinda looks like LEGO Land in some places: blocky buildings, solid colors.- Climbing can be frustrating sometimes. If they had the climbing and lock on jumping system of INFAMOUS this game would be so much better.- A wall run feature would be amazing as wellWhile this list seems long and bad, most of these comments are things I wished they put in the game. There are plenty of good parts too!-Suit looks badass- !!! Jumping off of rooftops and GLIDING is complicated and seems crappy UNTIL you figure out how to do it! You have to jump off a high enough place and once you activate the gliding and see his limbs splay out and the BLUE trail of lines behind you, you gotta aim his body downwards: once he dips low enough the lines will turn RED and then you slam the control stick back (I play with inverted Y axis) to make him shoot back up into the air and you just repeat those steps and you can go really far! You will eventually land, but it is so COOL!- Ok, despite what others say, this city is ALIVE! I found a guy playing an acoustic guitar SINGING a SONG about the agency and the cell and there was a crowd watching and some were dancing to the beat! I was quite impressed! I also saw a guy on the street trying to sell a miracle drug to a crowd...LOL awesome!- guns are awesome and sound great, I love the crack of the non silenced sniper rifle.- driving is really fun, great stunts- Draw distance is quite amazing from even the tallest building- People in the game will comment on your actions; bad guys cuss and yell at you- freaks sound very good, especially for this game which isn't even a horror game.- orb finder is helpful- Renegade orbs are a nice new challenge- freaks will chase you on the rooftops- explosions are epic- jumping is just as awesome as the first Crackdown- Scaling buildings may not be realistic, but it gets the job done, plus I don't wanna spend 5 minutes trying to climb a building anyway. I want to scale it as fast as I can; it's a super hero type game!- Ramming into cars and freaks is fun as hell- Power drop from the air is great and looks sweet and does lots of damage- Helicopters! And surprisingly they control excellently!- Sticky mag grenadeTo all of you who loved the first Crackdown and just want some more orb collecting, gun shooting, roof jumping, freak killing goodness then definitely get this game. I am sure it is fun online too.  Overall I give this game an 8.7 out of 10 for the few actual flaws that stand out to me, but overall it's a blast to play!And as side note: If you are deciding between this or Red Dead Redemption, choose Crackdown 2. RDR has some of the most boring game play I have ever witnessed in all the games I have ever played, do you really wanna tap the \"A\" button for 8 minutes while riding a pony to get somewhere?! Or would you rather being jumping massive buildings and blowing up hundreds of zombies in a badass agent suit?!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2010"}

In fact, they usually [smell](the only good one I've played before \"Crash Team Racing\" was that old game \"Wipeout\"). This game was rather good for a racing game, but the only reason why I bought it was because it was a Crash game, and I've been following the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy since the very beginning.This game has good graphics and power-ups, but sometimes it's quite difficult, like when you have to acquire Gems and CTR Tokens by going through impossibly difficult levels in a very short amount of time. The best thing about this, I think, was the story(which is one thing that \"Mario Kart 64\" didn't have at all). The story for this game was good because of it's uniqueness. Instead of having to battle Dr. Cortex and Uka Uka again, Crash has to challenge a new enemy, an alien named Nitros Oxide, to a race that will decide the fate of the Earth itself. Not only that, but this sudden turn of events forces Crash and Cortex to actually team up for the first time ever(except ofcourse if for some reason you consider Cortex fooling Crash to acquire the Crystals for him in Part 2 \"teaming up\"). Not only that, but Crash and Cortex's friends and minions( Coco, Polar, Tiny, Dingodile, etc.) also join in to make sure Nitros Oxide doesn't take over the world for himself and leave Cortex out of it.I would give this game 3 and a half stars, but I gave it a 4 cause, as I've said before, I love Crash to much to give him a 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2002"}

EVERYTIME you play a level, the NPC's do THE EXACT SAME THING EVERYTIME...which means you can memorize the routes of every character in your favorite maps...which makes the mode TOO EASY. now this mode would have been AMAZING if the game gave you the ability to place A.I. in the levels and CUSTOMIZE NPC ROUTES so that we could actually Organize our own Hit Situations...maybe even give us the ability to use in-game characters like Wade, Lenny, Layla, Mister Dexter, KANE AND LYNCH, etc as targets...but great ideas always seem to avoid developers, why is that??overall, this game is a well produced and well put together work of Art. Terminus, Vixen Club and Blackwater Creek are some of the BEST levels in Hitman history...but once youv explored every area, fooled around with the A.I. and participated in some contracts online, youll probably be on to something else in a week or 2. people who have NEVER Played Hitman will be AMAZED by this game. people who have played Blood Money and Contracts and understand what this franchise is really all about will feel scorned by the unwanted step child that is LINEARITY.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Jason A.

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Steve F","summary":"Cool gift idea for the gamer.","reviewText":"I bought these over a year ago and I probably only used them a handful of times.

That stated, the story of the game is the following: Conker's verygoodnight turns into a very bad day. He has to deal with a crazy and abusive world, all while suffering through a massive hangover. Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense. He is resourceful, however, and makes the best of his situation. The game combines elements of 3-D exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"D.N.","summary":"Ok, it's vulgar ....what else?","reviewText":"It is a well-crafted, fun game. I wish the graphics concentrated less on unrealistic rainbow-lighting and character expressions and realistic fur and things like that and just attempted to make the graphics easier to discern, with decent textures, instead the screen is cut up and you have to squint sometimes, even if you have perfect vision you'll see a boatload of fuzz. The N64 really made this game look almost too fugly to play I'd say, what's the point of 3D is it isn't clear what's ahead of you? Multi-player is the best in years, though the screen gets smaller and soooooo FUZZY!Single-player is pretty fun as well. The movie nods are really dull, it's not unique or funny, you just recognize it as from a movie, you don't really get to play through a scene. For instance, you just watch the opening of A Clockwork Orange only with Conker as the star (maybe that will make you laugh like crazy, but not me). Actually, I hated most of the cinema scenes. Some, like the bee talking to Conker are nice, but the evil villain and his henchmen were so dry, Conker really isn't laugh-out-loud funny or even laugh-inside funny.Playing as a bat was much fun! It went out of it's way to be immature, though and that cheapened it. I'm sure Conker 2 will be way better on Xbox, it has a lot of potential, it needs to be more unique when it comes to gameplay, but I like most Banjo Kazooie aspects. We've just seen this type of gameplay repeatedly made since 1996 and it's getting quite a bit old. An interesting plot would go far with this, along with a better reason why he's moving through all these different worlds. The humor would come from being character-based, maybe there should be more than just Conker starring in the next game. I would prefer if Conker were to make fun of different videogames instead of films, that has never really been done at all, unlike movie parodies which are lame and done to death. Conker 2 could make fun of RPGs in a vulgar/violent way (!), or cutesy kid games like Banjo, first-person shooters like Goldeneye, any videogame stereotype or genre, etc. etc.This first game is a rental, I'd say. It's about as engaging as a dumb movie. Hopefully the sequel will be out Quickly!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2002"}

They took the graphics and gameplay from Super Mario All Stars, and added some extra fun to it, with new secrets, new goals, some huge enemies / vegetables, voice-overs for all the characters (even Birdo), more enemies, and more ways of getting hearts. Some parts of levels were even recreated. There are three slots for saved games. There is one downfall though, the height of the screen is not as tall as the original Super Mario 2, so a scroll up / down function was added, which is very distracting. Finally as an added surprise it comes with a classic version of Mario Bros! Very nice detail has been added to the classic and it offers a four-player multi player game.

Graham","summary":"I don't understand the hype for this one.","reviewText":"I loved the first 4 titles in this series, but this was a real dud. Yes the graphics and everything are fancy and look nice, but there isn't much of a game here. If you like spending 95% of your game time either walking around trying to climb over rocks or listening to endless hours of boring dialogue, you will love this game. I gave this game a fair chance, put a good 20 hours into it, finished the Companions Quest and got to level 25. I then realized I couldn't remember the last time I actually fought a monster. The game turns into nothing but walking for 15 minutes, talk to someone, walk another 15 minutes... Occasionally a quest will need you to clear dungeons which are about 2 minutes of fighting and 20 minutes of wandering around looking for a switch.This game isn't like World of Warcraft where you can just go out and fight progressively more difficult monsters and get exp. In fact you can wander around for an hour and rarely see a monster anywhere. And, the interface; this has to be the clumsiest interface I have ever seen on a modern video game. You can't simply click a menu option, you must scroll down and press enter instead. You can't hotkey a spell and cast on demand, there a lengthy process of getting your spells ready use. I could never get used to the interface, whenever I needed to cast a spell or use a shout there was an elaborate process I had to do that I could never do reflexively.Fans of the series will discover one disappointment after another. Fewer spells, the inability to create your own spells. No Arena, not even a big city to explore that would have an Arena in it. Fewer skills, no classes and the list goes on.I was very impressed for the first few hours playing this game but once the novelty wore off I realized under the fancy graphics and cool battle sequences there was nothing underneath. This is a boring game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"An Interactive Mystery Novel!","reviewText":"Hotel Dusk is a real treat to play, its one of a kind.  When i started this game it kinda reminded me of that old game \"Dejavu\" on the NES.  You turn the DS to the side like you are reading a book, which you pretty much are most of the time.  There is a good amount of reading in this title, sometimes more than needed.  I only have a couple of gripes about this game, one being the excessive amount of text to read, i mean i enjoyed that it was a interactive novel and all, however i just felt like they had a lot of redundant lines that were written just to extend the game time.  My other gripe is that sometimes they just leave you hangin and you are not sure what to do next, so you wander around the hotel knocking on countless doors until you trigger the right event.Gripes aside, the positive aspects far outweigh the negative.  The sense of mystery is fantastic, you won't really know what is going on until the very end, meaning the story line is not too predictable.  There are a large host of characters staying at the hotel and each one has their own secrets which you will discover.  The hotel itself is rather large and will take some time to explore.  You use the touch screen with a bird's eye view to navigate your character while the right screen shows a muddy looking 3D representation of the hotel.  When characters are talking they look very much like the style used in that old \"Aha\" video from the 80s.  There are several puzzles you will come across and they are not too difficult. The music is quite good in my opinion, lots of variety.  Overall, Hotel Dusk is great, i just wish they had more DS titles like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}

Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Utilize Cole&rsquo;s climbing skills to go where most people can not, opening up a variety of offensive and defensive combat options.Organic City Ecology- Watch the citizens and city react and evolve depending on players&rsquo; actions.

{"product_name":"B00386VMWI","description":"","reviewerName":"E.S.","summary":"Recruiters, college football die-hards rejoyce!","reviewText":"First and foremost, let me state that I am a sport fanatic and that's not limited to college football.  Like 99.9% of sport games available, the yearly copy is simply a rehash of the previous year's game plus a few new gimmicks (EA is obviously the King of this).  I am not much a of Madden player, however, as I prefer its college counterpart because I find an enormous amount of fun in recruiting.  And it's in this field that EA seems to make players' lives difficult in the sense that they make it harder than it has to be.  This year, I can say with a clear conscience, recruiting has taken an ENORMOUS step in the right direction.Let me continue my review in the form of bullets, rather than paragraph form.PROS:-Recruiting now takes a mere 10 minutes per inquiry/pressing of a certain pitch, offering a scholarship, scheduling a visit, making a promise (which can now be done IN season), negatively recruit against another school, etc.  In years past, pressing a certain pitch could take way too many minutes from your 10 hours of recruiting time.-Recruiting takes on a game-show-like twist.  Recruits will now ask you about certain pitches rather than the other way around.  Once they pick a topic, you can either \"make a pitch\", \"ask them how they feel about it\", \"compare to another school\" (aka negative recruit), \"Change the topic\", \"make a promise\", \"schedule a visit\", or \"offer a scholarship\".  I don't know if this is considered a PRO, but it's a breath of fresh air for this central cog in the game.-You can change the \"recruiting difficulty\" if you don't want to keep saving and redoing certain weeks of your dynasty if a certain prospect keeps going to another school.  This is nice because sometimes I don't want to lose all the 4/5 stars to the SEC...-The \"Locomotion\" game play engine is a large step towards achieving game play comparable to the KING of football games, Madden.  In years past, the movements of the players were \"jerky\" (can't think of a better word), while this year this game offers a much more fluid football.  You'll know the difference once you pop the disk in your system. Personally, I'm pretty satisfied with the actual game play.  It runs smooth and tackles/catches all look exceedingly accurate.  The graphics are really beginning to utilize the full capacity of the PS3 system and I can only hope that EA builds on that rather than maintain it for the next few years.-Unique entrances for each team.  I think this is a gimmick on EA's part just to say they added something new to the game but for people who go to BCS conference schools (I'm an Oklahoma Sooner, myself), you will definitely enjoy this added feature.  You've got every thing from the Wolverines running under the \"M CLUB Supports You\" Banner, to the Clemson Tigers touching Howard's Rock before running into the stadium, etc.-Unique offenses.  College football is innately different from its pro-counterpart because of the unique offenses the majority of schools play.  This year, such offenses are highlighted.  From the triple-option at Georgia Tech, to the no-huddle at OU, to the Pistol-set at UCLA, etc. It certainly gets boring running the Pro-set for every team, doesn't it?-The entire interface of the game has been retooled and again, this is a huge breath of fresh air for loyal fans of the game who have to see the same things year in and year out.Cons:-The \"Pay-to-play\" recruiting features are STILL here and it's awfully annoying because they include the options among the other FREE features and I suppose sometimes I forget it's not free and end up clicking on it (sorry for the run on sentence).  They call them \"time-savers\" but paying on top of the $60 + tax you pay already?  At least with the Map add-ons for COD MW2, you play them every other game so you get the most use out of it.  The features EA makes you pay for are just side features that would surely enhance my satisfaction were they included.-At the end of the day, if your preference is for the most realistic football experience, you cannot look towards an NCAA game for it.  I know I said this had great game play, but it's obvious that EA saves the best for Madden, as millions of more people would prefer the NFL.  Which makes one wonder how good Madden 11 will be...-Same old commentary...... wish they would completely revamp that.-Each team still only has one unique (if at all) TD celebration.  It would be nice for each team to have multiple interpretations of their respective celebrations (i.e. V for Victory/USC, the Gator Chomp, etc.)-I've noticed that there is A LOT of lag when scrolling through options in dynasty mode.  I don't know if everyone else out there is going through the same problems.. my PS3 is not even a year old yet and it's the slim line one so I doubt its my system.-More to come??  After a few days of playing, I haven't seen anything else yet.  And I will update as I see them!THANKS FOR READING!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

The bomb was supposed to send the locust on the run. Instead it has made them more (desperate?) aggressive and they are pressing ever closer to the last remaining human stronghold, Jacinto.  Enter Delta squad fresh from delivering the Light Mass bomb to the Locust base, Marcus Fenix and his friend Dom where hoping for a little R&R; (in Dom's case more time to hunt for his missing wife), instead they get stuck with training Delta's newest recruit. Things quickly go from bad to worse as the training exercise turns into a trial by fire as the locust launch a surprise attack on Jacinto and have to be chased out by the COG army.  This attack prompts COG command to launch a counter attack while they still have the upper hand in the aftermath of the light mass bomb. Guess which squad gets to be the tip of the spear.....-------I liked this game when it was being the game I wanted to play. Which was the tactical game where the player has to make good use of cover to take out the opposing locust forces. The first game did a good job of this and generally made sure that the player had to use a little bit of strategy to pick off the opposing force so that the player could move forward foot by hard earned foot until the enemy could be flanked and eliminated. This game does that too.... when its not making me want to throw the controller across the room because the developers for some reason decided that they would make just about every other act some kind of rail shooter or puzzle level. Yes I get this was done for co-op and this is probably fun if you have someone to play through the whole game with either on your couch or online.  But if like me, you are unable to do this (I play late at night) for whatever reason, then you will be stuck with the semi bright AI that tends to get confused with the simple things like heal fallen comrades, stay in cover and generally be more of a help than a hindrance. Other than some design decisions that I disagree with the game does move along at a pretty good clip and made me want to keep playing. The story is standard video game but, I guess the developer is trying to get on the Halo bus by making it deeper and more complicated (emphasis on complicated). If you've read a lot of Sci-Fi then you can sort of fill in the blanks yourself. Other than that it probably is better to wait for the next game or read the GOW books that are coming out to make it make sense. Online multiplayer (what I played of it) is fun and is an improvement over the original. Besides the Co-op through the story and the standard multiplayer modes there is a new mode called horde which requires players to fend off an ever increasing wave of enemies.  Last but not least in the eyes of many (myself not included) the graphics are great, the characters don't fall into the uncanny valley and stuff blows up real good. I would recommend this game to anyone who liked the first one, those that like to play through games in co-op and those that like sci-fi based action/adventure tactical shooters.  M.a.cGraphics: Great. No uncanny valley, semi destructible cover. Stuff blows up good.Story: Its like reading book 3 in a 5 book series. You'll get why they are doing what they are doing, but your not real sure how the got there. Kinda like the first game, it just moves the game along so you can shoot more stuff.Game Play: When the game wasn't breaking up the flow with annoying puzzle levels or rail shooters it did a good job of making me want to keep playing to the end. My only other complaint is that sometimes it is not exactly obvious where your supposed to go. If I am wandering around for five minutes a nice arrow or hey stupid over here would be nice.Camera/Controls: Worked good for me. No cameral issues. No throw the controller across the room moments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2008"}

Every action is precise, smooth and highly believable and enjoyable. The subtle force feedback is also amazing.The controller grips nicely in the hand and is comfortable although the circle, square, triangle, X buttons are small and the Start/Select are a bit further away on the controller. Also the bright light can be disconcerting. Calibration is quick and painless and highly accurate after.The Table Tennis game is the best followed closely by Archery, Disc Golf and then the Bocce and Gladiator game. However, you will get tired pretty soon as there's no resistance to any activity you do. It is a pretty good workout for your arms.Pair this with 3D and its gonna be ridiculous. You'll truly feel gaming has taken a major leap forward.If you play the Nintendo Wii ( with MotionPlus ) and then play this, you're gonna laugh at how pathetic the Wii really is.

Of course, Square has always been on the cutting edge of graphics even since the 16-bit era.Now, let's move on to the rest of the game.Names- Yeah, this might seem minor to you and it might seem like they're still being consistent with using names for protagonists that indicate some kind of weather or relating to the earth in some way. I can name Terra, Cloud, Squall, and, now, Snow and Lightning. Snow and Lightning? Really? You couldn't come up with anything better than that? I would have been happier with Steve.Cheese-factor - The beginning is lame. Oh, wow, a lady ex-soldier suddenly decides she wants to fight the authorities. We haven't heard that one before have we? You just took Cloud and gave him longer hair and called him a female.Oh, Lightning is a hero. At least that's what his character and his support continuously say for the first 15 minutes of the game. Yes, I remember so many times when I thought \"Oh my god I want my character to tell me he's a hero.\" Especially in the first fifteen minutes of the game. Especially when I haven't even developed empathy for my character. Especially when the character hasn't done anything but whine and hand some civilians some guns so they can all run to their deaths.Oh, and let me add that there is a black guy with an afro. Oh, and he has a freaking baby chocobo in his hair. I suppose that's in case he gets hungry. He figures he can just grab some grease and make some fried chicken. Who in the hell thought this would be a good idea?We shouldn't forget the buff Vanilla Ice with red hair. He's one of the guys constantly hitting on Lightning and calling him a hero repeatedly. Like pointing a gun at him behind his back and then placing it on his soldier so he looks cool. *Gag*Tutorials - There are tutorials about every 5 minutes. They don't seem to stop.The sad part is that this is my review 30 minutes into the game. I started having nightmares of playing Star Ocean again.I hope this can save just a few people the time and money.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUL","description":"Hone your skills as a military strategist as you battle your way through encounters with wizards and dragons.","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Best GBA RPG Ever!","reviewText":"For those of you who were disappointed over Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls, this game will let you have peace in your heart.  Although it is not made by SquareEnix, it still shares some of the elements of FF:Tactics Advance.  While the story is as far out as the FF series, it still retains a lot of the plot twists and suspense that the other games have.For of you who haven't had the chance to play any of these games allow me to introduce it to you.  Intelligent Systems, the people behind Advanced Wars and Paper Mario, have released an RPG based off the Japanese series Fire Emblem after Super Smash Bros. Melee introduced Marth & Roy and the people begged for it to be released (including me).  This game is not like SSBM in any regards, its totally different.  You play on a grid where you move your units around and attack your opponents.I am a big fan of grid based combat, so I went and bought this game as soon as I could.  It has so many great elements to make a game good.  The thing that might shock other people, as it did me, as that as soon as one of the characters dies, they're gone for good, unless of course you want to restart the level.  This adds a huge amount of stratergy to the game.  Some of the characters that are weak would normally make me care less if they died, but in this game, they give you their background, and each has their own dying phrase.  The other thing is, your ending will be changed a little if any character dies.The sound is spectacular, some of the best orchastrated music I've heard on a handheld.  Conversations can drag on a little sometimes, but that can be ignored by the music and the excellent storyline.It starts out as your basic fairy tale about a girl finding out she's a princess and so on.  But then later the game takes on a much darker tone, which I don't want to spoil for those who haven't played the game.  Oh, and the other nice feature is the ability for your weapons to have 'health.'  Its similar to that of Dark Cloud's system, but different.  If you use a weapon too much, it'll break.  THe other neat feature is the extra chapters that can be obtained in various ways.So overall, the game is pretty awesome.  I suggest that to everyone who has a gba, to pick this one up even if they hate these games.PROS- Excellent Storyline- Great stratergy elements- The Battle System works extremely well- The music is some of the best on a handheldCONS- Dialogue can drag on sometimes, but it isn't too bad.- The Tutorial is extremely annoying, but if you skip it, you miss part of the storyline.- Losing a character and starting the level all over can be quite annoying when you get to longer levels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2005"}

The lighting effects are top notch. Overall scenery is great and the blood/gore looks good too.- Controls: basic controls are easy to learn, as are the many combination moves. I hate the camera though. 50% of the time something is blocking your view and you end up get slashed up.- Weapons: immense selection of weapons, from swords to throwing stars to huge battle axes to bow and arrow, this game has it all.- Quick load timesTHE BAD:- Difficulty level is too high. There is no selectable difficulty level in the Options menu. You have to begin the game in Normal, and then if you get stuck, you say you want to give up... and they bump the difficulty down to Easy and call you a Ninja Dog. Thanks.- Sound quality is very poor. I think they pulled a few too many sound effects from the Sega Genesis bin. I want to feel that sword strike, but it just sounds terrible. Everything is muffled. And I have Dolby Digital... no help.- No way to get back to the main menu once you start playing. You have to quit the game. I can't believe this.

{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"Zelda just got a little darker","reviewText":"After a very very very long wait, one of the most long anticipated video games of all time was finally released on December(dont remember the date)for the Nintendo Gamecube and that my friends is The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess.  I'm not going to get into the plot or such and such because half of these reviews will tell it way better then me.  So let me to the simple stuff and what nots to give a little closure on how I felt about this awesome yet very delayed game....put simply..Twilight Princess is an awesome game that shows that Nintendo hasn't got close to being stale on this amazing and most LEGENDARY series of all time.  The game boosts what is hands down one of the most beautifully made game ever, seriously if you thought that little purple cube had no life in it anymore think again cause TP boosts some of the best graphics scene on the gamecube since..RE4?  The Art style they took was a big leep for Nintendo and has a very more darker artsy look then the last Zelda game(Wind Waker) which was one of the best looking games on the cube as well but I prefer this darker, more realistic looking zelda game then the other.  From Zoras Domain(Man the first time I was there in the Twilight World, My jaws dropped to the floor)to Sky Temple the game is chuckfull of atmospheric details richly desighned to show that Zelda Has changed its look and feel......but still play EXACTLY the same as the others which sadly gets to my negative pointsAnyone scene God Of War 2?...hate to say this and im no fanboy, no siree but when you see that games trailer you say \"Man they really wanted to top the first one\" by adding so many new things and mechanics/battles/scenery/ect...This is something I wish Twilight Princess did.  Don't get me wrong I love the game, its visuals, scenery, dark blah whatever you wanna call it...but it plays just like the other zelda games and I've just about had it...I told this to a friend the other day but I was hoping for something along the lines of like \"Link ontop of dragons trying to slay other mini dragons flying and ect\"  Yeah I know that sounds a bit much but this game was basically Ocarina of Time with a darker, more realistic look to it.  I liked the fact that you can change to a wolf and stuff but as you progress through the game its basically the same pattern(Do some plot quests..Twilight Realm as Wolf to do some little fetch quest...Temple..rince and repeat.)  I was really sucked into the game but by the time i was on the 6th temple it started to ware off.  Also I don't like the jaggie Lines that the games has(it shows up from time to time..usually in an area with all the same colors and ect on the back round)which is what Wind Waker suffered as well..but again that still doesnt change the 10/10 graphics the game has..it just interferes at times.  Also did I mention this has some pretty bad music.  Nintendo should have just kept the old school zelda tunes weve known and loved(they do but not alot of it, not to mention they changed the sound about).Alright lets get back to good stuffIf you want the same good ol' action adventure fun you had with Ocarina of time then be ready cause this game tops Ocarina with some of its awesome thoughtful Puzzles and Temples.  This Particular Zelda Game also features some really memorable Temples like the Ice Temple, Sand Temple ect.  One thing to be glad is that the water temple isn't made to frustrate you and put you to full out angry mode like Ocarinas Water Temple.  Also did I mention this has some really amazing Boss Battles.  Sure there on the easy side(so was okami but they still proved to be epicly awesome and fun)but damn does this game feature some really fun and epic bosses that are truly unforgettable(like the Dragons Boss for example or the \"Shadow of the Colossus\" like Water Temple Boss).  But sadly the game does also have some very dull Bosses and one in particular really upsetted me which gets me back to a negative pointHOW THE HELL COULD YOU SCREW THIS PART UP NINTENDO?  Ocarina of Time has hands down in my opinion, the Greatest most epic Boss Finale I've ever played or witness.  From the battle itself to the damn scenery, its just flat out epic.  TP's Finale Boss Battle just felt like 4 dumbed down short and easy boss battles with Ganondorf(I was really upset over the scenery aswell, just didn't have that awesome epic feeling that Ocarina and many other games had)WHAT A HUGE LET DOWN.  This was really disappointing  Not to mention they used GANON as the first boss Phase, wth???!.The Good-One of the looking games on the GC, love the artistic, realistic dark look to it-Controls are tight and responsive as ever-Lots of Things to do which will expand your hours of play time-The Longest Zelda game ever...or..yet..should take a good 30 to beat the main game.-Some really epic Boss Battles-Some Temples are really amazing(some sadly not)-Some of the new things added like Being Wolf, Controlling a one eye Twilight Dragon beast in certain parts of the game are fun as well-Midna is KEWLThe Bad-Some Jaggies-Starts to loose its fun and edge near the 6th temple of the game-Worse Zelda game in terms of Music(man I really disliked the music in this game..specially the annoying voice to what was acctually a good tune..and im speaking of the Sky Temple..which was one of a few that were good...same with Twilight Temple which was really good too.-Some Bosses stinked...badly...Specifically the final boss-I really hated the way this game ended...It had a \"TILL NEXT TIME\" feeling to it...Heck the games final cutscene is shorter then any cutscene in the dame game!!!..What gives..-Gets abit repetitive at parts like the Wolf fetch quests in the Twilight WorldOverall this is a must get game for any cube owners and Zelda fans(duhhh).It may not be the best zelda game in the series but damn is it still good and fun, though its a shame Nintendo couldn't have added or make totally new different things(other then the wolf aspects of the game)to make the so much more better(not to mention FIX some things they made in the game).  But Thats made up of the Amazing atmosphere that the game presents you with...But what they do add still makes up for half of its flaws...Overall this is one of the best games to come out in late 06 and should be played by everyone who is a fan of games in generalOverall4.5 out of 5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2007"}

It was trulya groundbreaking game at the time it came out. Manyvideo game magazines such as EGM, Gamepro and websiteslike Gamespot gave it good reviews.The game on the original Playstation console has pretty decentgraphics that were groundbreaking at the time for consolegames.The game itself has you select between two characterseither Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield. Jill is an easiercharacter to play then Chris is and items such as ammo andhealing items are more plentiful for her.The gameplay is not to tough as you are mostly exploring acreepy mansion, running into the undead every so often suchas zombies, zombie dogs, giant spiders that are poisonousand even giant man eating plants. There are certain waysto kill certain bosses such as the giant man eating plantby killing it with weed fertilizer, for example. This isalso a puzzle of sorts that some people may as such andmany more puzzle are found throughout the game some oftenrequiring the use of a strategy guide (thank God for EGM,Gamepro and other guides at the time this game came out esp.the internet as well!)The game's story centers around, towards the end anywayand evil organization known as Umbrella.Resident Evil has a good storyline, excellent sound thatis both haunting and creep at the same time and when anenemy is nearby is changes it's intensity. I like how oneof the characters plays Moonlight Sonata on the piano atone point in the game to open a secret passageway or doorthat is hidden.You get a good selection of guns, healing items and ammothough they are almost always in short supply. Thankfullyyou have a knife for backup that each character has on hand.Only a certain amount of items may be carried at any given time.You may store items in item storage boxes found in some ares ofthe mansion.The same is saved via ink ribbons you find throughout thecreepy mansion which you then use on typewriters you find tosave your game.The characters you'll meet throughout the game in the mansionare kinda cliched but that's ok with me. The storyline may beas well but again it's still interesting to see how it unfolds.The whole game itself is pretty well made and should warranta playthrough at least twice as there are also secrets to unlock.I like finding notes, journals and books and reading throughthem to get a sense of despair, isolation, loneliness and dreadthe previous residents and people of the mansion had beforeall hell broke loose in it and it does add to the storylineand give clues on how to solve puzzles as well.I give Resident Evil on the Playstation 5/5 stars for creepysurvival horror fun, haunting music, beautiful graphics andscenery (the cutscenes are ok but nothing spectacular exceptthe end maybe) surprises, a feeling of isolation and despairesp. when playing the game alone late at night and revivingthe survial horror genre and making way for games such asSilent Hill and others like it.

Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit in the beginning. \n\nIn the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console (for that time) and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and SMB, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.","reviewerName":"Robert Kiehn \"TheForthcoming1\"","summary":"The Video Game System That Revolutionized The Industry","reviewText":"One of the best video game systems ever made.I first got this system from my Mom when I was 5 yearsold and all I can say is it's one of the best systemsever made and it helped revolutionize and revitalizethe video game industry.The system does have it's faults including the wireson the NES video game controller getting tangled upand the NES video game cartridges sometimes not workingbut otherwise it's a classic system that works fine mostof the time from what I can remember when I used to playit many years ago.This system has some of the best games ever producedincluding, but not limited to: Super Mario Bros, SuperMario Bros 2, Super Mario 3, Duck Hunt, Metroid, Castlevania,Zelda, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and many other games.I give this system 5/5 stars for many great games I enjoyedplaying on it and fond memories.From wiki[...]The Nintendo Entertainment System (also called NES or Nintendo) is an 8-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America, Europe and Australia in 1984.

Jackson's voice booming in your ear is controlling the character as it all happens. And now you can, with Afro Samurai for the Xbox 360. Based on the popular anime series, Afro Samurai will finally let gamers control their favorite samurai as he violently slashes through an eclectic lineup of assassins, ninjas, and robotic thugs..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The voice acting is done by Samuel L. Jackson, who brings along his usual flair.View larger.The Focus maneuver lets you low down time and perform precision hits.View larger.The Story UnfoldsSet in a futuristic, yet feudal Japan, this story follows a samurai named Afro after his hair. Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"Gregory John Ranzoni \"r_to_the_z\"","summary":"Shame","reviewText":"American audiences where graced with the speed and fury of the Afro Samurai, a cold hearted warrior whose has one goal, avenger his father death, but unlike other revenge fantasies this one has a twist. Afro farther was \"The Number One\" meaning he posses a sacred headband that signified him as thee best fighter in the land and made him a moral God, no other warrior could challenge him with the exception of the Number Two, the second best warrior in the land.Well Afro's father lost his position as the Number One when his head fell off his shoulders thanks Justice, a dark, decrepit looking gun slinger who has more then a Ace up his sleeve. After afro is raised by a kind sword master Afro begins a long bloody trek to find the number one, because after Afro gets the Number Two headband, any wannabe can challenge him.Stick with the mange and anime, because the video game doesn't do any of them justice. Although visual striking game with animation style like a comic book and all of the voice talent from the anime, the game suffers from lack luster game play. Your moves are very limited. You have no range weapons, forcing you to deflect bullets and missiles, which is nearly impossible to do because the timing of your focus strikes, that allow you to perform very powerful hits, has to be perfect, slicing ropes and lines is hard because you have to be in the right spot to perform the strike, otherwise your sword just bounces off. Another problem is that the enemy become too strong too quickly, a battle with four or five thugs could take up to ten to fifteen minutes because their skin is so thick and you have such a limited number of combos, which in it's self doesn't make any sense because your character can earn experience points for killing but those points don't get you anything, not more life or better weapons.In some respects it's too much like the anime, Afro only uses his sword and a few kicks, nothing else, no other strikes or combos. Because of this Afro became the first game on the Xbox that I never finished.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2009"}

For instance, it is a completely different (but refreshing) experience having companions travel with you (share the load and have unique perks). Given that you are in Sin City, it stands to reason that you will benefit from much higher speech and barter skills than in Fallout 3 (in New Vegas you can talk your way out of anything). Additionally, the interaction between no less than a dozen armed factions within New Vegas makes every decision that you make that much more relevant to your character (helping one group will hurt your standing in some of the other groups). The cause and effect of making alliances is far more realistic than just building up Karma. My second play through is completely different than my first and few of my strategies from Fallout 3 are coming into play with this new release. The number of hours spent on multiple play throughs easily make this game a great buy! Glitches - just save often. I have experienced my share of bugs: game crash, stuck in a rock, system freeze, pip boy invisible, companions go missing and can't add others. None of these made the game unplayable or influenced the outcome of any of my quests; but yeah, they need a patch.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

Again!","reviewText":"\"Call of Duty\" lovers will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of another \"United Offensive\" Expansion pack after finishing this stunning WWII fps. In 2004 the next best single player shooter to \"Half-Life 2\" was \"Call of Duty 1\". Needless to say COD2 brings us yet another damn fine sequel effort to rival anything else on the shelf. COD has firmly taken over where \"Medal of Honour: Allied Assault\" first got our attention in trying to recreate the \"Saving Private Ryan\" experience for us all. The COD series is built on the same concept as MOH except there is more action, more high-octane moments and a very different type of enemy AI. COD2 has upgraded the enemy and platoon squad AI from COD1 so that your comrades can identify the enemy and instead of scripting each action sequence as in COD1, COD2 depends on AI so that a rerun of any level will play differently although the situations remain the same. COD2 also has a lot more going on in terms of what you can pilot and drive although not freely but as part of the storyline. COD2 retains all the cinematic intensity that its predecessor successfully claimed and even expands on each of the earlier episodes over the course of a four year WWII period to give us Moscow 1941 - Red Army Training, Demolition, Stalingrad 1942 - Repairing the Wire, The Pipeline, Stalingrad 1943 - Downtown Assault, City Hall, Comrade Sniper, El Alamein 1942 - The Diversionary Raid, Hold the Line, Operation Supercharge, El Daba 1942 - The End of the Beginning, Libya 1943 - Crusader Charge, 88 Ridge, Tunisia 1943 - Outnumbered and Outgunned, Retaking Lost Ground, Assault on Matmata, D-Day 1944 - The Battle of Pointe du Hoc, Retreat? We're Advancing in Another Direction, The Silo, Caen 1944 - Prisoners of War, The Crossroads, The Tiger, The Brigade Box, Hill 400 1944 - Approaching Hill 400, Rangers Lead the Way, The Battle for Hill 400 and Germany 1945 - Crossing the Rhine, where you get to play as either a Soviet or a Brit or as a member of the US forces. Missions range from basic training, defending against attacks, counterattacks, planting explosives, repairing cut field wires, contacting HQ via the field phone, disabling Panzer II tanks, crawling through pipelines, taking out enemy snipers, destroying fuel barrel supplies with some of the best explosion effects seen in any game to date, destroying ammo depot supplies, gathering enemy documents, defending lower lines by using close-range weapons and artillery support, clearing out bunkers, radioing in for artillery bombardments, taking a Mosque, driving tanks, holding out for 5 minutes till support arrives, clearing the buildings in the town, sniping the artillery crews from a Silo tower, finding wounded Americans, transporting the wounded, taking a farmhouse and barn, taking out mortar crews and if that is not enough... securing a hill from a German advance. The smoke effects are absolutely photorealistic and have set a new benchmark for graphics quality. The textures might let the game down a small bit, including very blocky building designs or similar house interiors that are repeated at several points in the game  but the environments and maps are genuinely war like all the way through and can not be faulted. The enemy AI and your own team AI are much more realistic than COD1 and your team is reliable. If you get too close to the enemy you will engage him in close quarter combat. Although Call of Duty was never meant to be a war simulation, but more of a 1st person war adventure, to be honest, does exactly what it says on the tin. So apart from the staged element, which actually ads to the game, it is more of an experience than a game you will turn to time and time again, however it is worth it for the experience of the single player mission alone. It is also much longer than COD1 and OU, where COD1 had a 1.5 day game span and UO had 3, COD2 will last you for well over a week if you play one mission a day. The pandemonium of war is all here in a spectacular fashion because the story is a winner as you play a mini version of BAND OF BROTHERS and ENEMY AT THE GATES. Like COD1 you even feel loss at the end but for some reason the connection to your comrades in COD1 was a lot stronger because it was more scripted. The AI detracts from that connection a little bit, but I am only cribbing. Although Directx 9 is the standard for all the cutting edge new first person pc shooters, COD2 has been designed around Directx 7 technology. Only the new Geforce 7800 GT cards can seem to handle DX9 quality. If you don't have a very high end machine then selecting DX7 may prove to be the best result and funny enough is probably how COD2 should be played. Test it out to see. If you are looking for a war multiplayer then go for \"Battlefield 2\" (it is the war simulation that everyone plays for multiplayer) but do not miss COD2 single player! COD has always been a contender for game of the year and COD2 is no exception.Pros:- Cinematic gaming.- Best new war game and a worthy 1st person shooter.- Awesome war atmosphere.- Smoky explosions.Cons:- Needs a high spec system to run on full settings.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

Capcom's first compilation collection featuring the first six NES Mega Man games, the seventh game on the SNES, the PSX eighth game, and two never before released arcade games.One of the key video game series franchises that helped make the NES system great along with Mario, Zelda, Metroid and others was the Mega Man series. For those who are unfamiliar, the series revolves around a blue robot who must overcome the evil Dr. Wily and his robotic minions by tackling on each stage in any order. What set MM apart from the rest was the fact that you could steal a boss's weapon once you beat him and use it throughout the rest of the game. The fun part was always trying to guess which weapons worked best on the bosses. It's amazing that the series has progressed this far, continuing on the SNES with MM7 and the PSX with MM8. Growing up with most of these games, it's hard to believe that Capcom's little blue hero is already 15 years old. If you're an aficionado of the series, you know how difficult it is to find some of these games in their original cartridge formats, especially MM1 and MM7, which are ultra rare and fairly expensive on their own. I never owned MM7, so it's great to finally have it now. When I heard that Capcom was releasing all 8 of them on one disc, I couldn't resist buying this classic collection. After all, when you've got 10 games for only 30 bucks, what's not to like? How does the MM Anniversary Collection fare? Check out the list of many positives this game has, as well as the _very few_ negatives:POSIVITES-For the most part, ALL EIGHT GAMES ARE LEFT IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORMAT. This is good, because the graphics, sound, gameplay, and music are all intact and you get the same experience as when the games were originally released.-EACH GAME CAN BE SAVED VIA A MEMORY CARD. Of course, you can still copy down the passwords if you wish on all games except 1 and 8.-THERE ARE NOW DIFFICULTY SETTINGS ON ALL SIX OF THE ORIGINAL GAMES. Previously, the only game that featured difficulty levels was MM2, but now all the games can be tackled on easy mode for beginners. All these games feature lots of challenge, which is the way MM games were always meant to be.-THERE ARE TWO GAMEPLAY OPTIONS AVAILABLE: ORIGINAL MODE AND NAVI MODE. Original mode is simply the games the way they were originally created. Navi mode on the other hand changes a few aspects of the game, such as a modernized life-bar, menu, level maps (4-6 only), and hints are provided at key points of the levels if desired. Most MM gamers won't really need these hints, but I'll put it this way: If you need to look up a strategy guide after reading all the hints that are provided, then there's something seriously wrong with you.-NAVI MODE ALSO FEATURES REMIXED MM MUSIC. Most of these remixed tunes are great and stay true to the originals. MM's 1-3 only feature certain remixed tunes, all taken from the Mega Man Power Battle arcade games. MM's 4-6 on the other hand, show the most benefit, as all the tunes are remixed. Skullman, my favorite MM theme, never sounded better, and all of MM6's music is just AWESOME now.-One modernized improvement to the original NES games that all fans can appreciate is THE ABILITY TO CHANGE WEAPONS WITH THE L AND R BUTTONS.-YOU CAN UNLOCK LOTS OF BONUSES BY BEATING EACH OF THE GAMES. This includes stuff like original artwork, music, and the two Power Battle arcade games. The best bonus of all though comes from beating MM8. I won't spoil what it is, but it is certainly a welcome, pleasant surprise to any fan.-Speaking of MM8, THERE IS NOW NO LOADING TIME WHATSOEVER IN THIS GAME. In fact, there are no loading times on any of the games, only between the games themselves, which means more gameplay time.-Mega Man: The Power Fighters is much better than the first game because you have more characters to play as, more options on stage select, more moves, and multiple endings depending on which characters you beat the game with.NEGATIVES-As much as I like the remixed music in MM1-3, it's kind of odd that only a few of the tunes are remixed. For instance, you're playing through Elecman's stage and hear the awesome new music, but when you reach the boss, it only plays the original music.-At first, it's hard to get used to playing the NES games with the PS2 controller, but you'll get accustomed to it eventually.-For some strange reason, the music in MM7 sounds very quiet in comparison to the other games.-Mega Man: The Power Battle can be beaten in only 5 minutes if you rush through it. I'm not kidding.-I didn't care much for the bonus music tracks you can unlock. They don't have anything to do with the series.These are just a couple of gripes in an otherwise perfect game compilation. 5 Stars. You won't find any of the X games here, but perhaps that will be another collection released someday. Old fans of the series shouldn't hesitate purchasing this fine collection. If you're a newer gamer who only prefers 3D games with fancy graphics, then don't bother with this. However, if you're a newer MM fan who wonders how the series began, then it would be well worth your time to snag this stellar collection, as you've got TONS of gameplay time guaranteed.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2004"}

Unlike most fighting games Soul Calibur 2 has a good storyline. Some fighting games just have an arcade mode where you fight every character on the game. Soul Calibur 2 has a weapons master mode where you can be any character you want and you follow along with the story. Some of the characters on this game are Link, Astaroth, Voldo, and those are just a few of the many characters on Soul Calibur 2. I think that the storyline on this game is better than any other game I've played. Secondly the graphics on this game are so cool that they will blow your mind. It has awesome facial detail along with great background detail. Examples of this are, if the character says something you can see their mouth move. Now you may be thinking why does that matter? It matters because it makes the game more realistic and the more realistic the better.Like the storyline the controls on Soul Calibur 2 are good. I say this because it is easy to perform attacks or block enemy attacks. Also, there are so many different attacks you can perform. Such as, a horizontal attack, a vertical attack and an attack where you throw the enemy. All this helps you when you are battling throughout the game. Owing to the fact that, the graphics are amazing, controls are good, and the storyline is good, the fun factor of this game is great. What makes it so fun is that there are so many different things you can do, that you never get bored of. For instance, this game has a versus mode where you can play against other people.It also has a lot of extras, like an extra versus battle, extra team battle and a profile mode where you can read about the profile of any character. Soul Calibur 2 is probably the most fun game I have ever played. In conclusion, I rate this game a 4.5 out of 5 because of how good the graphics, the storyline, controls and fun factor are. Also, I recommend this game to anyone who likes fighting games. This game is probably the best fighting game ever made. Finally, if you have never played a game that you thought you couldn't stop playing, or a game with a good storyline, controls, and awesome graphics then you might want to play Soul Calibur 2. This is a must play game if you haven't played it. Pick this version out of the other Soul Caliburs because you got link. Link is the man and always will be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2004"}

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"This game has awakened an Old School Gamer","reviewText":"I have been a gamer since 1981 in the days of coin op Pac Man, Berserk, Galaga, Centipede, Donkey Kong.  Needless to say I have witnessed every phase of technological breakthroughs of gaming consoles. Back in the day, you knew a game console was awesome if a game cartridge could duplicate the graphics of an Arcade game.  Well, after the year 2000, the had tide changed to where gaming consoles created superior games than what you would find in arcades. This is why arcades only have &iexcl;simulator&iexcl; style games and shooters and I no longer go to arcades. Bear with me, I am going somewhere with this.So now we have the frontrunners of PlayStation and X-Box that have cranked out some pretty sick games and peripherals where you can literally participate in Dance contests and fight in Bare Knuckle street brawls(The Fight PS3 with the Move Controllers). The PS3 and X-box 360 up until last Friday, to me, could not be topped with epic gaming with stunning graphics and game play. I bought my PS4 on the release date and I had Assassins Creed Black Flag that was jaw dropping. Well Infamous Second Son is the most epic game ever created. It has easily topped one of my old time favorite series, &iexcl;Unchartered&iexcl; a PlayStation exclusive. Black Flag is a visually stunning game, but Infamous 2nd Son is even more visually stunning.I have owned MANY PlayStation games and have gotten sucked into many PlayStation games. And quite honestly, up until Infamous 2nd Son, I was actually beginning to get bored with gaming. Black Flag, Kill Zone and some and the new PS4 bred games were really neat, but it&iexcl;s hard to be wowed these days because gaming has advanced so much over the past 14 years.Infamous 2nd Son has accomplished 3 things from my perspective.First, is the creators have made a visually hypnotizing game (hypnotizing because of the use of colors and detail in the cities that make Grand Theft Auto cities look primitive on the lines of Atari 2600) that is not repetitive that is actually never boring and repetitive. You can choose two karma routes which can give you two stories and even different abilities and weaponry based on who you wish to be. I actually plan on going through the game and a bad guy next time. I suggest that the player actually go through all of the side missions and &iexcl;liberations&iexcl; to get the full experience instead of going straight to all of the missions and finishing the game quickly. I have done this with other games because they were repetitive and dull, but it would be a waste on this game. Seriously. My wife is not a game fan but was commenting on the rich neon colors that look like something from a rave party. The cut scenes that show the hero detonating his big attack launching himself in the sky and lowering the boom is the most spectacular thing I have ever seen and it never gets old. What is also good is how you don&iexcl;t get all of the power ups and abilities right off the bat. You gradually get them all as you defeat the other bio-terrorists which keeps you coming back for more. I like how the developers have utilized the controller as a speaker and &iexcl;spray paint can&iexcl; .Second, is that this game has actually piqued this old gamer&iexcl;s interest again to gaming. I like FPS games, but something new and fresh is nice.  This game is just plain fun. Up until last Friday, I was beginning to use my PS4 mostly for Netflix and movie streaming. Well not now.And third and most important, Infamous Second Son has shown what the PlayStation 4 can do. It has displayed the possibilities and potential that this console has. Hopefully, game developers will take the time to utilize the system to its fullest potential to make winners like this. I am looking forward to other PS4 games now and the peripherals that are on the console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

At some point though you need to explore the sea extensively and retrieve pieces of the triforce.  that would be fine except for two things:1.Every time you want to change directions in your ship you need to hit a specific series of buttons.  easy enough right?  Well after doing it 100 times you just get sick of it.  It takes some of the fun out of exploration.2. The pieces of the triforce are not in dungeons, they are just hanging out on the bottom of the sea.  Basically you just sail to a designated point and pick it up.  Pretty lame. Sorry.  No way around it.  It is.  Once you change wind direction a million times in a row and sail through boring bay several times to pick up triforce pieces there is the final stage and you win.  yaaaaaaaay!Play it if you love Zelda, but this is not the holy grail of Zelda games people make it out to be.

Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Fun update of NES Track & Field","reviewText":"Some people apparently find it difficult to use the controls.  I did not have this trouble, although a few of the events had a minor learning curve (3-5 tries to get decent at them), but nothing frustrating.  Even my 3 year old was able to play many of the minigames (in fact, he was better than me at the triple jump haha).Several reviewers said their arms hurt from playing this (because running  requires you to move the nunchuck and wiimote back and forth).  This was true for me at first, but then after messing around a bit I realized that you don't have to forcefully move them to run fast. You can use small, quick, gentler motions to get to a good speed.  My 3 year old doesn't get to full speed, but he consistently gets the blue signal that he's running fast...and he does not even hold them right.  Don't get me wrong; you definitely get a very minor workout and will probably sweat a little :)Several of those lower rated reviews also compare this to Mario Party, which is a bad comparison in my opinion.  This game certainly is not trying to be Mario Party.  This game is more like an updated NES track and field with Wii Controls.The only negative I have is the misleading Wi-Fi tag.  You cannot actually play others online, which is what I assumed.  You can upload your records and see how your records rank against the world which is nice, but online play would have been fun.I enjoy the \"Circuit\" mode which makes you compete in 4 events against the computer.  Winning these adds trophies to your collection, opens more circuits, and opens more Olympic events.I also enjoy the Mission mode where you have to take finish meet certain goals for 6 different events.  I have not completed one with all 6 yet as I still have to open up a couple of minigames.  It'll be fun trying to complete the goals for every character.One of the low reviews also mentioned that there was no replay value.  This is hard to comprehend since I have found a ton of replay value.  Trying to master the events, set world records, rank higher than online records, completing circuits to open up new events/circuits, and mission mode are extremely fun and you are replaying events over and over.  Not to mention getting family or friends to play with you so that you can compete against each other.My favorite events so far are: Trampoline, Skeet Shooting, Javaline, Hammer Throw, and rowing (scully or something).  I like the running events, especially the 400 meters where you have to focus on the character's stamina to keep him from slowing down due to being tired.  Archery is fun.  I have the most difficulty with table tennis, long jump,  and triple jump (the jumping events my 3 year old can beat me at heh).Overall, I really enjoy this game.  Online play would have put this over the top for a 5 star rating, but there is a lot to do without online play.  I too am a Mario Party fan (I give Mario Party 8 four stars also).  Don't expect this to be Mario Party, but a sporting event at the Olympics and enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2007"}

I have finished this game in single player and multiplayer (online mode) and there are a few unique features you need to know about when considering this title:1. Varying gameplay based on difficulty: When you change the difficulty setting, you are given additional side-missions which you can achieve. One example is a boat that needs to be blown up to protect one of your operatives. This is a refreshing change to the rather boring alternative of just having guys who can withstand more headshots or are using faster moving computer AI. This also makes for a more immersive game, since you feel like a real secret agent, who's being trusted with more responsibility as your skills increase.2. Varying gameplay based in single vs. multiplayer: When I first started playing this with a friend, I was amazed to find that it is actually a different experience. Rather than just heading down the same road as the single player game, the characters actually split paths and have different objectives. For example, on one level, I was a sniper on a roof, providing cover fire for my partner while he was down below trying to complete objectives for the mission. The game actually takes longer to play co-op, and it brings a lot of extra enjoyment.3. Co-op over Xbox Live: If you have a friend with a 360 who lives far from you, you can play the game together cooperatively. This is a very nice feature for those of us who get tired of being verbally assaulted by teenagers and completely wiped out by the pros. It also allows for a more strategic gameplay, as you can try out different manuvers and see how they work against the AI.4. Excellent multiplayer support: The game supports all 4 Xbox 360 controllers. You can even go online with 4 players on a single 360 to really help in a team game. This is the only 360 title that I know of that makes this possible. It's great when you want to really show off the power of the 360.All of this rolls up into a really nice title for the Xbox 360. And, now that I've played it all the way through, I would certainly recommend it for anyone who wants to get a lot of gameplay out of a FPS (First Person Shooter) game with Next-Gen graphics!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2006"}

The little forest environment does its job well...along with the first time you enter the city where the humans live.  After that, though, it's back to the good ol' classic Killzone environments.  Dull metallic ships and cities will be waiting for you for the rest of the game.  These sections don't look much better than a PS3 game.The story is stupid and so boring you won't even care.  I guess there are some out there who are invested in the Killzone mythos....but I do not see how.  More crap about the Hellgahns and humans fighting a never ending war.  And something about a half-breed chick...whose \"half-breed-dom\" doesn't really amount to anything.  Eh.  Just watch the ending on youtube for the \"twist\"...if you wanna call it that.The gameplay was ok.  The game is far more fluid than the last Killzone I played.  (Killzone 2).  You don't feel like you're an overweight slob plodding around when you run and perform actions.  There are some VERY tedious sections where I died many times that were just not fun.  Also some sections seem to place very overwhelming odds against you out of nowhere.  You will end up depending on the \"owl\" to revive you but be let down many times due to its need to recharge after just being used to put up a shield or stun an enemy 30 yards away from you.  Enemies would also spawn RIGHT BEHIND ME in an area or room that I just cleared 2 seconds ago. And for the love of God...don't make me remember the HORRIBLE free fall sections (there are about 3 of them) and that stupid escort the Dr. mission.  Jesus Christ those had to be some of the worst gaming experiences in my game-playing history.  It is also easy to get lost in the game...not in the good way, unfortunately.  There were many times were I simply did not know what to do or how to get from point A to B due to the level design and lack of direction.  None of it was fun...it just made me wanna get to the end and get it all over with.There are a few glitches in the game.  Sometimes button presses didn't register, leading to quite a few deaths.  There was an audio bug that kept the owl's recharging sound playing for about 30 minutes until i reached a checkpoint auto save so I could completely close the game and reload it.  For some reason, when bombs blew up around me my characters field of view would shift up to the sky for no reason and completely disorient me.  Enemy AI is tough overall, but is still pretty stupid at times.This game was a rental (thank God) and although there were a few fun gun-fights sprinkled in-overall the game felt like a chore to play.

However, I found it not to be as good as some of the more recent games, like Rise of Nations and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.Gameplay: Warcraft 3 is remarkably like Warcraft 2 in a lot of ways, which is both good and bad.

It's a very typical 1990s-style RTS game. However, Warcraft 3 adds hero units to the mix, which greatly impact gameplay. These units can gain levels as in a RPG-style game and have special abilities. You really cannot win a game without them. Each race has a choice of 4 heroes to choose from (with The Frozen Throne expansion loaded) and there are neutral heroes that can be recruited. The hero model works quite well with the single-player campaign, since it weaves them into a broad story. However, it makes skirmish games a little awkward, since you are required to both build bases and find creeps (random monsters) for your hero to fight in order to gain levels.The single-player campaign is both quite long and well done. Actually, it seemed a little too long once I played through the original campaign and the Frozen Throne expansion. The story is the typical good vs. evil theme, which gets really hard to follow by the mid-point. However, the missions are generally well done, with a good mix of RPG-style adventuring and a heavy-dose of base-building and conquest. The missions are designed to allow you the chance to play all four races, and I didn't get the sense that they were just practice for multiplayer online games. That is, for solo gamers like myself, Warcraft 3 has a substantial amount of single-player content.Warcraft 3 is good, but does have some issues. Some of the single-player missions are quite hard and will require much reloading of saved games in order to complete. Still, the AI can be a little lame. There were countless times that my base would be invaded, and my units would not automatically move to fight the enemy. However, AI enemies do fight smart, often first attacking your units that can do the most damage to them. Rather surprisingly, the game does not have a pause feature so that you can look around the battlefield and give orders while pausing. And unlike recent RTS games, Warcraft 3 limits you to very small armies. You'll be lucky to have 20 fighting units at any given time. Additionally, the game just seems behind the times in other ways. The camera doesn't really zoom, graphics are cartoonish, and the micromanagement can be burdensome at times.As with every other Blizzard product I've played, the game was perfectly stable and well polished, and I came across no bugs or typos. In addition to a single-player campaign that will last around 35+ hours for the average player, there are a large number of skirmish maps included, multiplayer capacity, and a map editor. As usual, Blizzard has supported the game well with patches and new official maps that are downloadable at their website.Graphics: The typical Warcraft visuals. A bit cartoonish, but with a lot of vivid colors and diverse environments. Spell effects look convincing, and there are day & night cycles that give the world a living feel. The game is actually cute in many ways and is probably supposed to be that way. The graphics will not win any awards, but they do serve their purpose. As with Diablo 2, Warcraft 3 has some of the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game.Sound: There is a lot of great voice acting in the game. Some of it is very funny. The music is also well done and appropriate to the mood of the game.Overall, I recommend Warcraft 3 (plus the expansion) to anyone interested in RTS or fantasy games. It's a well-made strategy game with lots of challenges, a epic (though rambling) story, and an RPG element in the form of heroes (which, again, can be a plus or a minus). If you can get past all of the micromanagement that the game requires and some other outdated elements, Warcraft 3 should provide many hours of entertainment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00EI4V3X2","description":"","reviewerName":"terpfan1980 \"Barry\"","summary":"A solid B for this early effort, but plenty of room to improve things....","reviewText":"Light, somewhat, uh, how do I say it delicately?, lets say 'inexpensive construction' feeling headset that at least for now still doesn't work completely wirelessly with the PlayStation 4 that it seems to want to be paired with (and which I want to use it with).Realistically, the completely wireless (or lack thereof) issue is more Sony's than anyone else's.  At release, the PS4 doesn't support any Bluetooth devices except the DualShock 4 controllers.  No Blu-ray remote controls.  No DualShock 3 controllers.  No other PlayStation 3 peripherals.  No Bluetooth headsets.  None.  Zilch.  Na-da.  That will hopefully be fixed over time, but for now any thought of being able to use any of the Turtle Beach headsets wirelessly with the PS4 are out the window.When used with a PS4, at least at the time I'm writing this review, this headset has to be connected by a small cable that is connected to the DualShock 4 controller *if you wish to use the microphone for chatting* while using this headset.  You can use the headset to listen to game audio, movie or video audio, etc., without the need to connect the cable, but if you wish to chat through the microphone on the headset you'll have to be wired to the controller.  The cable is included with this headset (along with other accessories, including a charging cable that is used to recharge the pre-installed rechargeable batteries that are in the headset), so there is no need to buy an additional cable, but given the price point for this product it seems pretty silly to even have to note that.  Really, at the price this device sells for, it shouldn't require any additional accessories, or at least none that would involve the need to spend any more money.The Quick Start guide that came with this headset was fairly sparce and didn't actually provide instructions on how to configure this device for use with my PS4.  I was able to easily find the full User Guide at Turtle Beach's website.  I wish that it was included in the package, but I don't really mind being directed to the website to get a soft copy of it.  The user guide does provide instructions on how to adjust the chat volume (which is done through the menus on the PS4, not on the buttons on the device which only work when the device is used in Bluetooth mode).  That is something that I would very much have liked to have included in the quick start guide, but again, the information is available in the downloadable user guide.As best I can confirm, the microphone mute function, at least when using this device wired rather than in Bluetooth mode, simply doesn't work.  I don't know if Turtle Beach simply blew that, or if it is a limitation of the way they've had to engineer a temporary solution for using this device with a PS4, but it is disappointing as I like being able to mute the microphone when I don't want to be forced to use it.  There are buttons to control the microphone/chat volume, but they don't work when using the headset connected in a wired mode.-- edited to add:  visiting the manufacturer's support forums shows the mute and chat volume function problem is being experienced by other PS4 gamers as well, with (thus far) no response received from the manufacturer.  Attempting to connect to the manufacturer's live support chat via the internet proves itself to also be a somewhat frustrating and time consuming experience (I had hoped to check with the manufacturer's support team to see what their stance was on the button functionality, or lack thereof, but seem to be meeting a dead-end there).** Updated again (12/5/2013) : confirmed, the chat mute buttons and chat volume buttons only work when using the headset via Bluetooth, not when using the direct cable connection that is currently required with Playstation 4 systems :-(  If/when this headset can be paired with the Playstation 4 over Bluetooth then users would be able to mute the microphone, but until then, muting the microphone is not possible when using the chat cable connection.  The manufacturer might be able to (and hopefully would) correct that with a firmware update, but as things currently stand the mute button for the microphone is basically useless when using this headset with a PS4 system.Also added later:  I had meant to be a bit more clear in my review noting that this headset is not just a PS4 headset, rather it can be used with PlayStation 3 (PS3) consoles as well as Xbox consoles, or even used mobile with an iPod, iPhone, or other smartphone for music playback and such.  While it might be assumed that this headset is meant only to be used with PS4 consoles, that is certainly not the case.  Perhaps the problem in that area comes from the thought that Turtle Beach uses so many different names and numbers for their products with so many of them having somewhat overlapping features and compatibilities that it is nearly impossible to know which headset would work with which consoles. :-(Over time, I expect Turtle Beach will improve the product and the feature set will be fully fleshed out.  Once it does, then I would say these are nice headsets.  Not quite as nice as some other headsets that they offer, but not bad.  Four stars for now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"Completely useless","reviewText":"This is by far one of Nintendo's worst accessories.  By reading through the reviews here you can tell what one of the major problems are: it takes too long and too much effort to assemble the gun, and the games that utilize it aren't worth that effort.  Once assembled, it feels rather robust, although that little nunchuck cord holder will break for sure.  Once you have the gun, forget any notion that you'll be able to effectively use any of the buttons on the remote other than B.  Then comes the play control.  Having the remote mounted on top of the light gun gives you MUCH less accuracy than you'd have if you were using just the remote by itself.  Aiming and shooting is extremly clumsy, and the sensor bar's weakness is even more evident here.Then comes Link's Crossbow Training.  This game is a waste of time.  It's overly difficult given the clumsiness of the gun, and it seems as though it was thrown together in a single day.  It doesn't even come in a DVD case...just a cheap paper sleeve like Wii Sports.  I played the game without the gun, and actually did much better while still being pleasantly challenged.Finally, aside from 1 or 2 other games, there's no support for this.  And like the NES Zapper, I foresee a huge shortage of support for this in the future (that Zapper only had Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley and Gumshoe!).

{"product_name":"B0050SWYTC","description":"","reviewerName":"Shawn Bird","summary":"My Killzone: Mercenary Review","reviewText":"With two analog sticks on the PlayStation Vita, we were all promised to finally have good first-person-shooters in the handheld market. Then games such as Resistance: Burning Skies and Call of Duty: Declassified come out all looks to be lost. Now we get Killzone: Mercenary, although it leaves the games mentioned beforehand looking like a joke and is the most fun in the Killzone series, it isn't without problems and repetition.In Killzone: Mercenary you take on the role of Arran Danner, who as the title of the game suggests is a mercenary. The main story of the game takes place a long side that of the first and second Killzone games. It is unique to see the battle between the Vekta and Helghan from this third party perspective. From this point of view the ISA is also painted in a less-than-heroic light and gives a little more depth to the Helghan point of view, but as a whole it is just as forgettable as the main story of the other games.The strength of the story is partially due to the shortness of Mercenary.  The campaign is a short one that only lasts a few hours and you bounce around doing work for everyone on both sides and hardly anything mentioned about doing so. The game goes out of its way to push you through everything and give little to no context for what you are doing. Also it is far from what I believe was told to us early in development that you would be able to choose your side. If so it is something they abandoned along the way. There isn't much depth to the missions either. It is a constant grind as you go from area to area killing baddies and then at some point being stuck in an area fighting off waves of enemies. After a short time the game play starts getting very repetitive and hardly changes things up except in a few instances.For the PlayStation Vita Killzone: Mercenary is a great FPS, but when it comes down to it and compared to the FPS genre as a whole it is pretty standard. The controls work well, although sometimes feel a little sluggish when the action gets really intense. It also doesn't help that unless you get headshots the enemies are bullet sponges. There is a stealth element that was introduced and works pretty good for a FPS. Once you sneak up on a bad guy or get close to them even in a gun fight you can do a melee attack on them were you swipe the screen in whatever direction that is prompted. It is an easy way to force players to use the touch screen, but as your knife digs in it does feel pretty satisfying. There are other times to use the touch screen, but most of the time it is an option to use it or press the triangle button.As said the game feels good and so the gun play works pretty well, outside of the stated before sluggishness that happens when fighting starts to feel over whelming. However, the game gives you some gadgets to help you along the way called VAN-GUARD gear. This is a set of equipment that helps you out on the battle field and can do a number of different things depending on the play style of the person. For instance there is the Porcupine which allows the player to shoot off homing missiles at different enemy targets. There is also The Mantys, which can be used to sneak up behind enemies to take them out silently without players risking themselves to do so and there is a number of other VAN-GUARDS that all work in different way.You purchase VAN-GUARDS with money that you receive from getting kills. You also get money every time you pick up ammo from dead baddies. Different ways of killing people gets you different amounts of money. This money can be spent at Blackjack arms dealership, which is just boxes scattered throughout each level.  Here you can also use your money to buy new primary weapons, secondary weapons, armor and other supplies like grenades. Unless you have a hard time deciding which weapons and gear you want to be set on, you will find yourself making way more money than needed. There is a small amount of everything to buy and use and if you get your load out the way you want quickly you will be building up money for nothing, except buying ammo from the arms dealer.Killzone: Mercenary of course has an online mode in it as well. There are three different online game modes to choose from to play. There is Mercenary Warfare, Guerrilla Warfare and Warzone. Basically that is deathmatch, team deathmatch and Warzone is the fan favorite were two teams do battle as the match switches between different game play types.Although the maps are thoughtfully designed, they are small and that causes for a lot of problems trying to stay alive. More than a few times I found myself literally spawned side by side someone from the other team. Although sometimes that proved helpful to score an easy kill, more times than not it ended with me dying before moving two steps.For a portable game there doesn't seem to be much lag, however I did run into a few situations of seeing another player bounce around from place to place or shoot someone and have them kill me instead. Of course I was playing in my home with my wifi, so there could be more of this if gamers are playing on the go using 3G I suppose.Killzone: Mercenary rises quickly to the top of shooters on the PlayStation Vita, but that really isn't saying too much for it seeing every shooter on the handheld system before it had been carelessly thrown together. It has its fun at times, but the story is forgettable and the game play does get repetitive quickly. It holds up if you play it for short bursts of time, but to sit down and play it for big chucks of time it will get boring. I am not at all a fan of the Killzone franchise, but this was the only one that I found decent enough to pick back up after a few sessions. Fans of the series will be happy and anyone that wants a well put together shooter on the Vita should be happy as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2013"}

I really don't like this game and just don't see the point.  The world feels barren, you wander around in search of mini-games basically.  These minigames involve things like herding cattle and are very boring.  There's also gun shooter sequences, but even though I am truly terrible at video games they are way too easy.  You can just stand in the middle of the gunfire without taking cover and take down hordes of baddies.There's an over-arching story forward which is all very cliche.  But the biggest problem is that there are certain triggers to get the plot to progress.  Like you have to go to a house and hope somebody is there before the story can continue, but then they won't be home until you complete some other random non-related task.  So a substantial part of the game is just wandering around visiting the same few towns over and over, hoping something happens.  I understand the idea of a sandbox game where you don't have as clear a plot, but still when there is almost nothing to do except wander around barren countryside hoping you trigger some event, you do not have a very fun game.I'm a bit startled at all the good reviews.  Maybe people want to like the game because it seems like a such a cool idea and it shares some DNA with Grand Theft Auto.  However in actual execution the game is a snooze and I strongly recommend against it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

Haven't seen a good one since Resident Evil 4. Umbrella Chronicles seriously is fun but hardly a survival horror. So when I saw the review of Dead Space on TV, I was very intrigue. Lucky enough a friend of mine got it so decided to try it.She showed me the beginning and intros of the game, and of course the system and mechanic. I was really impressed by what EA has done to this game from what I saw and tried. Last time I was impressed by this shameless franchise update churning factory was when Queen Victoria was ruling Britain. Anyway back to the game. The parameters was sort of like Alien so you have extraterrestrial organisms attacking you while you are in an isolated space when attempting to change a desolated planet into a home suitable for humans. To survive you must thread through the Space Station and complete all the missions before time runs out (or life runs out)Graphics wise it's brilliant. Very detail and excellent light and shadow effects. Also they use the light effect to the games advantage to give you a scary edge. The controls are very well balanced but strategic - you have to cut off your enemies' limbs to stop them from getting back up. The dismembered bodies will roll around and follow you in the space though. So to save ammo you will need to do precise surgery on your enemies. Lucky enough you got some Kinesis power to slow fast enemies down. So the game proceed in that way.However, the biggest treat you get was a frustrating mission where you need to shoot asteroids the came in like swam of bees with a stupid cannon that moves in a way to make sure that you miss a lot and get caned. If you die you will see your character die a dramatic death with his body thrown to the floor. Cool eh? Not after you've seen it for 10 million times in 48 consecutive hours. The problem is you don't have that much health and then the asteroids are very fast and the number is so huge that they just occupy every single polygon that the PS3 can process. So while you are busily shooting, you will find yourself on a death roll already.  Adding to that is your stupid partner kept on asking you to give him more time and while you got distracted by his sweet voice, it is the call of death - for the 10 millionth time.To be honest, I was completely disappointed by EA at this point that I wish EA will tank itself into this same Dead Space that it created. The game was so promising and fun up to this point and they have to ruin it by putting in such a mission. Whoever created this mission should be forced to do that for 2 years consecutively so that he will learn the lesson of never to do so.So, if you are up for a ridiculous challenge that will spoil your gaming experience get it out and try it. But make sure you have all your furniture soft padded or you will need to fork out more cash to replace your controller one after another. Definitely a game for the rich and jobless - maybe Paris Hilton and her boyfriends.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

The 30 years of WM mode is well done and brings back memories. It's even awesome that you have trouble slamming Andre or King Kong Bundy....in 30 years of WM. In the regular game you can slam them all over the place anytime you want however.The other flaws are that submission moves aren't reversed any more, you or your opponent just simply let go of the hold. While, I was dying for more custom entrance options, custom entrances, I believe aren't in the game anymore. So now none of your caws can have cool entrance titantrons that fit their personality.While it's cool, they have Piper's face and clothes in the game but why not his music or entrance video ?

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Minor tweaks save a familiar Call of Duty...","reviewText":"'Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare' is one of my all-time favorite video games. Never before had a shooter taken such a serious look at war in a modern world while still delivering an exciting gaming experience. Sadly I was left wanting with it's sequels and while the first 'COD: Black Ops' delivered an interesting (if brutal) story, it's pacing and level design was an inconsistant mess. Now 'Black Ops 2' is out and while I don't think it's quite in the same league as 'COD4' (nor does it change much of the COD formula) it has a few unique elements that make it stand-out.One big reason I enjoyed 'Black Ops 2' over it's immediate predecessors is it's more focused story-telling. The narrative is a bit sloppy at first as a story with original 'Black Ops' characters Frank Woods, Alex Mason and Jason Hudson during the 1980's is intercutted with the futuristic 2025 conflict involving Mason's son David. But once these different threads come together, focusing on the pursuit of villain Raul Menendez the plot really hits it's stride. The stakes are heavy for 'Black Ops 2's characters this time around and their personal stories (even Raul's) are just as compelling as the over-arching \"stop-the-bad-guy-save-the-world\" conflict. There are even multiple endings and branchings as your decisions during gameplay can really effect the outcome of the plot: Some choices are binary (do you save your friend or keep your cover?) but others are more directly worked into your actions during a mission (do you save enough intel before the enemy burns it all? Do you follow your objective closely or explore the level to see if there's anything you missed?). None of this is unique to video gaming but 'Black Ops 2' does show how good writing can really draw you into an experience.While the writing is a standout in 'Black Ops 2' the gameplay is still very much the usual COD running and gunning but has a few new features to mix things up. You can now customize your loadout at the beginning of each mission as well as break into hidden cache's spread throughout the levels (giving you different weapons and gadgets to play with). Missions do still play out in a very linear manner but you're given a bit more freedom to get to your objective with characters reacting to the different routes you take (\"I'll take the left\",\"You take the high-road\", \"I'll stay on the ground\"). Vehicle moments are also a bit more dynamic as you can drive down different roads in a military truck or fly with a bit more freedom in a fighter-jet (though the mission will still end if you go too far off path). While the combat can still get a bit crazy at points I never found myself as overwhelmed as the original 'Black Ops' and the pacing allows for some slower, stealthier moments in some levels.Another new feature in 'Black Ops 2's campaign are what's called \"Strike Force\" missions. These strategy moments usually involve you to ordering groups of soldiers and combat bots to protect assets for a certain amount of time (or until they reach certain objectives). You can take direct control of any unit at any time (even the bots) and the combat units are constantly being refreshed. Unfortunately the A.I. is pretty dumb for both enemy and friendly units and I pretty much got by just overpowering individual targets. It's an interesting idea and certainly changes things up as failing these missions can supposedly impact the overall story (you can't replay them if you fail) but I found them pretty easy and not worth worrying about.I usually don't pay much attention to the multiplayer features in FPS games but 'Black Ops 2' has some great additions that might bring some more fans to the fold. Instead of just jumping into a match with other players, 'Black Ops 2' allows you to set up your own private session playing with and against A.I.-controlled bots (Unreal Tournament-style). You can still level-up during these matches (up to lvl 10 with half-exp being earned after) and it gives newer gamers a chance to get a feel for multiplayer before joining with live-gamers. Zombie-mode is back with more freedom but less focus as different modes like \"tranzit\" allow you and your co-op partners to travel to different maps and slowly unlock more areas as you progress. I wish there was more depth to zombie-mode as it's being pushed as a selling point on the box but it's still fun if you want to kill some time (and if 'Left 4 Dead 2' isn't readily available).'Black Ops 2' may not revolutionize it's genre and I think everyone can agree the Call Of Duty engine has worn out it's welcome. But with the story-branchings, (some) player-freedoms and accessible multiplayer options I'm still getting a lot out of this game. 'Black Ops 2' a great FPS experience and one I recommend to people still interested in what this series can achieve.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"Michael Anthony \"Hybridblues\"","summary":"Not Even For Free","reviewText":"I made a terrible mistake and bought this game for $49.99 the day it came out.

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"The Force Could Have Been Much Stronger...","reviewText":"The concept behind The Force Unleashed is outstanding.Play an action game as a sith under Darth Vader and hunt down Jedi.However, there are quite a few bugs and glitches that hinder gameplay.STORY 9/10The game takes place between the two trilogies.  You are Starkiller and you're Darth Vader's apprentice.  You begin the game hunting Jedi, trying to prove yourself to Lord Vader.  Once you earn his trust, he sends you on an important mission for the Empire.  At your disposal is a small crew.  A sexy pilot named Juno Eclipse and a droid named PROXY, who uses holograms to transform himself into other characters when they contact you.  Complete with twists and character development, this is the best Star Wars story since The Empire Strikes Back.GAMEPLAY  6/10Starkiller has some amazing force powers.  Force Grab, Lightning, Lightning Shield, Lightsaber Throw, and lots of melee attacks.  Defensively, he can dash, jump, block, and counter attack.  The Powers are great!However, the enemy AI is pretty bad.  Lots of times, they just stand there.  The control scheme is ok, but locking onto an object or enemy is broken.  Many times, you grab the wrong enemy or object.  MANY TIMES!!!  This is frustrating.The Bosses... if you don't play the way the designers want you to play, you die.  This is frustrating and very unfortunate.The Levels...  Some of the levels are great, while others don't work with the camera at all.  The camera in general is bad, but levels 3 and 9 really show how bad it is.  You can expect to die a lot from enemies standing right next to you, that you never saw.Sub-Bosses.  You can finish them off with a press the right button when we tell you - mini-game.  However, you don't know when the mini-game starts, so a good deal of the time, you're mid combo on an enemy and the game decides that you missed the first button press.  In God of War, the Player initiates the mini-game.  In this game... good luck!ART 8/10The level artwork, character art, and effects are all great!  Some of the levels look better than anything seen in the movies.SOUND 10/10Complete with the Star Wars soundtrack and sound effects that all the fans love.INTERFACE 1/10They're awful, clunky, slow, they load in... they even manage to take the fun out of leveling up.  Also, at no point is a complete list of moves available to the player.  You have to click on each move and read the button presses one at a time.  Then back out of that screen and go to the next move.Overall, I gave the game 4 Stars.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you should like this game.  It could have been a 5 out of 5, if the game wasn't so buggy.  The concept is awesome, the powers are great, the scenarios are great, and the story is great.  However, the execution ranges from good to poor.  You'll have fun about 70% of the time and be frustrated 30%.  The game is about 10 hours long.  1 hour of great story, 6 hours of fun gameplay, 3 hours of turd-dom.You can replay the game again on different difficulty levels and keep all of the powers that you earned in your first playthrough.  Aside from collecting light saber crystals and xbox live achievements, there's no reason to replay it.It's a good rental!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great potential falls flat","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing graphics and voice acting, you really feel super powerful, new characters are great, concentrates on the dark side for onceThe Bad: Absurdly cheap deaths thanks to no recovering after falling, luke warm plot, repetitive action, the whole upgrading thing is confusing, force throwing is difficult, retarded cameraI was really excited about this whole game and I'm surprised LucasArts lied and made a lot of things up. First I have to mention that you can't choose which side you go on until the final boss fight. Without spoiling anything the whole game is based around you fighting with the dark side as Vader's apprentice to bring The Emperor/The Sith Lord/Darth Sidius down so Vader can take his place. So, Unleashed takes place between episodes 3 and 4 (ok if you can't the original 3 as 3, 4, and 5) and you try to bring about the Rebel Alliance to take the Empire down. While the story flip flops a whole lot and doesn't get interesting until the VERY end its keeps things interesting and there are a few new memorable characters that help make it interesting.The whole point of the game is to make you feel ultra powerful and mainly focuses around Force powers. The controls take a bit getting used to but you basically learn force powers over time and can upgrade your lightsaber and your powers by using force powers. You can earn yellow (combo spheres), red (force spheres), and blue (power spheres). Each section has abilities that cost sphere points and can increase your max health, max force energy, give you new combos etc. I found only a few of the combos really useful since the game is full of cheap fighting and death. You have to use your most powerful stuff on the weakest enemies thanks to you falling down and not being able to recover. You'll flop around like a rag doll while 20 enemies are wailing on you and you can't get up. You can ONLY recover in the air by pressing A really quick so this is really kills things...a hell of a lot too. You wind up dying and being overwhelmed because you get knocked down and can't get up so you die almost instantly even on the easiest setting.The game throws WAY too many people at you so here's a scenario. You have a bunch of Stormtroopers, 2 AT-ATs, 4 huge black Imperial dudes, 5 snipers, and 3 guys with turrets all wailing on you. How the HELL can you beat them all without dying? Well use your force powers like lightning shield, saber toss, Force push, or Force throw. When you fight bigger enemies like Rancors or AT-ATs you get a button pressing sequence like in God of War and it's not as fun as you think. There's not variation like stick turns, button mashing etc. Most of it is just sitting and watching so its really broken.I also have to mention that the game is absolutely gorgeous and this is probably the only superb thing about the game. Everything is HUGE and you really feel like your almost on these planets. Of course a Star Wars game wouldn't be complete without finding stuff. If you get Jedi Holocrons you can get new lightsaber crystals to change the color of your blade, or power crystals to change properties of your saber. Good luck finding them all since they are so stupidly hidden you'll only find half in every level and there's really no incentive to replay the game since it's so darn cheap and retarded. If the game wasn't so cheap you could possibly beat the game on hard, but even on medium you almost can't beat the game. I have a strong feeling that this game wasn't play tested much or these flaws wouldn't exist.Another major flaw is when you're force throwing. The game using both sticks to do this but it lacks depth perception and it's hard to aim objects properly. Another stupid flaw is the retarded camera; even though you can control it the camera likes flopping around constantly and it makes you feel sick after awhile. PLEASE!!!! Now, if you're a Star Wars buff then there are a lot of files you can unlock and read, an art gallery, unlockable costumes, a cheat code section etc. I guess only the hard of the hardestcore will go back and play this again, but even me (a HUGE Star Wars fan) won't go play this more than once. So, if you can by pass the absurdly cheap deaths with no recovering after falling, the repetitive fighting, and the luke warm plot then by all means go for it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Each of these people have a story to tell, and you'll get to hear all about it through the game. Each character will have a bracelet attached to them with a corresponding number. You're going to need to use the numbers in combinations of 3 or 5 to unlock doors within the game. You'll also only have nine game hours (not actual playing time) to get through the game and save yourself.Graphically this game has the flavor of a Japanese game. You can tell the anime influence in the character designs. I do have to say that I enjoyed how every character had a unique wardrobe and an overall different structure to them. The areas that you're going to get to explore definitely have a Titanic feel to them, and once you play the game you'll see exactly how close that feeling is.The sounds of the game aren't too complex but they come enough that it reminds you there is sound in the game.With the game basically being a puzzle adventure game the controls can be as simple as using the stylus, or you can utilize the other controls to get certain things done, but you're still going to need to use the stylus.I have to say that I was excited to play this game, I'm a big puzzle fan, and with the back of the box promising me a large variety of puzzles I couldn't wait to dig in. I quickly found that this was going to be a game that requires a boat load of time. It wasn't because of the amount of puzzles, but of the pacing of the game. The pace is snail like. If this could be found in a novel format, you might get more enjoyment out of it. I'm not saying that it is a bad game, but you're going to be spending the vast majority of the time dealing with dialog, history lessons, and even more reading. One of the big things about this game is that there's multiple endings depending on your decisions in the game. My issue is that I just can't get over the amount of reading you have to get done between actually getting to play the game. If it were cut scenes I think I could give the game more slack as I could passively let the story unfold, but having to tap on the screen or press a button constantly to advance the text on the screen becomes too much of an not so enjoyable chore.If you're looking for a good puzzle game with plenty of dialog to all you to feel the pain and anguish of the characters as well as their body language, then this is the game for you, but if you're looking for a puzzle game with a good variety of puzzles that you can pick up and put down and feel like you advanced the game, this is not the game for you. This game gets a 5.9 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

The game looks absolutely gorgeous. This game is probably based on Uncharted 1 Drake's Fortune's engine on the PS3, a great proof is that when you try to climb on something that the game doesn't let you go there, Drake will do a small jump, instead of kicking the wall and bouncing back like he does in Uncharted 2 and 3. The controls are similar to Uncharted Drake's Fortune as well. which is a bit of a let down for me after playing Uncharted 3 on the PS3. But it is alright. And also it took me a while to adjust to VITA's buttons and sticks but that's the case when something brand new came out. If you are an Uncharted fan this game has the power to make you immediately fall in love with the game.

In my opinion this is the third best Prince game out of the five that start with the Sands of Time game. The Sands of Time is still my favorite(I wish they would make a reboot of that one graphically) followed by The Warrior Within, then the last Prince of Persia on the PS3, lastly The Two Thrones. So, what to start with... the good or the bad... let's get the bad out of the way.Graphics: Come on Ubisoft! This is 2010, not 2005! The graphics on Forgotten Sands should have been much better with the technology that is available today. Ubisoft is capable of making beautiful games. I'm not sure what happened here. It's not terrible, but it is below par for action/adventure games of this day and age. What this game needs graphically is a nice polish. It some levels it is graphically beautiful and in others it's kind dull and pitiful. It's not a huge disappoinment and it doesn't detract a whole lot from the game, but it is something that needs to be noted.Story: It's pretty much the same kind of story that took place within The Sands of Time game. I loved the story in that game, but the problem here is it's been done before. Couldn't they come up with something a bit more original. Again, it's not a huge disappointment and it probably won't detract away from the fun you're going to have playing it, but it might was well not even have a story. I found myself not really paying much attention to it.Gameplay: First, let me say the Prince, as in the other Prince games, moves with acrobatic grace. However, that doesn't help the combat system. The fighting moves seem sluggish and uninspired at times. The enemies you fight for the first good portion of the game(probably the first half or so) are dumber than rocks as far as a.i.(no, I don't mean Allen Iverson either LOL) is concerned. I mean seriously none of the low level enemies have any kind of finding strategy. Yes, the screen will fill up with 20-25 enemies at a time, but you never really feel like you're in any serious danger, and that's not b/c the Prince is a complete badass. I think Ubisoft could have learned something from God of War 3's combat system. All is not lost, though because the later enemies do provide a rather robust challenge. Thankfully it's not overly challenging.On to the good stuff...Gameplay, again: Yes, a big portion of the gameplay is awesome. The Prince's magic attacks are awesome and a whole lot of fun wiping enemies out with. The whole climbing and wall running is just as much a blast as before. It can get quite challenging, and even frustating at times, later on the game when you have to combine different powers to get through a certain level/portion of the game. Being able to freeze water and climb up it is challenging, without being overly so, and fun. Timing and stringing together your powers to further your progress is a big part of what makes Forgotten Sands so much fun.Rewind Time: It was kind of crappy in the last Prince game when you had unlimited rewind time. I think it took away a lot of the challenge that the game offered. Not so, in this game. You can rewind, once your rewind bar is maxed out, about 5 times or so. This adds more challenge to the game without it becoming frustating. Don't mistake me that there isn't parts in this game that will frustate you. There are sections were you may have to attempt to climb something or do a combo power sequence X (i.e. 7 or 8) number of times. Fortunately the fun and challenging parts far outweigh the frustating parts.Music: I love the music in Forgoteen Sands. Possibly the best in the series. It has a real Arabian feel to it and the mood of it fits every level perfectly. It's probably one of things, besides all the climbing and wall-running, that kept me glued to the game from beginning to end. Excellent musical score, but somewhat shoddy graphics. It makes no sense.Length: It's rather meaty quest. I'm not sure how long it took me to go through it, but if I had to guess I'd say in the neighorhood of 12-15 hours. I got this about 3 p.m. CST yesterday(starting playing immediatly) and just finished it a few hours ago. I actually liked the ending and I hope they continue with this new direction for the Prince. I won't give anything away about the ending, but I think you'll be satisfied with it.Fun: Oh yeah! It's a helluva lot fun, even taking into account the missteps that Ubisoft made. I'm kind of burnt out on it right now, but I definitely see myself going through it again with this Prince. The bottom line is you're going to have a fun adventure with the Prince as wall climb/run and fight through hordes of enemies to save the day. For some this may be a rental only, but if you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan(like me) or big fan of action/adventure game(me, too) then I'd say it's safe to add this to you're collection.

Aside from few and far in-between digital distribution gems like \"Scott Pilgrim\" and \"Double Dragon Neo\", and some re-releases of classics such as \"The Simpsons\" and \"X-Men\", not too many good old-fashioned beat-em-ups come along these days. Leave it to the man who brought us genre classic \"Guardian Heroes\" to bring a new retail brawler to store shelves. However, leave it to the rest of the dev team to mar this otherwise fun experience with idiotic artificial difficulty, repetitive gameplay, and some serious design flaws. This is \"Code of Princess\", a game that has a modest approach but complicated issues.What makes this game memorable, right off the bat, is the hilarious romp of a story. It follows Princess Solange, a stereotypical ditz, who is off on a quest to stop an evil queen from unleashing demons upon the land. Joining her is the stoic and androgynous Ali Baba, the RPG reference-spouting Allegro, deadpan zombie... er, \"necromancer\" Zozo, and a whole other motley crew of memorable characters. The voice acting, character design, and overall story are all excellent, and very reminiscent of fantasy-comedy anime such as \"The Slayers\" and \"Dragon Half.\" This is the kind of self-parody comedic Japanese RPGs need, instead of the insipid pandering seen in series like \"Hyperdimension Neptunia.\"Another strong point is the music. The opening is truly special, as is pretty much the entire soundtrack. Well, with the exception of the main theme, which you'd better learn to love. Why? Because, with the exception of boss fights and cutscenes, that's the only song you'll be hearing. No individual world music, no nothing. This game expects you to love the main theme music, and if you don't, then you may as well turn off the music during combat.Other strengths that make this game stand out from the pack is simple yet robust RPG system for leveling up characters and getting new gear (which there is plenty of), and the clever level design. Aesthetically, this game is very strong, and if I were to go off of that alone, it would be an easy recommendation.But alas, \"Code of Princess\" is anything but an easy thing to tell people to drop 40 dollars on. This is due to some nagging, unforgivable design flaws that hinder it from greatness.First and foremost, the combat is deeply frustrating. Not because it's particularly difficult or anything like that, but mainly because, well, there's not much there. There are combos, and special moves, but none of them are really engaging. There's no real weight behind the combat system, and there's no real variation. You'll end up using the same few moves each time, to the point of tedium. One of the characters this is painfully obvious with is Solange herself, who's so clunky and slow that you'll be slogging through battles looking forward to the next cutscene. When your protagonist is the slowest character in a brawler, you know your game has some issues. However, some of the faster characters still feel really repetitive, and that's when it hits you: this game didn't have enough time in development for the combat to be truly fleshed out.But even when the game does start to get exciting, the biggest issue of all arises. That issue is the miserable slowdown players are forced to deal with while playing. When more than a few characters come on-screen, things start slowing down. Not just a typical lag for a handheld game with a bunch of sprites on the screen; no, this is a lag so noticeable that it ends up playing into how you play the game. To me, this is an unforgivable error. Players should not be forced to deal with production issues when playing a game. It feels deeply unfinished in that regard.What really kills this, though, is the insidious difficulty spike. I'm all for challenge (that's why I play games by Atlus: to take a licking and keep on kicking. Looking at you, \"Catherine.\"), but this game starts getting cheap. The boss stages inexplicably get difficult, but not because they force you to play in a new way. Their HP gets jacked up, they inexplicably dodge and block attacks, and the overall experience becomes a slogging, dull game of chipping off one or two HP at a time, then getting overwhelmed by a screen full of enemies and the boss itself, which in turn slows the game, which in turn makes you die. This is not a pretty sight, and makes for a frustrating experience. Even some of the hardest beat-em-ups from the early 1990s never got this frustrating; you could learn boss' moves, then formulate strategies. This, on the other hand, just feels like sheer, unadulterated luck. Again, another thing gamers should not have to rely on.Another issue, and one that may just be me, is the imbalance of leveling up characters. See, once you encounter new characters, they'll be at level one, and you'll already be at level ten. They don't level up with you: you have to play through old stages all over again, with the same dialogue all over again, to level them up. Otherwise, you'll be stuck just playing as Solange or Ali Baba for the whole game. This is incredibly unlike other games with RPG elements, and a terrible choice for a game that touts itself as having so many playable characters.The funny thing is that, despite these issues, I could still recommend \"Code of Princess.\" If you can put up with repetition and slow-down, beating up the creative enemies and going through the beautiful scenery is truly an experience worth having. It's especially worth it for those who pay attention to the excellent story and cheeky dialogue. You have to suffer a lot to get that fun, though, and for some players that aren't invested in the aesthetics of the game and the imagination that went into the overall experience, that suffering might not be worth it.Overall, I can see this becoming a cult hit, but it has a lack of mainstream appeal due to design and gameplay. Atlus has kept its fans happy, but unlike their recent smashes like the last two \"Persona\" games and \"Catherine\", \"Code of Princess\" will probably not have the same breakthrough to the masses.Plot: 9.0Gameplay: 6.0Graphics: 8Sound: 8Overall: 7.75","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"A shuffling, shrieking mess","reviewText":"Short Review:Dead Space 2 is great at certain points, and it's fascinating to learn more about Unitology, but the \"More, more more\" philosophy eventually makes the player numb to the horror elements, and the rest of the game doesn't do much to stand out.Long Review:As a rule, I always rent games before buying them, as I prefer to spend only a few bucks on a video game, rather then pay full price and find out I don't like it.  However, being a huge fan of the first Dead Space game, I made an exception and purchased Dead Space 2 on it's first day of release, looking forward to another trip into the world of Unitology, necromorphs, and outright insanity.  Sadly, it was a purchase I really regret.Dead Space 2 follows Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest engineer in the Milky Way Galaxy, as he wakes up on a space station a few years after the events of Dead Space 1.  Not knowing how he got there, he quickly finds himself thrust into yet another necromorph outbreak, and a desperate race for survival, while having to battle a far more personal foe that may threaten his very sanity.The first Dead Space was an outstanding experience in sci-fi horror.  You were trapped aboard an empty space ship millions of miles from rescue; ammo was scarce, and you had to use everything in your disposal to survive.  Naturally, the sequel would want to further build upon that foundation by giving the player more of what they wanted...more monsters, more guns, bigger environments, and more action.  However, the, \"More, more, more\" attitude completely backfired in almost every aspect, giving us a very disappointing shooter that somehow manages to make a misstep on almost everything that made the first game a masterpiece.To begin with, the story of Dead Space 2 doesn't really feel important...there's a necromorph outbreak, and you have to stop it, so off you go on another quest to destroy another marker.  By the end, it doesn't feel like you've accomplished much, and it all feels somewhat weightless, with little dramatic weight.  Isaac's dementia, a huge selling point in advertisements and on the back of the game box itself, is not used to it's full potential, instead being used for a few hallucinations and seeing his dead girlfriend.  Isaac never seems crazy or suffering from his dementia, and it's a sadly underused idea that I would have liked to see expanded.The characters don't fare well either:  Isaac now talks, and aside from sounding much younger then he really is (he's 43, but sounds like he's in his late 20's), he's still an errand boy, only now more people tell him to do things instead of just one or two.  Romantic lead Ellie comes across as a generic action girl, and doesn't leave an impression.  The main bad guy, Tideman, is so non-threatening that I wanted to give him a lollipop, pat him on the head, and assure him that he was a very good sport for at least trying (and it gets downright amusing how often he says something along the lines of, \"It all ends here Clarke!\").  The character with the most depth, ironically, is fellow mental patient Stross: he has the most fascinating story of any Dead Space character to date, and it was a delight to see what he would do next as the game went along.To it's credit, I do like how Dead Space 2 delves deeper into Unitology, the not-Scientology-religion that's taken over earth in the Dead Space universe.  It's fascinating to learn about their beliefs and how they operate (\"Give unto the church and the church will give unto you\"), especially considering how most of the unfortunate residents of Titan station have miniature markers and shrines in their possession, along with taking up mass ritual suicide.But while the Unitology element of the game is impressive, the story and characters are still weak; that alone won't break a game, but perhaps the biggest flaw of Dead Space 2 is it's policy of, \"More, more, more.\"  So many horror elements are thrown at you throughout the game that you quickly become desensitized to it, and as a result, I found that the game just wasn't scary.  It's the type of horror where you're walking down an empty corridor only for a monster to suddenly leap out a vent and practically scream, \"LOOKATMEIMAMONSTAHRAHRAHRAHBOOGABOOGABOOGA!\"  It's startling the first time, but quickly becomes VERY predictable.  In fact, there's only one area in the entire game where you walk around for an extended period of time without being attacked, but it doesn't last long before the monsters are leaping at you again and screaming at the top of their lungs.Speaking of monsters, there are several new foes you have to face, along with almost all the baddies from the first game; the problem is that all of them are excruciatingly annoying, such as the puker, who's lovely vomit attack is annoyingly accurate; the leapers, ware are even faster and stronger then before; the damn stalkers, who will make you want to take a ripper blade to whoever designed them, and the pack, which consists of zombified children, who are fast, annoying, and DO NOT STOP SHRIEKING.  You're constantly swarmed by multiple types of necromorphs all at once, and they only get stronger as the game goes on, increasing the frustration level triplefold.  There's a multi-level battle in a red room, for example, that made me want to quit the game, simply on how many enemies I faced, and how many times I kept dying.But what's most disappointing about Dead Space 2 is the lack of \"Wow!\" moments.  The first game had incredible boss battles, but shockingly, there's only one boss fight at the very end of the game.  You do fight a few mini-boss necromorphs throughout the game, but they are, frankly, forgettable.  There's also a crushing lack of amazing moments that stick with you once the game ends; the first game had several, from a trench run in the void of space to the final, titanic boss battle.  There are only a few such moments here:  A train ride, an astonishingly awesome free flight through space (the zero gravity segments, by the way, are MUCH improved, and a sheer joy to play), and a moment involving a rather large needle(which is the most terrifying moment in the series to date).  While these are the moments where Dead Space 2 is at it's best, it's so frustrating because once they're over, you won't see anything that comes even close to being as cool.In keeping with not really standing out, the levels of Dead Space 2 don't leave much of an impression.  To their credit, the developers do try to have variety:  Instead of going through numerous industrial environments like last time, you go through apartments, malls, schools, military bases, etc.  The problem is that most of these areas are bright, clean, shiny, and well lit, which isn't scary at all.  A mine stage, for example, instead of being dark and creepy, is filled with brightly colored lights, to the point where it started to feel like the inside of a christmas tree; there's even a stage where everything is brightly lit with blue light, and it honestly wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see neon signs and disco balls hanging about.  You'll also notice that a lot of these environments start repeating themselves, as you'll go through the same hallways, plazas, and walkways again and again, and it reaches ludicrous levels about halfway through the game, where the amount of copying and pasting becomes absurd, and it feels like the developers were trying to pad the game out to make it longer.  However, to be fair, the entire last stage of the game does manage to become visually amazing, and stands out as the most exciting stage of the series so far, and is easily the most pulse-pounding and dramatic part of the entire game.One final nitpick:  Isaac's dead girlfriend, rather then being a terrifying specter of horror and loss, instead spends so much time yapping away and shrieking about how guilty Isaac supposedly feels, that I wanted to slap duct tape across her mouth to make her shut up.Overall, Dead Space 2, is, in my opinion, an example of how too much can really be too much.  Take the classic film, \"Aliens\" for example; it had a bigger location then the first film, more aliens, marines, guns, and explosions.  But the high paced action moments were spread out throughout the film, and didn't come nonstop, one after another.  If Dead Space 2 cut out about half the combat sequences and just slowed down, I would give it a much higher score.  But as it is, I feel it's a noble attempt to be a great sequel, but it stumbles badly.  There's a great game here; it's just too fast paced, too full of monsters, and tries to pack in too much for it's own good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

You can play online with a buddy in co-op mode which is really the only reason you need to buy this. The graphics are absolutely stunning. The surround sound is awesome. You'll hear activity coming from every speaker at almost every second of the game, wheteher it be hissing pipes, computerized tour guide voices, growling monsters or gunfire hitting the wall behind you. And trust me, when you're making your way through the base and all of a sudden you hear this deep laugh that makes your subwoofer rattle and the lights start to go out one by one leaving you in utter darkness, you'll realize that you may be in for more than you can handle. This is a great game to play at night by yourself.What's bad about it?The sounds of the weapons themselves are kind of weak. When I blast something with a shotgun, I wanna hear that sonic oomph. The weapons sound really lame for the most part (not bad, they just don't give you that bang that you'd like). Speaking of weapons, it seems to me like some of them are more dangerous to you than they are to your enemies. The grenades have a tendency to come right back to your position for some strange reason, usually if it doesn't hit your target. It's minor but noticeable. The whole idea of not being able to use your flashlight at the same time that you have a weapon equipped. It is really annoying to have to constantly switch back and forth between the light and a gun. Now, I can understand why they did it this way as the darkness in the game plays an important part in the overall effect the developers were trying go for with the game. It actually works better in the online co-op part of the game, as one of the two players usually has to be the one to hold the flashlight for the other half of the team to be able to see where he's shooting at. In the single player campaign though, it is really just annoying. Also, while the online co-op is a blast, the deathmatch portion is a little bland for my tastes. It's really just kill or be killed. It would have been nice to get some objective based gameplay but it could be that we've just been spoiled by Halo 2.Regular or Collector's Edition, which one do I go with?Collector's all the way. Forget the G4 icon videos, as most of us already know that id Software were pretty much responsible for the first person shooter genre. The Collector's Edition comes bundled with the original Ultimate Doom and Doom II, both of which you can play with up to four players on split screen (sorry no Xbox Live for the classics) in Deathmatch and Co-Op modes. This alone, with the addition of a nicely designed metal case similar to Halo 2's, makes this a clear cut winner.Is this the scariest videogame ever?Certain parts of the game are unsettling, that's for sure. The surround sound coupled with the awesome graphics really make you feel uncomfortable, especially if you're playing at night with the lights down low. The game is really dark (pitch black at some points...) and it really gives you the feeling that something is waiting around the next corner to jump out at you. The whole Hell thing in itself always makes for good atmosphere. The monsters look pretty good and when they're chasing you through the darkness and all you can see is their glowing eyes, it might even make you scream out loud, being that you aren't able to have your flashlight equipped while shooting. As for this being the scariest videogame ever, I'd have to say no. It is creepy as hell but personally, I think both Fatal Frame and its sequel, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly, have this game beat hands down in terms of scares. Even the Silent Hill games are creepier than this.Should you buy this game?Absolutely. Great graphics, great sound and a good amount of old school style gaming with online capability make this one worth waiting for through all those delays (this was supposed to have been released back in November!).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2005"}

NOT SPOILERS, I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm on the last mission now. So far, terrific! This game is definitely not for children, it is an adult-only game. But it's awesome, and very funny. I'd never laughed with a grand theft auto game before like I did with this one, but Trevor man, best character ever! I simply love Trevor. Michael and Franklin are fantastic too, but Trevor is a crazy psycho that makes me laugh every time I play with him (ransom mission is hilarious). OK, many people say GTA V is way too short. I concord, it's a little short. I have done almost every mission, playing a couple of hours daily last week and I'm ending the story soon. Good news is this game comes with a crazy online that will keep this title fresh for a long long time. Graphics are very good, the best you can find in any other sandbox game, think in any game (current gen sandbox) and GTA V has better graphics. Story is good, nothing spectacular, but engaging enough. There are a couple of missions that require you to make certain decisions and plan what to do, pick your team members, and those are fantastic, because you switch your characters, Michael, Franklin or Trevor, depending on their positions and/or abilities, etc.. Driving is very good too, specially with Franklin who is the best driver along the three characters. Flying is the only thing I didn't enjoy as much as I thought because it's kind of difficult with certain planes, the bigger the harder and way more turbulence which makes it ever harder. I recommend taking lessons (yes, there is a school where can learn how to fly a plane better - Trevor only, but you can fly a plane with any character at any time). OK guys, my last words are these: I pre-order a next gen console, but I'm keeping my Xbox 360 just for this game, GTA V is that good! It has sold more than a billion dollars (so, R* doesn't need to sell more), buy it with confidence, it is a fantastic game and you will not regret buying it, you'll regret not buying this game! It's not perfect, but it's very very good.FYI, I recommend not installing disc 2 (playing game) on your HDD. Some people (like myself) bought a USB flash to install disc 1 (mandatory installation) and play disc 2 (no installation). You don't need to switch between discs, you only install disc 1 and that's it. Installing disc 1 on a USB flash is a good option if you don't have a HDD. If you do, a good option to enjoy this game is: Install disc 1 (mandatory) on your HDD, and install disc 2 on a USB flash, NOT ON YOUR HDD. Why? Because installing disc 2 on your HDD makes you experience many problems while you play. Enjoy GTA V! Kifflom! Kifflom! Kifflom!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2013"}

You and your rivals are dodging other cars or even drive against traffic when you go the the wrong way! Its actually even better to go the wrong way because when you avoid collisions, you'll be rewarded with boost meter. You can play several modes: Race (standard race), Time trials (beat the clock), World tournaments (race in other countries), Crash mode (cause car accident chain reactions) and a new feature called Road rage (awesome). Crash mode returns and to help you create more devestating accidents, they included powerups to help increase your score and destruction: some maps have money pick-ups, speed boost, multiplyer, and explosives. You can now activate super slow motion and guide your car in mid-air called \"impact time\" to targets. Your vehicle also acts as a bomb. If you press detonate, it will explode to cause more damage to the already lethal car accidents; and remember that this is happens in super slow motion and looks fantastic. In Road Rage mode you are trying to push your rivals off the road or cause them to crash while traveling at blazing speeds; hence the name \"takedown\". When you collect enough points you can unlock new, tracks, cars, and lots of other goodies. The sense of speed in this game is incredible!Why bother buying other racers?

Suddenly, the manhole covers all around you begin to erupt with pillars of fire, causing you and your rivals to swerve radically in order to avoid getting incinerated. But just as you think you're in the clear, time slows to a screeching halt as the entire road blows up in front of you, creating a makeshift ramp above a blazing chasm. Hitting your boost, you leave your opponents in your dust as your car soars mere feet above the raging inferno below you. All of this happens in less than 15 seconds. This is the chaotic world of \"Motorstorm Apocalypse\", which houses the most fun I've had with a racing game since \"Burnout Revenge.\"There is a plot to this festival of carnage, which, as you may have guessed, is pretty terrible. Throughout the paper thin story, you take control of three different characters who belong to a roaming group of racing junkies. This motley crew runs around in a post-apocalyptic society and race each other because... well, because they want to, I suppose. There's nothing particularly engaging about these characters, and their interactions only serve as a segway from one race to another. While there is a certain shlocky B-movie charm to the cheesy dialogue and \"Road Warrior\"-derived plot, that charm is sucked out by the disparagingly low-rent motion comic cutscenes, which look cheap and are immensely disjointed at times. If you don't go in expecting too much, and instead view the whole story as a funny checklist of cliches (oppressive corporations, warring factions, etc.) to get a few cheap laughs out of, you'll do just fine.Nobody expects a good plot from a racing game, however, and Evolution Studios is well aware of this. That's why their game picks up the slack with the actual act of driving, with some of the most responsive and fluid controls seen in a modern game of this genre. While I did experience some irritating moments of getting caught in a tricky skid, or overshooting a turn and ramming smack-dab into a wall, these were mainly due to my lack of effort with the controls. Unlike many contemporaries, \"MS: Apocalypse\" doesn't simply move you in a straight line and only expect you to accelerate and make minimal turns. It expects you to take full advantage of each track, micromanaging every turn, skid, and jump you make. It's been a while since a racing game has made me pay full attention to what I'm doing at all times, and it's certainly a welcome change of pace from the linear eye candy that passes as a \"racing game\" lately. If all of the games in this franchise are like this, then a few more games are going to be added to my permanent collection very soon.Where this game also impresses are the tracks. Each course is a living, breathing thing, a veritable deathtrap that waits expectantly for you to make one wrong turn so it can wreck your car. As you progress in the story mode, each course becomes more and more dangerous, and each experience is unique due to your constantly shifting vehicles. Expect to dodge boats being flung at you by a hurricane while barreling forward in a bulky truck, and to soar from rooftop to collapsing rooftop in an ATV. If the \"Uncharted\" series and a car had a baby after watching the \"Mad Max\" trilogy, this would be the adrenaline-charged result. Even replaying the same course in the campaign is never the same, and with plenty of time to spend with it (not to mention trophies to earn), the single player experience is definitely worth the price of admission. Add that on top of your typical Tournament and Elimination modes, plus both online and offline multiplayer modes, and you've got a robust package for your average racing fan.That being said, there are a few negatives worth mentioning. What needs to be called out first and foremost is the abhorrent, dreadful, nauseating \"music\" that thumps and \"wub-wubs\" throughout your time with the game. As a longtime lover of electronic music, this horrible collection of generic dubstep is downright offensive to even my auditory senses. Luckily, the racing sounds are loud and exciting enough to drown out this mess, but those not keen to the \"brostep\" fad deserve some fair warning. Another point of lamentation revolves around how long the action takes to get off the ground. For a good portion of game's beginning, you'll be driving through some very similar landscapes, to the point where you get a bit bored of the same color schemes and track designs. This may dissuade some players with short attention spans, but the wait is certainly worth it, considering how loony the racing gets later on.Graphically, this game is a mixed bag. Some of the most vibrant levels look gorgeous, and acts of massive destruction are breathtaking in their sheer scale and unpredictability. Also impressive is the consistent damage your vehicles take throughout the course of each race. At the same time, some of the more urban landscapes look very drab and dull unless there's a storm or series of earthquakes to spice them up, and the aforementioned motion comics look very sloppy and out of place when held up to the rest of the game. Overall, some levels dazzle, while kind of fall to the wayside while you focus on the race.What does deserve some praise, though, are the 3D effects. While I'm still not a believer in buying a 3D TV, this is a nice game to showcase one if you happen to already own it. I demonstrated a level to one of my family members, who hates 3D, and even she was blown away by the effort that went into the effects here. Levels such a pier being ravaged by a massive tornado and a suburban town getting torn apart by an earthquake are some of the best for this feature. If you've got a 3D TV, or the Playstation 3D Display (which was the rig I played this on), 3D definitely enhances the overall graphical experience, and makes it easy to overlook some of the lower resolution textures and the occasional boring level.The gangs in \"Road Warrior\" have nothing on this gang of post-apocalyptic daredevils. If you've been left in the cold by recent driving games that are too linear or too rigid for you to enjoy, \"Motorstorm Apocalypse\" is a one-two punch of hardcore racing and stunt action. Once you overlook some its flaws, you'll be on the edge of your seat and obsessing over getting just ONE RANK HIGHER in each action-packed race. For the money, it's a great little title, and nice PS3 exclusive for racing and action junkies.Plot: 7.5Gameplay: 9Graphics: 8Sound: 7.5Overall: 8","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004H0J5S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Foy \"Foy\"","summary":"Great history, dated gameplay","reviewText":"Chances are if you're thinking about picking up this low budget, little known title, it's because you are either into niche games or are interested in the Crusader era and the true Templar Order as I am. For those who want a decent game in this under utilized time period, The First Templar is a worthwhile expeirence if you're willing to overlook the many rough patches.Upon first glance it is clear this is a low budget title which should come as no surprise considering it released at a discounted price and was marked down further shortly after release. Right from the start I noticed the awkward running animation of the protagonist as well as dodgy collision detection and unfinished battle animations in the very first fight. These visual glitches would be inexcusable in a full priced mainstream title, and they will turn off many gamers, but the gameplay itself works fine. Levels are full of invisible walls and various contrived barriers which keep you on a linear path for the most part. The NPCs you come across have an appropriate look for the time period but often look identical throughout the game with little distinguishable features; every monk in this game seems to be a clone of one another, the same with the merchants. Sound effects get the job done during combat and as background noise, but the spoken dialogue jumps in volume from audible to nearly inaudible as if it were slipping back and forth from stereo sound to mono. The voice acting actually isn't that bad for a budget title and though the voice actors are clearly reading from a script, at least they don't overact their parts. The narrator is pretty awesome, he's like a well spoken grandfather reading you a story. To put it simply, the game looks and sounds like the budget title it is, so if you can only enjoy a game with a heavy coat of polish and sheen in these departments despite the quality of gameplay then The First Templar is not the title for you.Having pointed out the obvious shortcomings of the game's visuals and audio, I would like to make note that though the graphics certainly won't win any awards and could pass for an early Xbox 1 title, the artistic direction of the environments is actually quite pretty. You will find yourself adventuring in a large variety of locales from the European countryside, to Crusader cities such as the historical Acre, to the vast deserts of Otermer. You will explore ancient catacombs, wander the misty forest, run through a burning forest; avoid traps in secret temples, fight in the midst of siege warfare, and explore a large medieval castle. The variety offered is more than welcome and many of these areas genuinely look good with plenty of heart and soul put into their design and presentation. You can't scale walls, explore buildings, interact with the environment, or wander off the beaten path, but you do have plenty of optional bonus objectives to complete which add some sense of openness to each level. There were many moments while playing where I wondered how much a bigger budget would have helped the developers fully realize their vision since the ideas are definitely there for a great game. After a slow start I slowly but steadily became more wrapped up in the game, looking forward to where I would end up next, but it's not the type of game that stuck with me when I wasn't playing.The music fits the time period and the various cultures you will run across, it is catchy too. Distinctly European and Middle Eastern tunes were a delight to my ears, further drawing me into the world, but each track runs on a loop that at times ends abruptly, pauses for about a minute of silence, and then restarts. This reminds me of an old jukebox switching records and serves as another reminder that this isn't the most polished game out there.Actually playing the game is a mixed bag, but one I enjoyed for the most part. The First Templar is a hack and slash with light RPG style upgrades and linear level design consisting of a few branching paths to complete the bonus objectives mentioned earlier. Most of the game is spent moving your character and A.I./Coop partner (drop in coop is supported in both online and offline play, and you can switch between both playable characters in single player with the press of a button) from one battle to the next which means the combat mechanics are the meat of the game. The combat can be described as accessible but not overly simplistic; button mashing will get you nowhere as the game progresses. Both you, your partner, and your enemies have your own combos, defensive maneuvers, and special attacks that must be used appropriately in order to be victorious. Certain combos and special powers can be used to break an enemy's shield or knock him to the ground to leave him vulnerable for a one shot coup de grace. Other maneuvers are coop based, and defense involves the use of your shield, an evasive roll, and a counter attack; all of which must be timed properly for maximum effect. The special abilities use up zeal orbs which are essentially mana you can regenerate. Learning to manage the zeal properly by using the special abilities effectively added some depth to the combat which I found to be quite fun and rewarding once I got the hang of things. The combat has it's own feel to it, it's own identity, and I like the system they implemented. Charging into a group of enemies to knock them out of formation and cutting them down one by one with a sword combo, a shield bash, and a well placed kick is both fun to play and watch on screen. The feeling that I was in an actual sword fight is executed surprisingly well and as different enemy types are introduced I found myself planning my attacks accordingly: take out their shields first, then cut down the archers, then finish off who's left. The controls are highly responsive and intuitive when surrounded which is good because knocking back enemies to give yourself some space is integral to surviving each battle. Working up those hit chains and timing each strike just right to get a critical hit further adds to the experience. Keep in mind that the combat focuses on timing instead of providing you with a large arsenal of moves, so you will need to master the intricacies of the handful of combos and abilities you unlock over the course of the game.Aside from head to head battles, stealth plays a rather significant role. The stealth is as basic as it gets where you sneak around by holding the left trigger and creep up behind an enemy to snap his neck for an instant kill. Sometimes there are pots nearby which can be thrown to distract enemies, giving you a choice of slipping by unnoticed or going in for the kill. As basic and pedestrian as the stealth gameplay can be, these moments did help mix things up in the gameplay department, but more kill animations would have been appreciated other than the generic neck snap. A more elaborate sneak option would have been ideal as well, but this is yet another area where the limited budget most likely comes into play.In addition to mixing up the gameplay by incorporating stealth, there are also levels where the focus is to avoid booby traps and solve puzzles. It is in these levels where the clumsy collision detection moves beyond a visual nuisance and adversely effects gameplay, but it's nothing game breaking. There were a few instances where I could have sworn I avoided a spike jutting up from the floor or a flame igniting from the wall only to find myself taking damage. Again, it was nothing game breaking, but it's something to watch out for. The puzzles require cooperation to complete, but most of them require different levers to be pulled. The developers did a good job in trying to vary the experience even if a number of the levels are hit or miss in terms of fun factor. The variety certainly helps the pacing of the game where just when I found myself tiring of the combat in came a slower paced stealth or puzzle level. Towards the end the levels combine combat, stealth, traps, and puzzles at different intervals so pay attention to the tricks this game throws at you during the earlier and middle levels, because it all comes into play in the later levels.The narrative of the game is an epic but cliche tale about a quest for the Holy Grail involving various competing factions with plenty of twists that you may or may not find interesting. It's not a bad story and I liked the characters; some of the banter between the two main characters of the game, Celian and Marie, is genuinely funny and thoughtful which added color to their individual personalities and relationship to one another. They are far more charming than the male, female duo in Ubi Soft's 2008 Prince of Persia game...at least I thought so.There is drop in and drop out coop for both online and offline play, but most of my time was spent in single player. I did play a couple levels with an online partner, and it seemed that playing with another person would enhance the overall experience, but I can't comment any further since I didn't put much time into it. As you can imagine, there aren't very many people playing this online, but there usually seems to be at least one person playing whenever I did a search for an online game. If there is one thing that kills coop games like this in single player, it's the A.I., but The First Templar does a surprisingly good job here! In combat the A.I. held their own and saved my butt a number of times, in the trap and stealth levels the A.I. stayed close and proved to have excellent pathfinding. Whatever graphical glitches went unchecked in testing, the A.I. is borderline flawless.What really drew me to this game was the Crusade era and the Templar Order, there just aren't enough games which focus on this time period outside of the RTS genre and I personally can't stomach the conspiracy theory revisionism put forth in Assassins Creed. I don't mind if a game takes liberties with the history to tell a fictional story, I love historical fiction like Ivanhoe, but Assassin Creed just pissed all over the history of the Templars. The Templars were founded as guardians who protected the roads leading to the Holy Land so merchants and Christian pilgrims could travel safely without being attacked by slavers, bandits, and Saracens. The Templars created an ingenious banking system travelers could make use of and they were also a multicultural order who allowed various races, ethnicities, and even religions into their ranks. They are a complicated, invaluable, and controversial part of western history whom I wish both movies and games would do a more accurate job portraying. The First Templar involves plenty of conspiracy and fiction to tell its own story, but one of the truly fascinating aspects of this game are the hidden Templar chronicles that can be found in each level which provide for a short narrated anecdote about the Templar Order's origins, its customs and rules; its membership and various ranks; its rise and fall; its accomplishments and mistakes, and actual third party accounts from historical record from those who interacted with the Order. The Templars are treated these days as some kind of mystery even though who and what they were is well documented history, and The First Templar does a good job in lifting the veil of mystery should you choose to find and read these chronicles (there is an achievement for finding all 50 or so of them). Maybe the game will encourage some to read more about this time period, but I'm betting those who pick this up are already history buffs to begin with.In closing, the Templar is a budget title which I found to be rather entertaining, but there are plenty of tedious and derivative moments throughout. It's choppy animations and graphical shortcomings are clearly evident, but many of the environments are genuinely nice to look at thanks to the artistic direction. It's a pretty long game which took me around 20 hours to beat it on hard, and the levels mix up the gameplay here and there. Overall it is a well done budget game, the Bulgarian studio who worked on it clearly has talent, but it feels like something I would have played (and enjoyed) 10 years ago. It's not cheap, it's not lazy, it's not broken, but it can be described as dated. If you can handle dated visuals and play mechanics with an accessible, simple, but fun combat system in an underused time period for games then by all means pick this up. It's really a 2.5 star game, but I rounded up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Tetris911","summary":"Thank you Ni No Kuni!","reviewText":"I have stopped playing RPG games for quite some time now because there are either too many of them are because they are simply way too complicated to play.  The only RPG's are normally play nowadays are the Mario & Luigi games for the Nintendo portable systems. The last true RPG game I played for the consoles was probably Final Fantasy X and after that I just slowly lost interest because I was so pre-occupied with other games that I really wanted to play. So just recently I played the demo for this game a month ago on the PS3, I was TRULY amazed how beautiful this game looked and how fun it was to play at the same time. I just had to add this game to my wish list and once my birthday was around the corner, this was the last game I was expecting to get since nobody has heard of it and because of the price of the game was pretty high. Normally, I get games that are in the $9.99-$49.99 range since there are a ton of games that are selling for incredibly low prices and I still have a backlog of games that I need to finish as well! But once I got this game for my b-day, I was ACTUALLY excited to play this game, which was a first since normally I rarely play RPG games. So I popped in the game and the game literally took me right back to the good ole days of awesome original RPG games that made you fall in love with RPG's in the first place. I also love the fact that the game allows for live action battles instead of just standing there, waiting for your turn to attack, etc. Not this game, this game you have complete control over your character and you can freely roam everywhere you want! Even the animation/artwork is SIMPLY amazing when you play the game on a beautiful 51 inch HD TV. The music is incredible and it truly makes you feel like a kid again that was pouring HOURS into RPG games like Xenogears, Final Fantasy 7, Saga Frontier, etc. I am happy to say that Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch got me back into RPG games and I am glad I gave this game a chance after playing the demo because you will not regret it! I also heard that this game is available on the Nintendo 3DS in Japan and if that ever gets released in America for the Nintendo 3DS, then I am certainly picking it up day 1 since I would re-play this game again on a portable device. Also, if you are a fan of Princess Mononok, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, Arriety, Grave of the FireFlies, etc then you will certainly love this game because it really does feel like you are living and breathing in a Studio Ghibli (the company that made the movies I just mentioned) world! So far I have already clocked in 55 hours into this game and I am getting pretty close to the end but there is so much to do on the side such as quests, hidden treasure chests, bounty hunts, etc that I can choose to end the game if I want to but the game offers so much replay value that you will want to explore more before progressing onto the next task!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B005UDTTQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Surpasses War for Cybertron in every way imaginable - except for one thing...","reviewText":"The reason I wanted this game so badly is because I really enjoyed the first one. For the most part, it exceeded my expectations except for one thing, and I'll touch on that later in the review. You guys don't understand, I -REALLY- wanted to give this game 5 stars, because it deserves it. It was a solid 5 star game up until... Nevermind, I'm jumping the gun here...Combat - Nothing has changed in this department (for the most part), which is not a bad thing. This game mainly consists of third person shooter gameplay, with a little melee sprinkled in, if you so desire. It's pretty cool that we can now use stealth to attack some opponents. Now, there is one other thing that HAS changed in regards to combat. In War for Cybertron, you were accompanied by two other Autobots/Decepticons that helped you in combat and made things a bit easier. Fall of Cybertron pretty much throws you to the wolves and you'll have to kick butt by your lonesome for the majority of the campaign. I actually like this because I was forced to strategize and plan my attacks, as opposed to heavily relying on my help (which actually helped out, just read my review of that game). Also, by pressing the circle button, you switch shooting hands in the heat of battle. This saved my life countless of times because it allowed me to get a better angle. I don't recall the switching of shooting hands ability being in the last game, but I could be wrong. The ability to transform and fight in vehicle mode is still present. I have to use this opportunity to tell you guys there's nothing more satisfying than playing as Megatron, transforming into a cannon, and proceeding to blast a hole the size of Cybertron in an Autobot's chest!Weaponry - Again, not much has changed. Your choice of weapons will primarily consist of guns and rocket launchers. But, the one change that was made is a big deal and really added to the gameplay. I don't recall coming across any new weapons, which is fine with me because I loved the ones in the previous games. There are a couple of new gadget type things, but I never used those anyway. The big change is you're now able to upgrade your weapons by visiting the Teletraan store. In the past, the only way you were able to get a new weapon was by picking one up from a fallen enemy, or just by stumbling upon one. Now, you can visit a conveniently placed Teletraan store and change weapons as often as you would like, as well as upgrade them. Like always, you can carry a light weapon and a heavy one. Even if you haven't played the first game, you will not be disappointed in the weaponry.Enemies - Well, it's not a huge selection here, but I think it's enough to keep things interesting. Some are flying, some are on ground vehicles, while others are simply on foot. They provide a tough challenge on normal skill level. Like I mentioned earlier, you'll be by yourself in most battles, so be ready. I do have one minor gripe - It would be kind of cool if the enemies transformed back and forth between robot and vehicle mode, but perhaps that's asking too much. Ok, here's why I decided to deduct a star. This is the first game I've played that only has one boss battle in the entire game. I don't have a problem with that, many times the boss battles are over-done in games anyway. However, if there's going to be one battle, it sure in the heck better be of E P I C proportions! Sadly, this boss battle gets a F for me. I really, really wish I could go into more detail here, but it's hard to do without giving up spoilers. This I CAN say: In War for Cybertron, you battle Trypticon (if you play the Autobot campaign) and it took hours for me to beat him! This current guy took all of 5 minutes (if that). You don't go from Trypticon to this; that's disrespectful to the fans, as well as Trypticon...Miscellaneous - This franchise doesn't consist of sidemissions and things of that nature, so don't expect it. It's a pretty linear game, and there's not much to look for, with the exception of audio tapes and weapon blueprints. In regards to length, it's about the same length as the previous game. There is a Multiplayer mode if you're into that kind of thing. I tried it once or twice, and wasn't impressed. But then again, I'm never impressed with any MP being incorporated in a single player game, but that's a topic for another day...Sighs... Believe it or not, this is one of the most solid games I've played in quite some time. If it wasn't for that last boss, this would have been a 5 star game for me (easily). I mean come on guys, you get to play as Grimlock! It doesn't get much better than that. If there's only one boss battle, he/she needs to be memorable like Trypticon was, not forgettable like what's his face in Fall of Cybertron. See what I mean? God of War Ascension, you're up next big guy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2013"}

A few years ago he left Square-Enix and formed his own studio: Mistwalker.  So far they've released Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey.  Two games that, for the most part, were more or less reminders of the Final Fantasy series.  The Last Story, however, is a whole different beast from either of those games and Final Fantasy in general.  Appropriately named, The Last Story is said to be Hironobu Sakagunchi's last game.  If that's true, the man surely went out with a bang.  There are just so few games like it.The story is just about as basic as it gets.  Zael is a mercenary who dreams of one day being a knight.  After coming back from a successful mission, he and his allies are hired by the nobility.  Zael slowly gets one step closer to realizing his dream, but he's also falling for a mysterious woman.  And in the end, he'll ultimately be tested between his loyalty to his allies and going after a dream he so desperately wants amongst a war that has broken out as well.  There are a lot of \"by the books\" stuff in The Last Story.  The plot has a few twists and turns but it relies quite heavily on the familiar to tell its story.  However, the story doesn't always get too bogged down in its themes.  The JRPG is a genre known for, at some point, having characters sit around and give big speeches about destiny, justice etc. that are borderline preaching, but this never actually happens in The Last Story.What really makes the Last Story work are the characters.  The entire ensemble cast is really strong.  Amongst their relationships and banter you get the sense that the characters have truly developed personalities.  A lot of this helps the characters transcend simply playing their typical role.  And they'll all grow a great deal as the game moves on.  The writing is also gorgeous.  The dialog exchanges are some of the best we've seen from the genre in a long time.  The chemistry between the characters and their banter is enough to keep you pushing through the story.  It also helps because it means the story will rarely get too boring or grate on your nerves.  Though it's a short game overall (if you simply stick to the story) it moves at a good pace.  It can be hard to put the game down.  The characters are good that it helps the story stand out as being one of the best in the genre.As of late, quite a few JRPGs have been moving steadily from their typical turn based fare to being a bit more action oriented or putting a more western RPG spin on it.  The Last Story joins these ranks but it also mixes the two in ways that are quite good.  There are no shifts into a turn based battle.  Rather your characters pull out their weapons and you're free to move about as you please on the field.  Your characters will automatically attack the enemy when you approach.  There are quite a few things added to the battle system for good measure.  You can take cover behind pillars or rocks, for instance.  You'll soon gain abilities as well.  One has you able to leap over your cover and execute a powerful slash.  Another lets you run up a wall and perform a slash.  There's a lot more to the battle system besides just hacking and slashing.There's also a surprisingly large amount to observe during battle.  Mages have a countdown timer and you must protect them so they can cast.  There are magic circles along the ground that you can stand in and gain effects.  There are also times when you'll have to perform some context sensitive actions to really take advantage of what the battle system has to offer.  What's so great about it all is that it runs rather smoothly.  The arenas are big and spacious, allowing for you to run around and formulate decent strategies.  In some instances you can even lure enemies away from a crowd and take them out stealthily.The only thing that can be a little annoying about the battle system is that at some point it's really easy to make a character do something you didn't want them to do.  You might, for instance, be trying to take cover only for a character to attempt to run up a wall.  Or you might roll to dodge an attack and they take cover instead.  This happens from time to time, but it was rarely too troublesome.  It doesn't matter anyway because The Last Story is certainly not out to punish you.  Your characters will level up relatively fast and every battle your characters get five lives each.  If their HP drops to zero they can be easily resurrected.  Chances are, no battle will last long enough (save for boss fights) for you to really have to worry about a character ever losing all of their lives.The battle system is certainly complex, but it doesn't take a long time to really grasp it.  You can also access the tutorial any time you don't really understand something.  For the most part, however, battling is a lot of fun and really keeps the momentum of the game flowing.  Gone are the tedious transitions from combat to field and replaced with something that feels fresh.  Not that this was always a bad thing, but the JRPG has had quite a hard time trying to find it's footing in the current era of gaming and it's nice to see that with all The Last Story does it lands firmly on its feet showing that the genre still has a lot to give in some unexpected ways.The Last Story is a fairly linear game, but it's actually not really such a bad thing.  There's actually still a lot of exploring and a lot of side quests that can be done.  It's only to say that when you get back to the story you'll mostly have a clear objective the game will gladly lead you too.  The locales, however, are wonderfully constructed and give you the sense there is truly something more to what you may be exploring.  Likewise, because of the approach The Last Story takes it hardly waste time getting you through things.  The focus is really on the story.  This means the game won't be sending you out to constantly fetch this or that item to create this or that weapon too much (if really at all).  It puts so much stock in its story that it happily abandons a lot of common RPG tropes to help you get the best experience out of it.The visual presentation takes things up a notch as well.  As far as Wii games go, The Last Story is among the best looking.  Locations are wonderfully populated, the art style is fantastic and the environments are brimming with detail.  For a Wii game it's pretty darn amazing in a lot of ways.  It definitely pushes the Wii to its limits.  There are times when the frame rate will dip because the game will buckle under its own weight but it's rarely a problem.  The game loads a lot of its content and areas surprisingly fast.The biggest note of praise, however, most certainly comes to the music and voice acting.  Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu composes the score and its every bit as emotional as you'd expect it to be, perfectly complimenting some of the games very emotional or epic moments.  The voice acting, however, is fantastic.  This is saying a lot for a JRPG.  There are a lot of characters that speak in accents but they're very well done here.  Along with the creative and witty writing it's the perfect visual and audio presentation.  The game is firing on all cylinders here and it's hard not to be drawn into it when it's doing everything so well.The Last Story is a magnificent game.  It finds the right balance in everything.  It's linear, sure, but also more than willing to let you do things outside of the story.  It has a lot of common themes but presents strong characters to help it along.  It's got moments where there's lots of exposition but the chemistry between the characters is so good that you'll actually appreciate the downtime from battling.  Simply put, if you're a fan of the JRPG you need to play The Last Story.  It's some of the best the genre has to offer and is definitely among the Wii's best titles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

First, I would like to say to parents, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18.  The game does contain some nudity and suggestive themes and is very violent.I was impressed by the game play and graphics.  It was like Devil May Cry meets 300.  The games contain killer combos and a great upgrade system, but there is one thing about the game that bothered me.I consider myself a fairly good gamer, but there were points in GOW that frustrated me to no end.  Even changing it to easy did not seem to make a difference.  For example, in the Hades level you have to climb up rotating pillars, while blades are rotating around.  Sounds simple enough right?  Wrong, you touch one and you fall all the way down to the bottom and start over.  This is just one of many frustrating obstacles.  With that being said though, for some reason the game compels you to keep trying and eventually get through it no matter how many times you have to try.  I am starting on GOW II now and so far so good.PROS:-Great graphics and story.-Good control.-Great value.CONS:-May be too difficult at times for some gamers.I would definitely recommend this game, but beware if you are just a casual gamer.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Prepare to die!","reviewText":"My biggest gripe about other shooters is that after the first playthrough, the games become too easy; you get more ammo, health and weapons upgrades than you can ever use. Games like Bioshock (one of my favorites) are not as much fun when you can't pick up most of what you find because your inventory and wallet are both maxed out. That's true of Dead Space 1 as well. That is not a problem in Dead Space 2, at least not in my first two playthroughs.I think there is a lot more strategy involved in DS2 regarding whether to upgrade your weapons (and which ones), or upgrade your suit/rig to withstand attacks better, or to spend the money on ammo and health kits. On my first replay, I was spending all my money on upgrading weapons and was always running out of ammo.The extensive strategic choices you can make in the game, along with the fact that it does not appear that it gets too easy on replays, makes me think that this is going to have very good replay value.DS1 was marred by the meteor mini-game which required more luck than skill and could require 50+ tries to complete, or you might get it in one try. There is nothing as ridiculous as that in DS2, but you may have to die 10-20 times to figure out what moves are needed to beat a few of the challenges (reminds me of the movie Groundhog Day: go left, die, next time go right, repeat 20 times), which is why I downgraded the game from 5 stars to 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"Harmony of Dissonance","reviewText":"The ever lasting Castlevania series hit incredibly high on the GBA with the release of Circle of the Moon.  Circle of the Moon being one of the best Castlevania games ever made (though, once again, nothing compares to Symphony of the Night).  Harmony of Dissonance, the second of the GBA games, is also a fantastic game.Castlevania almost never tells a different story.  This time it's Juste Belmont out to defeat the evil count.  Castlevania hasn't been about story so much as it's been about gameplay.  Harmony of Dissonance certainly does have good gameplay.Once again, Castlevania takes on a Metroid feel as you explore through the castle.  Some areas can't be reached until you've got certain abilities and have defeated certain bosses, but for the most part, the game is highly non-linear.  You can tackle the game in almost any order you feel.Juste arms himself with a whip.  It's the only weapon he uses.  You can press and hold B and it'll dangle and you can control it, but you'll almost never need or use this move throughout the game.  Juste can also use secondary weapons such as the Cross, Axe, Holy Water and Dagger.  There are a few more than this, but these are the basics that have been in just about every Castlevania game.  Now, however, you can combine them with different kinds of special magic books.  While Juste can only carry one sub-weapon at a time, the results of combinging it with an elemental magic book is different.  There aren't nearly as many combinations as the Circle of the Moon's DSS Card System, but it gives the game enough variety to the point where it isn't stale.Harmony of Dissonance isn't a hard game.  In fact, in comparison to Circle of the Moon, it's incredibly easy.  Even the games bosses are not much of a challenge at all.  It's a fun trip, but it's a lot easier than your standard Castlevania.However, despite it's ease, the game looks absolutely fantastic.  The GBA's power really shines with this game.  The environments are decorative, and they're not quite as dark as Circle of the Moon's.  The bosses and castle design also look refreshingly fantastic.Then we get to the music.  The music really should've been better, but to clear a couple of things up, I'll tell you why the music isn't a fault of this game.  For one, if you disliked the music... good.  You're NOT supposed to like this music.  The subtitle of the game is, after all, Harmony of Dissonance.  The music does a great job of giving the feeling of dissonance.  It's easily demonstrated in how people negatively feel about the music.  So the music IS horrible, but it isn't meant to be good.  It's meant to give the feeling of dissonance and it succeeds simply because most people don't like it.  So no, you're not supposed to like the music in this game.  In fact, you're supposed to hate it.  So the reviewers saying the music is terrible are absolutely right.  But it's not supposed to be good.Harmony of Dissonance is a great addition to the Castlevania series, but it really doesn't do much to separate it from others in the series.The Good+Fantastic visuals+The music gives the feeling of dissonance+A lot of variety to the gameplay+Great bosses and explorationThe bad-The music, as many have said... isn't good, but it's not supposed to be likeable-It's way too easy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2006"}

One of the things I really like about the Wii is that it exercises more than my fingers. I can have a real sword fight and feel like I'm holding a sword and not just pushing buttons. This game got it right all the way around. Good accuracy and response on the Wii remote combined with responsive nunchuk moves and a fun storyline that does not leave you struggling to figure out where you are in a maze. Anyone can sit down (you won't be sitting down for long!) with the game and enjoy it while the more advanced player can enjoy combining many of the moves and sword techniques you are taught throughout the game to show off their skill and make short work of opponents. If more games used the Wii's abilities as well as this one does it would blow Xbox out of the water.

Gaming was in more or less a casual rut, and hardcore gamers were becoming sick of the simple games that while may have been innovative, lacked depth and most of all, a REAL challenge. DMC changes all this by bringing us an incredibly cool, slick and likable new character, gorgeous and unique level design, and a battle system that'll give you so many special movies and upgrades that it'll take about 3 playthroughs to actual be able to \"afford\" them all (considering the red orbs you collect by slaying demons and monsters are what buy you new special moves).You control Dante- slick showoff, gun-toting, sword wielding, badboy extrordinaire, who has a demon hunting business in some fictional city that one day gets visited by a mysterious woman who tells him of some god who's giving rise to the evil underworld. It's pretty vague and unfortunately the rest of the game's simple story gets almost lost on you because many times the action and sound effects will be so loud, the character dialogue is near inaudible. Anyway, you enter this gothic castle and the game has you playing through \"missions\" that have you completing a certain task in order to get through to the next level, all within the same castle of course. Don't worry, backtracking is kept to a minimal.The first thing most gamers will notice is the unpredictable challenge. The first level boss is tough, and simply standing near him, swiping your sword and jumping away every few seconds (as many other games allow) will only lead you to an early grave. Defeating these enemies takes a quick eye and even quicker reflexes, as many bosses reappear randomly in certain areas and due to the continue system in the game (purchasing yellow orbs gets you back to a checkpoint, but any items you've used before you died will be gone the second time around, and if you're out of yellow orbs, you've got to start the level all over again, which becomes downright heartbreaking a few times), the 22 missions in the game may only take about 6 or 7 hours in total, but you'll be playing a lot longer considering all the deaths and re-tries you'll be using. The game becomes progressively more difficult, but due to the gradual learning curve the gameplay itself will become easier to manage because gamers will, get this, BUILD thier skill. The great thing about DMC is that it emphasizes skill and reflexes, not button mashing. Unfortunately, at a few points in the game the third person camera (which isn't controlled by the player in some boss fights) works against you and can leave you wondering where exactly you are and in what direction you need to be attacking, which can lead to a death at a point that'll send you directly to the beginning of the level (swear inducing stuff). In simplist terms, this game is HARD, but ultimately rewarding.Besides the challenge, the environments are beautiful. The gothic and romantically dark castle feels surrealistic at some points and really takes a personality all its own. Still, the same can't be said about some very blocky and pixalated enemies, who can look downright ridiculous at some points (one boss had me asking myself \"what the hell is that thing supposed to be???\"). Other enemies are somewhat funny looking also, and unfortunately forgetful, and don't carry anywhere near the type of memorable personality from a game like Resident Evil 4.Still, I had loads of fun with this game and for the first time in a very long time, the game made me feel good about finally beating it, which is a lot more than I can say about a lot of overly long, yet easy games out there. I'm a Dante fan for life.BOTTOM LINE: For true hardcore gamers this is a MUST buy, for the casual Madden NFL guy, go back to your beer and let the real gamers play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2006"}

I don't hold it up as some amazing game that'll be remembered for years to come, but I do think it was solid and enjoyable enough to warrant my interest in the franchise. So I waited impatiently for Dragon Age II. I waited to see if all of the issues with the first game were sent to die. Sadly, the issues with the first game returned, in addition to more issues, as well.Positives:- The Combat is Improved - I actually enjoy that the combat is more 1:1 and feels like it's less tactical. I know many fans of the original will disagree with me here, and I welcome that, but I felt more in control with the new combat system.- Some Decent Characters - I enjoyed quite a few of the characters in this game. There was some nice variation to the cast.- The Main Character is Voiced - Giving your character more place in the world, Bioware gave your main character a voice.Negatives:- Incredibly Lazy Design - Repeat environments, repeat dungeons, copy & paste environments. This game is put together so poorly.- Bland World, Mediocre Graphics - Poor textures everywhere, 2D trees, some NPC models that look straight out of 1995, flat lighting, \"game-y\" looking city environments. Nothing even strives to look real and immerse you. Everything looks like a prop.- Stripped Down RPG Mechanics - Take an RPG, like Origins, then rip a lot of the most important features away -- that's Dragon Age II!- Average Story - Generic, poorly done, etc.- Tech Issues - Freezes, glitches, odd cutscene transitions, etc. Bleh.Dragon Age II is totally playable, and you may even get a good bit of enjoyment out of it, but it's nothing to write home about. If this is all you've got, Bioware, just stick to Mass Effect or something.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}

I have yet to buy any. I have a decent sized collection of PS 2 and GameCube games. The XBox has been a dust collector for a while.This weekend I decided to do some renting to see if there is anything of value for the system yet, and thankfully there is. I know I could get blasted by Halo fans for not acknowledging it as the \"best game ever\" but Eternal Darkness has my vote for that, and Halo is a first person shooter that will be out done by Metroid Prime shortly. Usually I don't like First Person Shooters anyway. After many months Hunter: The Reckoning has made my purchase worthwhile. It's not a lot on story, but the pen and paper RPG can be like this as well. Unlike its sister World of Darkness games Vampire, and Mage, Hunter features a lot more of the \"Hack and slash\" gore fest than other World of Darkness games. The Pen and paper version still has a lot of room for character development and depth, something that the video game does not. What that game does offer is breathtaking visuals that are almost, but not quite, as good as GameCube's Resident Evil, fast paced Gauntlet like action, and a multiplayer game that beast out Gauntlet on many levels. Although it could be argued that the game more resembles Gauntlet than the pen and paper game that it is based on, but this is not a bad thing. A modern day Gauntlet is a beautiful thing, both graphically and game play wise. My only complaint is that the boss battles are too difficult to handle with just one or two players. It's only when you have all four that the bosses are doable, and even then they're difficult.Hunter is a sigh of relief for me. This one game has given me hope for this otherwise disappointing console. Perhaps XBox will have other World of Darkness based games that will be more story focused. Its not that the story is bad, just thin. It's still a great game though. It's worth it to get an XBox for Hunter alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2002"}

In a thrilling and frenetic 1st-person shooter you'll bust out of the triple-maximum security prison amidst vivid, ultra-realistic graphics. The epic story line will reveal secrets about Riddick's past and cast light upon his future. Features the voice and likeness of Vin Diesel.","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Story based \"Adult\" First Person Shooter","reviewText":"**Not for children**Butcher Bay happens to fit the niche nicely. After Half-Life 2 there was only really the Call of Duty: United Offensive as a good first person shooter (Doom 3 being an older game now and Far Cry also... you should play all of these if you have not). Riddick comes off the back of a very bad sequel to the surprise hit Pitch Black. Here we actually play a game that should maybe have been the sequel. It is certainly heaps better.The premise is very good. You are Riddick in a maximum security prison somewhere on a planet with inmates voiced by leading actors and facial expressions that are nearly as good as HL2. The atmosphere of the prison is A+ as you go about the place taking on various missions in the cells (fighting, buying drugs, snubbing out bosses, causing a riot, doing jobs for people) so that you can... escape Butcher Bay.The menu is astonishing at first as it opens up like a cube and the buttons move around. Riddick is mostly about stealth moves, like grabbing people from behind and either slicing them or breaking their neck. You can get into hand-to-hand combat where the enemies face actually bruises and bleeds. Clubs and knives have a similar effect. The story breaks nicely at the end of each level where you meet your foes. Riddick banters off some classic one-liners and there is quite a bit of swearing. You can talk to some of the characters and choose your answers.Once the prison riot starts, you are given weapons to escape the prison and the real rush begins (Doom 3 type fast and furious blasting). Enemy AI is quite good and the game plays very smoothly from start to finish. For all intensive purposes, the game play is very much like DEUS EX but the graphics are a way better. It is surprising how long this game is, given that it just seems like a movie tie-in package. It is not. This is a FULLY FLEDGED first person shooter all the way.It seems that high-end graphics \"adult\" first person shooters are back again! Bottom line is to play it.Pros:- Great Story- Great Graphics- As good as any new 1st person shooter.- It is long.Cons:- Not enough stealth jump moves.- Enemy AI can sometimes get a little repetitive.- Needs a fast high spec machine to run properly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2005"}

It would be true, what others have said, that no one has attempted a game like Heavy Rain before, although many of its features have been seen in many games before it.  Some of the parts (interactive quicktime events, for example) have been seen in God of War and others, although I like the way Heavy Rain handled them much better.  Overall, this is the most cinematic game I've played, and hands down the most adult, which was a welcome change from many Rated-M games that give a wink-and-a-nudge about their \"M\", rated for adults, made for sale to everyone, especially the younger market.  Any parent that would buy their kid Heavy Rain deserves the therapy they will eventually have to pay for.The graphics are outstanding, and yet, do suffer from frame rate issues.  If you soak in all the details of Heavy Rain, you'll realize that whatever engine they were using was, on occasion, being maxed out.  I don't think they redlined the potential of the PS3, but perhaps the engine they were using.  Still, its some of the best I've seen on any console, and by far the darkest, more noire imagery in a game I've played.  Music is stellar, and really gives the movie-like feel a whole new dimension - fantastic. Gameplay is done pretty well, although the tank-controls are ones I hope were things of the past, and sometimes navigation is frustrating.  There is often a focus on minutae, which in the beginning fleshes out the story, but towards the mid-way point starts to get frustrating,  To be fair, it does add an element of realism to the game.I bought Heavy Rain expecting a tour-de-force, best game I've ever played type game, and it came up short of expectations.  However, it is an amazing game, a must-buy for the PS3, and one to be savored for what the developers were trying to accomplish.  I think they mostly hit the mark, and I look forward to buying the DLC (and hopefully, a Heavy Rain 2 type game, with completely different storyline).  Its not a 5 star game necessarily overall, but its done so well and with so much innovation, I think the weaknesses bear rounding up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0047ODJAI","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An extremely scary ride is waiting","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent story telling, atmosphere, and riveting beginning and ending chapters, the javelin gun is awesome, new Necromorphs are great additions, the multiplayer is surprisingly funThe Bad: Too much is the same, only one new weapon, the middle chapters are pretty much the same, the multiplayer is short livedEver since the entertainment industry was born man has always loved to be scared. Despite our curiosity for death we loath it every day yet we surround ourselves with it in an ironic twist. Dead Space 2 is just a dot on the time line of horror and death in media, and we suck it up like candy. What makes Dead Space 2 quench our curiosity for horror, and pushing the human mind to it's psychological limits? The story of Isaac Clarke aboard The Sprawl, and returning to the Ishimura, may hold the answers.Isaac Clarke wakes up in a straight jacket, and is being chased by Necromorphs once again. He has to destroy The Marker, but he doesn't know how. His journey through The Sprawl is very dangerous and gut wrenching, but  I guarantee you'll love it. The combat is pretty much the same but feels slightly tighter and a little more responsive this time around. De-limbing Necromorphs is as satisfying as ever and proves to be pretty scary and gruesome. You can now use your telekinesis module in combat such as throwing limbs and objects at enemies to kill them, but I rarely used this method.There are a ton of weapons at your disposal but upgrading them all takes a couple of play throughs since power nodes are harder to come by, and you really need to rely on buying them. The new weapon (there's only one sadly) is the javelin gun which lets you launch spears at enemies and lets you impale them to walls. A secondary fire mode allows you to electrify the spear to shock nearby enemies or do extra damage. It seems a little over powered but works well on larger enemies.Speaking of new Necromorphs there are a few new great ones. The Stalkers are really great enemies because they hide and peek around corners and rush you. Using the force gun, or the javelin gun and using alt fire are great ways to stop these guys, or just planting mines. The Pack are screaming evil morphed children that rush you in well...packs. The force gun is the best way around these guys or the flamethrower. Another new enemy are Crawlers which are morphed infants that cry like babies and their bodies can explode. Using the force gun or flamethrower works great here too.Despite the combat being the same the pacing is great, and the atmosphere is extremely haunting especially during the first few chapters. The story telling is deeper thanks to Isaac actually talking and interacting with characters. The ending is excellent, but the game runs out of steam after the first few chapters and just becomes a hallway grinding shooting fest. This isn't to say that's bad because the varied environments are nice to see, but I would have liked more scripted moments.Some other key elements have changed such as zero gravity game play. Instead of jumping from fixed point-to-point you can move around freely now and the sections are much longer and more involved. Some times a whole half chapter will be in zero gravity and this includes being out in deep space. I really liked this change and is probably one of the biggest in the game.I really feel as if the story mode was well planned out, but with the middle of the game being pretty straight forward keeps the game from getting a higher score. The game is also a lot harder and is pretty much relentless in dolling out enemies at you without stopping. You really need to stay on your toes this time around and strategy is key to figuring out which weapons work in which situations. So, with the first few chapters and last few being the best the rest of the game is just mainly atmosphere, but it's paced well and that matters a lot.The multiplayer suite is unusual but only addictive for a little while. This isn't like Call of Duty or Halo where you'll be coming back for dozens of hours at a time. It plays a lot like the single player where you blast away Necromorphs, but humans control those too and they keep respawning until the objectives are met. You can collect health packs, ammo, etc, but Necromorphs are pretty relentless. There are four types you can play as, and each has their own unique abilities. Ganging up on humans is the best strategy, but some times the whole ordeal feels unbalanced since this is a tricky way of doing multiplayer for a game that wasn't designed for that. The multiplayer is thrilling after awhile, but once you play all the maps and classes for a few hours you'll be done.Collector's Edition: If you want to dish out an extra $20 you get a nice plasma cutter replica that lights up and is built rather nicely. You also get a pointless comic panel, and the Zealot force gun and armor, plus the soundtrack. It's a nice package for $20 and the PS3 version gets Dead Space: Extraction (originally a Wii exclusive) that's compatible with the Move (but you can use a controller!). Even gamers who aren't hardcore fans will love this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

The choices you make, from the alliance you join to the battles you fight, will shape your destiny and the world of Tamriel.","reviewerName":"B. Wright","summary":"Released far too early","reviewText":"Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is still firmly beta and was released far too early. Barring the glitchy in-game problems, the story is lackluster and the quests are way too short and easy. I will also point out that it costs anywhere between $13-16 a month for access to the online service in addition to the $60 you pay for the game. Though, you do get 30 days of service included (with a catch).Quests / StoriesWhile Skyrim felt epic in nearly every way and every story seemed to matter, ESO feels hollow and already been there, done that. In Skyrim, you always felt like every story did something to progress you towards the final ending. In ESO, the stories are short, random, haphazard and disconnected and don't seem to lead somewhere important. In short, don't go into ESO expecting the same experience as Skyrim.GameplayFrom Oblivion to Skyrim, some of the gameplay pieces were dumbed down and intentionally limited. The same is true from Skyrim to ESO. Features in Skyrim like pickpocketing are not in ESO (at least not yet). Additionally, it now costs stamina to crouch and sneak. In exchange for losing stamina, you no longer have to level up your sneak ability. Keep in mind, I did choose a character adept at sneak, but I still expected to level it up. You also don't level up other attributes by swimming or running like you did in Skyrim. The level up system has changed again in ESO, but not necessarily for the better.Veteran RanksAfter having finally reached Veteran Rank 2, I can honestly state the game is effectively over. The only territory you have open as VR is Craglorn and replaying faction quests in Cyrodiil, which is not very much. By the time you reach level 50 (aka Veteran Rank 1), your game is over. The main quest is complete and your character is locked into its health, magicka and stamina stats. The only way to augment your character from VR1 forward is to search for skyshards to finish skill points, to search for materials to improve or enchant your armor and weapons and, well, that's it. The stories are over and there's not much else to do. Oh, you can grind if you like, but you can only grind in VR dungeons and VR territories. You cannot grind in 1-50 territories. Though, you can finish up unfinished quests there, in most cases they are boringly easy. Basically, the Veteran Rank quests and dungeon crawls are all endgame content. Oh, leveling up from one Veteran Rank does yield special armor as a token, but you don't get anything else. But, expect it to take ages to level up to VR12 (max level at this point) as it takes nearly 500k experience to move from one VR to another. And, if your VR is less than 6-10, don't expect to get invited on looting parties in Craglorn or Cyrodiil much. On the other hand, questing solo in VR dungeons is near impossible. So expect to grind grind grind your way to VR10.Glitching, Crashing and EnvironmentsAs with another MMO named Defiance, ESO chose a somewhat similar MMO strategy with 'shards' falling from the sky reminiscent of Defiance's Arkfalls. As for environments, I've run into places where walls are missing from being rendered. Network player characters simply walk through one another rather than having any sort of collision. Getting on and off of a horse is stupidly unrealistic. Instead of actually housing your horse in a stable, you call it with a key and it appears out of thin air and you hop on. When you hop off, it also disappears into thin air. What's the point? Clearly, a step backwards for realism in this franchise. The horse running animation is easily one of the weakest in the game. When running, you feel like you're on a toy horse.The glitching and crashing have not improved in the 2 months since I started playing ESO. In fact, crashing is quite frequent. If I'm grinding in Craglorn, the ESO client crashes after every 8-10 wayshrine teleports in the middle of battle. The time it takes to restart the client, the whole party has moved onto to the next grind point and you're left well behind. Keep in mind that I'm on the Mac client, so it may be specific to the Mac. The PC client may be more stable.LootingMost chests are empty in the environment. When you do find something, it's 1 gold or a worthless food item that you don't need because health auto generates too quickly. Unless you've specifically killed (or helped in killing) an enemy, you don't get the choice of looting a body.  So, you'll find bodies laying around where you can do nothing.Graphics / HUDThe graphics quality are somewhat better than Skyrim (at least for character faces and environments). The character bodies are still a bit too blocky and are incorrect proportionally. Looking at a male character, you can't tell he's actually male (if you get my meaning) other than by them wearing male clothes and a muscular upper body. It's clear that Bethesda has no intention in treading into 'relationship' territory. The characters seem more like what you might see in early Second Life than what you'd see in a next gen game. Bethesda is clearly out of their element when it comes to producing realism. They just don't have artists capable of realism in characters, unlike the characters in Mass Effect, Infamous Second Son, Killzone Shadowfall or even Halo 4.  The graphics are somewhat better than Defiance, though.The mouth motion when talking is like a puppet opening and closing. There is no actual attempt at trying to make the lips appear to say actual words. This is another step backwards towards realism. I mean, you create these characters with seemingly realistic skin tone, but the mouth moves like Kermit the frog? You create environments that look amazingly realistic and then create a horse that runs like a mechanical windup toy?The HUD is standard for Skyrim with map screen, inventory screen, settings screen and main play screen with compass quest locator at the top. When necessary, the health, stamina and magicka bars are at the bottom. Chat is to the left bottom.OverallThe game is underwhelming and not currently worth the $15 a month online charge on top of the $59-$99 price tag of the game. The story setup is underwhelming. The voice actors are just not that great. Yes, I do realize Bethesda used Michael Gambon (or a very close soundalike) as one of the primary voice roles, but it was not a good choice. His voiceover work is inconsistent even between sentences in the same dialog. The environments are overly crowded with other network players. All of this just serves to clutter the environment in that you don't know which NPC you're supposed to interact with. Worse, most quest giving NPCs are crowded with players hovering there trying to do the same thing you're doing. There's entirely too much spam text chatter which can be turned off.In other words, ZeniMax's decision to create the Elder Scrolls as an MMO was not kind to this franchise. It just doesn't hold up well enough as an MMO the way that it is. For a light kind of RPG you might find online for free on Facebook or one of those other free MMO sites, it's probably okay. But, for top end heavy-weight questing game, ESO doesn't fulfill that need. ESO feels like we're back in the 90s trying to figure out how to make an MMO game work. ESO feels unpolished and unfinished. It needed at least another 1-2 years development effort and a rework of some very fundamental aspects of the game.  In fact, even as poor as Defiance's graphics were, the game hit a homerun in the questing and co-op pieces. Not so much with ESO. ESO's questing leaves a lot to be desired.Cyrodiil is one big game of Risk with limited questing available, but quests are specifically towards the campaign. The PVP elements were shoehorned in awkwardly and in a territory where PVE also exists. So, when you're just trying to finish quests without PVP, there are a bunch of gamers running around that area playing death match on would-be PVE gamers. As I said, awkward and frustrating. On top of this, the endgame Veteran Ranks don't really offer enough actual questing value just to keep people in the game. In fact, there is basically no questing after VR1. There is just a lot of looting and grinding.I'm hoping that by the time ESO reaches the console in December (moved out from July) that Bethesda will have a much better product to offer. If you're looking for a polished game, don't look here yet. Perhaps in time Bethesda can patch it to greatness. Though, I'm not confident that Bethesda can actually polish it more than it already is. Note that ZeniMax moved the game from July to December in an attempt to get the console networking issues resolved. Apparently, ZeniMax is trying to created a unified MMO world and will need to help from Sony and Microsoft to make this happen. Some gamers have also claimed the gamepad is the issue. However, I can definitively state that I've used a gamepad to play on the Mac the entire time. So, mapping of all of the most necessary keys to the gamepad is possible on the nextgen console controllers. The PS4 controller will likely have the easiest time playing ESO with the touchpad. The Xbox One's controller is barebones basic. Without a keyboard, Xbox One gamers may find the game more challenging to play with the limited keys available.Ratings out of 5 starsGameplay: 2 out of 5Graphics: 4 out of 5Voice Acting: 2 out of 5Quests: 3 out of 5Story: 1 out of 5Overall: 3 out of 5Recommendation: If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series questing, I'd strongly recommend waiting for the next non-MMO Elder Scrolls game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2014"}

Unfortunately the gameplay is a factor and while serviceable I found to be lackluster at best. I got about 2 - 3 hours in and realized that I was just going to be fighting waves of enemies and collecting random stuff . The same enemies over and over and over. It was fun at first to possess someone and watch them off themselves or use the Crows and watch them squirm and to melee someone is also cool. However the subpar first person shooting gets old and gets old fast. The skyline fighting is a good idea but doesn't really work all that well. I really felt that the majority of the details in the atmosphere and story telling were done very well but the pacing was off. In areas of the game my jaw would drop and then there would be spells of areas that were bland and recycled looking. One session I would play the game and couldn't wait to drive ahead and other parts I had a hard time keeping interested. The Patriots are cool the first time or two but quickly lose their shine after being used over and over and over again. I have never been so underwhelmed making my way through such and well done story line.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"Another world awaits...","reviewText":"Its not often I'm truly impressed, I'll admit many things in life are deserving of wonder and should be absolved of critique, but I just don't think video games ever should be. They're products for consumption, after all and you'll spend a lot of time with them, well, at least I think you're supposed to.****Introduction:I've long touted the Bioshock series as \"The thinking man's shooter\" its not a mindless gore fest, its deeply rooted in strategy and using your head to come out of sticky situations better off. Notice I said \"better off\" Bioshock is playable by mindlessly shooting, but you won't excel doing it. The original proved to console gamers that they didn't have to deal with the conventions, the simple narratives, the completely multiplayer driven, obligatory story campaigns, and gave gamers a memorable set of characters, scenery and mechanics that raised the bar on what to expect from the FPS genre. I thought B2 was a disappointment, its writing wasn't as strong and the game felt much more of the same as the first, feeling more like a expansion than a true inspired sequel, but after many years and delays, Irrational leaves us with its work. So what do I think of it? I think it may be one of the best narratives to adorn a video game, I think that again, Irrational has raised the bar of what gamers can expect from games.So why do I feel this way? Well, lets dive right in, and break down the core reasons.****Mechanics: (Controls, Graphics, Sound, and Functions)************Controls:Infinite doesn't use conventional controls for an FPS, lets be honest, each shooter does have their own style, but here it is a bit much. You can only aim by clicking the right stick down. After playing so many games where to aim you hold LT, that was a bit hard to get used to. Still, the controls work well once you're used to them, they're very responsive, and while they're not second nature, the game gives you plenty of time to get used to them before really jamming enemies that require finesse down your throat, which is nice. The controls are what you expect, they do what they say they do, and not ONE time was I ever lagged out of a command or had a command act weird, if you die, it's your fault, and that is how it should be.************Graphics:The more I think about this the less I believe it, they're stunning. The stunning emotion doesn't come from them being the best I've seen, enemies aren't as pretty as I thought they could be, and up close a lot of stuff isn't readable, and even then some effects like fire are less well done than I feel the Xbox could handle, but there's no framerate drop, and from anything other than the simulated 2 feet in front of your face, Columbia is GORGEOUS. The graphics here though aren't just for eye candy, they suck you in, force you to acknowledge the location you're in and leave you with a sense of wonderment for a large portion of the game. Still, even as the eye candy wears away, you're left with so many nuances, animations and little discoveries everywhere that make you appreciate the work that went into the artistry.************Sound:If I'm honest, I think this really is what makes the game great, the realism and EPIC performances from the voice actors can't be ignored. The voice talent here ranks in some of the best I've ever heard for a video game. Many takes and frustration likely went by to get everything just right, the soundtrack is excellent, the music is sublime, and some of the nuances therein are just phenomenal when you hear what's going on with some of the songs in the game. Infinite's soundtrack is life itself, and gives the people in the game more tangibility, that's something very rare in a game.************Functions:The A.I. even on hard has some minor flaws, for the most part they are excellent on how to attack the player, but they can have serious issues with reacting to very particular situations, an accurate player can take advantage of these fairly easily. Physics all work well, and ragdoll is thankfully not in this game, enemies fall, die, take damage and react to situations a lot like people do, and not very stiffly. Player and computer players alike have very well crafted animations and all look lifelike. The game also never once bugged while I was playing, meaning its very stable.****Gameplay: ( Game Features. Story)************Game Features: (Vigors, Gear, Weapons, Elizabeth)********************Vigors:For Bioshock Elite, these are your plasmids, At first I have to admit, I figured it'd be more of the same, but it isn't, you can choose to depend on Vigors in this game, and some of them are exceptionally powerful in the right situation. I'll not spoil what kinds there are but each has a great use and can be used by different players to varying levels of success, for instance some Vigors work very well against some enemies and not so well vs others, but even though the Vigor is not as damaging it may have another effect, which could buy you some time to run and get a better vantage point, or eliminate a flanker. Some Vigors do feel a bit tacked on, but that's not to say they're not useful though, and though the game may have benefited from combining one or two Vigors effects with others, it's a good roster of stuff to do with all of its own little nuances that can change how battles play out.********************Gear:If Vigors are your plasmids, Then Gear is your Tonics, you get four slots and can adjust your outfit to suit as you get more items, customizing your character's bonus skills to better suit your playstyle. For instance I used a Scoped weapon, so since I was searching for headshots, a bonus to critical damage was right up my alley. This item drastically saved my ammunition and helped keep my enemies far away, allowing me to focus on having good ground and keeping my flank checked. Others will allow you to run and gun more effectively. Gear doesn't just give you better stats to run around like a tank and kill everyone, its tactical weaponry to give you can edge by boosting the way you like to fight, and if you search high and low, finding gear is almost always good.********************Weapons:I can't be as nice here, to be honest I feel this is a bit stripped out, though there are more weapons, each has much less personality than the previous games. I really liked the mods from the Power to the People machines, here its just a stat-boost with no visual change, which is disappointing, BUT there are many more weapons to choose from and a broader play style curve, from run and gun machine guns and shotguns to long range carbines and sniper rifles, to mortars and RPG's. There really is something for everyone, I just wish I could put 17 lightbulbs, 12 miles of surgical tubing, and 13 cats on my shotgun like the old game did when it upgraded. Oh well, can't have everything. One thing though is that in this game you're not so much harmed by tricking out weaponry you don't often use, unlike the previous games, as upgrades are based on cash, and not a one time selection.  I'll be honest though, I didn't explore too much of the game's weaponry, pretty much any gun will do you well, and actually that being said, there's a lot of good in that.The second weapon choice is the Sky Hook, a rather deadly hook device for traversing Columbia's network of  connection/transport cables. I'm assuming the device is tied to maintenance work, but it does a good job on people's faces, relocating various organs in victim's faces to the floor or the opposite part of their skull in seconds. The Sky Hook can be used to do deadly Death from above attacks, and moving about some maps quickly. Personally I rarely melee'd, but the weapon holds its own, and even in the late game still packs a punch to the opposition.********************Elizabeth:When someone says \"Escort mission\" most gamers pull their shirts over their heads, scream like little girls and bolt out of the room. They have good reason, partners are often non protective, they're often unlikable, and they're almost always slow. I however, just participated in 20 hour escort mission and I don't want to kill myself. That, is a gaming miracle. Elizabeth, your target is a far more effective accomplice than even most shoot buddy A.I. in squad based shooters both in and out of combat. Since she doesn't have health, she can't die so you don't have to worry about her well being in firefights. Its not like she sits idle either, she actively hides and runs from gunfire and actually appears she has interest in her own well being, a nice touch. Not only that, but since she's running all over the place, she'll often prompt the player to accept something she's found on the field that she sees you may need such as Health, Ammo, or Salts (used for Vigors). Out of battle she walks at your pace with usually quite intelligent A.I. in the direction the computer thinks you're going (sometimes it's wrong, but hey so are people) where Elizabeth can help you find items strewn about such as lockpicks, help you open inaccessible doors with some of her handy skills, and the occasional few bucks she finds laying around.It's a surprisingly well executed mechanic, and keeps the game from feeling like its stopping for a cutscene and taking you out of the action. I have to say the games actually better with Elizabeth, I do wish that she wasn't wearing heels though, the sound effect was a tad annoying, but seriously when I'm griping about a woman's shoe sound there isn't much wrong with the game feature.************Story:I'll be honest, Bioshock Infinite's narrative is hard to grasp, it's convoluted, and its very, very full with plot twists and items you may not have expected, but if you focus, and let the game take you in, like you would a movie, you start to wonder why what's happening is happening. What characters stand for, why they act the way they do, realize that this game has much in common with its predecessor, and that each and every thing that happens in the game is explained in one way or another by the plot or your ability to comprehend the story's progression and what effects your character and Elizabeth can have on the world, and how through manipulation of Columbia itself, your characters can have multiple outputs. The story itself is told in a linear way, but the way it progresses in straight time is not. Without giving anything away, this story is not just about Booker and Elizabeth's life as contained by the game hours played, its jumps around quite a bit and if you remember the jumps and their significance the answers your own brain will think of to explain questions you inevitably will bring up will astound you.The story and characters play their parts well, and will keep you guessing what will happen next for the majority of the game, and though I did figure out what was up and was not surprised by where the narrative took me, the plot was well handled, and answered every question I had of it.Still despite how complicated this story is, I think it warrants it, the game rewards you for being methodical and unearthing more things through the discoverable voxophones, and I'll be honest, I didn't get them all, but they do help understand the story, and because they are a set of items that are hidden, I might be able to ding the game for purposefully being secretive. Except, I can't. The 15 or so plot point Vox's are right on the linear path, and are really hard to miss, so if you miss them and miss a big plot point, well, don't do that. Still as it's presented, the story still makes sense, its just harder to figure out the intricacies of it, and there are SO many.Another thing I like is that the game has a clear and concise ending and resolution, there's no cliffhanger, no \"Buy Infinite 2 to learn more\" slap in the face. The story takes a good long while to complete as well, building steam and maintaining it through all of the acts, all the while not babysitting you. Letting you piece together the story yourself with a huge payoff in your own head when you do.****Final thoughts:I Haven't done, played, or experienced anything that made me think this much in years, and trust me saying no game is without its flaws, this one has a few annoying battles, odd placement of money and edible items in garbage containers, and a very complicated storyline, but difficult battles, a few dollars in a trashcan and a complicated but well contained story are hardly a reason to dislike this game. The controls are tight, the graphics are jaw unhingingly gorgeous, the sound is extremely well executed, and the Weapons, Vigors, and Gear are well balanced. This story is engaging, and non spoonfed, the narrative is MILES deep, and its entertaining, all it asks in return is for you to think.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

You can even be a pizza delivery boy.  The structure of this game relies solely on what you want to do.  Do you need a plot?

Many RPG's punish you harshly for the \"wrong\" answer. With AP, you get good and bad things happen to you with most any answer, so there actually isn't a right or wrong answer. This was my problem with Mass Effect. Sure, you could play it how you wanted, but if you didn't play it the \"intended\" way, you were severely punished.To the complaints about stealth and poor shooting. Like an RPG, you need to spend skill points on stealth and shooting to be better at it. Also, what you wear makes a HUGE difference in stealth. It is very hard to sneak up on someone wearing combat armor, but in street clothes, you can practically run around all you want. I will say, I had to upgrade the pistol pretty much all the way before it became truly useful.The mini-games were frustrating at first (actually just the hacking), but once you figure out that you can see the letters not moving and then move to it, it is easy. I got almost all of them on the first try after I figured it out.CONS:His crouched walk is just awful. Luckily, you get immersed in the game enough that you don't notice it all that much, but it is still annoying.Glitchy - You can walk down an empty corridor only to have a guy pop up behind you, start shooting you, and then an alarm goes off. I played one level over, and the first 5 guards were not even there.The main character's voice could have been better. He was very monotone through most of it. There were differences, although I thought they were too subtle.Cover - The cover system is a bit broke in the game. Many times, I was in cover and could still be hit.I also think that using gadgets from cover was too difficult. I should at least be able to got a vague idea of where I am throwing something without having to stand straight up like an idiot from cover.I do agree with the one reviewer that what you choose for a mission doesn't make a big difference. I went through with ease with a silenced pistol the entire game.You can't sell your old gear even though there is a sell button. So, you end up just eating a couple hundred thousand dollars.The levels do tend to be a bit small and a bit linear, although not completely linear. You do have some options.Overall, this game is close to a beta when it comes to its lack of polish, but they did spend time on the gameplay, and it is a very fun game if you enjoy stealth and RPG's.It is one of those games that when you play it, you are very excited about what they will do on the next one because of all the potential.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

However, there lies its faults.  The game prides itself on working together as a unit and achieving the goals set out for you while not giving you the AI assistance necessary to do your job well.  Sure, you'll get through, but when the AI is assigning itself as soldiers and engineers with no medics........well.........BOO!I have complete faith that once this game gets online it will redeem a lot of its downfalls, but sadly PSN is still down and I feel rather cheated having pre-ordered this game not realizing that without some other people playing with me, it will be an effort in futility.The graphics are rather cartoony and not in the enjoyable \"Borderlands\" style.  It goes for a pseudo-realism that neither plays off well as Aeon Flux-style artwork........nor as a \"realistic\" futuristic shooter a la Bulletstorm.  It straddles the fence and this lack of commitment makes the graphics come across as just odd.  The \"customization\" of your character, while not poor, isn't very good either.  From a company that has done the RPG aspect so well, I was expecting something a little more from them on that end.  Not even having a color wheel seems lazy to me.The gameplay shows some real promise.  As mentioned before, it focuses on working as a team and the skills you can get are likewise designed to benefit your GROUP more than yourself.  While I like this, I foresee a similar issue that MAG had.........the lack of mature enough players to truly work as a team.  Also, since it requires so much teamwork, it seems foolish not to include a 2 player local co-op to help take some of the flak for the offline players (see: everyone who got this for PS3).  The combat is fierce and fast-paced......however as mentioned before, it takes a LOT of ammunition to drop the enemies coming at you and all the guns within the same weight class feel like cookie cut-outs of the others.  To be fair, though, the gun add-ons DO add some variation......just not enough to overcome the shortcomings of their general deisgn.  It also doesn't help that you never really beef yourself up.  You get additional slots and side weapons for the different classes, but not one I have gotten has managed to even out the lack of support from the AI.  Add to the mix the use of timers for everything and it gets rather frustrating.I feel bad reviewing this game without having ever tried out the online, but it stands to reason that if ANYONE is looking to get this game........they deserve to know that this game was designed with online in mind.  It's obvious in every facet of the game and with no network to play on it feels bland.  I seriously had more fun doing combat training on Black Ops.  Pass this game up until PSN is back up and then give it a RENT, but be warned........unless you got a good, solid group of friends to play with online; you probably will find it less than enjoyable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007UM59L6","description":"","reviewerName":"dancinhomer","summary":"Melee combat at its finest!","reviewText":"I don't have a lot of history with the DMC series, having only played Devil May Cry 2 on the PS2 (I didn't fall in love, but it's my understanding that was the weakest of the the trilogy).  So, I went in without knowing much and that may affect one's enjoyment for better or worse.On its own, this is a wonderful game for anyone who enjoys melee combat.  Yes, you have firearms, but they serve primarily to buy you time as a baddie is charging up for an attack.  If you try to rely on even the most powerful firearms to get through the game, you're in for a challenge.The AI is lightning-fast, but fortunately so is your control.  The control you have over this character is pretty tight and you can easily switch weapons, even assigning a new one in a slot, on the fly.  There were a couple of moments where I'd get a bit overwhelmed with the options (to the point where I would forget how to fire a gun LOL), but that was more my fault than that of the game.  The only problem I encountered is with the camera.  There would be times I would want to turn around and go after a green pod for health, but the camera would disagree with me and try to stay focused on my nemesis.I thought the story was pretty good, but again, I don't know anything of Devil May Cry lore.  I found the protagonists likable and the bad guys deliciously evil.I liked the use of the pull systems as well.  You can use cables to either hoist yourself in the air or drag foes to you (or, if you're so inclined, to pull yourself up to airborne enemies).  The moments where you had to focus on traversing using these cables were nice breaks in the fighting.The variety of enemies is also quite nice.  Every breed has its own method and weakness.  I appreciated that the game gave color clues as to what to do.  For example, if you see a red spot on an enemy, you'd use a \"devil\" weapon (an ax or gauntlets).  If you'd see blue, you'd use an \"angel\" weapon (a scythe or a set of glaives attached to cables).  When you'd see gold, whip out your trusty sword.  Again, firearms have very limited use.  But even the boss battles gave you some clues as to how to take them out, which I appreciate.  I hate it when a boss causes a huge spike in difficulty (some makes sense, but games tend to ratchet things up disproportionately when a boss comes along).Finally, I liked that the game didn't encourage you to ditch using old weapons as you got new ones.  You may have a new weapon, but you will run into parts late into the game where you have to rely on the old ones.  Heck, the sword I started the game with came in handy right up to the end.In short, this is a very fun game that will take about 8-10 hours to go through if you just want to see the story played out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2014"}

VANQUISH is a game that wasn't talk about a lot, but should have been.  I consider VANQUISH to be an instant classic hit.  This game is so much fun to play.  This game takes a little bit from the movies Star Wars, Aliens, War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Predator and mixes them all together to make one great game.  This game is directed by Shinji Mikami, who in the gaming world is considered a gaming god and a genius for making great games.  I think the AI in this game is very, very good.Anybody who has played the VANQUISH demo will tell you that that the demo is very fun to play. There is a lot of action going on all the time.  But the demo is just a small part of this game.  The demo just covers the very first part of this game.  You think the demo was great.  Wait until you play the rest of the game.I will give you some good examples of what to expect.  You play the role of someone named Sam who wears a special armor suit who fights along side with other armed soldiers against a Russian Nationalist who has taken over a space station high up in space above earth.  The Russian leader sends robotic like creatures to fight against you.  I noticed right away the space station you are fighting in is huge. I thought the armored space ship I was in to approach the space station was huge until I saw how small it was compared to the actual size of the space station. You'll notice how big the space station really is when the heavily armed space ship you're in crashed lands on the space station.  I think the graphics in this game are pretty good.  The colors in this game are real vibrant and bright.Anyway, on game play, I was fighting along with some other American soldiers in a fire fight with some robots and I caught some robots out in the open.  Well another robot came along and actually formed what looked like a cement wall in front of the other robots so they could hide behind it.  I thought that was so cool.  In another area, I notice spider like robots that when you blew them up they actually turn into groups of smaller spider like robots.  I thought that was cool too.  I noticed the robots you fight against will constantly try to outflank you and try to get behind you.  That is where your armor suit you are wearing comes into play.  You have this special armor suit on that has booster rockets attached to it so you constantly slide really fast across the ground to your target.  Well you can slide real fast to any targets that are trying to outflank you and take them out before they know what hits them.  I like how you have all kind of different weapons to use throughout the game and you are constantly upgrading your weapons all the time.  The sound effects in the game are really good.If you are looking for really good shooting game that is fast paced, then I recommend trying out this game.  This game seems to have a lot of replay value.  This is one of my favorite games to play right now.  I hope they make an expansion pack or a sequel to this game.  Give this game a try.  I don't think you will regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"Forget the big budget releases; this is the shooter you need to play.","reviewText":"If you're like me, you're getting a little tired of the same old shooters coming out year after year, each one almost identical but with little tweaks that reel gamers in. Vanquish is something completely different; a brilliant single player arcade-style shooter that focuses more on fast-paced action and high scores as opposed to online multiplayer and a brief single player campaign that feels tacked on.The story of the game is the standard United States vs. another country, in this case Russia, fighting for control over a repleting resource that both countries need. The story takes place in the distant future and the stakes are especially high, since those pesky Russians will annihilate a major US city if they aren't defeated. Along for the ride is a host of gravely-voiced generals and meathead soldiers, and the enemies range from your standard armored bullet fodder and amazingly detailed and rather difficult to defeat robots. As stories go, Vanquish brings nothing new or remarkable to the table, and none of the characters are particularly engaging, however the action and tight gameplay more than makes up for this.The thing that's instantly striking about Vanquish is the style and pacing of the game. The game looks amazing, especially in 1080p high definition, with the detailed futuristic environments and the remarkable character animation. You're character's suit, the enemies and especially the bosses are intricately detailed and remarkably animated. The pace of the game is fast and frantic, but it's not exactly the duck-and-cover style of Gears of War. You can duck behind cover to recover your health, but the environment is destructible and you can't just hide there and pick off your enemies. You need to keep moving and you have a \"power slide\" ability which allows you to move around at a breakneck pace until your suit overheats, and this provides some of the best action in the game. For a game like this, tight controls are a must and fortunately there is a minimal learning curve. Despite the sheer amount of things going on at the same time, the game never lags, freezer or bugs out, which ensures a smooth gameplay experience from beginning to end.The two most common complaints you'll hear from critics and gamers are that the campaign is too short and the obligatory \"Dude, where's the multiplayer\". The campaign is roughly 8 to 10 hours depending on the difficulty you select, which I think is perfect for these types of games. The quality of the campaign is way more important than the quantity of hours in my opinion, and many great games (including Enslaved and Uncharted) are roughly the same length as Vanquish. The campaign may not be overlong, but it is intense and the pursuit of a better high score will have you playing the same levels over and over again. This is a throwback to the classic arcade style of gaming, where playing short levels endlessly to get that high score kept you engaged for many hours. As for the lack of multiplayer, I don't think every game requires this and I applaud Sega for giving us a good single player experience. Too many games focus on online multiplayer, which I find very frustrating since my experiences online have been instant kills by campers and rude teenagers acting tough and using a variety of colorful expressions to point out how badly I am playing. If you're the kind og gamer that absolutely needs multiplayer, this game is not for you and you should look elsewhere.Vanquish is a fantastic game that is probably coming out at the worst time, with big name titles like Fable III, Call of Duty: Black Ops and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood soon to be dominating the market and most definitely pushing this game under the radar. This is a shame because it's a real gem and easily one of the best games of the year, so you owe it to yourself to check this game out. If you enjoy shooters or action games in general, Vanquish is a safe purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Shooter for Gamers","reviewText":"Vanquish provides a breath of gun powder scented fresh air to a shooter genre that is getting a bit stale.  Sure Call of Duty dominates in sales and that's because anyone can feel like a hero in Call of Duty.  It's pretty easy, the aiming is taken care of, the production values are through the roof, but on the flip side, experienced gamers do feel like you're being squeezed through an adventure like toothpaste getting squeezed out of a tube.  Vanquish puts you in exciting situations and rewards accurate shooting, risk taking, and good judgment.Story:  6/10The story is pretty basic.  A battalion of space marines are sent to a space colony stop a fiendish dictator from taking over.  You play chain smoking former NFL star Sam Gideon who has been outfitted in a cybernetic suit that gives him superhuman speed and acts as body armor.  The dialogue is written and acted like a bunch of 12 year olds got together in their garage and said, \"What do tough guy mercenaries talk like?\"  So, there's lots of swearing and every line of dialogue is shouted and snarled.  It comes off as ridiculous, kind of like an R-Rated Popeye Cartoon.  Unfortunately, the quirky dialogue prevents this game from feeling truly epic.Gameplay:  9/10Sam Gideon is armed with a cyber suit that protects him, allows him to dash for limited distances at 100 MPH, while the game goes into bullet time.  Sam can also take cover and dive roll to avoid enemy projectiles.  Sam is armed with an arsenal of upgradeable weapons.  There's an accurate light machine gun, a less accurate heavy machine gun, a guided rocket launcher, a lock on laser rifle, a force gun that shoots a sphere of energy that passes through walls, a shotgun, a disc gun that fires giant blades, and a sniper rifle.  Sam can also throw two types of grenades.  Explosive or Energy, which damage or stun enemy robots, respectively.So, if you look at this list of guns, they aren't just a list of machine guns that are slightly different.  Each gun has its own special purpose and ideal situation.  Sam can carry 2 types of grenades and 3 different weapons at a time.  It's up to you to figure out what you need.Sam also has cigarettes which he can light behind cover and throw to distract the heat sensors of the robotic enemies.  This gives Sam a small window of opportunity to go on the offensive and take on the enemy forces.At the end of each mission, (there are 29) you get a scoring summary that rewards you for speed, accuracy, cover, dead enemies, rescued allies, and punishes you for dying.  So, if you want to get great at this game, you have to play aggressively.  This forces you to quickly enter dangerous situations and battle your way out of them.There's a great deal of depth and strategy that's missing from most shooters in the genre.On Easy (Casual) Mode, it's pretty hard to die.On Normal Mode, it feels pretty fair.On Hard Mode, it's a tough challenge.On God Hard Mode... umm... you need to master the game.Levels:  10/10The levels are pretty spectacular.  The space colony that provides the setting for this game is a giant cylinder floating in space.  The colony is on the inside of the cylinder, so when you look up, you see more of the colony above you.  The graphics are impressive as well.There is a good amount of variety to the levels, too.  Most of it involves arena style shooting with objectives like, Kill X, Rescue X, Get to X, Activate X.  There are shootouts on trains, in flying vehicles, in hallways, in open areas, etc...  And the boss battles are memorable.What makes this game fun is that you aren't on a linear path.  The areas are open, there are tons of enemies, and you figure out the best way to take them all out.  You'll battle against robotic grunts, giant walkers, sub bosses, flying enemies with jet packs, flying vehicles, giant enemy mechs, giant transforming enemy mechs...  And they are armed with a variety of different weapons.  Mostly loud rockets that explode all around you.When you combine Sam's arsenal with the encounters, the game becomes really fun!Graphics:  9/10The art direction is great!  The enemies and the space colony are thought out to great detail!  The characters' faces and animations are also done well.  And of course, the explosions and visual effects compliment all of the action.Sound:  8/10This game needs to be played loud to be fully enjoyed.  The sound track provides an exciting or stealthy atmosphere, depending on what is needed.  The explosions and giant mechs sound great.  If your neighbors aren't complaining, you're playing it too softly!Replay Value:  5/10Ok, so there's no multiplayer mode and that's kind of the kiss of death for a shooter.  But Vanquish is meant to be learned and mastered.  You should start on Normal Mode, then play again on Hard Mode, then try to tackle God Hard.  There are leaderboards, so you can see how you rank.  The game should take you about 7 hours to beat on Easy and maybe 13 hours to finish on Hard Mode.  But these are FUN hours where you are actively engaged in exciting combat.Maturity:  TeenI know the game says M, but there's some swearing, and a bit of blood.  It's a war game vs. robots, that's about it.  There's no sex, no nudity, no graphic violence, no gore...  The reason that shooters like this are M rated is because some morons in congress convinced the ESRB that without \"head shots\" people wouldn't know that shooting someone in the head does more damage than shooting them in the leg.  I'm serious.  That is the reason.  And now you know why Halo is rated M, too.Overall:  9/10This is a great game that you can buy cheap.  I know Call of Duty and Halo fans can blow through the campaigns and enjoy 200 hours of online fun, and that's great.  But if you are looking for a very fun campaign that encourages skill, then this is a must buy.Buy it if you are a collector of Platinum Games or Clover Studios Games.Buy it if you are a shooter completionist.Buy it if you want to spend a week or two blasting enemy mechs.Rent it if you just want to blow through the campaign in Normal Mode over a weekend.Avoid it if you need Multiplayer or you don't really like aiming.Avoid it if you can't get past cheesy dialogue.If you liked this game, then you've probably already played the Halo series or Gears of War, but you might not know about Space Marine or Lost Planet.  Both of those are exciting sci-fi shooters as well.  Space Marine has intense battles and Lost Planet has good gameplay.  Lost Planet 2 has great Co-Op through Xbox Live.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}

I can add the reasons why I held off getting this system for so long and I can explain why those fears were completely overblown, in case you've had the same concerns.I held off exploring the Wii for two big reasons.  #1, I was afraid the controls would suck, and #2, the array of controllers and other peripherals was daunting.#1:  The controllers don't suck.When the Wii first game out, I tried 2 minutes of a golf demo and found the controls difficult to use.  I was used to button-based controllers from competing console systems.  For example, with Mario Golf on the GameCube, I could hit a perfect drive easily.  There was skill involved, but not a lot of skill -- you setup your shot, then pressed the buttons with the correct timing, and the ball went where you wanted it to.  But with the Wii golf demo, skill was much more important, and I was unable to hit a perfect shot.  This 2-minute experience was a bad first impression, and lead me to believe that Wii controllers would be difficult to master, imprecise, and frustrating.  It also wasn't clear if I could \"bypass\" the new controllers and still use my old button-based controllers -- but more on this in point #2 below.Fears of frustrating controllers kept me from buying a Wii for a year, but turned out to be completely overblown.  For example, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Party 8, Mercury Meltdown: Revolution, and every other game I've played on the Wii has been no problem to control with the new controllers.  There are occasional quirks, but in no way do the controllers seriously impede gameplay.  To be fair, the fact that the controllers frustrate you maybe 1% of the time is still 0.5% of the time more often than the controllers of other game systems bother you.  But the fact is the new controllers work great and add tremendous new capabilities, which adds a lot to the gaming experience and makes them a lot more fun to use.  (See my reviews of Mario Party 8 and of the Wii Remote Controller for more details.)#2:  The controllers aren't confusing.I'd seen a few Wii ads, read a few articles about the Wii, and even did a small amount of web research into the topic of Wii controllers, and still, I wasn't able to learn what I thought I needed to know.  This again kept me away from the Wii for a long time.  Specifically, I wanted to know what controllers I truly needed for the games I had in mind and the number of players I had in mind, how the controllers worked together, if I could use my old GameCube controllers to save money on peripherals or if I didn't like the way the Wii controllers behaved, if the controllers would cause wireless interference in my wireless-heavy house, etc. etc..  I even had a very basic, stupid question which was hard to find an answer to without asking someone who had played a Wii before:  what is the game controller, is it that thing they call the \"Wii Remote\" that looks like a TV remote control?The short of it is that, again, these fears were completely overblown.  It's very easy to learn how to use any of the controllers in just a few minutes usage, they're extremely intuitive.  It's also trivially easy to understand the array of peripherals/controllers once you start using the system, plus, it's trivially easy to understand what controllers you need to play a game -- just look on the back of the box and there's a clear diagram.  If you're holding off getting a Wii because of this, don't hold off, just start with the basic package and you won't be disappointed.But I will also take this opportunity to demystify the controller situation.The primary game controller for the Wii is in fact the Wii Remote.  This threw me off because it doesn't look like a controller.  It is.  In fact, it's a hybrid between a classic game controller and a remote control (e.g. like a TV's remote control).  The Wii Remote has features of a remote control (e.g. you can turn on and off your system with it, and oftentimes you point it at the TV to use it), and it has features of a game controller (e.g. it has a \"plus\"-shaped direction pad and 2 action buttons).  The Wii Remote is also loaded with other features you may not be used to in either a remote control or game controller:  wireless connection, automatic player number selection, rumble, a speaker, memory (to hold your Wii profile), a port to plug in extra devices, tilt-sensing, motion-sensing, and pointing capabilities.  It's quite a remarkable device, when you realize how much technology is jammed in there and for how little it costs.  In any case, the Wii Remote is the primary game controller, and you will definitely need 1 per player to play Wii games, up to a maximum of 4.The Wii Remote neither causes nor suffers from any wireless interference that I've been able to detect.  I have 802.11n and 802.11g networks in my house.You cannot \"bypass\" the Wii Remote controller -- you will definitely need 1 for each player to play any Wii games.GameCube controllers are required to play GameCube games.  Wii controllers are required to play Wii games.  Likewise, GameCube memory cards only work with GameCube games.  The Wii has a hard drive so doesn't need a memory card, but if you do want to backup or transport your saved games, you can use a standard SD memory card.  Yes, the Wii will play GameCube games, but you need all your old GameCube controllers and peripherals to do so.  The two systems don't intermix.  Yes, this is kind of lame from the standpoint of \"controller clutter\", but at least the system is backwards compatible, and when you see how profoundly different the controller systems are, it's no wonder they can't interchange.  (Caveat:  I haven't tried playing any GameCube games on my Wii yet, but this info is all in the Wii manual.)There are 2 common \"satellite\" controllers or add-ons that can plug into the primary controller (aka Wii Remote).  These are the \"Wii nunchuk\" and the \"Wii classic controller\".  These add-on controllers cannot function by themselves and must be plugged into a Wii Remote to function.  Both add-on controllers are for use by the same player who is using the Wii Remote, though in some cases you may just put the Wii Remote in your lap and use the add-on controller exclusively (e.g. when using the Wii classic contoller to play Geometry Wars:  Galaxies).Most Wii games just use the Wii Remote.  Some games optionally support an add-on controller and some games require an add-on controller.  When buying a game in person, check the back of the box, upper right corner, and it will tell you which controllers are required and which are optionally supported.  When buying a game on Amazon, make sure to check which controllers you need to play the game (you may have to hunt).If this all sounds too confusing, \"don't panic!\"  I assure you, it all makes complete sense as soon as you start using the system.  In fact, the games themselves show you visually which controllers to use and how to use them.  You can just start with the standard Wii package itself (which comes with 1 Wii Remote), and you'll be fine.  Or you can take my personal recommendation, which is to buy (a) the Wii console itself which comes with 1 Wii Remote, (b) a 2nd Wii Remote bundled with Wii Play, (c) 1 Wii nunchuk, and (d) Super Mario Galaxy (because it's one of the best video games ever made).  :^)Bottom line: don't avoid buying a Wii because you're concerned about the funky new controllers or you'll be missing out on an excellent video gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2008"}

Since my first video games 25 years ago I've noticed that whenever a game maker tries to bring more than one gaming genre together in the same game it usually spells disaster.  There are a few exceptions but those exceptions are so few and far between that crappy cross-genre titles are generally the rule.  That makes a game like Bioshock stand out all the more.  The developers of this game have blended first-person shooter, adventure, puzzle, and role-playing together in such a seemless masterstroke that this game could appeal to almost any gamer.  And almost no part of any of those genres is lost in the translation.  The game looks beautiful, plays well, and has an engrossing story.  I would recommend Bioshock to anyone.  In my opinion it is THE game of 2007.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}

How seemingly normal people would react if they went from a life of relative luxury to that of a hostile, radiation and violent super-mutant filled, environment?  The previous 2 Fallout games explored this angle through bird's-eye view RPGs (similar to Runescape and Diablo), but Fallout 3 explores this idea through first and third-person shooter perspective in the wasteland that was once Washington DC and the surrounding metro area.  You assume the role of the \"lone wanderer,\" a survivor in Vault 101 that exits the sanctity of his/her home in search of their father.  Along the way you battle super mutants, heavily mutated scorpions, crabs, bugs, and robotic remnants of the US Army.  You also interact with a large variety of people (with full voice acting) and either help or hinder their efforts to survive.You can become a bastion of hope, a harbinger of death, or play Switzerland and remain completely neutral with every choice you make.  Combining dialogue features akin to Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect, you alone, determine the fate of the Capitol Wasteland.Thus endeth the introduction.To any of you, who have not played Fallout 3 and wanted to enjoy a great open-ended RPG with a LOT of exploring, I strongly encourage you to check out this packaging and NOT get the original version of the game.  Ignore the fact that it costs less because you're getting more bang for your buck here.Why, you ask?  Well, let me explain from the perspective of someone who bought the game (at full price) when it originally came out in 2008.For a few of us, the Fallout 3 Game of the Year package is a slap in the face since we spent full price on the game and 1/4th that for every expansion set out there (see my review on Broken Steel/Point Lookout) and then this complete package set comes out less than a year after the release of the original game.Oh well, my heart will go on!  :PIn the meantime, the Game of the Year packing has got to be the best idea Bethseda has come up with since they re-released the first two Fallout games and expansions on the PC.  It includes not just the game itself but all five expansions including the new Mothership Zeta (which I am currently playing and having a blast with).  This means newcomers to Fallout 3 will not have the misfortune of playing the game for 30-50 hours, beating the game and then realizing that the ending sucks and there's nothing else to do.  That was the curse of the original game, however, with the Broken Steel expansion not only do you raise the level cap from 20 to 30 but you have post-ending game content with and open-ending game play as well.While Broken Steel is probably the nicest expansion in the Game of the Year edition, the newest one not yet available for mass (offline) purchase is Mothership Zeta.  Released, so far, only as a download on XBox Live, Mothership Zeta was not available for those of us who do not play online so its inclusion into this packing really makes a difference.  Not to mention I have heard that many original glitches, such as audio loops causing the game to fail advance the story, have been fixed.In fact, my Broken Steel/Point Lookout expansion caused my game to go into a dialogue loop at the very end of the game and, since I used nothing but autosave like an idiot, I could not revert and try again.  What I ended up doing was erasing all the expansions I had on my Xbox hard drive and, using the expansion disk from the Game of the Year packaging, reinstalled them and the glitch was fixed.  If you experience the same problem I had, try this method.Other than that, the other expansions (such as Operation Anchorage and The Pitt), offer little more than extra quests and more gear including some slick weapons.  Point Lookout, however, offers more of the same but with a massive new map for exploration and the farming of new weapons.All in all, Fallout 3 Game of the Year packaging is a must have for any newcomers to Fallout 3.  Not so much for veteran players since we've already spent waaaaay too much on everything already.  I only bought it because I was using my brother's copy in the meantime.  :PPeace out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

I have played RPG games as well, but to a much lesser extent.Borderlands is certainly a fun and highly addictive game, but with a caveat.  I think it works best when you play with someone else. (I'll explain more below). The game is a shooter at heart - you have entertaining and ever-evolving weapons that you acquire as dropped \"loot.\"  For the non RPG gamers out there, loot is the fun stuff that killed enemies drop and that you gather from found enemy chests and lockers.  For the most part, you go from place to place and shoot various types of enemies.  This is straight running and gunning.The RPG elements comes into play because you have some limited abilities to customize your character.  You can choose from 4 different classes, which basically define what \"special ability\" you will have.  You can be a sniper, a soldier, a brawler, or a female character that can become invisible for short periods of time.  The chosen class gives you a special ability like deploying turrets, sending out a hunting bird, going invisible, etc.  The class also defines what class of weapon you can specialize in that will deal additional damage.  For instance, the soldier can add damage to shotguns and assault weapons, while the sniper (AKA Hunter) can add more damage to sniper rifles and pistols.  But at the end of the day, all can shoot and use all weapons.  Now, a true RPG game has an in depth story.  Borderlands does not, not at all.  The basic story involves you are on a Road Warrior type planet hunting for alien artifacts.  That's about it.  If you really want a story, this is not your game.That said, it is still a fun game.  I think it is best played with a partner because the environment is pretty desolate and barren, and without an engaging story, I think it would be a bit dull to play this through alone.  I am playing it coop, split screen, with my son off a single x-box and having a great time.  I applaud the developer for including the split screen option.  It was brilliant.The graphics are \"cell shaded,\" meaning it looks like a comic book.  I almost didn't buy it for this reason alone, but it actually works with this game and looks great.  The game has a sense of cool style - I recommend it fully.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

No ball boys scurrying about, no oil from the  alleys to get players dirty and no rain to keep anyone from a day at  the court, park or course. Use the Wii Remote controller to mimic the  actions of swinging a racket, bat or club, roll a ball down an alley  or bring the left jab.Players can use their own Mii caricatures in the game and play them  against their friends' Miis for a more personalized experience. As  players improve, their Miis' skill levels will increase, so that they  can see exactly how much better they've become.People of all skill levels can pick up and play any of the games in  the unprecedented Wii Sports package, making this truly a title for  everyone!","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Now this is a good casual game!","reviewText":"Nintendo has released a several games with their consoles over the years (mostly Mario). While I wouldn't say Wii Sports is quite up there with those games, I would say that it's the best game it could possibly be, when given the aims of the title.Wii Sports is targeted at those casual gamer types, but it has a surprising amount of depth just beneath the surface. There are five little games you can play against friends or against the computer. If you're playing one player, the difficulty level consistently continues to increase as you win (as does your rating). After you win so many times, you're given a 'pro' rating, which I guess would count as winning the game. So, despite the pick and play packaging of Wii Sports, there are reasons to return to this game again and again, even if you're just playing by yourself.There's also a foray into into what Nintendo would later turn into Wii Fit with your Wii Fitness Age (or whatever it's called). You do various exercises and play various games, and based on how well you do, Wii Sports gives you your 'fitness age'. It's a very interesting curiosity.It should be mentioned that non-gamers love Wii Sports. This is the kind of game that you can play with friends or family members that don't particularly like video games.Are the games fun? I think the best one is Tennis, although Golf and Boxing are both pretty good too. I don't see why Nintendo didn't opt to include a 9-inning option for Baseball, but the actual game is sort of fun, especially when you consider the rating system. Bowling might be good to those people are can actually bowl well in real life, but I'm terrible at both versions of bowling, so...If your Wii didn't come with Wii Sports, I would recommend it. The \"Nintendo Selects\" version is 20 dollars now, but you can probably get it cheaper if you shop around. Do that and it's totally a worthwhile addition to your game collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

Well, playing Terminator: Salvation will bring you back down to Earth, as it is as much a cash-in game as you could hope to find. That's not to say that it isn't any good, as it does offer some occasional engaging gameplay, but other than that, the game is too short and too unpolished to be anything other than a rental at best. Once you get past the fact that the game looks pretty good and features a suitably gloomy atmosphere as you trek through a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, you realize that the game's overly simplistic and repetitive gameplay becomes more apparent than anything else. Shoot, cover, shoot some more. That's all that Terminator: Salvation boils down to in the end. That's not to say that it isn't done particularly well, which it kind of is, it's just that at it's heart that's all the game really is in the end. Combine that with the fact that the game is incredibly short and is definitely not worth the full retail price (not to mention the fact that there's no online multiplayer either), and you get the kind of relatively half-decent, cash-in, licensed game that we should come to expect by now. That being said, if you're a Terminator fan, Terminator: Salvation is worth a look, but in the end, the game is best left on the shelf instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2009"}

You will spend some time getting used to the car control, its cool but it takes some time to get used to.  You cannot upgrade your cars, besides paint schemes (very cool paint schemes) no parts upgrades, just tweaks.  You cannot see your car in a 360 view like in Forza 2 (another must have racing game).  You also cannot see your car from the side while racing,why would this matter?  The cars have an astounding amount of detail to check out, a side view would be cool.  Loading times are a bit long, but the menus give you info to read while the loading happens.Thats all I can think of right now.

Though most of the fundamentals in this game aren't exactly revolutionary, they are presented with an attention to detail and level of polish that make the game seem new and exciting. Sins is surprisingly easy to pick up and play, but is definitely a game that would take time to truly master.The basic resource and base model is something that should be familiar to most RTS veterans- 3 resources (credits- from tax income, ore and crystals from harvesting) and facilities orbiting planets. There is a limit to how many can be built around a planet, and this varies depending on how well developed said planet is. You can also build defensive platforms and production facilities for your fleet. Research is also a pretty standard model, and is based on how many research labs you possess.Where it starts getting interesting is the way you expand your empire, which you surely must in order to survive. Sins definitely favors aggressive players, as they will have more spaces for buildings and more credit/resource income as a result of higher population and more asteroids to harvest. At the start of a game, you usually have one home world connected to a few other systems. These may be colonizable, and may not- and in general, the better the planet the stronger the defense forces of the indigenous population. This means your pitiful starter fleet will likely not be able to conquer any prime worlds without taking losses, which can be bad if your opponents decide to attack you in the meantime. Additionally, some sorts of planets require research to colonize, and you need to colonize to build. This makes scouting of potential objectives and a general strategic plan essential.To move between systems, you have to follow 'warp lines' connecting them. That is, you can't just go from your homeworld to any other system directly, but likely have to pass through several (and potentially hostile) worlds on the way. In order to make a jump, your ships have to travel to a fixed distance from a planet, power up their drives, and make the transit at high speed. This is a lengthy process, so you have to keep in mind that your forces might not get back in time if you need to mount a defense against a surprise attack. Thus you will always have a problem with balancing your defensive and offensive capabilities, and in safeguarding chokepoint planets that have warp lines to many systems. This is similar in concept to the map model in some other games, such as Conquest: Frontier Wars. It also allows battles to be taking place in multiple systems simultaneously, which can lead to some seriously frantic action.There are three factions in the game- the TEC (essentially, humans), Advent (a bunch of weird female human psychics), and Vasari (the 'real' aliens). Though they have radically different looks and somewhat different weapons and technology, the corresponding ships of each empire are about equal in strength. Thus it's more an aesthetic choice and matter of personal preference. Ships are broken down into frigates and cruisers, and capital ships. The latter are your 'hero' units that gain experience and have powerful weapons and special abilities. Your first is free, and it's critical that you keep them alive and kicking. The other vessel types are the grunts of the fleet, and are substantially cheaper and more expendable. The vessel types, in all three classes, have a wide array of roles ranging from colonization to direct battle to fighter/bomber carrying mother ships. You can't afford to specialize in all technologies and upgrades, so it's best you figure out what you like to use and stick to that. There is no really clearcut paper-rock-scissors setup like in most RTS games, so as long as you invest in at least two roles (e.g. carriers and main battle units) you will likely be fine.Research and expansion are critical if you plan to win against computer or human opponents, who will be your serious adversaries in any campaign. There's also pirates, who can be irritating, and local forces- but these are generally far less aggressive than other players. You can also help your empire along by trading goods on the black market and even by bribing pirates to attack your enemies. There's also a simple diplomacy interface where you can form alliances and break them at will (if you aren't a fan of backstabbing, you can also enforce permanent alliances before a game starts).Admittedly, combat is a bit simplistic. You pretty much send ships at others, and even if you don't they auto-engage if in the same system. It's all done on a 2-D field even though the game is fully 3-D, so there's no 'depth' to the battlefield a la Homeworld. You can maneuver ships and order individual ones to retreat, and can manually manage special abilities, but it generally works to just leave them on automatic. However, the game graphics and interface are so attractive and slick that you tend to not notice. Effects and detail make it fun to watch even though you're not doing a whole lot, and the sound design is also excellent.The game supports full online play, but also includes a pretty challenging AI for skirmish mode. I have found the 'easy' setting to be hilariously weak and the normal setting to probably be a bit too much of a step up, however. Additionally, computer opponents seem to do really weird things on occasion, such as building tons of siege frigates or forming a grand alliance to wipe you out (if there's more than one). Nothing that can't be patched, but still weird. Online is probably where you will have the most fun, since real people are generally a lot more inventive than the AI- and Sins gives you a lot of ways to use your cunning to give your opponents a hard time.Despite its complexity the game is pretty easy to pick up and play as a novice. There is a very brief tutorial that teaches you the control and user interface basics, and then the best way to learn is to just start a game vs. one easy computer. After you beat them down (or not) you will likely know enough to play seriously.The one big letdown in Sins is the lack of a single player campaign. It is such a glaring omission that it's hard to forgive, even with the superb gameplay and production values. This universe just begs to be explored in terms of a developed storyline, and the opening cinematic leaves you salivating over how much fun that would be... but there isn't one. Maybe in version 2.0? Please? I'd seriously beg for one if it helps.The bottom line is that Sins of a Solar Empire is a finely polished, extremely fun strategy game. It is fast-paced, has great strategic depth, and looks amazing. If you've ever played and appreciated any RTS- not even necessarily ones set in space- you will most likely love this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2008"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"A Fun-Filled Racer .........","reviewText":"........ That about sums up Burnout Paradise. I had heard about this game from a friend who played it pretty often that this was a racing game that was packed with a lot of fun and plenty of open world to explore and raise mayhem. He was correct as I found myself drawin right in from the moment I put it in my game console. The controls are pretty easy to pick up on (without even reading the manual) and your free to discover events, find landmarks, crash ... you name it, as you wander around \"freely\". I have never really been big on racing games in the past, but I have recently started to give them a try. I had bought Midnight Club:LA a few months ago and found it to be very difficult (especially the AI !!) but the graphics and customization of MC:LA and detail were (and are) great, but I didn't find it to be a \"user friendly\" game. Burnout Paradise has some gameplay similarites and the graphics may be a just a notvh below MC:LA but it is alot more fun in my opinion.I am fairly new to the racing genre of games and I now own 2. So far Burnout Paradise is my top choice. Fortunately I was able to purchase a \"used like new\" copy from Amazon warehouse for just $12.99 (free shipping too when I combined it with another order). The transaction was smooth, fast and it arrived in excellent condition. As far as game modes go, Burnout packs a good variety of races sucha as marked man, road rage, burnout routes, stunt man events, regular races, etc ........ plenty to do here besides racing as well, like findind 400 shortcuts & 100 plus billboards to try and smash through. I have just started playing and earned my Class \"C\" license and hope to level up quickly. I even gave the multiplayer mode a shot and found a decent amount of people to play against online.  If you're looking for a racing game that puts an emphasis on fun over hardcore competitiveness, then this is your game. Not to say there are not some difficulties here too, but the fun outweighs those frustrations by a good margin. I would encourage anyone looking for a racing game to try it, Burnout Paradise is an excellent way to get your feet wet when it comes to racing on the streets !!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2011"}
