{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"One of the better RPG games in years","reviewText":"Given that this is a game from a little-known developer in Eastern Europe, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by \"the Witcher.\"  It doesn't quite reach the heights of classics such as Morrowind or Baldur's Gate 2, but it is good roleplaying fun nonetheless.Gameplay: This is a single-player RPG, tailored to the PC. It's set in a medieval-inspired world that has its share of intrigue, moral dilemmas, and other troubles. The goal, of course, is to rescue the world from an evil cult and various other nasties.  In so doing, you'll battle several types of monsters, travel through various environments,  meet various people, and gain various skills.  Standard RPG stuff.  What is new here is the focus on combat and the ways in which Geralt (the main character) can improve his skills.  The combat mechanics, while simple, are fun and never get old.  You will not find much in the way of new armor or weapons, but there is enough combat, alchemy, and magic to keep the game interesting.  There are many quests, ranging from \"fetch this\" or \"kill that\" to more involved scenarios.  Character interactions can get pretty interesting, especially when you have to make difficult choices.  The game earns its \"mature\" rating.  Even if you are not really looking for it, there are at least a half dozen women that Geralt will have the opportunity to be intimate with during the main quest.  I suppose that there are several others that I missed all together.  In the American version of the game, there is no outright nudity.  Additionally, there is some profanity and gory scenes, but nothing that's really over the top.Graphics: This is a good-looking game.  Environments are convincingly rendered, and character models and animations look good, too.  Some character models are repeated way too often, and you may get tired of encountering the same monsters (such as Drowners) dozens of times. But still, the game's visuals are immersive and convey a good sense of the grittiness of Geralt's world.Sound: All is well with the auditory for the most part.  The music is appropriate to each context, and the voice acting is reasonably performed. Environmental sounds are also present.Technical issues/documentation: This game may have crashed my computer 2-3 times during about 40 hours of gameplay.  Otherwise, it was stable. It comes with a decent manual, and the first half-hour of gameplay is a tutorial.  With the first patch installed, I found the loading times to be reasonable, though there were a few areas that took 15-20 seconds to load.Replay value: Given the limited character customization and rather linear plot, I found no reason to play this game a second time.  However, there are several quests that allow for alternate resolutions, so some players might go back a second time.Overall, this is a fine RPG that takes full advantage of the PC's power and controls. I hope that a sequel is forthcoming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2009"}

There was nothing in the way of tutorials and I wasn't getting the gist of the game very quickly. The minutiae was overwhelming to me, choosing which soldiers would get outfitted with a rocket, etc. The idea was very appealing, but I couldn't get it going for me.I was very excited to boot this up and get going. The very first mission is an introduction to the mechanics, emphasizing the most important strategies of using flanks and cover.After that, there is a story mission that you will go on, sprinkled with plenty of side missions. This game kept me up at night, trying to do just one more mission before bed. Since each one takes about 20 minutes to complete it's really easy to get on a roll where you play one mission after another.The meta-game is the biggest weakness as the weapon mechanic reaches a middle ground between people who love to tinker with their outfit to those who just want to hop in a game. The latter will have difficulty with this game, especially later on even on the easier difficulties. The weapon trees aren't completely apparent, and the usefulness of some technologies aren't obvious. The first time you play this game will be to 'learn' the game. It's very much a game to experiment with different strategies before you find one that will work.I truly hope this game does well enough to warrant a sequel, because it really is one of my favorite and most unique games of this past year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

This is a plain good game.  It has many numerous flaws, and isn't exciting at all, but it's original and the best puzzle game ever made.  Ico, a little boy trapped in a castle, finds a girl and tries to escape.  In order to do it, Ico must solve puzzles to move room to room while fighting spirits trying to kidnap the girl.I'll start with the negatives.  It's a slow, tedious game.  Even when you know what to do, to walk there is a chore, especially dragging the girl around with you.  The spirits can't even kill you, but they take forever to be killed.  There are also minor problems like some camera angles, trouble doing simple things like lighting and throwing bombs, and so forth, and some parts of the game where you don't even no where to go to progress.  Sometimes a blessings, sometimes a curse, but there is very little music in the huge cavernous castle, adding a feeling of loneliness and possible dullness to the game.To start off with the positives, the most noticeable thing are the graphics.  The best way to describe it is epic.  You actually feel like you're in a castle, despite the monotony of it all.  The scenes where sunlight shines on the castle are spectacular.  Secondly, it's a great puzzle game.  Not too complex and pretty intuitive.

Immerse yourself in the glorious chaos of all-out war, found only in Battlefield.","reviewerName":"ManUPT","summary":"Excellent Imporvement, Few Glitches","reviewText":"Battlefield has continued to improve, and I think it is worth buying. I have read some reviews complaining about some of the same stuff including the glitches in graphics, the problems in the multiplayer, and a short/boring campaign. I have to disagree about the campaign. The campaign has good plot and is exciting to play. It keeps you engaged and interested in what happens next just like a serial keeps you hooked. As for the length, it was just a touch short. They probably could've extended the game by another 2 hours if they extended the end instead leaving everything so open-ended. Like always, guns in this game are as realistic as it gets, and that is a big plus for Battlefield every year. The way you shoot, the recoil, the size, the specs, all are more realistic than any game I ever played. In the campaign, there is some war in the sea (about 10 minutes driving a boat, shooting at people), but there is NONE in the air. I was hoping to fly a helicopter or jet, but no missions had it. We all know that flying is a big part of Battlefield, so why not put at least half an hour of campaign that involves flying? The real problem with the campaign were all the glitches. Your character can stay in stealth if you are hiding in certain areas, but your squad will go out in the middle of everything talking like they are at a concert without getting detected. The graphics will also get a little glitchy, probably because the game is optimized for Xbox One and PS4. It only happens a few times, so personally I just ignore it. The multiplayer on the other hand is SUPERB! Graphics, sound, maps, FUN!!! We all know Battlefield 3 had great graphics, these are even better! The texture, lighting, and detail has been enhanced. I have been playing online for quite a while now (about 15 hours) and I think it is even better than BF3, and definitely better than MW3 (Notice I did not say Call of Duty Ghosts considering I have not played it yet). Driving and flying the vehicles takes a little getting use to, but after a few hours you will get used it just like any game. Jet ski's are hard to control and once it gets close to shore, there is no getting the boat off the shore. They should make an option where you can push the boat into the water as long as it is realistic. Can't be pushing a huge fighter ship, that would be stupid. There are new game modes that follow the ideas that COD has. Obliteration is like demolition; defuse is like Search & Destroy; and we all know domination. Although I am more of a conquest kind of guy, these are good additions to people who would like to experience more from Battlefield. An awesome new feature is the ability to be a commander of the team, giving you cool abilities like assigning jobs to players and sending in airstrikes. The multiplayer has really gotten improved all around. Everything is destructible, except for rocks, which makes the game very action packed and can change the map greatly. You now have the addition of water warfare which has made the game that much more fun. There are some problems currently with the servers, but it is not as bad as what GTA went through. The problems with the multiplayer will quickly be updated and fixed, be patient. Overall, the multiplayer is addictive just how BF3 was and it will keep you hooked for a year or so.Should you buy this game? Make sure you have at least 5GB free space (Just to be on the safe side), and you got to love big warfare with vehicles and realistic shooting (makes it harder than COD). Don't blatantly buy this game not knowing what you are getting and then trash talking it in a review. Hope you take this review into consideration, enjoy playing BF4!!!UPDATE: Some extra things I noticed after playing a few more hours-Unlike in BF3, you can now counter someone knifing you in certain situations.-There are awesome maps where it is all water warfare and the whether changes halfway through making it difficult to drive and effects the shooting.-Battlelog allows you to join servers, change loadouts, and check stats from your phone or laptop.-You get points for any damage done to vehicles, no need to destroy it to get points.-Parachuting looks more realisticI will update as I continue to play on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0045U01OG","description":"","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"In retrospect, it's an excruciatingly tedious game","reviewText":"When GTA4 was released in April 2008 it was quickly regarded as the best video game ever made and sucked up thousands of positive reviews. In my judgement it was a victim to blind adoration from folks who were just unwilling, or unable, to see the numerous faults that ruin the game. Having played it upon its release, and again for the first time in 5 years only recently, I have the advantage of distance. It's a bad game people, sorry.My main gripe is that GTA4 is soooooooo slooooooooow! For a game that sells itself on speed and thrills there's very little high horsepower to it. The missions are dull and repetitive, and go on and on for an eternity. In order to explain how joyless the missions are I'll go into a step-by-step detail for the average mission.Go to some dude (usually miles away).To avoid spending the next 15 minutes of your life driving to this destination you will need to find a taxi.There will be no taxis nearby (although there are lots when you don't need them) meaning that you will have to go hunting for one.At the destination the person you meet tells you that you are both going to a new destination and that you need some wheels (cue, if necessary, the only instance in the game where the title is actually relevant).Another 5-10 minutes are now spent driving to this new destination while your buddy dishes out boring exposition.At the new destination a deal will go sour or a target will run away.An awkward car case in which your target will get away thanks to poor controls and difficult camera.Mission failed.You start again. ALL THE WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING! There are no mid-mission checkpoints.Through sheer chance you manage to complete the mission.Your buddy actually has the audacity to say \"take me home\" before the game saves and progresses.This is not Grand Theft Auto, this is Taxi: The Liberty City Experience.Have you ever wanted to feel the bore and monotony of just driving, and driving, and driving, and driving, and driving, and driving, etc, etc, etc, etc? If so then this game is for you.Nothing in this game is easy. Be it driving a car, a bike, a boat, a chopper, or even just walking around. It's all too difficult. When Niko is running about the streets (usually hunting for a taxi) there is a weird inertia which seems to pull him in all directions. You will often find yourself caught on corners, even when there is nothing to be caught on.For a game that goes on and on and on I reckon some RPG elements would have made the grind somewhat bearable, but there none. Even your weapons are very basic with no variation. You have one hand gun, one machine gun, one automatic rifle, one sniper rifle, one rocket launcher. Even the ability to upgrade just the weapons would have kept things interesting. When using these weapons the targeting system is a joke and will often lock-on to people you don't want to aim at. Meanwhile 3 or 4 bad guys are blasting away at you. I hope you wanted to restart that mission all the way back at the start.The main problem is that the premise just does not fit the open-world gameplay. The original GTA, with its cute, chunky, top-down graphics, worked just fine with car-jacking and reckless driving. But in an open-world game it just doesn't fit.I actually foundSleeping Dogs, a game often accused of ripping-off GTA, to be far superior in terms of graphics and gameplay. Nothing in GTA feels refined. It debuted less than 2 years after the release of the PS3 and I do fully believe that it is too rushed and rough. Had it been delayed a year, or even just a few months, to polish away the many faults then it might have deserved the absolute mad praise that it got.It doesn't. Plain and simple. Many were distracted by the bloody carnage and savage humor but this does not make up for everything else.There are a total of 66 trophies, but many of them are online-based, and after 5+ years there's no way you can win them now, so don't bargain on getting that Platinum. Some of the other trophies are so torturous too. There's one that requires you to snipe about 250 pigeons hidden all over Liberty City. Erm...no. Anyone who dedicates the necessary amount of time for such a thankless, pathetic task should be required by law to get outside. Over 50 of the trophies are bronzes too. Believe me, this game is very stingy with rewarding the player for slogging through the breathtaking, patience-breaking tedium. I maxed-out at 54% before vowing to never, ever play GTA4 again.Graphics B-Sound AGameplay DLasting Appeal D","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2013"}

I got killed multiple times just trying to learn how to work the fighting controls which are very clumsy. Why is the aim and shoot button the same?? It is ridiculous trying to aim because if you hold the button down long enough you start shooting, but push it once and release and he stops aiming. Maybe I have to select other control types to get it off that but why is that even a default?I've done two or three missions so far and all of them boring. One where I had to hit a guy with a golf ball which was nothing more than a golfing game. If the marker didn't line up perfectly either over or under you had to keep doing it over and over again. If you fail the mission you have to do it all over again. Just the thought of that is enough to never make me want to play Ballad of gay Tony.

{"product_name":"B00009VE6B","description":"Play as eight characters from the acclaimed movie as you battle your way through twelve stunningly detailed environments.","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"An exercise in face-palming stupidity","reviewText":"Review update  1/23/13So I had the Two Towers game for Gamecube back when it first came out in 2002 and I loved it, and played the ass out of it.  But by the time this one came out, I had either lost interest or couldn't be bothered to spend money on buying it.Where the previous game was smooth, streamlined, and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time.  It had the original voice actors playing themselves, even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording.  It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.Nine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.Everything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.The graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.Adding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;- The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.Some specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.Another horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.- Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.Whereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.This is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.At the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).- Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.This section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of \"an exercise in face-palming stupidity\"The Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like \"Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss\", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.Here, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.Some of the absolute worst examples include:Samwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.The Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.Other times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying \"the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results\".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.Some of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.Similarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of \"I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid\" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.And this \"warm up\" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.And the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!And the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2003"}

This is a great FPS, anyone saying it isn't scary is lying through their teeth.  There are several instances (I don't want to spoil them for others) where you'll be jumping up and saying, \"Oh, S#%^*!\"  I still prefer FPS'ers on the PC, you just can't beat the accuracy of a mouse, but that's to be understood beforehand with console versions.My biggest complaint and reason for removing a star is the lack of subtitles, or at least the option to have them.  Many complain that subtitles get in the way but for Deaf and Hard of Hearing gamers it's a real pain not knowing everything that's going on, especially with a game that uses dialogue and such to set the mood.  Video games are like crack-- the real money is made by returning customers and word of mouth.  When a company doesn't set up something to meet the needs of its gamers they're losing out on potential buyers.  I, for example, don't recommend this game for those who can't hear what's going on-- being in a university with over 2,000 Deaf or Hard of Hearing students the company has chosen not to tap into a viable market.  Similarly, those that play late at night and need to turn the volume down so as not to disturb others will have the same problem.I really wish game reviews included whether or not a game has subtitles (or the option to turn them on), it is just as important as the quality of sound/music for a vast majority of people.

Use the brand new Glyph attack system which has more than 100 different combinations to battle Dracula and his minions throughout 20 explorable areas. Take part in side quests and collect items to power up your character in the next great Castlevania game produced by Koji Igarashi.","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"A solid Castlevania title with a few twists","reviewText":"Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia is a really good game.  Not great like some of its predecessors, but very, very good.If you haven't played a Castlevania game before, the basic premise of the game is that every once in a while Dracula comes back from destruction in an effort to enslave the souls of man into dark servitude.  The player explores Dracula's castle, gains levels, finds lots of loot, learns spells, and generally trashes Dracula's well thought out plans.  Much like the Metroid series, backtracking to old regions is an important aspect of the game as you gain new abilities that increase you're character's mobility and lethality.This iteration of Castlevania has done away with some sacred cows of the Castlevania legend.  You don't play a Belmont, you don't use a whip, and you aren't Alucard (Dracula's half-human son, for the uninitiated).  For the first half of the game you don't even spend any time in Dracula's castle.  You will explore light houses, forests, ocean reefs, and rescue the residents of a small village for about half of the maps.  This is different and generally works well.  Instead of equipping weapons, this iteration of the game utilizes a \"magic-only\" concept and your character equips glyphs... which mostly act exactly like weapons in previous games.  A large number of the enemies have received graphical facelifts, which is nice and I've seen a large number of creatures that are completely new to the game.WHAT'S DEVILISHLY GOOD ABOUT ECCLESIA?+++ The graphics and art-style are excellent.+++ Stepping outside of the castle is good, but there are issues.+++ Monster redesigns are excellent and the new animations feel fresh.+++ The music is very good+++ Gameplay mechanics have changed.  The new glyph system takes some adjustment, but it is different from previous iterations of the game and works well.+++ Villagers give you optional mini-missions, which is a nice bonus that extends the play.  I wish there were more of these.+++ The last half of the game is very excellent, so good that the first half is worthwhile.WHAT SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF THIS GAME?--- The first half of the game is no where near as good as the last half.--- The learning curve on this game is completely out of whack and unbalanced in the first half of the game.--- While the music is good, most other Castlevanias have done better.  As a fan of the series, I was let down by my high expectations of superior tunes.--- Inventory feels more limited than previous games and provides fewer options.Dare I say it, this Castlevania possibly possesses the best 2D art (mixed with some 3D effects) the series has seen.  Graphically, I think Symphony of the Night was finally surpassed, but only because the art looks crisper and sharper.  The downside is that some of these gorgeous backgrounds are little over-used so some areas give the player too much of a sense of deja vu.  More variety from screen to screen would have been nice.  The storyline is presented stiffly and painfully, full of cliches common to video games.  There is some very limited voice acting, and it is at its best, mediocre; at its worst, embarrassingly bad.  But no one plays Castlevania for the story.  We know the story... Dracula is bad and he must be stopped.  We play the game to explore and experience awesome classic 2D gameplay.My biggest complaint probably won't bother hardcore fans of the Castlevania series, but I think the unbalanced difficulty level in the first half of the game could turn a lot of semi-casual players off from this game.  It almost feels like some really tough monsters were randomly tossed into early parts of the game without recognizing that the character would only have a handful of levels and a lot of weak weapons and spells.  To top it off, a few boss fights feel downright cheap and unfair in the first half of the game.  I think the first 30% of the game is more immensely more difficult than the later sections, and in some cases just switching the play order of the different zones would fix most of these issues.  My girlfriend loved the first two DS Castlevania games.  She's just a casual gamer and focuses on if a game is fun.  The first two DS Castlevanias had a smoother learning curve and eased new players into the franchise, but I know this game will frustrate her and it isn't likely she will try to complete this version.All in all, I recommend this game to all Castlevania fans.  To newcomers, I recommend playing through at least one of the other DS Castlevanias first (I recommend Portrait of Ruin personally).  Once you've got your Castlevania chops up, dive into this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2008"}

Set off on a grand adventure in the finest version of Final Fantasy V ever released!","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"I love this game!","reviewText":"If you have ever read any of my other reviews, it is obvious that I am a Final Fantasy addict. From figurines to the rest of the games, movies to paraphernalia, I find it an almost obsession that I must buy more and more of the items. So of course I had to add this title to my collection when I found it on sale!Having never played the original, I cannot make a direct comparison as to how much it follows true to the game. I know from experience that when Square Enix chooses to release a newer version of one of their classics, they usually cannot help with tweaking it. Whether it be the graphics, the dialogue, the enemies available or the music, something has to be touched. Oftentimes, this seems to cheapen the game, at least, as compared to what I would consider the original (Final Fantasy IV Advance comes to mind).But, I cannot make a comparison of this version. That being said, I will have to rate the game based upon what I have played.Graphics and SoundAh, the glorious 8-bit days. The graphics are VERY reminiscent of classic Nintendo titles, and in comparison to recent Game Boy Advance titles, are very dated. The sprites of the enemies are varied, detailed, and colorful. However, the sprites of the characters (your party members as well as other townsfolk), are compressed and not very good, quite frankly. When you can see more detail on a Nutkin (one of the squirrel like enemies in the game), but cannot tell for sure if the character Faris is a ninja, you have to wonder. If you want a comparison, there is not much of a difference between Final Fantasy IV Advance and this title.Sound is true to the franchise, with the classic crystal melody in full effect. The sound effects are classic slashes and hacks, with sparkly noises for magic. There are no voiceovers, which is probably not a bad thing, since they would probably sound horrible anyway. I personally don't mind 8-bit MIDI music, but for many people, they would probably be able to turn the volume off and not miss much. I wouldn't rate the music as bad as other Game Boy titles (can you say, Pokemon?), but it certainly is not an orchestrated masterpiece.There is lots of color, overall, but not much detail to the maps. If you have ever played any Squaresoft (now Square Enix) title from the NES days, then you can probably get a good idea. Water is blue with white pixel dots for effect, trees are textured green clumps, mountains are beaks of brownish with the occasional white top for snow. It is not bad, per se, but if you have a younger player who has never seen a game from the NES or other 8-bit system days, you will probably hear complaints of how ugly it is.Gameplay and StoryThis game is your traditional turn-based RPG. That is, you have a party of four people, each of whom have special abilities. You select your attack/item/magic/flee/defend option from a menu, wait to make your move, and go through the command list for everyone on the team. The monster(s) will attack somewhere in there too, and since this is the Active Time Battle system, they can attack while you are making a menu selection. You have to be quick on your toes.In this game, your characters have the option of taking different jobs, AKA, classes, with different abilities for each. Everytime you beat a monster, you gain experience points (which are used to gain character levels, independent of the job class of the character), and Ability Points (ABP), which are used to gain new skills within each job class. Once you have mastered a skill in a job, you then have the ability to use it with another job, however, you can only select one extra skill at a time.Sound confusing? Not really, once you get going. As the game progresses, you will gain access to new and different job classes, which open up different abilities. Some skills may seem fairly useless at first (who needs a Bard, anyway?!?!), but sometimes, the game may force you to use that class to beat a boss with a weakness to a certain attack. Sometimes, a super hard monster may appear in your travels, and a character class you have never used may have the secret to beating them. If you have played this game, I am hinting at the Skull Eaters and the Beastmaster job class. I say no more.This game is also a bit unique from other Final Fantasy titles as you essentially have your entire party formed by the first major boss fight within the game. You also have access to various travel methods at each point. In most previous titles, you are restricted to land-based travel until later in the game, when you finally get a boat/airship/spaceship, etc. Being able to travel rapidly right from the beginning is nice, and certainly makes it easier to gain levels quickly.The only real complaint that I have is the ability point system. While a monster party you kill may give 600 gil (the money in the game) and 1500 experience points, they may only give 1 ABP. That being said, I remember at time where my Red Mage job class needed 999 ABP to gain the next job level (this was fairly early in the game too, like the 4th job level or something). While I don't mind grinding (that is, killing monsters in a area for the sole purpose of gaining experience or in this case, ABP), 999 fights at 1 ABP per fight is retarded. Now it is possible to get monsters that give 2, 5, 12, or even more ABP, but those tend to be few and far between and possibly more difficult to find to grind on.The story is very traditional, at least, as far as the Final Fantasy franchise is concerned. The crystals, which are representative of the elements of the world (Wind, Water, Fire, Earth) are each shattering, one by one. Mysterious meteors are landing near each crystal shortly before each one is destroyed. Your party is comprised of 4 people who meet at random; Galuf, the amnesiatic older man that happens to a pretty good warrior, Faris, the fey pirate captain, Lenna, the princess of Tycoon, and you, the boy and his chocobo (you can name the protagonist). You then strike out on a mission to save the crystals by traveling across the continents. The dialogue is funny, and sometimes, borderline risqu&eacute;. All-in-all, it makes for a good Final Fantasy entry.ControlsThe controls to the game are pretty basic. Use the D-pad to move around or select your menu option. The A button is used to execute a selection or to talk with townsfolk, B is used to back out of menus or to Run (when held down in towns or dungeons), and the Start button is used to access the menus for your party (not the battle menu). The only complaint that I really have is the mapping of the Menu option; I think it would be nicer if it was mapped to the B button or even the shoulders, but since that is the only real complaint that I have, I can let it slip.In terms of response, they seem to be spot-on. Since this is not a fighting game, the sensitivity is not really an issue. If you select an option, it recognizes it. If you are running in circles, the controls are tight enough.OverallThis game is funny, fun, and a solid entry in the RPG field. Since I am still torn with Final Fantasy XII, I must admit this is a nice turn-to. It is obvious now at least, where the later game (XII) got some of the gameplay elements that I feel were murdered. But, that is another review.Some of the commentary in the title may be a little borderline for younger kids, however, the story is fun. The enemies are well designed and the fighting system is solid. There are minor irritations (which I mentioned earlier), and some people may not be able to get past the dated graphics. However, if you can bring yourself to play through 8-bit era goodness, you will find a solid, fun title that helps to embellish the recently flawed Final Fantasy franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS5","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"One of Mega Man's all time great games on any system, probably even better than Mega Man II","reviewText":"Mega Man 2is generally considered the breakout game for our titular blue bomber, and for good reason: it fixed all the problems found in the firstMega Man, and was one of the best games for the NES.  Truthfully, it's the only \"Mega Man\" game I had for the NES in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though I played the first game quite a bit as well.  As good as \"Mega Man II\" is, is it really the best Mega Man game ever, let alone in the classic series?If it weren't for \"Mega Man III\", I would unequivocally say yes.  \"Mega Man III\" is easily as good as \"Mega Man II:, and opens up the Mega Man gameplay, expanding Mega Man's repertoire.Major new features introduced in \"Mega Man III\"*Slide - Mega Man can now slide, creating new possibilities for level design.*You can now carry up to 9 energy tanks, rather than 4 like \"Mega Man II\"*Due to the introduction of the Doc Robot levels, this is by far the longest of the six NES \"Mega Man\" games.*Rush, Mega Man's iconic robotic dog, makes his debut here.*Proto Man, masquarding as the mysterious Break Man, debuts as well.*Another notable feature is this is the first game that has accurate cover art on how Mega Man actually appears in the game.  \"Mega Man\" is notoriously bad cover art, and \"Mega Man II\"'s cover art has Mega Man holding a gun rather than his arm cannon.  Not bad but not great. This is definitely an improvement over the last two.\"Mega Man III\" actually has the best story of all six NES titles.  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily are working together to build a giant peace keeping robot named Gamma.  However, the eight robot masters that the two designed to help keep the peace go beserk, stealing 8 power crystals.  The two scientists quickly call Mega Man into action.Mega Man must defeat the eight bosses to regain the crystals.  This set of levels is probably my favorite in any Mega Man game.  They're all very well designed, and just flat-out fun to play.  The Shadow Man level and Snake Man level are both great.But wait, there's more.  After defeating the eight robot masters, four new levels open up (they are remixed or altnerate versions of four regular levels), and robot masters named Doc Robots are masters of these levels.  There are two Doc Robots per level.  While all the Doc Robots look the same, they are actually programmed to act like one of the robot masters in MEGA MAN II.  When you reach the Doc Robot's lair, the sprite of one of the \"Mega Man II bosses descends from top of the screen down into Doc Robot, like the spirit of that perspective boss is inhabiting or animating the Doc Robot's body.Once you defeat the 8 Doc Robot masters, another level opens in the center of the portrait page, entitled BreakMan.  It is a simple one screen level, where you must fight ProtoMan.  Ultimately, it is revealed Proto Man is Mega Man's brother, and built before Mega Man.  Proto Man, who has been kept ambigious throughout the game, has been helping train Mega Man with each fight.After you finish your training level with Proto Man, you now learn that Dr. Wily has stolen the power crystals Mega Man recovered, and has holed up in a new Skull Castle, intent on activating Gamma and reprogramming him to begin yet another attempt to take over the world via thru the campaign of bloody massacre or pogrom.Wily's Castle features several cameos or references to the first two games.*The famous Rock Monster (AKA the Yellow Devil) from the first game makes a return appearance, with a newly designed appearance.*Gamma looks a lot like Gutsman (who, of all the villains in Mega Man, makes the most cameo appearances in other games, his likeness also appears as a Wiley Castle Boss in \"Mega Man III\").*The boss guarding the transporter room in the fourth portion of Dr Wily throws rocks like Gutsman.*Mega Man must fight his clone, just like the original \"Mega Man\".  This  time around, there are three platforms, each with a separate clone.  One clone is real, the other two holograms, and the real clone's location constantly changes between the three platforms.The Dr. Wily stages are fun, although the last incarnation of Dr. Wily is the weakest of all six NES Wily bosses.  With a single top spin, you destroy him.The only two negative things I have to say about the game is this: the story is not really explained, and the inclusion of Top Man.1.  The story is the best in the NES Mega Man Games.  With the other titles, you are given some cut scenes to tell what little story there is.  In \"Mega Man III\", there are no cut scenes initially, so you don't really know the story.  In fact, until you defeat BreakMan and the Dr Wily stage opens up (the Dr Wily levels is proceeded by a cut scene with Dr. Light and Mega Man, revealing Dr Wily is evil), you probably won't even now Dr Wily is supposed to be helping you.  Granted, the game is longer than the other titles, so maybe they didn't have the memory to work with on extra cut scenes, given the NES's technical limitations.  Still, given how it's the best story it's sad Capcom relied almost entirely on the game manual, which most NES players won't have access too, to advance the story.2. Top Man.  He's the most stupid robot master of the first three games, and his weapon is hard to figure out how to use.  Once you do figure it out, its pretty useless with the sole exception of the last boss fight.  The whole idea of \"Top Man\" as a robot master is pretty ridiculous, and is the first indication in the Classic Series that Capcom is beginning to run out of ideas for robot masters.  This trend of borderline asinine robot masters would continue thru \"Mega Man IV\" and \"Mega Man 5\", and reach the absolute bottom of the barrel in \"Mega Man 6\"(really, who the HELL thought of \"Plant Man\"?)  A minor quibble, though, and don't let that distract you from all the game has to offer.  It's a more important as an indicator of bad things to come for the series than really effecting this game's quality.  Beginning cracks in the foundation, if you will.Overall, I think this is easily one of Mega Man's best games, and is an essential purchase for NES and retro gamers, as well as Mega Man fans.  As much as I like \"Mega Man II\", I really think \"Mega Man III\" gives it a run for its money.Though \"Mega Man II\" is more important from a franchise historical pov as it was his first major hit game (\"Mega Man\" was more of a sleeper hit), \"Mega Man III\" takes everything about \"Mega Man II\" and improves on it.  This one definitely ups the ante, and the next three sequels simply can't compare it its genius or playability.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2007"}

Additionally, all of the buttons are backlit, so you'll still be able to game in the dark.Ergonomic, Natural DesignErgonomically designed, the Pro Elite Wireless provides optimal comfort for all hand sizes.

Using a fine-tuned accelerometer and gyroscope, the Pro Elite Wireless can sense your movements and translate them into the game. This gives you more direct, lifelike control over the events in your game. To get the most out of SIXAXIS-heavy games like Warhawk and Heavenly Sword, you'll need the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.Rumble Feedback for Immersive GameplayFully supporting rumble feedback, the Pro Elite Wireless uses two vibrating motors on either side of the controller to create a rumbling sensation at certain moments during the game.

Great aesthetics, especially the backlight which doesn't seem to have much effect on battery life, and a good, high quality feel. I like that there is some weight to the controller and the grippy texture on the handles makes it feel very secure in my hands. The buttons give very nice tactile feedback which is important to me. I don't like controllers (or keyboards for that matter) with buttons that are too \"soft\". This controller gives a great balance of size, texture and tactile feedback. It's also no small bonus that this controller is significantly cheaper than the official Sony brand controllers.However, all this is moot when you're actually playing a game that requires a high amount of precision. There is no gradual progression from a light touch to a firmer touch. You have to press on the analog sticks quite a bit more than the official controllers to get a response. It was a nightmare for my husband playing FPS and even racing games that required high precision and quick response time. I haven't yet come across a satisfactory and more affordable replacement for the Sony brand controllers, and this one is no exception.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Andrew K.","summary":"An Unwarranted, But Welcome Sequel","reviewText":"It's surprising to see Bioshock 2 since the first didn't exactly warrant a sequel. But while the wonder, and mysteries that lie in Rapture may be gone, Bioshock 2 succeeds in one-upping its predecessor in pretty much every way with improved game mechanics, a touching, subtle, and engrossing narrative, and the all-new multiplayer component.The thoroughly amazing detail of the fall of Andrew Ryan that comprised the plot of the original Bioshock may seem like a hard thing to follow, and fortunately, 2K Marin realized that, and opted to make a more low-key story. But while Bioshock 2 might not be as intense, or provocative as its predecessor, the story succeeds in being more subtle, mature, and thematic, and even at times, oddly touching.Ten years after Jack's visit to Rapture, a Big Daddy known as Subject Delta (whom the player takes control of) reawakens in order to track down a girl named Eleanor Lamb. But little Eleanor just happens to be the daughter of the new face at the helm of Rapture, Dr. Sophia Lamb. Delta's quest is that of revenge, and while the politics of Rapture take a back seat, the game presents extremely interesting themes about family, and through that, further explores the Big Daddy/Little Sister relationship.While the original game's plot could best be described as a sort of thematic baseball bat bashing its themes into the skulls of the player, Bioshock 2's plot is much more subtle, mature, and enjoyable.At its core, Bioshock 2 is a shoot-and-loot game. You'll explore the relatively non-linear districts of Rapture in order to complete various objectives, and scavenge the materials, weapons, and plasmids (special genetic powers) you'll need to survive.While the aforementioned openness of the game's levels allows for some enjoyable exploration for your looting pleasures, the combat takes center stage in Bioshock 2. As a Big Daddy, you're much more adept at taking on groups of enemies. This time around you can dual wield a weapon and a plasmid, which makes combat a little faster paced. Combining the right plasmids, weapons, and ammo-types therein is the key to taking down the game's multitude of different enemies with ease; think of Bioshock 2 as the thinking man's shooter.The game also features a wealth of upgrades available that will test your skill withthe game's new hacking mechanic, in which you must carefully time button-presses, and your stock of ADAM, a \"special\" currency in Rapture that allow you to access Plasmid attacks, and the passive, but extremely helpful Gene Tonics. In order to get ADAM, the player must find a Little Sister, take down her Big Daddy guardian, take her to a corpse to harvest, then defend her against waves of enemies. It's fun, and intense the first few times, but the process quickly becomes repetitive, and you'll wish there were other ways of getting your Big Daddy gauntlets on it.Bioshock 2 has an all-new multiplayer component, which is surprisingly great. The multiplayer component has a great narrative twist. On New Years' Eve 1958, civil war in Rapture officially breaks out between the supporters of Andrew Ryan, and Dr. Lamb. You get a number of characters to choose from, and you can unlock audio-logs for each which detail their stories. If you want to, however, you can jump straight into the action. And the action is pretty damn good. There are a fair number of modes, from standard deathwatch, and team deathwatch modes, to the shocking Capture The Little Sister mode. Things are further spiced up thanks to Big Daddy suits that will become available at certain times on each map, which, when retrieved will make the player extremely powerful. The game also has a leveling system, that keeps the rewards, and deployability flowing steadily. It's not the most memorable multiplayer out there, and you'll wish there were a bit more features, but it's certainly a good deal of fun, and it's use of narrative is impressive.It goes without saying that Bioshock 2, just like its predecessor, has thoroughly impressive production values. The graphics, and art-style are great, even if there are some weak spots (namely character models), and the music, and voice-acting continues to impress. One rather nitpicky complaint I have, however, is that that game doesn't use its new time period at all. Even though it's nearing the 70's during Bioshock 2's campaign, the game still retains its 50's style, which feels a bit odd. Still, Bioshock 2 has more than competent graphics, and an excellent sound department, making minor complaints easy to forgive.Bioshock 2 is much shorter than the first, only clocking in at about 10-12 hours, and that's even accounting for a fair amount of exploration. The multiplayer has the potential to tack on a fair amount of play time depending on how into it you become.The original Bioshock was a triumph in video game narrative, and it's astonishing that the sequel can even surpass it. While it doesn't totally shake up the formula, the numerous gameplay improvements, and the new multiplayer component, Bioshock 2 is an unwarranted, but welcome sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options.

Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

{"product_name":"B000099T2G","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Poor gameplay, but does capture Jet Li's moves well.","reviewText":"Any enjoyment you might derive from this game is from playing as Jet Li in an old-school fight setting.  When the novelty of that wears off, what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an ill-advised control scheme.Yes, bonus marks are in order for using Cantonese in Hong Kong with subtitles.  (As a native Hong Kong person I can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual, though still flawed)  Though I might add that international espionage games like Syphon Filter has been doing that for years.  The settings are authentic enough, with the battles in the Hong Kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu films.But is it worth the very problematic gameplay?  Just barely.  If you've seen/played the demo already, you'll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick.  While the array of moves you can unleash is impressive, motion-captured well from Li's own silhouette, this system is very ill conceived from a fighting-game perspective.  Worse still, the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy, and then the perspective shifts so that you're suddenly hitting at air and the enemy's to the side.  So many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers, not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective.  This problem came to a head during the ludicrous \"escape from capture\" stage where the camera actually cuts you off, preventing you from seeing what's behind you, even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that you're supposed to avoid!  This is simply a moronic use of the camera.Aside from this, the fighting gets tired awfully quickly, especially since the designers committed the ol' \"this level never ends\" sin.  This game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game, but during some of the \"one against 14\" stages, the endless brawling still gets tired.  And whose idea was it to have enemies pull off 18-hit combos, where if you get hit the first time, you get to watch your character get pummelled for 10 seconds straight?I actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless, endless hand-to-hand stages.  This is where the dual analog sticks truly shine, allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do Time Crisis-style ducking.  There's even a crazy level where you fight off about 100 enemies with two nailguns!This game would probably remain tempting to Jet Li fans because of the role-playing aspect of it.  And I wouldn't blame them -- this was my reason for buying this game, and there are a few levels that I truly enjoyed.  The overall game, however, is really not that great, and I would recommend only playing it in small doses.

Then, Capcom shocked everyone by announcing a port of Street Fighter II was coming to the SNES and it was released in 1992. This port was revolutionary for its time because while Capcom made changes to the game, the core essence remained and it was still as fun to play as it was in the arcades.Street Fighter II is a fighting game where you face off against the computer in a series of matches that lead up to the game's main villain, M. Bison. You choose from one of eight characters, face off against the other 7 characters, then you go up against 4 boss characters (including M. Bison.) Each character has his/her own storyline and ending so you find out their specific reasons for wanting to fight M. Bison. After every third match, you enter a bonus stage where you get to earn additional points before the timer runs out (there are 3 bonus stages in total.) The game features a 2 player vs. mode so you can take on another human player but you can only choose from the 8 characters and not the additional boss characters. Finally, there is an option screen where you can change the buttons on your controller, play audio tracks from the game and adjust the difficulty level of the game. As an added bonus, there's a code you can use where both players can use the same character in a match.The PROS: This was revolutionary because they took an arcade game that was 58 megabits in size and shrunk it down into a 16 mega-bit cartridge. While changes were made, it looked and sounded close to what the arcade game was. On top of that, the controls were perfect. The game used every button on the SNES controller so Capcom did not have to compromise the button scheme at all. The rules of the arcade game were the same as the SNES port so you weren't missing out at all as far as how your character moves or what strategies to use against the computer or another human player. The same character code was such a sweet bonus as it was NOT featured in the Street Fighter II arcade game.The CONS: Like I said before, this is not a perfect port. In order for the game to retain the same feel, Capcom had to make changes across the board for this game to fit and work properly. There are too many to list but it doesn't hurt the overall experience too much as there were people who never got the chance to play it in the arcades. For them, buying this game for the SNES was a perfect way to find out what the hype was all about. What is surprising is that when you put the difficulty level to its highest point, it is 100 times harder than the arcade game so only the most skilled SF players were able to defeat M. Bison at the highest difficulty level.It was a great time to have the SNES as Capcom would release a port of Street Fighter II: Champion Edition for the Sega Genesis more than a year after Street Fighter II was released for the SNES. Not only did fighting games become popular, but the gap between the quality of arcade games and their ports to home consoles became smaller and it was starting to become common to see popular arcade games ported to SNES, Genesis, etc. If by chance, you have never played any of the earlier Street Fighter II games, you can either pick up a used SNES copy, look for the numerous Street Fighter anthology collections that are out there or download this title for the Wii via their Virtual Console service for 800 points (US $8.) I recommend you try it out if you haven't done so yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"AlexJouJou","summary":"64 hours of gameplay and loved every minute of it!","reviewText":"All told I logged a lot of hours into this game. I sincerely enjoyed it! I always give my perspective which is a 42 year old Mom who just got into gaming about 2 years ago. This is the first RPG I bought for my new PSP.This game is outstanding at easing you into gameplay and \"tutoring\" you in how to play. You won't be lost and it is not difficult to figure out where to go and what to do. I thougth the graphics were great and the characters well done. The music was good--perhaps a bit understated but it did work with the game.I loved the story--I found it very well paced with some twists I didn't see coming as well as a bit of romance. That was a nice surprise for me and actually made my enjoyment a bit higher. I play a lot of rated E RPG that don't have any form of romance or character relations so this was a nice change. It is not major (this is not an M rated title) but its presence, for me, was quite fun.I liked the battle system and the skill points and specialties you could develop. Unlike in some other RPG making the effort to learn these and do things like customization or cooking can actually make a HUGE difference. I spent hours doing the blacksmithing to get good armor and customizing my weapons. It added quite a bit to the game.The only tedious thing is backtracking and random battles. However they are par for the course in most of the RPG's I play and I'm used to them now. I think the level of difficulty was light to moderate. I found the Second Evolution game a bit more difficult starting out--so I would class this one as especially perfect for a new RPG person or someone who is more of a casual gamer. I didn't get too many game over's (only due to my own stupidity LOL).I recommend the guide, if you are the type that goes for guides, as I found it very helpful. It pointed out things that were good to know but I usually use guides to help me in dungeons as my map skills are not all too great. Wonder what happened to all that orienteering skill I had in high school?This is an outstanding RPG with a great story that keeps you hooked for the entire game. Gameplay is great and I believe you will get a good amount of \"bang\" for your buck with Star Ocean: First Departure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2009"}

It a big con to what could have been a five star game. Sadly Tekken is not what is used to be.To be honest Namco's Tekken entries since the initial release of the PS2 have done nothing but knock this fighter flat on its face, but before we get to the cons lets talk a little about the pros. Tekken 4 corrects a number of Tekken game play issues, but is limited to a shocking 10 players, reducing it by 20 from the previous 30 player staggering TAG entry. Tekken 4 also gives us an extra one-player level fight setting and improves on the graphics and combos.Tekken 4 provides about 70 moves for each character (with some additional multiple combo configurations) and corrects the TAG fight move-sharing problem meaning that most characters do not share many moves which is good. So if you are looking for more unique moves per character then Tekken 4 has it, however TAG wins Tekken 4 in terms of its lifespan and game play (even if you own Tekken 4 friends will still ask you to put this disc in), so the tag game play makes TAG a better buy. Tekken 4 has solved the old `this character is better than that character' syndrome, which to be honest, has never changed in any game series as some character moves are simply impossible to pull-off with years playing with them, making them hard to win with. Tekken 4 is more balanced and easier to fight with making it a more fluid fighting game. Although Tekken 4's graphics are better than TAG's graphics it is still a tiny bit of let it down, especially if you play something like Virtual Fighter 4. The background/platform disconnection problems with the fighting platform in TAG (you can see the bad anti-aliasing moving out of sync with the background creating a dizzy fighting experience that is unpleasant on the eye) has been solved in Tekken 4 and looks more real with objects that explode and crowds that get knocked over. All great improvements.However TAG rulez Tekken 4 and this is bad news for Namco because this game is not even remotely close to the kind of quality that they could have delivered on... and believe it or not, Tekken TAG isn't a whole pile better either. The PS2 has not had the good Tekken gamer it deserves which is sham because Tekken is only available on the PS2! This one gets 3 stars because TAG gets 4 and TAG is better.Pros:- Better graphics than TAG.- Better backgrounds with some environmental damage.- Better character strength matching, easier to control, better moves.Cons:- NO TAG!- ONLY 10 characters!- Not better than TAG.- Does not deliver anything expected of the Tekken series on the PS2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}

I was running all over the place to get away from the zombies lol.  This game set the par for all horror and shooting games alike.Graphics: The graphics were great and I experience no lag or bugs in the game. I enjoyed all the scenes.  The blood and carcasses of zombies laying everywhere made the game feel so much more real to me.  2/2.Story: The story was extremely deep for me since this was my first R.E. game.  I never expected to have to fight so many enemies in a zombie game, but to have exact precision while shooting or I would be dead.  I learned a lot about Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Jack Krauser past in previous games.  This game offered many boss fights, and it was also very challenging at times as well.  I might have to play this game again someday soon.  2/2.Characters: The characters like Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Jack Krauser are fully explored in the extras after you beat the game.  You learn about Wesker and all of his fine things he is doing.  The boss fights were extremely tough at times because I would have limited ammo at times making the fights extremely tough.  The extras you earn after you complete the game explores a lot of the characters past thus you learn a lot more about them.  2/2.Sound: I believe the sound in the game made the game feel more exciting, but also more light hearted at times. I really enjoyed the victory music after each boss fight. 2/2.Controls: The camera angles and handling of the controls work perfectly.  The first person view of this game really added to the fear factor of the game.  2/2.Overall a great game to play.

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"A must own racing game for any PS3 owner!","reviewText":"Most people who buy \"Burnout Paradise\" are likely those who have played another entry in the Burnout Series.  This was my first Burnout game, so I was able to enter without any preconcieved expectations.And this game exceeded which little ones I had.  Convincingly.First off, everything is unlocked, save for the cars, right away.  This allows you to approach the game YOUR way.  Want to go look for all 400 hidden smashes and 120 billboards?  You can.  Want to try and clear all the missions first?  You can.  Want to knock out all the time trails and showtimes for each road?  Well, you get the idea.  This open world approach works wonders, and is real refreshing considering the normal progression of racing games, where you need a \"license\" or have to meet a specific finish to advance the game.Secondly, there's something for everyone here.  Want to just smash cars?  Then the Road Rage challenges, where you must \"takedown\" a certain number of cars in 2 minutes are for you.  Want to be the hunted?  Then you'll love the Marked Man challenges, which start off fairly easy but will get incredibly difficult as you get better cars.  And of course, there are \"races\" where it's exactly like it sounds, you have to be the first to cross the finish line! New to this version of Burnout is the \"Stunt Run\" where you have to score a certain number of points in 2 minutes.  Finally, each car you take down during the game (cars randomly appear after completing so many events), has a \"super\" version you can unlock through completing its respective \"Burning Route\" shown on the map.There are a couple issues that do complicate things.  The first is during a race, and because of the wide open nature, it can be hard to tell where you need to go.  The intent is for players to find their own paths, and a road sigh will appear flashing when you need to turn, but that's hard to do when you're driving as fast as you have to in order to win.  And in reality, the compass function doesn't work really well.  So you might have to pause the game to make sure you're on the right track.  Secondly, and this goes along with the above paragraph, if you do lose an event, you then have to trek back to that spot and try again.  Which obviously, if you just tried to beat a near 3 minute burning route/race can be annoying.So in short, I break it down like this:Graphics:  9.5/10  This game simply looks amazing, from the cars, to the city.  You feel immersed, as if you're really in Paradise City.Sound:  9/10  Every car has a unique sound when it comes to engine revving, shifting, etc.  Wrecks sound realistic too.Controls:  8.5.10  The default setup (with the gas being R2 and the break being L2) is a little counterintutive from what I've been used to in a racing game, but can be changed.  Your finger will also get quite sore trying to use R2 as well.  Choosing the right car definitely affects your control of it.Music:  8/10.  A mixed bag here.  The Guns N' Roses song is a perfect opening for this game, and the inclusion of Alice and Chains, etc. are great touches.  I could have done completely without the classicial music.  It would be more realistic if future Burnout games in the same setting had radio stations like Grand Theft Auto did.Gameplay:  10/10.  This game runs completely smooth. You feel the sense of speed, especially when you kick in the boost.  Moreover, this game is just FUN to play, even if you're not attempting a task.  Especially when you are wrecking. :)Replay Value:  10/10.  With 500 challenges online, 400 smashes, 120 billboards, Super Jumps, messages, time trials and showtimes, it will take you a long time to get 100% completion.DLC Content:  9/10.  Burnout Paradise also has Big Surf Island, which adds some smashes, challenges, etc. to the package, and sells for $12.99 on the PSN.  It's a decent addition but once you have some experience with Paradise City, doing everything here will come really easy.  You can also buy special cars and other add-ons as well, including unlocking every car in the game if you don't want to go through all of it!In closing, this is a fantastic racing game that's fun for everyone in your family, and is highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

For the most part it succeeds.The racing is fast paced and the graphics are outstanding.  It is just as enjoyable to cruise around the scenic sites of Paradise City, as it is to race through them.  And, man, is the sense of speed spot on.  You have to really know your way around the city to place well the variety of events.Speaking of events, they are as follows:racing - place in the top three or get nothing for your effortsroad rage - one of the best Burnout events, make your never endless stream of opponents crashmarked man - kinda the opposite of road rage, you have to survive a race against heavy duty enemiesburning lap - beat the clock in a specific car along a specific coursestunt runs - string a bunch of stunts together to score points.  (as seen in Project Gotham Racing)  But, it did not work there and it certainly does not work here.All of the events have a few frustrating things in common.  For instance, you constantly have to check your mini-map to avoid speeding so far off course that you cannot possibly win.  This could have been easily overcome by a GPS system to guide you to your goal like you may have seen in games like GTA IV or Saints Row 2.  The developers could have given you the option to map a course based on short cuts discovered or over factors.  But, they opted for a horrible mini-game of swapping back and forth between your mini-map and the actual race.  This breaks the flow of the game.The second thing I found to be frustrating is the lack of a race reset or \"do over.\"  If you get lost or crash too often that you cannot possibly win, then you have to come to a complete stop and drive all the way back to the beginning of the race to start over.  This made me want to throw my controller at the screen several times.On the other hand...The addition of breakable billboards and gates adds a lot of repay value to unlock extra cars.  The car models are awesome.  I strongly suggest checking out the downloadable cars available in the Playstation Store.  Some of them are a blast to race with.Showtime mode replaces crash mode.  Hit a certain button combo and you enter a \"bullet time\" like event that challenges you to smash into as many cars as you can before you run out of time.  I enjoyed it, but I do miss crash mode.If you liked Burnout 3 or Burnout Revenge, then you will most definitely love Burnout Paradise.  A definite buy.

You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"","summary":"Great for games that require it","reviewText":"So, if you are looking at this, you must have the Wii.

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

Now with a story line about a guy named C.J, who is someone who's come back to San Andreas because his mother was killed and the rival gangs have taken over, so he's back to help out and blah blah blah.Gameplay; It's so awesome, the game is so huge, all inside a 3D world of S.A that combines a bit of Las Vegas, San Fransisco and L.A... you can find so much to do that you forget easily that you are supposed to be doing missions. From being able to take whatever car, bike, boat, planes, helicopter and various other stuff you like, to finding weapons ranging from your fist, brass knuckles and knives to flame throwers, Uzi's, mini-guns and even adult sex toys!!! The streets run with all different kinds of people from the rich to the homeless and even hookers that you can actually have a laugh with by buying there services!The area is huge, and i mean HUGE! If you don't believe me that it's huge then check out the game for yourself, then and you will be amazed at just how big it all is! Ranging from the city streets, suburbs, hood, country, desert and so much more. If they where to make this game look just like the streets of your own town/location where you live, you'd be amazed at how well the area in this has been put together and differs in each section.And whats even better is you can download mods for the game and put your own cars and things into it. So I've been loving flying around the neighborhood in a Back To The Future Delorean, K.I.T.T (knight Rider) the Ecto Mobile, as well as just about every vehicle you can think of... even the Batmobiles are able to be put into this game with the options to cloth C.J as Batman, or even Jason Voorhees if you want.This game sure has come such a long way from just an ariel/birds eye view 2D game. I never even thought game like this was possible until I saw how well they have made this one. It's like nothing Ive ever played before.Filled with hidden goodies, cheats, secrets and even side games... like, say for instance, you enter a casino, you can actually play the slot machines in a side game. As well as gambling games like a horse race, or if you enter a bar or something you can even play video games of different kinds, like the old school atari games. And if that wasn't enough, there is even bonus races you can find in the game, things like a Go-kart races, Stock Car racing and so much more.I've only had this game 2 days and i am already this impressed with it, and there is so much more i haven't even discovered about this game yet! If anyone finds they don't like this game, you need your head read, or maybe you just need some cheats and codes to stay alive or fly around or something. I don't know how anyone could say this game isn't great, apart from those people who don't like cuss words or violence... well, turn the audio off and dont hit anyone. This here is bound to be one of the top contenders for game of the century.Man, you can even go shopping for food and cloths in this or just hang out at the strip club and pay for a lap dance. This game has become so much more then just hijacking cars and doing hit jobs. I must have played for 18 hours straight without even bothering to check out what any of the missions are. Just exploring the game is entertaining enough for hours on end.Also the music is great, there is so many tracks been put into the game, and not unknown songs either, songs from Jerry Reed, Guns N Roses, Faith No More, Ice T and so many other artists and then you can also just use your own mp3's as well!!An amazing game, and i say that knowing I haven't even begun to fully explore what is inside of this game!GOURANGA","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2006"}

Best of all, the fighting system allows even more mastery and strategy of your favorite character -- including the most complex DOA countering system yet!","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Fast, Furious, Infuriating","reviewText":"There are a number of fighting games out there that kind of just toss you into heavy action and hope for the best. Most of those, at the end of the day, are thankfully button mashers, and often times have the full gamete of difficulty options for fighter game weakling like myself. Now I do have my fighting games I'm good at. I'm still a master of the old school Mortal Kombat I and 2, and I'm reasonably good at Tekken, but am only good enough with Soul Calibur 2 to survive the Normal Difficulty. With DOA 2 Ultimate I managed to actually bite, scratch and scrape my way through the hard mode, but it was not an easy thing to pull off, and it was something I swore I'd never put myself through again. You see I'm a hard-core role player, but a casual fighting gamer.I am a real life martial artist, though, so martial arts based fighting games do hold an interest for me. I was eager to get DOA 4 because even though the screen shots for the XBox 360 games revealed titles that looked a lot like their old Xbox counterparts I had already become aware of an amazing but true little factoid. The 360 looks amazing in High Definition. I cannot lie, the same is true of DOA 4, and it looks breathtaking, though the character models are sadly disappointing at this point. I'd be nice if Team Ninja would have aimed for more realism. I also found the game's Barbie doll like \"partial nudity\" laughable. I can't believe they got an M rating for Barbie doll nudity. The ESRB must be overly strict...The music, once more is awesome, and did I mention the graphics are amazing? I did? Oh... well they really are, especially the scenery. There's hardly any jaggies at all, and I only noticed one instance of any sort of graphical flaws.The fighting system is similar to DOA 3 but revamped so that the moves that worked in the previous version don't quite have the same effect here, but here's where we get into my whining. There is no easy mode. It's true that there is a training mode, but it does little to prepare you for the raw aggression you're going to get from the computer run opponents. Simply put, for me, this game is too hard, even on the lowest difficulty setting possible \"Normal\" which is \"medium\" in MK terms. Clearing the game for newbies and people who are only casually interested in the DOA franchise is no easy feat, and for those of us wanting to learn by hands on experience rather than an unmoving un-reacting computer character it makes it difficult. I mean you can pause, and pull up a move list, but when you try to execute it the computer run opponent will pummel you into oblivion. Worse yet, the AI seems fully capable of breaking my combos (and I have learned a few sweet moves) but even though I try doing what the game's manual suggests I find myself unable to stop myself from taking a severe beating.I'd love to give the single player mode a higher score, but as a casual fan of DOA, rather than a hardcore fan, I can't help but feel like this game was built for the hardcore. Had Team Ninja tossed in an easy mode it would be easier to pull like I did with DOA 2 Ultimate and eventually work my way up to where I'm good enough to bite, scratch, kick, and break controllers on my way through Hard or even very hard mode. Instead DOA 4 starts you in a difficult mode, and expects you to go from there.That's not to say this game is bad. To the contrary, it's still a great game, and the endings are well worth suffering through the battle with the next-to-impossible-to-beat Kasumi clone at the end, but one thing Team Ninja did that I'm really happy about is make the story much more coherent, and the stories overlap each other so that you have a much better idea of the over all tale from beginning to end, and everything in between. As a player for story, I was very happy about that. And despite the game's increased and insane difficulty the great graphics make the game hard to pull your eyes away from, kinda like RE 4 did on GameCube a year ago, sans the life like characters.Online I cried. The lag I experienced was absolutely horrible. I am not sure why, I read that the game had next to none. I may be experiencing technical problems, but I got beaten because of lag, and that did not make me happy. I'm sure a number of players may make the same \"claim\" but rest assured, I'm not the best at the DOA games, but I'm not the worst either, so I was really mad when the game froze up in the middle of a combo I was doing and when it unlocked I had been beaten. Then a similar problem occurred in the following round costing me the match. At any rate, the new lobby sure is weird, and to be honest I'm not sure I like it. I think I prefer the more simplistic approach taken by DOA Ultimate.In the end, DOA 4 is a great game, but great for hardcore gamers. This game will try the patience of casual gamers pretty bad. I definitely recommend this title for in home multiplayer though, if you have a spouse, or sibling or friend or parent, etc. it can be great.  Online seems to have a few bugs, sadly. I'd say hardcore fans of DOA should get this right away; others may want to rent it first and see if they can handle it. I don't regret buying it, but it is trying my patience at the same time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2006"}

It had amazing graphics, unique and perfectly refined combat, and an online combat that is hard to beat.  So all that was required with the sequel was to refine the first, and make it more refined.  In this, the game succeeds.  The levels have improved the \"get stuck in one area and bombarded by bad guys\" issues that were so constant throughout the first game.  Not only is there a longer and more interesting campaign, there's more to do, and a new variety of actions.  The graphics have been updated, and I must say, this game is far more fun with a friend through the campaign than on its own, though that is pretty fun as well.  An  A-List title that is great fun.As to the game of the year edition, there's no reason to get it if you own the game already, as all you get are some codes to download the extra content.  However, if you don't have it, then this is the edition to get, as the down-loadable content is almost as much as this full game.

If there are times where I seem vague, it is only because I do not wish to ruin the story for anybody. The true strength of the Golden Sun series is the story and it is best experienced on your own.While the game's story does draw heavily from the prior two games, you do not need to have played them in order to enjoy Dark Dawn. In fact, this new entry in the series utilizes an encyclopedia to remind you of key places, people and events in the games' combined history. Simply tap the shoulder button when an obscure reference is made and the top screen will display an entry to help refresh your memory.While I wrote that the story is Golden Sun's strength, it is also the game's Achille's heel. Gamers with short attention spans may be stunned at the amount of dialogue and exposition are packed within a Golden Sun. This is not a game you pick up and start blasting enemies. As an example, your entire party will stop to talk about a given course of action. They will weigh the pros and cons, people will express their disagreement, they will ask you what you think of the matter and talk some more. You will then take that course of action only for your party to stop and talk about what just happened.That isn't a bad thing though. This is not a bland RPG where you have to rescue a princess or some other oft repeated story line. This is a game that explores consequences for actions taken and how heroes are not necessarily loved by all. While the characters do talk a lot, the dialogue helps to establish the personalities of the characters. These characters aren't just collections of statistics. They will actually have their own unique viewpoints and may even disagree with you from time to time.The gameplay mechanics are very similar to the earlier games and long time fans will be able to pick it up and play without even looking at the instruction manual. The graphics are lush and colorful and the camera is more dynamic now. This is very recognizable as a Golden Sun game.For those of you who are new to the series, I would describe the gameplay as a mix between the classic SNES Final Fantasy games and a top-down adventure game such as A Link To The Past. Monsters are fought with a turn based battle system where your characters can attack, defend, use items or cast psynergy (the equivalent to magic). Your characters gain psynergy from mystical beings called djinn which represent the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. Attaching different djinn to different characters will change the psynergy available to that character as well as their statistics.The overworld and dungeon parts of the game contain puzzle elements; mostly these are about getting your party from one area to another. For example, to reach a path out of a forest you may have to climb a tree, hop over to a mountain ledge, walk down a path, slide down to a lower level, push a log into the water and then hop across to the exit. You might also find yourself having to use psynergy to cause a plant to grow into a climbable vine or to destroy an obstacle in your path.The biggest innovation for this series is the use of the DS touch screen. You can use a stylus to access the game's menus, move your character or choose a direction to cast your psynergy. Traditionalists can still choose to use the d-pad and buttons. It's up to you.I give this game 5 stars but I admit that I am very fond of this series (I've played it since the beginning.)If you loved the SNES era RPGs, if you thought that A Link To The Past was one of the best Zelda games or if you want an RPG with a well written story that can be light hearted yet still has its dark moments, I think you should check this one out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Battery life is a minus, but easily rectified with a cheap external charger.","reviewText":"There are a lot of misunderstandings about this product, namely that 1) You can't move data between memory cards (and so an 8 or 16 gig is still perfectly adequate for a good library, and if you want to swap content, it takes almost no time to do so and is very intuitive), and 2) There aren't a lot of &#34;good games&#34; for the Vita. This one's confusing, because it's like people don't realize you can play ANY PSP or PSOne game (digital, of course, though they're very inexpensive), and it's almost impossible to run out of games to play. Both PSP and PSOne games run beautifully and are visually enhanced, and playing something like Chrono Cross with the improvements the Vita makes is freaking awesome.While the battery life leaves much to be desired, especially with some games in particular that tax the hardware to extremes (e.g., Killzone: Mercenary, which will drain your battery beyond belief), this can easily be worked around with an external charger that is equal to or under 5V/1.5A. You *do not* need the official external battery, though you can use that if you want a lot of extra battery life. But you can easily get something like I have, which is 11,00 MaH and supports both 2.4A (for tablets) and 1A(for anything else). Contrary to popular belief, it does *not* need to be exactly 1.5A, but it should not *exceed* 1.5A. The $20 external charger is fine, though you can get a higher-capacity one, should you choose to.In any case, the Vita is an outstanding handheld system that has rocketed from its slow starting point after supporting Plus and having major firmware overhauls that enhance its capabilities, most importantly, to play PS4 (streaming), PSP, and PSOne games, in addition to native Vita games. The OLED screen is staggeringly gorgeous.I actually own a launch unit, which I decided upon after playing WipEout 2048 in a store, which wowed me. Things got MUCH better afterward, though I've never regretted the purchase. I got my brother the ACIII bundle later, which he very much enjoys.Aside from a carrying case with game slots to walk around with, you don't really need much in the way of accessories besides an 8 or 16 gig memory card, which often go for $30 or less, and you will never, EVER need to buy another. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, and didn't read the manual.Beautiful system that deserves high praise. IMO, blows the 3DS out of the water.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"S.

The tale is brought to life by an all-star voice cast. Fans will revisit this beloved story and come to care for a new troupe of characters in KINGDOM HEARTS II.","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Radaar\"","summary":"What The Heart Desires","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts II opens roughly one year after the events of the first game.  After destroying a team of some of Disney's greatest villains (including Maleficent, Chernaborg, Captain Hook, Ursula) as well as the man pulling all the strings of the villainous Heartless, a man known as Ansem, Sora (Haley Joel Osment), Donald Duck (Tony Anselmo), and Goofy (Bill Farmer) wandered into Castle Oblivion.  It was there that the events of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories took place.  The game, which was on the Game Boy Advance, introduced us to DiZ, Namine, and Organization XIII.  Also, Sora had some of his memories stripped, and anyone he forgot about in turn forgot about him.  Now, Kairi(Hayden Panettiere), one of his best friends, doesn't remember him.  Meanwhile, King Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine) and Sora's other friend Riku (David Gallagher) have escaped from the dark realm that they were sealed in at the end of the first game.The Organization serves as the big bad in KHII (similar to what the Disney Villains were seen as in the first game).  They are comprised of 13 creatures known as Nobodies, which serve as the other main enemy besides Heartless in this game.  Whenever a person with a strong heart, whether they are good or bad, becomes a Heartless, their body and soul are left behind, and create a Nobody.  The strongest of the strong hearts lead to the Organization members.After a long tutorial period featuring a new character known as Roxas (Jesse McCartney), we finally see what Sora, Donald, and Goofy are up to (I'll admit that I was a little upset at first when I was going through the very long intro period, but then I remembered that KHI did the same thing, with your time on the Destiny Islands serving a similar purpose).  Sora and his friends wake up with their memories restored in a strange place known as Twilight Town, which is where Roxas lived.  Even though you encounter Roxas' three friends, and even his enemies (including FFVIII character Seifer Almasy [Will Friedle]), none of them know Roxas.  After leaving Twilight Town, the gang meets up with Yen Sid(Corey Burton), the sorceror from Fantasia, and he updates the trio on the goings-on in the worlds.  He also gives Sora some new clothes, which allow for the game's drive feature (which I will explain later).  The trio also runs into all-purpose Disney villain Pete (Jim Cummings), who they learn was working for Maleficent (Susan Blakeslee).From there, they are able to start visiting worlds again, starting with Hollow Bastion, the castle of KHI villain Ansem.  Now reunited with Squall/Leon (now voiced by Doug Erholtz), Yuffie (now voiced by Mae Whitman), and others, they are ready to move on to helping other worlds.  While some worlds are repeats from the first game, such as Agrabah and Halloweentown, new worlds such as China (from Mulan), Beast's Castle, and Port Royal (from Pirates of the Carribean) become available.  Unfortunately, not all of the worlds are as fun as they were in the first game.  A few of them seem like [World]: The Game, especially the Port Royal world.  It very much plays out the plot of the film, only with Sora, Donald, and Goofy inserted in.  It isn't so bad, but the worlds in the first game seemed, for the most part, like their purposes fit into the game's overall plot.  Still, the plot of the Coliseum (another repeat world) was pretty cool, especially since it involved FFX character Auron (Matt McKenzie).Still, the best parts of the game tended to take place in the original worlds, especially Hollow Bastion.  One of my favorite parts was around the halfway point (in this game, nearly every world must be visited twice; once before and once after this grand midpoint event); it begins with a massive cutscene of an army of Heartless storming Hollow Bastion, and later a scene involving Mickey Mouse in such a way that I never thought was possible.  Speaking of Mickey, he is actually playable in this game, and he is awesome!  He is strong, fast, agile, and has a ton of HP.  However, the circumstances under which he can be played are very particular.The story of the game is very good.  One does need to overlook a few things, such as a fact regarding the Ansem you fought in the first game, and the fact that a few bosses (mostly Disney villains) get ressurected, and, for the most part, must be fought again (strangely, Maleficent never fights you, but I bet that they're saving her next fight for the next game).  Organization XIII makes worthy adversaries (some of them seem nearly impossible), and their story is interesting to follow.  Also, the group that accompanies you in the World That Never Was is pretty sweet (basically, Mickey, Kairi, and one other person join you).  The game also has many great new features, most notably the Drive feature.  Driving allows you to combine with your allies and become exponentially more powerful, and it usually allows you to weild dual Keyblades.  Also, KHII offers the best reason I've ever seen for why, at the beginning of the game, you start off as weak as you were at the beginning of the first game.  Basically, due to the events of KH:CoM, you have forgotten all of your abilities (I'll buy that).  The one place that doesn't make sense regarding things not remembered is Atlantica; there is no explanation for Ursula's resurrection, and no one seems to remember her, not Ariel (Jodi Benson), nor your party, who remember all of the other bosses they fought.There are a few problems.  The game is a little over simplified; sometimes, you'll have \"missions\", but all of your objectives are spelled out for you.  One complaint I've heard is that there is little use for magic in the game, but I attribute that to the camera controls.  In this game, you use the right analog stick to move the camera (as opposed to the R2 and L2 buttons in the first game).  This makes the camera easier to move, but it means that you can't use the right stick to choose things on the menu while fighting (which was the method I used in KHI as opposed to the D-Pad).  You are forced to use the D-Pad, which must be manipulated with the same hand as the left stick, which is used to move the character.  Since I preferred to be always moving in battle, I rarely used magic that wasn't on my shortcut list (one of which was Cure).Still, despite its few shortcomings, Kingdom Hearts II is, overall, a great game.  The story is good, the effects are great (I love so many of the cutscenes), and is fun to play.  If you played Kingdom Hearts, you owe it to yourself to play the sequel.  Oh, and if you haven't played KHI, play it before you play this, otherwise you will be totally lost (it's possible to play this without having played Chain of Memories, but there will be some things that won't be as meaningful to you; I didn't play it, so my roommate who did had to explain some stuff to me).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2006"}

I went ahead and got it because it was dirt cheap. I did have problems with crashes causing the computer to restart. These ended up being caused by an out of date video card driver. I did not have any problems with security software, but I have a DVD ROM drive. The game does work for ATI and Nvidia video cards. Make sure you download the latest patch.The designers made a concerted effort to recreate actual WWII combat movements of the 101st Airborne starting with their parachute drop in Normandy. The buildings and other terrain shown in the game are based on WWII aerial reconnaissance and pictures. The missions are based on combat action reports recorded by the actual soldiers who fought in WWII. As you play the game, extras are enabled to be viewed which show various things about the actual WWII missions, pictures from Normandy during WWII and now, and lots of other interesting material.I like the squad based commands. This is a great merger of combat strategy and first person shooter (FPS) games. The commands are very simple to use, but they are limited to line of site. Contrary to some of the reviews, you can hit target even that have cover, but basically you have aim using zoom feature in the gun and range has a major influence. Cover provides significantly more protection than most other shooter games, but I think this adds to the strategy of the game. The game uses a suppression system that is really cool, but the indicator in the game detracts from the realism (this can be turned off). The situational awareness feature allows you to pause the game and see the position of your team members. This is useful to be able to move your squad efficiently and plan attacks. I think is a little overdone. It allows you to zoom in on enemy positions. I think it should be more limited to line of sight of the team members. My only real complaint is that the computer AI does not try to use the same squad based tactics that the player uses. The Germans mostly only fight defensively and their counterattacks are not coordinated and do not react to your placement.I gave the game four stars because of good use of squad based commands and authenticity of the terrain and missions. It's something different than the typical WWII FPS games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2008"}

This game is so much fun.  There's a better story line, perfect controls, great sound, and some pretty nice graphics too.  Once and for all we get to kill Dark Samus and stop the Corruption for good!I'll start off by saying the new weapons and gadgets are pretty cool.  Some are sort of useless after one use, such as the ship missiles, but are still required to reach 100% pickups.  I have no idea why there are so many ship missile expansions in the game because they are absolutely useless unless you want to get the special ending.  Oh well; that takes no value away from the game whatsoever.  Every new beam you get is backwards compatible with your previous beam, which is frickin awesome.  No more D-pad using to switch between beams.The only quirk I really have about the weapons is that missiles are rarely used and not even necessary to kill the bosses in this game.  Most of the time you'll be using the hyperbeam to kill tough enemies and bosses.  And you get that almost in the beginning of the game!!!The sound in MP3 is very good.  I don't think it's as good as MP1 was but the soundtrack is not bad at all.  Bryo is probably my favorite piece.  MP1 had almost identical music to Super Metroid in non midi form and that's what made it so great.  Magmoor Caverns took the music from Super Metroid's Norfair area and that is by far my favorite level music from Metroid.  The voice acting is also actually pretty good for what little there is.I give sound a 4.5 out of 5.The graphics in MP3 are some of the best on the Wii to this day (although it doesn't have much competition).  There is definitely a difference between the standard composite cables and the component with 480p.  The game looks sharper and less blurry.  Although there are more jagged edges while playing in 480p, the overall clearness and color of the game look great.  The game runs at 60 FPS even on the planet Elysia (which reminds me of Cloud City from Star Wars :D).  Retro did a great job on creature and boss animations as they are amazingly detailed for the Wii.I give graphics a 4.5 out of 5.The controls in MP3 are the best I have ever seen in a first person shooter game and I wouldn't change a dang think about the controls.  Nintendo has done a revolutionary thing with the Wii remote and the controls are so precise you'd think it wasn't wireless.  It's almost like using a keyboard and mouse.The nunchuk joystick (resembles w,s,a,d on a keyboard) moves your character up and down, and strafes left and right while the Wii remote (resembles a pc mouse) looks up, down, left and right.  The controls may take you a little while to get used to after playing on a standard controller but once you get used to them, you won't want to go back.  I wish all FPS games had this control setup now.I give controls a 5 out of 5.The gameplay in MP3 is the best part.  The first time I played this game was at my best friend's house and I think I played the first level 3 or 4 times just to show him and his brother how cool it was, and how awesome the very first boss looked (on the federation ship).Samus is now able to view the inside of her spacecraft and manually hit buttons inside her ship.  She can use a communications radio channel, view a galaxy map and use an options menu inside the ship.  While a couple of these are really not usefull to complete the game there are a few easter eggs dealing with her ship.The few planets in this game are big and beautiful.  I would have liked to see more planets to explore but I really satisfied with was was there.  The zone layout is different from other Metroid games as instead of only 1 planet to explore with several areas, there are 3 planets now with 2 or 3 areas to explore on each.  While altogether there aren't as many different named zones as there was in Super Metroid or Metroid Prime, the worlds are arguably bigger and more complex.Elysia is by far the most advanced world to navigate in the series as there are many cannons and grapple points to traverse between the areas in the sky.  Bryo is also pretty interesting.  It has a jungle, fire and a small ice area which can be accessed a little later in the game.  I would have liked to see a larger ice area like what was in Prime 1 but it doesn't take away from the gameplay at all.  The fire area is also not as awesome as in the original Prime but hey, the zones here are still pretty sweet!The boss fights are pretty amazing.  Some are very easy and others can be pretty tricky and difficult.  There is a lot of manual aiming to be done when fighting bosses which can be good and bad.  A lot of key firing spots on bosses are hard to hit because they're either too small or the boss is moving around too much to get a good shot off.  But it just takes a patience and if you can avoid the boss's attacks then you can obviously get more attempts at destroying it.  The bosses are big and intimidating as always!  The metroid series never failed to give huge and epic boss battles and this game proves no different.  Although each planet's seed bosses are by far the largest (they are world bosses and they should be!), the mini bosses pose a high threat as well.  They are fast and vicious and will always keep you on your toes.I would have liked the game to be a bit longer.  I collected 100% rating just 15 hours into the game and unlocked the best ending my first play through, but that was also on Normal difficulty.  Even so it seemed too short the time was very well worth it.  I'm not one that plays every game in normal, hard or very hard difficulty levels since I play so many different games, but I have to say I think I actually died a couple times on some boss fights on normal difficulty :P.I give the gameplay a 5 out of 5.Bottom line - if you love the Metroid Series then you'll love this game!  I really think it is the best in the Prime series, but that is, of course, my opinion.I give Metroid Prime 3 a 4.75 out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"J.

It is also dirt cheap which is why you should buy it now. But for the tough sale out there, I'd like to cover what the game excels at and what it doesn't.The biggest reason why everyone should play this game is that it really revolves around you. No not your character Mike Thorton (rogue agent for Alpha Protocol), but you the player. There are interactive cut scenes that you pick where the conversation goes. Not just that but your choices in the conversation will improve or decline your reputation with characters in the game. The story becomes your own. You can execute characters, be hostile toward them, nice, suave, and a lot of other things to each one. Your alliances build and fall apart and make other characters like or hate you more. It is really captivating. Their animations are realistic, they don't just stand there... unless they're on a television screen, but even then effects spice it up.The talks are good and well written especially for the diversity. The voice acting is very believable and some characters like the Russians are a little cheesy. Perhaps intentionally cheesy like the 80s mobster and the agent sent to murder you (Darcy).You will get emails from these characters and you can reply to them using preset emails that will change your relationship with them accordingly. You will also meet a journalist too and whenever you find out dirty little secrets, you can send it to her, sell it on the black market or notify the company you have the secret.The story is that you are Mike Thorton, the newest agent at Alpha Protocol. You are sent off to find missiles that were used by terrorists to shoot down a passenger jet. You get sent through 4+ different parts of the world (Rome and Moscow come to mind) on dozens of missions that have a good deal of variety to them. Most missions are your standard find this and rescue that.The game also excels with its mini games, such as lock picking where you simply match the lock tumblers, computer hacking where you need to match 2 strings of letters to a series of other letters and finally a find the path electronic wires sort of thing. All of these are done amazingly well and keep your mind thinking and your eyes looking. It is another captivating part of the game.There are 4 varieties of weapons. Pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sub machine guns. Each handles differently and there are several different weapons in each category. At the end of each mission you will get a level up and you can choose your stats for abilities like pistol usage, shotgun usage, martial arts, electronics, stealth and so on. With each level you get to, there are new specials that will be unlocked. Such as room clear for shotguns and slow motion for pistols. They are very nice abilities that will take the guess work out of RPGing. You have secondary items too like first aide, flash bangs, grenades, decoys, sound generators and so on.Now let's talk about the bad part of the game. Well bad in relative terms. If you've played 3PS games... then you've played BETTER 3PS games. Its also an RPG game which means if you shotgun someone in the head at point blank... you still might miss them! All because the accuracy of your weapon isn't high enough and that's your random luck.The boss battles can be extremely frustrating if you don't have special abilities. Luckily there are not that many boss battles, but the ones against humans are the most frustrating just because they can take 100 shotguns to the face and still kill you.This is a cover based shooter, but honestly I don't find myself using it much. I just go in very rambo style. When I shoot someone down I just run up to them and finish them off. That's my play style. There is stealth and stealth kills. People also don't seem to like the camera either because your mouse moves the camera... but if you hold the right mouse button that takes on a traditional 3PS or OTS look so you can accurately shoot.The game has some nice enemy animations. Shoot someone and they will act realistically. They fall to the floor, fly through the air, flip if you shoot their leg, their gun will go off and other interesting things. The AI isn't exactly smart though. No one scatters from cover if you throw a grenade. Enemies will charge at you if they run out of ammo or if they're close enough. That will stun you. Enemies will throw grenades to get you to move. The graphics aren't the best, but the environments feel real and believable with nothing glaringly bad.In all this is a really fun game and very immersive. I never want to stop playing it, because I always want to see what's next.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

You get to choose the styles of an agent you want to be.Story and Script is interesting. Skills and missions are plenty.Con:- I don't know about the console versions, but the PC version has this particular issue that made me uninstall this game.EVERY TIME the game loads a new area or a new information (like an incoming radio contact or a new objective), the camera jerks out of control.It will fly to your back, over your head, aim right at the floor, any direction BUT the way you want it to be. That means when you go into an area with an enemy nearby, chances are you'll mess up.I'm no stranger to stealth games, action or action-RPG. Never before that I messed up this much. I walked out of cover and got shot. I shot the floor instead of a guard and called in the rest of them. And I even meleed in the wrong direction !?!? All because of this camera issue !!!I tried it with both joypad and mouse, the problem persisted...I lowered all the video settings to minimum, the problem still persisted...I played Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands on the highest video settings without even a hiccup. So I'm sure it's not my machine.This is not just annoying. It's UNFORGIVABLE.- Minor flaws for a joypad user. They tie the camera sensitivity to the aiming sensitivity. If you lower the sensivity so you can align your aim better with an analog stick, the camera turning speed will get dragged down to a crawl.But if your camera turns with a moderate speed, it will be VERY difficult to align your shot to a small target.In conclusion:The game has a lot of potentials. But the developer ruined it all with LOUSY camera controls. If you can endure the frustration, this might not be a bad game for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2010"}

Especially when it came to graphics and camera control.  Fortunately Disgaea 4 improves practically everything, with one unfortunate exception which I will mention later.This time around the graphics got a pretty decent upgrade.  Not to say that your mind will be blown away by the visuals, but definitely quite a step up from previous versions.  The character sprites are now in high definition, and the backgrounds look smoother and offer a bit more detail.  The game gives you the choice of using standard definition sprites as well if you are using a SDTV.  Another thing to mention about the graphics is the fantastic visuals during team attacks.  Especially when you trigger a three or four member attack.  Not only are the visuals impressive here, but they also can be a bit funny as well.The story this time as well is quite an upgrade.  Disgaea 3 in my opinion had a very below average story and characters.  For me at least, the story and humor were much improved and I looked forward to what each new chapter would bring.  Also, the voice actors for the most part do an incredible job.  The music is also an improvement and fits the situations almost perfectly.A few additions to the game-play as well, mostly for the better.  The item world now has branching paths every five levels.  You can either choose to upgrade the item, or follow the other path and upgrade the innocents.  The Cam-pain map is also a nice addition.  Placing \"Evil Symbols\" on the map to enhance your characters is well done and definitely adds strategy.  Of course the geo blocs return, and once again can be both fun and challenging especially in the item world.  Definitely still fun watching all the colored squares get destroyed and your bonus gauge filling up.  Some online elements are also available.  Unfortunately since currently I am only playing single player, I am not extremely familiar with them.  I believe though that you can appoint council members from your game, and they may show up in the Senate of another game if your playing online.  Eventually I will check this feature out more, but frankly I prefer playing single player games.The only real complaint that I still have is the camera.  While you can rotate the camera and choose 3 different viewpoints, it is still pretty limiting.  Especially in the item world when many characters and different color squares can make things a bit difficult.  Overall not a big deal, but still slightly annoying.This is definitely a good strategy game.  Whether you just want to play the main story, or spend many hours in the post-game content this game definitely delivers.  Many people assume this series is just for stat crazy, and those that love insane leveling.  Disgaea 4 can be played just for the main story if you wish, and in doing so you can avoid much of the \"grinding\" and more difficult challenges.  Actually the main story chapters can offer a decent challenge if you basically just play through them and don't grind your characters too much in the item world or on previously completed story maps.I am glad I didn't give up on the series after the third version.  Disgaea 4 is actually my favorite in the series.Graphics: 9/10 much improved, even if they don't blow you away.Music:  9/10 very well done, a few character voices can be annoying at timesStory:  9/10 my favorite in the series.  much better than Disgaea 3Controls: 6/10 still a bit clunky and crowded maps can be a headacheReplay V: 10/10 no complaints here.  story mode is long and post story mode offers insane amounts of things to doOverall:  9/10 perhaps the best in series, and one of the best RPG/SRPG on the ps3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

It's no patch on the semi-divine RPG experience of Morrowind, but it's possibly the hugest, most engaging experience in the current market. Haters will point to the lack of spell design, the emphasis on 1-hit stealth kills, and easy quest markers as concessions to the console crowd, but they gloss over the improvements- Spells are now markedly different as opposed to past games' \"shoot a colored ball\" spells, stealth and melee reward characters who can plan and exploit the many ways of distracting and disrupting enemies (to the point where it feels less like a hack'n'slash and more like a real action game) and quests now flog you around a huge world where fast travel is actually MORE limited than oblivion.

{"product_name":"B001BX6JUA","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"Second verse: same as the first.....but better!","reviewText":"So if you've even heard the words \"video\" and \"game\" put together outside of Fox News' patented Chicken Little hysteria over violence and such, you're well aware of just whatRock BandandGuitar Heroare all about.  Good.  That'll make this easy.  \"Rock Band 2\" Takes every single little thing every living breathing gaming entity on the planet loved about the first one and added every little thing that was lacking and then some.  Seriously, some may call this a full-priced expansion pack, but for what you're getting here you'd be an idiot not to buy this game if you already have the original pack.  And if you missed out then there is no reason not to start here with theSpecial Edition's new and improved peripherals.  I called the battle between RB and GH a draw before since GH had such a cooler over-the-top style, better translation of music-to-game and better songs to boot.  No more.  Rock band is the top of the music game hill right now andGuitar Hero World Touris going to have to rock some serious socks off if it hopes to surpass this one.First off, the most important part of the game: the music.  Like Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam?  Sure you do.  How about Bob Dylan, Blondie, and The Go-Go's?  Darn skippy.  Not hard enough?  How about freakin' Testament, Mastodon, Megadeth, and System of a Down?  My head is banging just thinking about it.  Not legendary enough?  The Who, Bad Company, Journey, AC/DC, and Fleetwood Mac do anything for you?  Heard it all before?  Well then check out the brand new never before heard new Guns n Roses song.  Favorite band still not here, you say?  Lacuna Coil, Sonic Youth, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and two different D's ( Social AND Tenacious) wish to make the pain go away.  That's just a few of the EIGHTY FOUR master recordings you will jam out to.  Not enough?  How about a free code to download TWENTY MORE FOR FREE when they become available?  And endless downloadable content including entire albums from Megadeth, Judas Priest, Boston, and an ever-growing list of many mucho more is an even bigger clincher.  Plus, for a $5 fee you can import your entire Rock Band 1 library.  If you love any sort of rock music, you will love this game.Okay, the new additions.  There is no reinventing of the wheel here, but the road is much smoother.  The useless solo mode has been eliminated and instead solo play is integrated into the awesomely awesome world tour mode.  I have not the time or the Rock Band-playing friends with too much time on their hands to embark on a lengthy multiplayer campaign so this is a dream come true.  The best aspects of the original was saved for the multiplayer.  That's no longer the case.  You can also choose to play bass when going solo now so three cheers for that.  The basslines are translated much better than the guitar parts anyhow.  This time around you aren't tied down to any instrument at all going it solo; you can switch freely among them as you progress through the game.  You can pass on the songs you don't like (or that kick your rear end) whereas in the original's solo mode you'd have to slog through every single song.  Even the Flyleaf and Jet ones.  Torturous!Using the barely upgraded create-a-rocker feature I recreated my original RB band Midget Apartheid's lineup to a T and now I can play with all of my custom thrashers onstage at once when playing alone instead of having a bunch of lame stock-rockers filling out the ranks.  I love this.  Sadly, my band name was deemed \"not classy\" by the fascists at MTV Games and I'm barred from online play until I change it.  I'm not changing it. It rules.  Anywho, the online component is brilliantly integrated into the tour mode with optional battles and challenges where you can compete against other online bands that pop up as you travel.  \"Sage Tellah and the Spoony Bard Band\" is sounding like a cool band name at this point (if you get that reference, you are now my friend).  It's not selling out or caving in if I pretend it was my idea, right?  I wanna try this new component out!This is the simply the coolest music game ever put together from top to bottom.  The only problem that remains is that a few of the songs are duds (\"So Whatcha Want\" is awful on guitar) and there are still times when you don't feel like you're controlling the music so much as you're just pressing combinations of buttons because the game says so.  Guitar hero always makes you feel like you rule the guitar track.  At times in Rock Band you are obviously playing a drum or bass part on the guitar and hearing something you aren't playing and vice-versa.  There were also drum parts where all I heard was the bass drum and yet they still had me flailing away.  This throws me off to no end because I listen to the music intensely and take rhythmic cues from it.  It pulls me right out of the game when I'm hearing one thing and playing something else entirely.  I can forgive this because it isn;t always flagrant and everything else is so heavenly.  But no excuses, Harmonix.  Fix this and you've got a contender the best game of any genre ever.  Maybe it already is.Bon Scott was a prophet.  This I know to be true.  He hath spake the blessed verse that hath come to be many a decade ago when he bequeathed unto us these words that best describe the experience that is Rock Band 2.\"Let there be sound\", there was sound\"Let there be light\", there was light\"Let there be drums\", there was drums\"Let there be guitar\", there was guitar\"Let there be rock\"And so on this day it has come to pass that (ramma lamma lamma lamma) Rock Band 2 is king.  It's got the drums, it's got the singing, it's got the guitar/bass, it's got the songs, it's got more songs if you don't like those songs, and it's got a much better interface than any of it's predecessors.  You like music?  Got an up-to-date video game system?  Beg, borrow, steal, or sell your family members' organs if you have to; but buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2008"}

Instant incredible game, right? Well, not exactly.\"Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy\" has a more interesting story this time around, taking the original's and spicing it up with a few swapped loyalties, a minor mystery, and less goings-on about the great \"divine conflict\". This time around, the focus is on the characters, and from what cutscenes I did see (skipping most of them due to the lengthy and often laughable dialogue), the game is standing on slightly firmer ground. It's still not up to par with Squeenix's other blockbuster offerings, but it is a little less boring than the first one.Adding a bit of spice and conflict to the narrative is the introduction of many new characters, including the famous joke character and running gag, Gilgamesh. While I myself have never played a game with him in it, he is legendary enough that the cutscenes depicting him were quite amusing and well worth watching. Tifa Lockhart and Kain Highwind are nice additions to the roster with a well-balanced, mid-range moveset. Others are lackluster, such as Laguna Loire, Yuna, and Vaan, are nice additions but ultimately fall a tad short with their inflexible moveset, though their two alternate costumes make up for this a little. The Twelfth Cycle, which is the game's primary narrative, is a lengthy, occasionally entertaining, but often cumbersome tale of the new characters (with the exceptions of Prishe, Gilgamesh, and Feral Chaos), which makes up the bulk of the game and is guaranteed to drain a few hours from your day.A more minor, but just as nice, little addition are the new alternate costumes - every character now has three costumes, one default, one being the original's alternate (if applicable), and the third being the new alternate. Some are nostalgic, such as Yuna's wedding dress and Sephiroth's original look from his original game, while others aren't much more than palette swaps. Some, such as Tidus's new shirtless look, are old concept art sketches brought to life. Others, like Ultimecia's Edea outfit, make some sense in context but are otherwise fairly boring.Another nice set of inclusions are the new battle maps and music tracks - from a minor remix ofFinal Fantasy XIII's \"Blinded by Light\" toFinal Fantasy X's \"A Contest of Aeons\", from the Phantom Train to Orphan's Cradle, these new battle maps and music tracks amplify the sense of nostalgia for longtime fans, not to mention give a little push for newcomers to go check out Sqeenix's original offerings. In addition to that, the battles themselves have picked up the pace - the Chase sequences are faster and notifications come and go a little quicker, so in a way, the main focus is still on the battles themselves. Movesets have been improved, such as Cloud's Braver range being shortened (a welcome addition for anyone who's played against a Cloud that liked to spam that move) and a close-range swipe for Sephiroth to balance out his long- and mid-range strikes.With all these improvements (including some for existing characters' movesets, such as Cloud), one would think that \"Duodecim\" is a far superior specimen to the original: not only is there the legendary Twelfth Cycle here to play through, but there's also such modes as the Party Battle and the Reports to play through, as well. Unfortunately, the actual execution of the game buckles under its own weight: all the shiny new improvements, colorful characters, the overworld map, and the bloated storylines all work together to weaken what was originally a fantastic game.First of all, the Assist system seems nice on the surface, but it's actually little more than unnecessary shininess. Thanks to the new feature, the fairly clean interface of the original game now appears cluttered, not to mention you now run the risk of your opponent suddenly filling his or her Assist gauge and spamming it on you without warning. Also, for old-school blow-for-blow players like myself, the system is a bit cumbersome and requires a little too much attention to the gauge rather than focusing on fighting, not to mention it takes some of the skill out of the battles. Players well-used to the original's battle system will likely not be using the feature very much.Second of all, the Twelfth Cycle itself, as mentioned before, is a bloated mess and a chore to get through. While the addition of the world map (otherwise known as an overworld map) is rather nice, the way the dungeons and enemies are executed is a kind of underwhelming. While Destiny Points have been removed from these dungeons (no more having to strategise one's battles, I suppose) to be replaced by \"Kupo Points\", they have also been made that much easier...and boring. Winning every battle against every pawn on the map can take a long time, and while the new chain mechanics are nice (there's now an option to cancel them, too), there's not a whole lot of incentive to build up Kupo Points. KP are used at Moogle Shops, but so far there's nothing much worth buying. Winning prizes at the end of each Destiny Oddysey was a nice reason to keep racking up DP, and with that feature removed, well...In turn, the new mechanics have turned the streamlined Destiny Odysseys of the original game into a cluttered mess. Where the original was a nice way to spend some hours or blow off some steam with a quick battle or two, \"Duodecim\" has added all the new mechanics, including the world map, to it. The ability to swap outfits has also been removed, and while that might seem like a minor bone of contention, it's still rather irritating. The act of having to run across this world map, occasionally encountering enemies, treasures chests, and the \"light of the dead\" (which, I don't know about you, I find a little disturbing), sucks a lot of the fun out of the Thirteenth Cycle.The biggest thing, for me at least, is the save data transfer function. The near-two hundred hours I spent on the first game has gone completely wasted here - although  was able to keep all the levels I had earned with the original characters, most of those hours were spent in the Duel Colisseum earning rare or expensive items and fighting through tournament after palm-sweating tournament in search of \"that one item\". The DC has been removed, replaced by the Labyrinth, which provides nothing more than a challenge rather than any kind of reward. Not to mention that all those items - from Rosetta Stones to expensive armor and exclusive weapons - is gone. Completely gone. From a realistic standpoint, yes, this makes perfect sense, but for those of us who spent so much time grinding and working toward those items, you're better off hanging on to the original game. The ones that really burn are all the Battlegen accessories, any penultimate exclusive weapons, and the Great Gospel accessory.The last little annoyance is the Creation Mode: a nice addition if it were possible to use an external keyboard with the PSP, as entering all that text becomes painful really quickly. Not to mention that the game's load times (on the PSP-1000, at least) are terrible and really serve to bog down any of the modes available in it.Overall, \"Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy\" is a nice addition to the Square Enix lineup, but unfortunately it falls short on its execution. While some of the new characters, maps, and music tracks make it a worthwhile purchase, the cons tip the scale more toward the \"needs a lot more polish\" side of things. For gamers used to the original and those who invested a great deal of time in it, you'd be better off hanging onto your copy and just buying this one on the side if you simply must have it. For those newcomers to the series, this is a good purchase, though in my humble opinion the first was a wonderfully flawed jewel of a game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings game review","reviewText":"The Witcher 2 is based on the Witcher series by Andezej Sapkowski and is a well known fantasy series in Poland. Now I had never heard of the Witcher series till I saw youtube's Angry Joe review the PC version on his show so needless to say I had never played the first Witcher and wouldn't have gotten to play the sequel had CD Projekt not released the game for the Xbox 360. This is going to be a review of the 360 version since it came out this year and my PC would explode if I tried to install it on here.  I should say that I'm not that big a RPG gamer and most of the RPGs I've played in my life have been Japanese made and that was back in the 16-bit days so this was my real first time playing a Euro-RPG. What's interesting is that is the most successful video game Poland has ever made and for good reason. In May 2011, the Prime Minister of Poland gave a copy of this game to President Obama on his visit to the country. But that's enough of the history though, on to the review. I really liked this game and it really sucked me in. Now the 360 version is known as the Enhanced Edition which includes 10GBs of new content and also comes packaged with a journey book which is basically a mini players guide and the game's soundtrack which I am actually listening to as I write this review. It's really good! The game and soundtrack.STORY: You play as Geralt of Riva, the Witcher. What is a Witcher? Witchers are mutated men that possess greater strength, speed, and agility than most humans and the use of magic. They also have animal like eyes that allow them to see in the dark. They are few and usually work as mercenaries.  The game starts with Geralt in a dungeon in a castle in the kingdom of Temeria. He is being interrogated by Vernon Roche the leader of the Blue Stripes, the Temerian Special Forces. Geralt is the only witness and believed to be the assassin of King Foltest but Geralt knows it was really another Witcher who committed the crime and other assassinations of kings in the kingdom. Through a series flashbacks, we learn of the events leading up to the assassination, about the characters, learn of Geralt's relationship with the sorceress Triss Merigold, and the attack of a dragon during the battle that took place on the day of Foltest's assassination. You then break out of the prison with the help of Vernon and Triss and head out on a quest to clear Geralt's name and find the assassin. Oh but things are not as simple as they seem. As the game progresses a massive conspiracy unfolds that could change the fate of the entire kingdom.The world this is set in is an immersive one filled with the usual fantasy elements and races such as magic, monsters, sorcerers, elves, dwarfs, demons, ghosts, and dragons but unlike other fantasy series like Lord of the Rings per say, the world is very dark and gritty. There is strong racism in this world as humans tend to hate and mistreat non-humans. Elves are seen as bad guys, depending which path you take. That's something I've rarely seen in fantasy. This is also a VERY ADULT game. There is very strong language throughout (you will hear the word `plowing' used a lot and they are not talking about plowing a field), graphic violence, and there are sex scenes with full female nudity. You can find prostitutes and sleep with them as well as courting some of the female characters. The established relationship you have with Triss is done very well, one of the best adult romances I've ever seen in a game. There are a lot of interesting and developed characters throughout the game and tons of side quests and branching paths. It is a pretty long game, took me a couple weeks the first time to beat and about a little more than a week the second time so it's about 30+ hours depends on the quests you do. Far better than the usual 4 to 6 hour games you run into these days. Chapter 2 is the longest part of the game but the last chapter is much shorter so some might be disappointed in that. You don't have to have played the first game to understand what's happening in this one. If you like games with deep complex stories of political intrigue and lots of twists, you'd love this game's story. It's well written and well thought out.GAMEPLAY: When you first play this, I highly suggest you got through the tutorial first. It's not the best tutorial but this is the only place you're going to have the game tell you the basics because once the game really starts, it's not going to hold your hand like most games these days. The tutorial will make the combat system seem more complicated than it really is though. You'll notice that you can be armed with two swords, a steel sword for killing humans and a silver sword for killing monsters. You have six magical spells most only two of them I used most of the time, the fire blast and the telekinetic push thing. You also have a spell that can cause enemies to turn against each other but it rarely works, a spell that boosts your defense briefly, and a magical trap that you can place on the ground that I only really used during a boss battle. The game expects you to strategize your battles, don't just run blindly into a battle or you will get your ass kicked. You gain EXP points two ways, fighting enemies and completely quests and side quests. Completing quests will give more EXP than monster fighting so you want to try and take on as many side quests as you can when you get to a new area. When you level up, you can branch out into 4 different areas, training (You'll have to fill this out first), fighting, magic, and alchemy. However, you'll mainly want to develop the fighting and magic branches more over the alchemy branch other than to get health and vigor (your magic bar) upgrades. Alchemy deals with the making of potions which there are many that you can make throughout the game and there is also a limit to how many potions you can take. You can actually OD on them which I find to be an interesting and realistic twist on potions in gaming. There are also some mini-games you can take part in such as fighting which is basically a simple QTE that is almost impossible to lose at, arm wrestling which is also pretty easy till later in the game, and some dice gambling game that I have no idea how it works so I just avoid it.The inventory screen is a bit of a mess. When you pull it up, as default it shows you the list of everything in your inventory and you gather A LOT though out this game and will need to clean it out often as to not get weighted down. Yes, you have a weight limit and it sucks when you go over weight so sell and store items often. The map screen isn't very helpful but you do have a in game mini-map that is more much more useful. The quest management screen is also a bit confusing because you will be given so many quests that it can be hard to keep straight which quest you are trying to take on at a time. The boss battles are few but epic including an awesome battle with a dragon. One last thing I'll say is that the game has high replay value and warrants at least two play troughs as at the end of chapter 1 you will be required to choose sides and it will dramatically affect the rest of the game. Like a lot of RPGs these days you'll be required to reply and direct conversations that you have by selecting answers and this game does it very well. There have been times where I have sat there for a few minutes trying to figure out which answer I should give to an important question. Unlike Skyrim or other RPGs, there is no morality system or anything like that so in theory there is no right or wrong answers but they do weight in on the story. The conversations are engaging and very well written so don't think you'll be bored listening to all the talking that happens in the game.GRAPHICS: The graphics are good but nowhere near as good as they are on the PC. On the PC, the environments are drop dead gorgeous, on the 360, not as much but still very good. The game recommends that you install the game on your system (that goes for both discs) to improve the graphics and load times and it does. If you don't do that, you'll be seeing almost constant texture pop in. I noted some frame rate slow down in a couple places in the game but for a game this long, it's an extremely minor issue. The character models look great and there is a lot of detail put into them and the creatures of this world. It is a very beautiful game.SOUND: Like I said before, this game comes with the soundtrack and it is very fitting. It's beautiful and epic at the same time with a medieval, Celtic feel.  The sound design is also very good. You can walk through towns and forests hearing all kinds of life all around you. The voice acting is really good. Even just average villagers are well voiced. Geralt's voice sounds kinda like a medieval Solid Snake. Most of the voices are English and other European accents however Triss and Dandelion (your bard friend) have American voices.. They're done well but they really stand out among the European voices. All the music and sounds perfectly compliment the world the game is set in.Overall this is one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time. It has a really good story (which is one of the most important things in an RPG in my eyes), interesting characters, a fun combat system once you get used to it, and plenty of quests. It's a long game but not impossibly long. Well worth the money for it. If you're an RPG or fantasy fan I highly suggest this game and even if you're not a big RPG gamer I suggest this game, it surprised me and I can't wait for The Witcher 3 which is currently in the works.OVERALL: 8.7/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

It is very entertaining and very informative. What a nicely done job of explaining everyone's role in Mortal Kombat.And the challenge tower is very addicting. I can seem to put the controller down.One downfall I would probably say is the Krypt. Its a bit hard to navigate since you can not look 360 degrees around you. I think it was a cool concept but it is just a bit too much. I saved up a ton of points so I could just go to the krypt and just buy everything in one shot but GEEZ!!! I wanted to unlock the fatalities first, the costumes second, the kombat codes 3rd, and then all the senseless concept art if I had anything to spare. But doing it in such an organized fashion meant I had to spend about 2-3 hours in the krypt.....in real human time!!! That's absurd!! (I had a map that I found online btw)I would say just save up about 200,000 + points and then just start unlocking everything without a map. You will spend a lot less time in the krypt doing so. Or just go there every now and then and grab a few things you'd like. I don't recommend doing it the way I did it.So to review...the combos rock! Xray attacks rock! The fatalities rock! The character line up rocks! The extra content rocks! challenge tower rocks! story mode...ROCKS!!!I highly highly recommend this game if you are into Mortal Kombat or fighting games.It definitely has enough to keep you busy which is great since the PSN network has been down since the day this game came out.

You see every detail in your Porshe, Mustang, or other racecar.I've been playing a lot of this and also Project Gotham Racing 3. Both have quite highly detailed car models, with a nice selection to choose from. NFSMW shines in the area of customization. Where PGR3 gives you a few colors to choose from, in this game you can go through a giant range of color choices. Then you can customize the vinyl, and tons of stickers and other options.You can go through a mission mode where you develop the storyline and learn the characters. You can also do time trial types of challenges, as well as quick races just to have some fun.The graphics in this game are REALLY nice. First, the car models are great - from the detail of the body to the interior and lights. Next, the characters are really well done, far better than just about any other XBox 360 game I've played so far. The face textures, especially, are quite smooth and life-like. The backgrounds are also quite nice. I really like the mountains in the background, with the forest running down the sides.The sounds are reasonably good, with the dialogue being OK. Some of it seems a little silly, from the cop deciding to key your car, and the girls acting like toys.What it really comes down to, though, is having fun street racing, and customizing and choosing new cars. This game obviously isn't realistic. If you slam your car into gas station trash cans at 140mph, your car comes to an immediate stop without any damage at all to the car or the trash cans. You can drive your car down through street light after street light, leaving a trail behind you. The game's about fun fantasy. You have fun driving all of the super-expensive cars you've always wished you could buy - or perhaps you take a car you own and \"test it out\" in ways your local cops wouldn't approve of.I do have to comment that some of the cars seem a little squirrley. I've owned Mustangs since I was 18, and have done a bit of high speed driving with them. I don't recall them spinning in circles quite as easily as in the game. Still, maybe the roads in the game are a bit slick :)Well recommended for car racing lovers who are into customizing and detailing their cars! I do have to say that this game lets you race only against 3 others online, where PGR3 lets you go in a field of 8. So it might be worth it for you to get both games, as each has a different area it is truly great in.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2005"}

I'm a college graduate with a large vocabulary, and I got 100% correct on the minigames the program gave me to determine my starting placement. It still put me at 20%, \"primary school graduate.\" I have to wonder what it would have called me if I hadn't gotten 100%!- The handwriting recognition is not perfect; the program has repeatedly confused my \"D\" for an \"M\" (and I have very clear handwriting).- As a result of the first \"con\" above, I find the game too easy. The words it is giving me include things like \"juxtapose,\" \"jurisdiction,\" and \"overawe\" -- there hasn't been a single unfamiliar word so far.I'm sure the game will give me increasingly difficult words, and that if I stuck with it for a few weeks I would start learning new words from it; but I don't know if I have the patience to keep playing until I get to that point.Overall, this would be a good game for children, if they would play it.

{"product_name":"B0002CHIWO","reviewerName":"RPG Fan","summary":"One of my new faves","reviewText":"I love this game and it is now ranked up there with FFX on my list of awesome RPGs.  I really love this game, it's as simple as that.  I recently bought a GCN solely for the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess that will be coming out soon and was just wandering the aisles looking for anything decent when I happened upon this bad boy.  Everything about Baten Kaitos is ingenious-- battle engine is awesome and intuitive, graphics are amazing, and storyline is incredible.  I'm a die hard RPG fan and have grown tired of the same hack and slash, cast magic, heal your party, etc... that's out there.  BK answers the call of breaking through the monotony via a card-based battle system and it works very well.  Leveling seems like less of a chore since every battle is literally different; each time you'll be dealt different cards to use.  The customization of each player's deck is also emjoyable for those who like card-based games.  The utility of time is a really cool aspect.  For example, if you hang on to some green bananas (an attack item at first.  You chuck 'em at the enemy) they'll ripen and become a healing item.  Hang on to them for too long and they become rotten and their status changes again.  Cards can also be combined to create new cards-- mix up some Light magic with a flower bud and you have a flower, etc...  The manner in which you collect money is the most creative system I've encountered and I really like it.  You aren't paid for every victory-- you have to take pictures of either the monsters you're fighting or your characters-- and you can only do so if you're dealt the \"camera\" card.  It's a really cool system in my opinion.  Leveling is also done a little differently.  You're rewarded with experience after each battle but it doesn't do any good unless you visit a priest and have him level you up.  All of the small things in this game that have been tweaked from the norm of the RPG genre is what really sets it apart and makes it different-- the reason why I like it so much.  Sound and voice acting don't apply to me since I'm deaf, I know that seems to be something that most people are complaing about but it doesn't affect me at all.  The intro cinematic is just breathtaking, the graphics are stunning, and the concept of the world being presented is clever.  Some more CG scenes would be nice but the graphics in the game are good enough to compensate.  Other than that I recommend this title to all RPG fans and GCN owners.  BK is not to be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000R0SR9E","description":"A supernatural horror action game with a story devised by the master mythmaker, novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker. Mingling the darkest elements of Barker's horror fiction and films, Jericho deals with the mysterious reappearance of a lost city in a remote desert. When a form of evil that goes right back to the dawn of days resurfaces from there, a Special Forces squad, trained in both conventional warfare and the arcane arts, is sent in. Their mission: hunt down and destroy the evil that lurks at the heart of the city before it destroys humanity.","reviewerName":"W. Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"Dissapointed","reviewText":"To be blunt I didn't like Jericho. The textures are bland, the voice acting is pretty bad, the sound of the guns are very tin-can sounding,the friendly AI consistenly die and walk right into exploding enemies ,your spending most of your time healing them,the lighting is pretty bad, the contrasted black-light areas are washed out . Its basically a choridor shooter ,although that's not necessarily a bad thing . There's also constant mini-cutsenes that break the action way too often and include some load time. The enemies do look good though very detailed ,but the screen is so washed out in darkness and obscurity (even with the given flash-light) that you don't get to apreciate how cool they really look. The highlight of the game is the cool looking 'casper' character which looks quite creepy and dark, its one plot element I do like, but on the gameplay side Jericho is a very basic ,choppy,corridoor shooter. The graphics never really dazzled me and the gameplay is unfinished. Your squadmates love to die and you'll spend the vast majority of your time healing them. Also the command feature in the game is a useless feature since the enemies only do one thing which is charge at you and your squad will not hold position if you walk too far, so there's no squad tactics involved like taking cover or flanking since the levels are mostly  linear, so the squad command options are pointless if the only thing the enemies does is walk-run or fly at you. I do like the secondary magic powers they're quite nice, but there split up between 6 people and not all given to one person  like Bioshock or The Darkness. So your constantly micro-managing your squad like a kid in a toy store. So the game basically plays like this,enemies charge you-you shoot them-and/or-use a magic power-your squad always runs right into the exploding enemies and die-you try to heal them-rinse & repeat, that's Jericho in a nutshell,while not necessarily a bad thing but the emphasis unfortunatly is on healing or you could just shoot  away at the enemies until the melee is over and your friendly AI will get up eventually without healing sorta like Gears does. It is nice to be able to switch between each member of the team, but given that your all standing together it makes little sense,except that you have to to use there given magic power, as some of the powers are better for certain enemie types, so your gameplay is riddled with healing dumb friendly AI because they'll never get the hint that the exploding enemies will kill them so they don't try to avoid the exploding enemies at all. This has nothing to do with tatics or player error its just game code and its inexcusable .There are some hi-lights of the game like some gory entrails and the typical gory blood stained walls and rooms full of human body parts, but allot of it is so washed out in bad contrasting dark/light areas that you'll be wishing you'd bought that $10,000 OLED LCD to enjoy it, but its more of a game programming error than TV inferiority . Im viewing it on 1080i 768p native LCDTV in which other games look spectacular on. As a game fan  of all FPS, Jericho just doesn't quite do it for me, there's too many negatives for me too enjoy this game. I returned my purchased copy for a refund, Id rather spend that money on  COD4. I myself don't always listen to the big named magazine/websites for their reviews of games, but in Jericho's instance, they were all spot-on right about this mediocre shooter.I expected a little more out of a Clive Barker game,like a deeper plot and better game-play mechanics but Jericho is just that 'mediocre'.

New players will be pleased.","reviewText":"Everything I liked about the original Thief game is here again for me to love all over.  Sneaking and the general feelings of control are just like the original.  I could basically sum this game up by saying that it plays and feels like the original, but looks like Deus Ex: Invisible War, but I think Thief: Deadly Shadows deserves a more thorough review.The graphics, while not he best and very dark, did several things while I played.  They set the mood, first of all, and very well. Everything looked dark, and medieval.  They had me gawking is awe at some of the areas because I loved the textures a lot.  They were VERY important to gameplay because it is up to you to find the dark areas behind pillars or in other shadows to hide from pretty much everyone as you go about your stealthy gaming.The sound is give and take.  I say that because the surround sound is well done and they use sound as a major part in the gameplay.  Guards and enemies hear you moving around or knocking into things.  The voice acting was, in my opinion, pretty good.  They brought some of the favorite actors back to play the guards, Garret, and others.  Nice touch.  The downside to the general sounds comes when you throw or drop objects.  They just don't clank around like they used to and in some cases can sound almost muffled even when you are right on top of an item that you drop on the floor.  In the original, I would cringe when I dropped a little pot or vase because of the ceramic \"ker-CLATTER\" that sounded from the object hitting the floor. This is minor and most everything like ambient sounds or voices sound quite nice and immersive.  City streets can be sometimes busy and you can hear people chattering.  The effect is subtle, but it draws you in. I have to say that the noisemaker arrows get the job done though!There isn't really too much music as much as there is just a general ambience about the game.  This is a good thing. Think of what Doom3 did with their music.  There is none.  They just have an ambience that draws you in from the absolute silence to the game without the rock soundtrack. Well done.The general gameplay is oh-so-sweet.  Without question, if you were a fan of the original, there is no possible way you will be disappointed.  It just feels the same and that is exactly what I hoped for.  Moving around, sneaking, the whole bit is spot on.  Nothing feels wrong or \"off\".  It's not just like the original, though.  They added plenty to do.  You have some nice new tools to use at your thieving disposal.  You have most of the old items, plus some very cool ones.  Some are mostly useless, but hilarious to use (see flasks of oil). Patrolling guards and other people that you might be wise to hide from will notice things when you open or close doors, put out torches or candles, take items from their general area, make noise, or show yourself.  The reactions on these people vary and there is tons of spoken dialog that is all unique for each area so listening to the speech in the game never gets old.  They will talk to or even fight each other sometimes.  It adds to the fun either way.If things get hot, the AI will retreat when fighting you and losing, run and get reinforcements, and search for you.  Unfortunately (or not) they generally have short attention spans and will give up if they cant find you after a while and just go back to their routine of walking around complaining about their sore feet, or wages, or late dinner.  Some enemies can wield magic and will use magic to enhance their allies in different ways or use it to blast you. I have even been healed and hastened by a friendly Hammerite priest when we where fighting some zombies.  (I stole his wand later, shhhh)I really hope they make another sequel as grand.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2004"}

Here below are the good points.Pros+Game Length 9.5 hours on normal+Cool weapons+Cool Lead Character+Cool Storyline+Doesnt get too serious, alot of jokes to make you laugh+Super Group put the game together+Made for people with good aimCons-A few small levels that are side scrolling (maybe 5 min a piece but are terrible, like a bad contra)-if you arent a good shooter, your not going to make it.All in all not a whole lot of bad. I happen to be good at shooting, so the small targets didnt bother me. Kinda made it fun to have a real task for once. If you are a gamer who doesnt play alot of shooters you might struggle. And all tho the side scrolling missions/levels are only a few and arent long they take away from the game. Otherwise I would have given this game 5 stars. If you like Resident evil, Silent Hill, Killer 7 than pick it up. Also, what was nice was it was an adult game. Violence, Nudity, Language, and more.

Only prob i had with the game is that i felt with the number of buttons the Vita has, all the moves felt crammed together when trying to execute them. The Vita could sure use 2 extra buttons so that it's easier to pull off moves.

The graphics as usual is photo realistic. The character animations are excellent. The character movements are realistic, too. The character movements are much better than that of Halo or even Gears of War. I have played both of those and I found Halo's to be to arcade-like stiff. Gears of War at least has cover movements but they are still not as realistic as Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3's. And I will go further to say that the character animation on Modern Warfare is much better than Black Ops. Black Ops' environment and character animation looks rather washed out and the movements are not as realistic. Infinity Ward, the originators of Modern Warfare outclasses Treyarch in all phases of the game. The only thing that Black Ops has over Modern Warfare are the zombies. I enjoyed playing the zombies but it can get really old really fast. I prefer to play with live players online. The zombies are pretty much predictable. They just come in swarms. Returning is the ability to save matches so that you can study your game play and other players' game play. These is a neat and very useful addition to the series. I also really like the ability to report cheaters when they turn up to try to ruin the fun. These jerks have nothing better to do with their time than to try to ruin the game for others by coming in with their hacked abilities. They must really be terrible that they have to resort to cheating. To Infinity Ward and Treyarch, I would like to make a request to add \"harassment\" or \"verbal abuse\" to the complaint button as they, too, ruin the game for others. To allow these jerks to verbally abuse other players incessantly is really unacceptable. An issue that is at the forefront right now is bullying. Given that many of the players are youths something should be done to show that bullying is not acceptable. Yes, this game is rated \"M\" but we all know that children do play Call of Duty. I have not played Black Ops II but will in the future. Right now I am still busy with Modern Warfare 3. And if you will, I have a match to go to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

I saved this review for a special something called the Wavebird Wireless controller for the Nintendo 'cube.This is by far my favorite controller, even now with such greats as the SixAxis and the Wii-mote, I still love the ol' Wavebird.This device is well manufactured, it's almost indestructible.  The 2.4 gHz technology is fantastic even today, having played with this controller almost exclusively for over four years it has never had a hiccup or any other sync issues.The Gamecube controller is probably the best of any generation of game controllers, I love it for the different shapes of the buttons.  In a pinch I always know which button I'm pressing, the Wii-mote is the next best thing, but for hard-core gaming it's not my favorite of favorites.  The competition controllers all use plain old round buttons that I always seem to hit the wrong button on when it's important.The battery life on this device is quite impressive.  Believe it or not in four years of gameplay I've only changed the batteries two to three times.The only complaint that most have about this controller is the lack of forced-feedback (tremor or rumble).  To tell you the truth, I've never liked that feature anyway, but many do.  I think that the omission of that feature is the reason for the unbelievable battery life and for me I would much rather have the extended battery life.  But, perhaps the big \"N\" should have made a tremor pack available for it for those who wish to have the feedback.Several key technical features make this controller superior to many of the competition:Two position R1 and R2 buttons allow you to zoom in on a target 50% or 100% if playing a shooter.Different shaped buttons lend themselves to better accuracy.Camera stick and Control stick don't \"Click in\" a feature that often times results in mistakes (at least for me).Simple key layout is easy to use and understand.Controller fits comfortably in your hands.All in all, this is a great controller.  If you look at the competition (MS and Sony), they have both incorporated wireless controllers into their new game machines.  I think the big \"N\" lead the way in this innovative field with a great controller called the  \"Wavebird Wireless\"Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2007"}

Paper Mario - The Thousand Year Door is one of those games. And best of all, this GameCube game plays perfectly on the Wii.Yes, the graphics are a little dated - but this is Mario after all. We expect Mario games to be cute with simple graphics. The paper-style atmosphere means that we can fold, spindle, and mutilate all to great effect. We have Mario, Princess Peach, and all our favorites roaming through the universe.This is an RPG, so there is a lot of character building going on. And a LOT of dialogue. Don't expect to race through jumping on mushrooms' heads. Instead, you talk to people, figure out what is going on, build up your stats, and learn combat techniques.That's not to say it's complicated. It's nicely set so that even younger kids will figure out what is going on. But thought is definitely involved. The gamer has to read, to absorb the story, and figure out the clues. Just where should they go next? What is the quest all about?If you're playing it on your Wii, you CANNOT use the standard Wiimote controller. Instead, you want to get a wireless GameCube controller. One part - a small box-like item - will plug into a port on the very top of your Wii unit. The other part is the controller that you use. This will have an A, B, X, and Y button set on the right, and a thumb-joystick on the left. You can find these in most stores, and it's absolutely necessary for your Wii to play this GameCube game. Also, it's good to have a GameCube memory card. That way you keep your GameCube games organized.I'm an adult and I enjoy this game, so it is well designed for all ages. There's enough story to keep you curious. That's not to say that it's all logical. Mario shows up and promptly hands his treasure map over to a stranger to look at. This college girl's ability is to \"tattle\" on people. And her way of rewarding strange men is to kiss them. Some of this is a bit questionable. But still, if you look past some of these stereotypes, the gameplay is fun, and that's a testament to how well these developers made the game so many years ago.Well recommended.I purchased Paper Mario - The Thousand Year Door with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

However, I'm a little disappointed with its execution.The game's flow is very similar to the promo ad that Amazon had running for this game which featured the game's creators.  During that promo, they showed a meeting and discussed the game's ultimate objective:  \"kicking a$! with the Force.\"Unfortunately, that's where the game fails because every fight with extras is mind-numbing in its monotony.  Gee, how should I defeat this stormtrooper?  Should I choke him?  Zap him with lightning?  Cut him down with my lightsaber?  Oooo, another door that I'm going to have to develop a Force blast to get through?  How about a vehicle that I can throw around like a rag doll?  It's good fun for about the 1st 5 minutes, but then every encounter that doesn't involve a major character or creature becomes a legal substitute for Ambien in its creativity.  Enemy AI is on the order of 1st generation DOOM-type games - i.e., run at and try to destroy you.  All the while, you can almost hear the droning litany of its creators through every encounter \"kicking a$! with the force...kicking a$! with the force....\"Major character encounters are more challenging, but lead to Dragon's Lair-esque (that dates me a little) moves that involve moving the Wii remote a certain way to defeat said major character.  If you mess up, you get knocked to the side and you have to laboriously start guessing your way through the sequence again.  Don't worry, though; if you die, then you get the pleasure of fighting that character again with full health with the enemy's own health diminished.  You'll get him...eventually!!!!On the plus side, the cut scenes and the storyline are intriguing.  Without giving too much away, you play a Sith who was Vader's apprentice between Episodes 3 and 4.  It's an interesting story with some interesting character development besides.It's fun to play only to get to the next cut scene, but the journey is on such a one-minded track (\"kicking a@s with the force!!!!\") that it's almost not worth it.I would suggest purchasing the game when it's $29.99 or less.  The full, beginning retail value of this game is not worth it.  Gone are the days when the next installment of Dark Forces, Jedi Knight, X-Wing, and TIE Fighter were reasons for excitement.

Its fun, especially Kai's parts with the SixAxis controller. I did however encounter one problem with this gem. When I hooked up my optical sound system, the game installed some patches. After it did that in some parts of the game the frame rate would drop horribly! (The game froze once) The FR drop only happend 5 times. Maybe a Firmware update would solve it?Enough of that tho. This game is a must have. There is only one thing stopping it from getting a 5 Star....LENGTH!

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"msnola","summary":"disappointment","reviewText":"I dislike this game... the only good level is the storming the beach level...very intense...but after i played call of duty..it left me wishing call of duty made a storming the beacxh level...can u imagen?..call of duty is a far superior wwII game..this is way too linear..and in war u dont fight all by ur lonesome...ur surronded by men a lot..this game is too linear..follow the path shoot shoot..and it would be ok...but i found myself getting incredibly frustrated.. i get frustrated with a lot of games but if it frustrates to tyhe point where i just say \"screw it\" and sell it...its bad..im not a great gamer...i suck at games, ill admit...but still","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2005"}

This new game, however, is just no fun. It's gritty and bloody and full of bad game design that makes it annoying to play. The constant sliding and falling, for example: I guess the designers think constantly falling off of something is fun, but I got bored with the repetition. And then there is the sliding, where it's impossible to avoid most obstacles because the camera is set so low that you can't even see them. I just moved randomly from side to side, hoping for the best. This could've been remedied by a higher camera, but what do I know? I'm not a game designer. I just attempt to play these difficult games.And then there are the generic bullet fodder. I got tired of shooting morons. I wanted to raid some tombs!

It combined intense First Person Shooter with an involving mission oriented story arc that kept you glued to your chair and the monitor. The multiplayer aspects were excellent as well with varying mission types a healthy mod community and fun gameplay.Now we have Call of Duty II. Does it live up to its predecessor? You betcha. Not only have the graphics improved and oddly enough I thought gameplay graphics were better than the intro movie, but the AI and missions have intensified for the Single Player campaign. There wasn't too much vehicle interaction in the game with the exception of riding in a Lorry and driving a Crusader tank in North Africa. However, by the time I had done two missions in a Crusader tank I was ready to get out..hehe.The Single Player campaigns will take up a bit of your time depending on the difficulty you set it on. Easy setting is a joke and you really have to try to get killed and as you ramp up you have to be very careful and make use of available cover and grenades. Grenades are much more common in Call of Duty 2 and very very useful. On the harder settings those bullets really start to hurt so tossing smoke and fragmentation grenades around is really the only way to go. Sticking your head up above cover will get you dead in a heartbeat on the harder difficulty settings.Multiplay for Call of Duty II has a very healthy community of gamers. A plethora of servers out there with a variety of different games - Capture the Flag (My favorite), Search and Destroy, Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, etc.Overall this is a great game if you are a fan of First Person Shooters or liked the movie Saving Private Ryan or the HBO Mini-series Band of Brothers.

{"product_name":"B00B59L9T6","description":"The fear that was originally brought to players in Resident Evil Revelations on the Nintendo 3DS system returns redefined for home consoles complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. Furthermore, the home console version will deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode and improvements to Raid Mode such as new weapons, skill sets and the opportunity to play as Hunk and other characters from the series. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat.  The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Back to Survival Horror","reviewText":"I was very happy when I heard that they have made a version of this game for PS3/360 as some people claim that it is even better than Resident Evil 6. Therefore I got this game the day it came out. After finishing the story on the normal mode and doing a few raid missions here is how I feel.******************************Pros**************************************- Survival horror + action gameplay: I would say Resident Evil 6 is about 20% survival horror and rest action but this game is about 70% survival horror and rest action. I am really happy that Capcom decided to make a survival horror in this day and age after moving pretty much completely away from it. As for me, since I like both survival horror and action gameplays, I loved this game.-Awesome bosses and decent enemies: This is what I liked the most about this game. When I finished this game about 50%, I was worried because I didn't encounter many bosses but afterwards most of the chapters rewarded me with pretty awesome bosses. I especially liked last two boss fights and a boss in the middle of the game (don't want to ruin the surprise). The enemy quality in this game was decent, but personally I like RE6 enemies much better.- Creepy resident evil 1 like setting: This game takes place (for the most part) on an abandoned ship. I loved how they have designed the ship. A good mixture of dark, creepy, isolated and yet elegant and authentic. It is supposed to be a luxury ship so the parts of the ship are great looking. Had fun exploring each and every corner of the ship. Bravo to the level designers and the art team.-The story and story length: Considering this game first came out on 3DS, the quality of the story and the length of the campaign are quite impressive. Since I explored each and every corner of every level, it took me about 15 hr to finish this game. I was wondering if this game was worth the release day price, but now after experiencing the story and campaign,  I don't regret spending that money.-Improved graphics: I am happy that this game came out on PS3/360. The fact that you can play it on a handheld (3DS) is great but the 3DS graphics don't do justice to this game. Now this game still doesn't look as great as say Resident Evil 5 or 6, but still looks pretty decent now that it is remastered in HD.-Upgradable/hidden weapons/items: You will have to find/unlock weapons. If you just try to rush through the campaign you will miss out on many of them. Also you can find the upgrades for the weapons and upgrade them.  This adds exploration and experimentation aspect to the game. Liked it.-Raid mode and online competition: Some extra missions you can do once you are done with the campaign. Good to pass some time and adds longevity to the experience. Better have it than not.******************************Cons**************************************- Backtracking: This is somewhat annoying aspect of the game. You will be backtracking quite a bit in the game. 60% of the time something will be different when you backtrack (finding new weapons/items) but 40%, a lot of things will be the same. They could have definitely included some novel enemies (or better like Dark Souls some hidden bosses).-melee attacks: Some people hated RE6 for its melee attacks. I loved RE6 for its melee. This game is the opposite. There are melee attacks but they are not as easy to pull as RE4, 5 and 6.  Definitely like RE6 better.******************************Conclusion**************************************RE6 or RE: Revelations? Well I loved both games. If you want more survival horror type of experience play Revelations, if you want more action and Zombie brain bashing play Resident Evil 6. In short, I thought this game was well worth the money I spent, especially considering I didn't played the 3DS version. A must buy for those who miss old Resident Evil games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}

I thought SEGA was trying something new, but in actuality, it might have been the beginning of SEGA screwing up.Shadow the Hedgehog as a game wasn't bad but it wasn't good as I remember it when replaying it.Story: The story takes place BEFORE Sonic Battle (a lot of people seem to forget this but this explains why Shadow is so friendly toward Rogue given that he's not too fond of her in Sonic Heroes) and after Sonic Heroes. The Black Arms (an alien race) has invaded earth and is trying to destroy it with their leader Black Doom. Shadow who is suffering from amnesia and trying to recall the events of Space Colony ARK does not want to get involved until Black Doom approaches him. Its then does Shadow know he needs all 7 Chaos Emeralds to get what he wants.Gameplay: This is where the game branches off. Shadow can decide who to help out. He can be a hero, villain or neutral the entire way with over 300 different endings (not really, but the guide book lists them as such). There are mainly 10 endings and you have to get them all to get the true ending (make all the 10 endings moot anyway) and ironically all the endings are based on alinements (chaotic, lawful and neutral with good, neutral and evil). The gameplay isn't that bad honestly. You're not playing as Sonic so the game shouldn't be going so fast, but because the game focused more on gunplay, it slowed the game up. The issue with the gun is that you might kill people you don't want to kill (like if you're playing hero, you might accidentally shoot them and then the heroes will call you out on your action). When you kill the Black Arms, the blue gauge fills up and you can use chaos control that skip large portions of the stage (perfect for neutral missions or missions in general where you have to to race/catch up to something). Killing humans means you fill up the red bar and you can use chaos blast to do critical damage to enemies and blow them away (mainly used for bosses). Overall, there isn't that much depth in the game. You can also drive vehicles but there's no point honestly when Shadow runs faster than the vehicle.Characters: No matter what people say about Shadow being emo, this is the game that actually resolves his character arc once and for her. From this point on, he's no longer the brooding emo about his past and moves toward the future. Alas, his brooding gets annoying in the game and depending on the ending, Shadow remembers things differently depending on his alignment (despite the fact the hero alignment is the one that is closest to canon).Now people complained about the cursing to. The cursing is out of place in some situation but at the same time, you get the funniest lines in the entire franchise. \"Where's that DAMN 4th Chaos Emerald?!\" Ironically, this swearing is no different from the new DmC and the whole \"F*** YOU!\" being shouted over and over again but I can clearly tell swearing like this is aimed toward little kids. It worked for me as a kid. :DI think the final issue was the voice acting. This is the first game where 4Kids took over the dubbing completely from the original voice actors after Dr. Eggman's original voice actor died...so basically this is where most of the voices started becoming crap until Sonic Colors where they changed it again (but in Sonic Generation, Amy's voice is horrible and Shadow's voice doesn't match. X_X)My final verdict is the game is so bad (or corny) that it's good. The gameplay is average (not glitchy like 2006) but a huge step down from the previous Sonic games. We get the most memes from this game (stated above and also \"FIND THE COMPUTER ROOM!\" and \"YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THE MORE THE MERRIER!\" and Shadow's karate chop). Pick the game up if you're bored and while I had fun, many people will disagree which is why the game gets an average score (but the fun score is high for me).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2013"}

However, not being one to fork over full price for a title, I waited for the inevitable price drop.The game is awesome.  Truly worthy of its lineage.  The fighting has improved, as have the graphics and sound.  The major downside (for me) is the PS2 'exclusive character'.  While Xbox has Spawn and the Cube has Link, we get geriatric Heihachi.  Not being much of a Tekken fan, I wasn't thrilled.  At least everyone gets the new McFarlane character, Necrid.  Being a &quot;Rock&quot; fan from the original outing on Playstation, I do like the larger, more powerful characters.The arcade mode is great.  Going head to head is also quite a lot of fun.  And the Edge Master mode really adds a lot of depth.  Now there are those who prefer the latest Virtua Fighter or Tekken games.

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

Alright lets get to it.  First off, it was a nice idea.  Finally a game that focused on loving and caring, without being sexual, and helping your fellow man.  However I think that this is all they focused on in production.  The game, and this is sad for a Final Fantasy, is bad.  I'm sorry but it reeks.  SquareSoft is running out of orginal ideas and it is showing.  Although, the ideas were innovative.  Enemies that level up with your characters.  Never will your characters be gods over an enemy.  Unless it's a boss.  For some odd reason boss levels are limited.  So a player can beef up their characters all they want and then beat the messout of the boss without worry.  The Guardian Forces, while still a nice idea, were poorly planned.  A GF is like a Pokemon (in a sick sadistic way).  It gains levels with your character and through it your character can gain abilities.  Problem is GFs can quickly make their 'host' gods very quickly.  At level 15 my main character's strength was through the roof because not only did he have Ifirt equipped but all his strength increases too.  He could cut down enemies in one blow!  While that's nice it takes away from the difficulty of the game.  The battle system is a nightmare too.  If I have to push buttons to get more damage done, then why don't you just program the game to register the extra damage.  Granted this only applies to Squall but it gets very annoying to have to mash buttons to get a character's strength up.  I hated it in Super Mario RPG and I hate it in this game.  The GF spells have to be pumped up if you want it to do any serious damage.  What happened to watching the nice animations and appreciating the work of the artists who designed them.  The story line is my next pet peeve.  The strength of an RPG comes from the story not the gameplay.  The story in this game is shoddy.  Picture a writer with the exact opposite abilities of John Grisham or Micheal Crichton.  It is that bad.  Not only do you have to mash buttons in the battles but you have to mash buttons to get past the annoying long dialouge exchanges (that seem to be written by a pre-schooler with help from their friends).  It is worse than Parasite Eve 2's story.  At least they tried.  I'm done with my tirade now.  You want the truth, this game is not worth [price], it isn't even worth the rental.  Go to a friend who owns this poor excuse for a game and play it there or borrow it.  For those who saw the Charlie's Angels movie.

Sure it was short (only 5 levels...6 if you include the turtoil at the start), plus it leaves the door open for sequel...ok I know the 2nd is out and the 3rd will too soon. But there is nothing wrong with the game. Its challenging enough to please anyone. The graphics are sick..as too are the weapons. I like so many had fun with the Lancer's chainsaw. Fire from a distance or slice them. I loved the hide and seek gameplay.The game is like the title says...EPIC!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B005B8DRVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Carlos E. Coto","summary":"Amazing work","reviewText":"This review is for both the gameplay and the collectors editions content.Do note I got it before release but haven't used the 30 days nor anything the package contains.When you open the box, you will see the statue right in the middle inside another box. On your left side of the box where the republic emblem lies, you will see the soundtrack disc as well as the the journal of master gnost dural. On the sith side or empire emblem you will see the map as well as the steelcase.It is by far the best steelcase I own and seen. Inside you will see 3 install discs as well as the product registration code and on its back the key commands, which is neat to have. You will also get another piece of paper with a discount for gentlegiant.comThe random code generator lies in front of the statue. For the statue itself I will not open as I like keeping some statues, depending how they are shipped, within the NRFB, Never removed from box. But when you open the box itself, you see the statue completely sealed by foam material with tape on the top and sides, and on the top of the foam itself, there is a card of darth malgus.Overall this is the best collectors edition I've seen and well worth its price. The steelcase itself has the emblems of the sith and the republic, one on each side with them popping out. As well as the Star Wars The Old republic popping out as well.The gameplay itself. I have played the early access only as we are still in this period and the gameplay is well worth it. The characters are all voiced acted so there is no moment of silence, however you cannot skip conversations. Not from what I've seen at least. Currently I'm playing in the Kaas server and in the jung ma server. Kaas for the jedi and Jung Ma for the sith. Jung Ma gets filled up quickly and there is a wait time sometimes between 10 mins to 40. The game plays like a lot of other mmos, but the voice acting and the beautiful environments can lose yourself within the story. From what I've seen, and playing with a friend of mine, both our stories never intertwine with the main story. You can play as a jedi counsular but I haven't seen a story part that is the same as a jedi knight. Same goes for different classes as there are green shields to let you pass, and red shields that forbid you to enter the realm. It also seems that the environment changes if your aiding someone else in an area but with a different character. Example, as a jedi counsular I entered a cave and it was totally different when I entered it again to help my friend whose a jedi knight do a different quest in the same cave. These styles of playing allow the game to feel new, regardless if you have played with a certain character and then decided to start anew with a different skill from the same class.Overall from what I've seen I enjoy this game a lot and keeps me coming back for more. The different playstyles are the best I've seen as I played different MMO's and some fall short of this and the classes repeat a lot of the same quests, even within new levels. Giving me different quests for my main character allows me to feel the game is fresh. Do note I'm level 6 on the jedi counsular and level 7 on my sith. I will keep you updated on how the game changes and the similarties of the characters within the same classes.For now the gameplay won't get a review score, since I haven't played enough to consider it, but the collectors gets a 5/5Updates will be added as I keep playing. Thanks for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"D","summary":"One of the Best Mario games","reviewText":"Super Mario 3d World is a great addition to the Mario Franchise. While 90% of Mario games are excellent this one is defiantly part of that percent. This game is basically a sequel to Super Mario 3d land on the 3ds with a little inspiration from super mario bros 2 on the nes. However even though 3d land was a great game I wouldn't consider it the greatest Mario game of all time but this on on the other hand takes what was best about that one times it by 10 and adds some new stuff as well. Theres also 3 green stars on each level plus 1 green star on bonus levels which kinda give it a super mario 64/galaxy feel later on in the game before you get to the final boss.Of coarse the cat suit is the biggest thing new in this game. With it you are able to scratch or dive bomb enemys (just like a cat) and climb walls to a certain extent. Theirs even a few levels where in order to get the green stars you will probably need the suit but its not required to get threw the levels. I would say it is the best new powerup in Mario games since the Raccoon suit in Mario 3. Speaking of which that suit actually returns but it does not fly it kinda works like 3d land and it only appears a few times. The Fire flower also returns and theres also a ice skating shoe along with a few other powerups I believe.Also new with this game is that there is 4 character multiplayer in it. Unlike the New Super Mario Bros. series player 3 and 4 are not 2 different colored toads instead player 3 actually plays as peach while player 4 plays as toad. Also Luigi is of coarse player 2 while Mario is number 1. If your playing single player you can choose which character you want to play at the start of each level. The multiplayer is a huge improvement over New super mario bros wii/U its still chaotic but considering the game is 3d theres a lot more room for each player in this one.The levels are done very well as usual from nintendo. Even though the levels in 3d land were good This one amps up everything and throws new stuff at you just about every other level. My only problem with the game is the difficulty. While getting the green stars are very challenging and feel rewarding I found the main levels to be really easy and I blasted my way threw them in a day or 2, but don't let that hold you from buying the game theres plenty of challenges for the skilled mario player. The special worlds in this one are up there with the originals in terms of difficulty even a few of the last levels are about as hard as the ones in the lost levels (maybe not quite as much but still hard) Anyway if you have a wii u this is one of the first must own games with many more to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"J.S. Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"A Disappointing Successor to GTA: San Andreas","reviewText":"First of all, understand that novels could be written about almost any Grand Theft Auto game.Also, understand that this particular author has been playing Grand Theft Auto since it was a top-down, 2-dimensional game on Pentium 100mhz systems.  The Playstation 1 was still the hottest gaming system in existence, and GTA was well beyond its capabilities.GTA:San Andreas was simply a revolutionary game.  It provided a massive playing field with no load times - two firsts for the GTA series.  It also incorporated a wonderful handful of \"extracurricular activities\" that provided nothing whatsoever to the requirements of the game, but still gave players the opportunity for hours of additional entertainment.  I'm referring to such things as flying aircraft (even the hidden jumbo-sized jet,) customizing cars, managing large-volume garages, collecting money from acquired businesses, etc.  I played San Andreas for hours after beating it.Most - if not all - of this content has been abandoned in this much-hyped Grand Theft Auto IV.  Note that I have not yet completed the game, but in just my first two hours of game play realized that GTA had in many ways gone back to the basics.  Yes, the visuals are amazing.  I am constantly impressed by the bullet holes that not only show up, but remain on the vehicles.  Just recently I noticed that each vehicle has an internal dome light.  Aerial views of the city (only available via helicopter as all jets and planes have been reverted back to the \"look but don't touch\" forms of pre-San Andreas games) are simply astounding.But I think many gamers will agree that looks aren't everything.  Cars are incredibly difficult to drive - yes they handle much like the big, heavy cars we drive today.  They tend to understeer when braking, and oversteer when attempting high-speed, emergency-brake maneuvers.  Driving at high speeds has become a rather nerve-wracking ordeal, especially when being chased.  The most annoying inclusion is that of the cell phone - cleverly used to enhance core missions within the game, but otherwise a constant annoyance as other, non-player characters are constantly asking your character out on play dates.  Sorry - that's why I quit playing \"The Sims.\"The missions - in my opinion - are rather simplistic.  More annoyingly, they act as a seemingly unending tutorial as every mission teaches you a new skill (usually just a new button sequence) that then you seem to never use again.GTA IV has returned to the days of nearly-linear, one-after-another, non creative missions with a few added \"modernizations\" like the afore-mentioned cell phones, internet cafes and toll booths (yes, I know - I'm not sure what they were thinking with that one, either.)  Gone is the stuff that made Gran Theft Auto fun, unique, and inventive.  My only hope is that they were simply testing the graphical limits of the newest generation in gaming consoles, and have much more up their sleeves for another version.In a quick sidebar, the multiplayer aspects of GTA IV are much better than I expected.  I have already logged many hours simply romping around the city with friends and even family.  I won't hesitate to say that I am simply impressed with what they have managed to do with the [real] internet - this is what we've been missing for a very, very long time.  Does it save GTA IV?  Quite possibly.  Does it give you enough incentive to finish the game?  Not sure yet.To put things to a close, Grand Theft Auto IV is a beautiful game with still a lot to do.  But GTA has been better, and in the end I can't help but feel dissapointed.I also wish to offer my dissatisfaction to the online game-reviewing sites who have obviously offered stellar, \"perfect\" scores to an obviously undeserving game in the interest of extra income through promotions, advertisement and industrial \"butt kissing.\"  Shame on you all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2008"}

I decided to buy the less expensive controller that was \"designed\" for the Xbox 360 and not the one that is marketed for Windows. I also did not want to go wireless because I have heard numerous problems with the wireless interfering with other wireless devices and because it eats through batteries. So if you can live with the long cord on your desk, go with the wired controller.The controller worked right out of the box with Vista 32-bit and 64-bit SP2. I didn't have to install the Microsoft software, but I decided to do so later on. I haven't had any problems using the controller while playing Devil May Cry 4. The analog sticks didn't move around by themselves and the vibration/rumble feedback works as advertised.My only complaint is that it took some getting used to because I was more accustomed to the DualShock PS1/PS2 controller. That controller made a bit more sense in terms of the stick layout. The Xbox controller still has the same number of buttons but moves the left stick to the upper left corner. For many of the combo moves in DMC4, I had to hold the RB and Y buttons, which easily cramped out my fingers. The alternative was to use my keyboard and that would be a feat by itself.Overall, the Xbox 360 controller is an excellent gaming interface for the PC but if DualShock3 had better support on the PC and cost half the price, I'd have to give the DS3 controller a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2009"}

C. Orr","summary":"Expensive Thrills and Cheap Tricks","reviewText":"\"Ninja Gaiden 2\" probably will not be remembered very fondly.  A game blighted by terrible camera, cheap difficulty-raising tricks, and a game engine generally hailing from the previous generation of consoles, NG2 nevertheless has enough of the magic dust of its XBOX predecessor to make it a fully worthwhile purchase.Everything about \"Ninja Gaiden 2\" is intimidating.  From the sturm und drang Tecmo video intro sequence to the final boss fight, the game retains the fearsome seriousness and difficulty of 2004's \"Ninja Gaiden\". That game was possibly the greatest action adventure of the 3D era.  To attain success, \"Ninja Gaiden 2\" has to follow that and add the requisite gloss of current-gen gaming, whilst fixing the original's annoying camera and tweaking the controller-damaging difficulty level.  In this regard, NG2 is a failure: the graphics are often bland and barren, the camera sits too close to the player character, and the admittedly lessened difficulty is soured in many places by cheap hikes in difficulty which the player cannot possibly avoid.However, there is a big \"but\".  The gameplay is as thrilling as NG, as beautifully detailed and rewarding as the rest of the game elements are shoddy and perplexing.  While the sequel incorporates close-up Obliteration moves to kill wounded enemies and a regenerating health-bar (a nod to making the game more accessible), it is still fundamentally the same game engine as the original...but more.  More blood, more fighting, more all-round violence.The point is that the wonderfully fluid and responsive controls actually make the gamer feel in control of a master ninja. It makes you feel proud to have accomplished a tough boss fight or to have countered an enemy attack.  This element alone makes this charismatic game worth paying serious attention to.  And, having played such cutscene-heavy games as Metal Gear Solid 4 recently, NG2's non-stop action shines particularly brightly for me; the game represents a big gold star in favour of action gaming.  Perhaps having realised this, Tecmo have gutted out the often tedious and obtuse puzzles from Ninja Gaiden in favour of added enemies.To be clear, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a deeply flawed videogame.  There are plenty of elements to the game which are not really good enough.  In keeping with Team NINJA's Mount Fuji logo, the game is either peaks or troughs.. The peaks are fantastic, and the troughs are \"fantastic\", too.  The camera, it must be stressed, is awful, locking up terribly especially in tight corridors and on flights of stairs.  Graphically, the game has bland backgrounds, although the detailed character animations make up for this in large part.  The story is the usual tosh about armageddon that game developers so love, with demons and devils spewing terrible dialogue -just ignore them.  But Ninja Gaiden 2 has the magical charisma of a game which just knows it is special, that can treat you badly because it knows you will come crawling back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr. Kirk J. Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"A treat for the eyes but much more as well","reviewText":"Too many sandbox games are bad for your health - probably. At one time they were new to the industry, an exciting and new formula in the first days of GTA, the formula of which has seeped into the ingredients of today&#8217;s gaming blockbusters. This broke barriers in terms of how restricted video games were with their &#8220;levels&#8221; and sequential structure. Around the mid-2000&#8217;s, sandbox was no longer intriguing, and had the potential to bore players to death by permitting aimless wandering with no direction of the character or storyline.Far Cry 2 actually had many gamers highly annoyed at some of its features, which are no longer an issue. The world actually feels like its breathing, pumping blood around its tropical veins &#8211; whereas the former was a body on the brink of death. A huge part of the atmosphere stems from the addition of animals and their AI, which is at its best convincing not only as to suspend disbelief but also to occupy the player during the many treks over the map. Hunting animals allows materials to be created to carry more ammo or objects. Leaves can also be combined from plants which enhance the players ability for a short while (more specifically, by injecting syringes into your veins). The player can paraglide off mountains which overlook harsh seas while the sun sets in the distance. Crops can be set on fire and the terrain burns to ashes. It&#8217;s all atmospheric, engrossing stuff.The storyline is not the best, but perfectly acceptable. As a twenty-something male, you go on holiday with a bunch of almost-alcoholic friends who end up being kidnapped by modern-day Pirates Of The Caribbean enthusiasts. Escaping their grasp, the campaign consists of finding your friends who are located somewhere within the two large islands. Your character goes from being nothing to a full-force fighting machine by the end with the aid of an XP system which allows perks to be activated to change how the game plays. The game is addictive though, and allows you to gain all the perks before long. Even with all the perks and upgrades, the difficulty level never promotes you to a god, which is important as to make the game sustain its challenges.As expected, the campaign has several different mission types, which for a sandbox game didn&#8217;t seem unreasonable or predictable in any shape or form. The missions are completely relevant to the storyline which chugs along nicely. It&#8217;s also hugely eventful without reverting to &#8220;EXPlOsIoNS!!!&#8221; Drugs play a part of the game and allow the player to hallucinate in some cut-scenes, and some playable areas too &#8211; this is intriguing and improves the pacing of the story from stark seriousness to the plain weird and exciting.Outposts are back in Far Cry 3, and play heavy relevance to ranking up of your character, as without performing them using a certain method, new abilities can&#8217;t be unlocked. Stealth is encouraged, although definitely harder to perfect than using the guns blazing approach. Enemies can be marked by sighting them with your camera, at which point you can view them through walls. They can be influenced by throwing rocks, where they can be silently melee killed&#8211; although doing this anywhere near conscious enemies fails as their bodies can&#8217;t be disposed of once they fall. Alarms can be called unless you cleverly disable them first which ensues in havoc. Once you unlock silenced weapons, stealth does become easier but many players will choose to take the messy route at least after the stealth perks are unlocked.The selection of weapons is impressive. New guns can be unlocked by collecting &#8220;hidden&#8221; items such as Relics and Letters Of The Lost scattered around the map. That this is completely optional does provide rewards for players who wish to experience all of the game. Achievements are perfectly laid out and players are enticed into completing all the activities by experiencing all the optional features. There are hunting quests, hitman quests, as well as other trials that break up the main story.Visually, the graphics are something else, definitely the best we have seen this generation. Very reminiscent of 2007&#8217;s Crysis. This was a game which tested PC&#8217;s to their limit and honestly &#8211; the first title I&#8217;ve ever played where the graphics completely made the game. FC3 does this also with sights which can and will make your jaw drop over its stunning beauty. It&#8217;s expertly done, and makes the game great to look at all times. How FC3 does this with minimal load times and slow down, is incredible. The fetching landscape consists of tropical terrain, with a classic colour pallet - lush green, sky blue and sandy yellow. It&#8217;s definitely nice to look at not just for this but the fact the textures are highly detailed and the effects are fetching.The campaign lasted me a good twenty hours, which is rare nowadays &#8211; I even rushed through several parts to grab some achievements. To complete all the side-quests and extra activities (which are optional), you could probably squeeze a good thirty-five hours out of Far Cry 3.Overall, this is a title which has been overlooked by many, but captivated me with a surprisingly fresh campaign, incredible graphics and addictive XP system which consumed many of my hours. Well worth a buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

I'd barely touched the main quest, spending my time exploring and doing side quests.  By that time I reached the cap, my character could kill just about any enemy in one go of VATS, so there was really no combat challenge.  And with no combat challenge, there's no longer any reason to collect ammo or weapons.  I could attempt to change my character's strengths, but without further level progression, I'd never get any better.I can understand why Bethesda put a cap in the game, but the problem is it comes far too early for a game with this scope.  I was having a blast exploring new locations, but in sixty hours, I'd searched only half the map.  Sure, there are still locations to discover, but I don't feel the same motivation - most of them look the same, anyway.  After all, levelling up and gaining new abilities is the focus of RPGs, and the remainder of Fallout's gameplay isn't quite good enough to make up for the loss of character development.Can I still follow the main quest?  Sure, but the game's narrative isn't top quality either; not enough to keep me going, anyway.  During my sixty hours, the joy came from gaining experience and increasing my stats.  With this removed, I no longer have the push to see things through.That's not to say I didn't love what I played.  The open-ended structure is phenomenal.  During the first 20-odd hours, I was ready to christen Fallout 3 as the best game I'd ever played.  Unfortunately, now that I'm unable to continue developing my character, the magic is gone.  I'm probably done playing, despite not being close to finishing.  Yes, there's the morality system, but the impact on the overall picture is negligible, and yes, there are skill books to collect, but they also won't make a major difference now either.  In addition, the world isn't quite versatile enough to support statless wandering.I do certainly recommend Fallout 3.  I paid full price and got my money's worth (about $1 an hour - better than most games these days!).  However, I think it's important to realize that the experience may peak before you've finished.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Good game for an ordinary shooter","reviewText":"Back in late 2006, the Playstation 3 launched a year after the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii and it was met with a share bit of indifference. First there was the price at 599, then there was the launch titles which were good but there wasn't that one Halo or Mario 64 that said \"THIS is why you're spending all that money so you can play \". Turns out the PS3 is actually a quite serviceable game console and one of the more premier titles that was released at the time of launch was \"Resistance: Fall of Man\", a WWII shooter with an intriguing premise brought to you by the studio who made \"Ratchet and Clank\". How's the game? Good but not completely excellent but does its job admirably.Story: It's 1951 and World War II never happened. Rather a different kind of force raged through Europe; that of the Chimera, an alien (or genetic creation? I don't know )race that conquered Russia and Europe incredibly quickly and sets their sights on England. But the Americans, like the real World War II, shows up later and among the soldiers is Nathan Hale whose missions will take him deep into Chimeran territory to hopefully wipe them out.Graphics: Resistance in terms of framerate is incredibly smooth with barely any problems in terms of slowdown, jitteryness or screen tearing and such which is quite a feat considering the battleground can be quite chaotic. Other areas however are a bit hit-or-miss with up close textures looking a bit bland while things far away look pretty remarkable and some cool \"sci-fi spaceship\" designs near the end of the level. The detail on the Chimera themselves as well look quite good and the variety is also welcome but as a launch title that shows the power of the PS3, this doesn't have the wow factor of Tools of Destruction has.Sound/Music: Like a lot of WWII shooters, heavy on the military style percussion, trumpet and big epic flavors during the bigger firefights. Though you might get sick of the small music interlude when you die, especially in later levels. As for voice acting, the main draw is the VA for Rachel Parker who acts as a narrator and she's very good at bringing you in to the action rather than just a plain old \"storyteller\" during cutscenes. Nathan Hale probably has more lines of dialogue than Insomniac has games however which makes him a strange hero, bad*** enough but not much of a character.Gameplay: The meat of this is an FPS and there's not much else to it then that. You have your squad members occasionally with you (who die too frequently and too quickly), you alone against a legion of troops, vehicle sections where you command a tank, a jeep and a really cool vehicle later on as well as guns and grenades but Resistance mainly does one thing differently and that's regarding your arsenal. Instead of being limited to 2 guns, the game offers a weapon wheel where all the weapons you found will stay with you till the end of the game and though some incredulous thinking kind of makes it funny (a guy can fit a sniper rifle, missile launcher, and at least 7 other guns in his pocket? Hm.) it does add some good incentive to experiment. Snipe some dudes from afar, lay down explosive goo as traps, and more, having a full inventory to choose from helps you with any situation as opposed to the sequel where the 2-weapon-only scheme made you go \"do I bring this or that one?\"Like the Ratchet and Clank games, Insomniac loves to brainstorm really messed up weapons. Each weapon has an alternate fire which is specific to that gun. Your typical plasma gun Bullseye can \"tag\" an enemy so that all gunfire will zero in on that dude specifically or the Augur which can fire through walls but also set up a bulletproof shield temporarily. My favorite though is the Fareye which can slow down time so you can shoot enemy heads more accurately. This ingenuity even goes down to the grenades which adds 2 types other than the traditional frag: the hedgehog which fires a large group of spikes to impale enemies and the air-fuel grenade which can create a flammable vapor which incinerates nearby enemies. It gives a bit more interest than just simply \"oh hey look, another assault rifle type, whoopee\".However, I do have a couple of complaints. The control scheme is a little funky and I had to switch shoulder buttons around to make it more comfortable but my least favorite thing is having your aim be the right analog which like Killzone 2 never feels as comfortable as using the Left Trigger buttons and it's somewhat disorienting to reload during a zoom in since it goes back to a zoom-in when you maybe just want to return to normal view and more than once I died because I couldn't get out of a zoom look quickly enough. And like Resistance 2, it's a \"learn by death\" game where the more you play, the more you figure out your strategies by what NOT to do such as blindly going in quickly or not paying attention to one key area. And since enemies are incredibly good shots, this makes it a pain when 4 or 5 get the surprise on you and even headshots don't down them immediately so it makes managing the battlefield stressful.Oop, almost forgot multiplayer. Up to 40 players with your standard Deathmatch and Team DM, Capture the Flag and Bombing variances are here but the battles are so frantic that it's like a huge playground where everyone's in the thick of it. One complaint that I have about the equally-fun Killzone 2 online component is that the maps start you at one end while enemies spawn at the other and you end up meeting in the middle. But since spawn points are within a gigantic square as it were, you have to be on your toes a lot more since you can spawn a corner away from 3 dudes aching for some kills. And best part of all? No noticeable lag whatsoever and haven't experienced one disconnect. While I wish the co-op was online as well as with the single player campaign rather than a separate file, the online in this game is quite a blast.Resistance: Fall of Man in terms of a story has a bit more weight than the sequel did but the frequent cutscene interruptions just when things are getting more intense slightly annoy. With the requisite intel to collect and other difficulties to tackle, Fall of Man is a good game to check out though strangely, Insomniac seems to really pull out some wonders when they do the Ratchet and Clank stuff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"OoAK","summary":"Ending doesn't ruin the experience.","reviewText":"Truth be told. Alot of the bad reviews for this game are knocking the entire experience, making it sound like the game is completely worthless, simply because of the last 10-15 minutes. I'm not defending the ending in ANY way. I hated the ending, it made no sense to me, and raised more questions than actually supplying answers. However, it doesn't change the fact that I was on the edge of my seat for pretty much the entire time up to that point. No, the ending isn't good but to say I didn't have fun playing the game and going with the 1 star protest is just ridiculous. A bad ending does not warrant criticizing the experience as a whole. They have of course announced the \"Extended Cut DLC\" news, which will apparently clarify what happened in the end, and hopefully it does in fact do that but i'm not getting my hopes up, but until people see what this DLC has in store there's no reason for anyone to be giving an opinion on it. The Mass Effect trilogy, for me, was one of the most gripping and entertaining gaming experiences of this generation. A bad 10-15 minutes does not take away a fantastic 100+ hours. I'm a serious gamer, but also rational. If there were a better ending this would be a 5 star game no doubt. But, I docked one star because the ending was indeed a letdown. The overall experience was great and i'm still a fan of the Mass Effect series and am ready for the next installment, even if Shepard's story is over.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard C. Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","summary":"Great story, decent gameplay - questionable ending. Great Multiplayer.","reviewText":"Added 4-25-2012: First - You MUST play this game at least two times! Play once, then play around 100 multiplayer games. Then play it again. Why? You'll learn to use your powers, won't overload with un-needed or under-used weapons, and play much better. Plus you can make different choices and open up new avenues of exploration and new dialogs. Plus, you just may play new character types. I always went with soldier because of the weapon types.  Now I almost exclusively use sniper rifles and handguns, so can try other character types. Plus you can keep an eye out for clues to the ending - there are several! At one point, Liara asks if Shepard had ever thought about what would happen if the Relays were destroyed.--------------------------------------------------Gameplay: Fun, great sound, nice cinematics. There were a few times when the game took control for preset encounters, where Shepard and whomever he was talking to were in really awkward positions - looking over their shoulders in opposite directions, bumped up against walls, etc. The battle with the Harvester where Shepard had to LASER paint the Reaper - the final scene froze the game three times.Weapons: Some fun, new, cool toys. The Graal Spike Thrower shotgun is a blast, as is the Scorpion - I find myself using the Scorpion the most. It's just fun to watch the baddies explode into gory piles of goo. Or shatter. The mods are a welcome return, and the way they are implemented is pretty much like Dead Space - you need a weapons bench.  Unlike Dead Space, they are all over the place, including the Normandy.Ammo: plentiful. I never ran out - sure my assault rifle may go dry, but I could switch to another weapon. You'll find ammo all over the place, including spare grenades.Exploration: Not as rewarding as previously, or as in say, Bioshock.  If I wander around and explore every nook and cranny, I want to be rewarded. Only happens occasionally here. You have to explore to find mods and upgrades, but it should be more rewarding. More credit stashed perhaps? The DLC does have more stuff stashed around the place.Paragon/Bad-Azz dude: I really wish the text choices we were given matched what Shepard actually said or does.  Often they seem opposite or nonsensical. Sometimes they are obvious - highlighted in red or blue.  Most times, they are not.Killing people off: Why? Some deaths were pointless. Won't get into details, but you'll find yourself with several WTF?!? moments.Choices: Results are often nonsense. There's a point where you have to select between two races. Pick race A, and race B will try and destroy them - race B gets wiped out. This is idiotic - there's no reason for race B to make this choice. Sleep with person A and person B gives you the could shoulder - even though there's no way she could have known.Battles: Most are pretty good, not overly challenging. There was one \"no win\" battle - it took me a few tries to realize this and change the goal from killing them all to finishing the mission. The solo fight with the Reaper I mentioned earlier - pretty silly.DLC: So far the only DLC is the first day release. You can skip it.  There was about 15 minutes of game play, and the character was not that great. If it was free or $2 - but not $10!Movement: It's a little quirky. Shepard tends to spin around too much and it's a little tricky to align him with people just right so he interacts. You get the hang of it eventually, but it should not be that quirky. The running/shooting/ducking/jumping is much refined and a blast.Battle Center: Never went above 50% readiness. I collected 90% of the junk lying around the galaxy, completed all but 7 of the side missions (and those were minor), and had my forces maxed out.Other quirks: When our Ninja Assassin goes after the Prothean AI, the AI announced \"indoctrinated presence detecting\" and declares that defenses are activated. Nothing happens. Another character (I'm staying generic to avoid spoilers) - I had him/her make a choice. We find out his/her eventual fate later on. Again, lame. Makes no sense. The character was asked \"are you xxxx\" - the character answered \"yes\" and was shot.  Why would you answer \"yes?!?\" Why not hide - there were plenty of places - and lots of time. The writers seemed determined to kill off anyone Shepard interacted with in the previous games. When you have the final showdown with the Elusive Man, well lets just say he was way too easy to deal with.Ending: I agree with the other reviewers. It seemed sloppy and contrived. Again it's too black and white. The two choices given are bizarre. First time through I chose the \"left/good (blue)\" option because I saved the species involved. I'll play it again, but I'll select to save different species during gameplay and pick the right/bad option.  I don't know why they consider one good and the other bad - the results of the \"good\" option are pretty dramatic, and the final wrap-up, set far in the future is bizarre. It assumes no advances in space travel - really? With all that Reaper tech lying around? There's plenty of controversy about the ending - one I find diabolically clever if true! If you decide to control the Reapers, you are actually indoctrinated by them.The final screen: Basically an ad to buy DLC so you can continue Shepard's legacy.  Really? I played 30 hours for an advertisement?Overall it was fun to play, and it did recognize choices from the previous games (I saved the Rachni, did not blow up the Harvester base, etc.)Oh yea - ever wonder what a Prothean sounds like? A Rastafarian.2nd Playthrough: You start out with the basics, as in the first playthrough, and little cash. But as soon as you start collecting weapons you'll have cool upgraded versions. I upgraded all my weapons to level V - highest available.  Picked up a rifle - and it was instantly at level VI. As soon as I was able to switch out weapons, I had access to all my previous playthrough weapons - but not the mods - but the mod effects I had chosen previously were in effect.  Once I found some mods, all mods from the previous playthrough were there.  I was awarded around $50,000 once I hit the citadel. I'm intentionally making different choices than the previous playthrough. It's almost like a different game. I have two more additional people on my team choices. I've seen at least 5 minutes of new video. Several new missions. Cool!Muntiplayer: A blast, although it is a bit of another money grab on the part of Bioware. To really survive in the multiplayer game, you need supplies and upgrades. You can earn credits by playing, or just spend $$ for them. You need to visit the \"store\" for supplies, and can spend from $1 to $4 for supplies - and purchase several at a time.  Or spend 5,000 to 80,000 game credits. Bioware is making a fortune from this, and I feel a bit reamed.  You should be able to pick up these items in the game - not pay for them.  Aside from that, gameplay is more fun than GOW3. I've tried all the classes and have settled on a human engineer. That combat drone has a \"deer in the headlights\" effect on Brutes, husks and most importantly, Banshees.My biggest complaint: EA servers keep going down.  Happens every three or so games. Any credits (real money or earned in-game) you spend on \"consumables\" are then GONE!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000066RKC","description":"Based on the same elements that made the movie so enjoyable--fear, suspense, and the possibility that your teammate might be infected--The Thinglets players slowly creep into the action with the help of several nonplayer characters (NPCs), whom you control and use to protect and aid you and your group. Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing. For his sake, he'd better believe.","reviewerName":"Stewart J.

They raised the fear effect level on this game as well.  You had the opportunity to freeze to death ifyou got lost outside in the snow or getting eaten alive ifyou crossed paths with one of those &quot;things&quot; indoors.

You never know when one of those monsters willcome busting through the walls, and you just can't kill themby blasting them which makes killing a little unique.

Denick","summary":"The best end credit sequence I have ever seen!","reviewText":"I got a bunch of games with the PS4, including Battlefield 4 and Need for Speed Rivals, but strangely... this was the game that kept calling to me, and I couldn't put it down until I had completed two playthroughs. Knack didn't &#34;wow&#34; me, the way the graphics in the BF4 campaign did, but it has a fun, challenging type of gameplay that really drew me in. This game is actually pretty tough (I played on &#34;normal&#34; difficulty). You can't just plow ahead and smash your way to victory. You have to carefully evaluate each enemy's patterns and hone your timing and skill in order to progress. I love that the game is hard like this, because it really makes you work for it, and you get a great sense of accomplishment when you clear a challenging area (particularly those tough bosses!). This is the classic formula that was applied to platoformers like Mario, Sonic, and Crash, and there are frequent check points, so you hopefully won't have to pull your hair out.I also like the art direction and the whimsical nature of the story itself (and it's always nice to see games where the violence is not paramount). This is a really fun platformer (though I would not rank it up there with Ratchet and Clank or Rayman), and I love that it allows for two player co-op. The only thing that I don't like about the game is the randomized loot drops from secret treasure chests... this gets really frustrating when you're trying to collect all the items, and it just keeps giving you the same crystal again and again... not cool! Due to the apparent hopelessness of collecting all the gadgets and crystals, I eventually gave up on the endeavor. But I can look past that flaw, and hopefully Mark Cerny will not incorporate that aspect into any potential sequels.And let's not forget... this game has the absolute funniest end credit sequence I have ever seen! If you can't finish the game or are not inclined to play it, just go to youtube to watch it... it's hilarious!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"Proof that individual superb qualities don't necessarily add up to a superb title.","reviewText":"It's still a mystery to me, but somehow, great graphics, improved controls, great (mercilessly unforgiving) enemy AI, good storyline, and incredibly addictive MP don't add up to the best shooter of 2008.-Graphics: aside from the fact that people look a bit....weird in R2, the surroundings look amazing, pretty at times, and the enemies just look eerie. A VAST improvement over RFOM, and although I preferred the grittier look of RFOM over the more colorful R2, it's a beautiful looking game.-Sounds: pretty good soundtrack, as soundtracks go, and I much prefer the voice acting, and the gun sounds in this game. The chimera sort of sound the same, so I can't complain on that end... can't elaborate much either.- Gameplay: I must say that this game feels a whole lot more solid than RFOM,  Nathan Hale moves a whole lot more realistically in my opinion, and the controls over all feel just tighter. Who knew that being able to sprint could make such a big difference.  The SP and the MP differ greatly in some unrecognizable aspects, but I think I've narrowed them down to that the SP , as I mentioned, has incredibly tough AI: the chimera not only take forever and a day to die, they have all become crack commandos in a few years. I died and continued, a lot.The MP on the other hand is incredibly addictive, a bit pointless, but incredibly fun. Arguably more fun than the single player campaign.- Story: I'm not sure this is where the game falls short, and I have not finished the single campaign yet, but, the whole game revolves around a chimeran invasion of the USA. I would expect it to feel a bit grander, but I guess the freedom of the human race can be fought in a lot of proxy wars and black ops in backwater covert facilities, right?Overall, this game falls short to achieve in the sum of its parts the greatness of each individual component. Kinda sad, but I think the hype might have killed it a bit. Or perhaps it's just because of when this game was released (amidst a bunch of heavy hitter titles). OR, and sadly enough, perhaps we remember RFOM with much kinder eyes than we should have because it was one of a handful of games that were subpar...?Either way, fun, good, not incredible.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2009"}

In Giants, the giant characters add a new perspective to the gameplay, and the environment brings many new and exciting challenges as well.You can still use your old Skylanders characters in Giants along with the new characters, and create infinite combos of destructive teams for your multiplayer quests. Another nice thing is the portal that's included with the Giants starter kit connects directly to your system via USB, whereas the old portals did not, and ended up burning through tons of batteries with extended use. Why didn't they think of doing this for the first installment? Either way, it's a welcomed fix this time around.Overall, Skylanders Giants is a worthwhile buy for a lighthearted adventure that all can appreciate.

The amount of freedom allowed in the game is great - you can focus on the main storyline, cruise around, do the side missions or just wreak havoc in general.

Scott Heitman","summary":"SSX Meets Motorstorm","reviewText":"SSX meets MotorstormPure isn't the definitive racing experience, but it's definitely a great time in short to medium length sittings.  In a nutshell, the game combines a complicated trick system (a la the SSX games) with the off-road vistas of Motorstorm.  Unlike Motorstorm, Pure doesn't offer an array of vehicles to choose from; this is an ATV game.  However, Pure does allow the player to 'build' an ATV from the ground up and periodically offers race rewards in the form of part upgrades.  In this sense, the game offers that pseudo-rpg sense that series like Need for Speed have been exploiting to good effect for the last 5 years.  Like Motorstorm, the game offers a relatively linear progression of races; the interface in this regard looks almost lifted from Motorstorm, itself.Pure has some nice production values, though they fail to reach levels established by EA in the SSX games.  Slick menus follow you wherever you go.  In potential sequels, I'd like to see some notification in the bottom of the screen when a new song starts.  As it is, the soundtrack is decent, but I can't really tell what's there.  Additionally, the game offers up a set of player characters, but the art and voice-acting (if it can be called that) will make you want to strangle whomever you pick.The physics and general gameplay of Pure feel very much like Motorstorm plus tricks.  I hate to mention a previous game so many times as a descriptor of this one, but the comparison is quite valid.  In comparing the two, each have relative strengths.  If you prefer the addition of tricks, Pure is the right choice.  On the other hand, Pure's track design simply doesn't offer the same amount of depth and character as Motorstorm.  The tracks are well-designed, but you won't remember any of them two months from now.I look back at this review and realize that I've spend the majority of it making criticisms.  Please note that these act more as exceptions to the fact that this is a great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

I made the assumption everyone would go with the Xbox one but instead they bought PS4s. This isnt a negative point for the Xbox One but its important to see if who you are playing with now is upgrading to it otherwise you need new friends. I work in a field that requires a lot of secrecy ie no cell phones at work, background checks on new people you meet etc. The idea of this always listening creeped me out so I wanted to see if what I was saying was sent to servers to be processed like siri. I looked into what the xbox was doing on my home network and it always sending and receiving data I disconnected the camera and this crippled the experience (Data usage was lower) and keeping it offline ruins the whole reason I bought the system. These two reasons are both situational but everyone should value what little privacy they have because you always have less than you think.My primary reason for not being able to justify the console was it would not play any files on my online FTP server or my networked hard drive they all worked fine all my 360 and $25 Raspberry Pi. 70 percent of the time I use my tvs to watch movies or tv shows I downloaded and im a cable cutter so the HDMI passthrough serves no purpose.In summary I wish I had researched my decision more especially media playback and privacy concerns. I will probably buy a PS4 and keep my Raspberry PI running Xbian and keep my Xbox One in storage until I see a future update that disables the voice services and improves media playback.Positives:.Next generation gaming looks great.The console looks professional in a home theater setup..A future update can fix all my issues.(If theirs a way to fix now please comment!)UPDATE: I've been using this console without kinect to play xbox only games but overall I still enjoy my PS4 better and use a fire tv for my media needs. Its a decent console but an example is Watchdogs it will play at nearly 1080p on PS4 while only 720P on the Xbox.

Those that have been paying Blizzard at least $15 a month for several years and want to break free of that monkey on your back, and those who are thinking about playing Warcraft for the first time.For those of you who are looking to stop funneling money to Blizzard while they continue to dumb the game down, ignore their customer's wants and needs, and slowly make Warcraft a kid friendly game in an effort to bury Warcraft like Netflix did themselves:Guild Wars 2 loaded great. I did free up some space on my IMac to load it into Windows because apparently there is no version for Mac yet. I won't lie, I am trying to wean myself off of WOW and force myself to like GW2. It's not that hard to do. GW2 has some great points. The battlegrounds are fun and you get into them instantly. Learning what you are doing in one is not nearly as intuitive as WOW but it's not hard to enjoy them. The questing is not very difficult yet, and my highest character is only a level 10. She has died a few times, but not really from challenge as much as laziness :) If you run into a mob, you're going to die. The rez points are all over the map so you do some running but not like in Vanilla WOW. One of the best features, which Blizzard could (but won't) learn from is the instant travel. There are no flight paths, no long waits (longest is something like 15 real time minutes while your char flies from Feathermoon Stronghold to Tanaris) to get to a spot in the game. Just click your map and click where you want to go.  The 'auction house' can be accessed any time, anywhere just by clicking on a tab. The weird thing is that you have to find a certain character at larger towns to claim your money from these auctions. This seems very inconsistent as far as game planning, which brings me to the game itself. I've already said, I'm a WOW person. So yes, I'm going to compare. I fell into Wow headfirst and loved it. It was so pretty and so intuitive. I tried Allods and it's a lot like GW2 in that it's not intuitive. You will have questions and have no one to ask. But it's nearly as pretty as Warcraft. I tried Rift. I really liked Rift and if it wasn't at least partly about paying $15 a month, I'd stick with Rift. They have instant travel from stations placed throughout the game. The downside is it's dark and kind of medieval looking, the mounts/running is kind of dorky looking. Little things like that. The 'rifts' themselves were a super fun perk. So far, and I'm only at 10, GW2 is kind of dark like Rift is.GW2 is fun. It's more than worth giving a try. The very, very best part of GW2 is that you buy the game once, and (so far) you never pay again. There is no monthly fee. Unless this game really changes a whole lot after level 10, I'd say I personally would never pay a monthly fee to play GW2. But, with zero fees after you buy this initial game, I'd rate it above World of Warcraft unless money is not a problem for you.For those of you who have never played Warcraft, my advice is DON'T. While it may sound like a ringing endorsement for WOW, I do NOT mean it to when I say....World of Warcraft is wayyyyyy to fun and addictive. Everyone in my household played, started staying up late to play, joined guilds, played with others around the globe, lost sleep, called in sick...etc etc. At one point we had three accounts, at $15 a month each. Don't laugh, you probably pay that much a month for your fancy phone or McDonalds...we played Wow. Together! Great times!!! But then they nerf your character that you worked so hard to get to be the strongest you could, got her/him the best gear in game, only to have that be crap next to the newest armor. Then they come out with a new boxed version you have to install or you can't level your character up beyond a certain point. Bang, There's an additional $40+ bucks for each account.Get GW2. Try it out. You may fall in love with it a lot faster because you avoided Warcraft. Save yourself a LOT of money and aggravation and addiction. Skip the monthly fee games. If GW2 can do it, others can too.GW2 is fun. It's a huge game, with a huge world to explore freely. It has crafting skills and battlegrounds where you can play with other folks, guilds, questing, etc etc. Thinking of getting GW2 for a friend? Be sure their PC can handle it. Want to play GW2 with your kids or spouse etc? Grab 2 boxes. For less than a hundred bucks you and your spouse/kid/friend can immerse yourself in a new world. If it was prettier, more intuitive, I'd give it five stars.Sheri Gill - Writer, MAGE, MOM!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"The Blue Rose","reviewText":"Have you ever wanted to be in an action movie? Well, unless you look like Brad Pitt and you have some good Hollywood connections, you'd better not quit your day job.On the other hand, there's Metal Gear Solid 4. It's like an Anime action film where you have control over the lead character. While a little melodramatic at times, the story is a lot of fun. Importantly, there's no need to have played the previousMetal Gear gamesto be able to jump right into this continuing saga (I can say this first-hand as I only started gaming last year).The difference between MGS4 and other action games that I've played is that you are rewarded for being stealthy and covert. You will go a lot further a lot faster in MGS4 by sneaking past some of your enemies versus blasting your way past. In fact, alerting the enemy to your presence in some areas will lead to certain death.There are many Weapons to choose from to put down the enemies that you can't just sneak by, in addition to all different kinds of Items that  will help you heal, hide or just take some of the stress of play away (like an adult magazine or an iPod!).With all of the different weapons and \"stuff\" that can be used, and the stealth action style required throughout the game, I was little nervous before starting play that the controller schematics would be a pain to learn for all the different elements of the game...especially Close Quarters Combat...I'm terrible at hand to hand fighting games. But after the first minutes of the game, I quickly realized that the controls were as user friendly as the easiest game that I've ever played.There are 4 levels of difficulty to choose from (and I think perhaps a 5th to unlock if you complete the game on the hardest difficulty???), and I can say again first-hand that the easiest difficulty is way too easy. Unless you want almost no challenge whatsoever, I'd recommend starting the game on the second-easiest setting or normal setting if you've got good gaming experience.You've probably heard it everywhere already...there are some very long cutscenes in this game, but it really adds to the fun; and it's essential if you care about understanding the history of the story going back to MGS1. On the easiest setting I was given the option during every cutscene to skip if I wanted to (which I never did), but I've heard that on some of the other difficulties the option to skip the cutscenes isn't available in your first play-through (I'm not 100% sure about that though).The graphics are great. The Dolby Digital Surround plays beautifully through a 5.1 or better system.There's plenty here for gunners, hand to hand fighters, puzzle solvers and people who just love that challenge of finding the right road to the next level. But most of all, there's apx 18 hours of playtime that will have you sneaking around in some of the coolest environments that you've ever seen in a video game.MGS4 is a must for any PS3 owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001383L36","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Three games for a fairly good price....","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid is a unique series of games. The series can appeal to a wide range of audiences: rpg fans to the hardcore action fans. The games are heavy in scenes, dialog, and action. It rewards more on stealth than direct action which causes players to think more about moving around than other games. The Essential Collection is a collection of the Metal Gear Solid series. It comes with three games: Metal Gear Solid 1 for the Playstation 1, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Metal Gear Solid 3 for the Playstation 2.A review of each game.Metal Gear Solid 1: This is the original game from the Playstation 1 platform. Some of you may have played the remake on the Gamecube. This isn't the remake. It's the original game that was released 10 years ago on the Playstation 1 platform. The game is amazing even at the time of its release. Watch out though: if this is your first time playing, you might find the graphics need to be getting used to. This is a Playstation 1 game, by the way. Every ps3 should be able to play this game.Metal Gear Solid 2: This is the second game. This is the special edition of the game that was released after the original. It comes with loads of extras that the original didn't have. Basically, this is the complete version of Metal Gear Solid 2. I heard they cut out a few scenes in the game, but I haven't noticed anything wrong really. Also, PS3 owners of Sixaxis controllers, beware that there is a part in the game where the vibration function is needed. I don't think it is important to the story as I completed it, but you're going to miss out on it if you don't have the vibration. I heard you can turn off vibration and it works differently, but I haven't tested yet.Metal Gear Solid 3: This is a step back in the timeline. This goes before all of the events in Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2. You look back in the past and it sort of fill gaps in the stories. I played this one first when it came out. This was my first Metal Gear Solid, and honestly, I was quite confused with some of the things in the story. I honestly think if this is your first time playing the series, you should go in order of release. The Metal Gear Solid 3 game is the special version of the game that was released. You get a cool free camera, which is a first of the Metal Gear Solid series. It's quite cool to free float the camera instead of having a fixed bird eyes view when moving. Some of you may have the special edition with two discs. Be warned, do not trade it in if you like the second disc as the Essential Collection only contains the first disc.Overall, you'll love this collection. It's quite good for the money. Honestly, if you're planning to buy it, you better get it fast. Something tells me that this is in limited production and might become hard to find in the near future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It was beaten to the punch by Microsoft's new X-Box, as well as falling behind the DVD-playing PS2 & that system's online capabilities.  When the final tally was made, the Gamecube ultimately precipitated Nintendo to create the ground-breaking Wii to once again compete in the video game market.That being said, the Gamecube was home to some of the most enjoyable video games ever created.  It didn't fare too well in the always-popular first-person shooter & \"epic games\" categories, but its own licensed stable of games/characters was still as strong as ever.  Games like \"Mario Power Tennis\", \"Luigi's Mansion\", \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", & \"Mario Kart: Double Dash\" provide hours upon hours of entertainment, while installments of the Madden football series and the MVP Baseball series were some of the best ever created on this system.Simply put, the Gamecube was never meant to be anything more than a console for brand loyalists who wanted their Mario, Zelda, DK, & Pokemon (among others, of course) games.  While Microsoft went for the \"online gaming\" crowd and found a winning market (although it actually took the 360 to accomplish that goal), and Sony was the first to grasp the concept of an \"all-in-one\" entertainment console, the Gamecube was perhaps the last bastion of gaming console meant for the sole purposes of video games.In terms of \"specs\", the graphics in this system were excellent for their time, and the controller was easily the most ergonomic I have ever played (with the 360 a close second).  Here we are in 2012, and Nintendo has yet to even match, much less surpass, some of the graphics of, say, Super Smash Bros. Melee or Zelda: Twilight Princess.Overall, the Gamecube was a fun system that played very well to its niche: Nintendo brand loyalists.  Though other systems reshaped the public perception of video gaming, the Gamecube provided one last throwback to the traditional console market.  In the process, the Gamecube turned out to be perhaps the best overall Nintendo gaming unit ever in terms of fun, functionality, & quality game titles.One final thought: While the N64 now looks and seems quaint by today's standards, with only nostalgic games like Goldeneye or Mario '64 to keep it relevant whatsoever, the Gamecube still touches a core market even today: those who want a traditional gaming experience with the \"old gang\" of Nintendo characters.  Though obviously no new titles are being released for the GCN, it says a lot when such a niche audience can still be satiated by that little box in the bottom of the home entertainment center.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A fun open-world filled with random stuff to do","reviewText":"GTA V for me isn't like other games such as the Last of Us or Halo, because while it does have a central story the majority of the memorable moments I had came from just messing around in the game doing your own thing and just having fun experimenting. I've put my thoughts below on each aspect of the game.STORYGTA V takes place in a fictional Southern California with some bits of Nevada thrown in to round things out. You experience the story from the perspective of 3 central characters: 1) Michael, the retired bank-robber being pulled back into his old life, 2) Franklin, the street hustler who's got dreams of moving up into the big-time, 3) Trevor, the sociopath drug-dealing best friend of Michael from his bank-robbing days. The general story takes place with the 3 characters all being brought together by bigger events that keep adding up as you play the game. The execution of how the characters are portrayed feels accurate, and its fun getting to have such different mission types between the 3 characters. There is now the option to retry missions and try things out differently next time too with gold rankings to shoot for in each. And don't worry about getting frustrated over some levels which have annoying sequences that you just can't get past - fail a part of a mission 3 times and you get the option to skip it. While the storyline itself was sound in terms of game design, I felt that it frankly wasn't a very original story and at times to me felt predictable and cliche. This goes back to my main point that the best part of GTA V isn't the campaign story, it's everything else it's got to offer.GAMEPLAYThe dynamic switching between the 3 characters really adds a new layer of immersion and variety to the gameplay. Each character starts out with their own skillset, and kind of like Skyrim the more you perform any given activity the better you'll get at it. You drive more to improve your character's driving ability, take flying lessons to get better at flying, run/bike/swim more to build up your stamina, etc. It feels like a very natural process and kind of gives the player goals to work towards as you play the game. The shooting mechanic by default comes with a very generous auto-aim, that makes the game almost too easy in terms of combat, though you can change this. There is a great variety of weapons this time around, with plenty of customization and a shooting range to try them out on.Driving in terms of technical game design is built fine. The main issue comes from the cars that you have available to use. In fact there are only a handful of cars I even bother looking for to drive because the rest handle so poorly. Part of that I get is by design, since a prius isn't going to handle corners like a dodge viper. Still, I can't help but feel like a lot of the cars I expected to be great to drive felt like a mess on the road (I'm talking about cars like the Diablo aka. Lambo rip-off). I even maxed out my driving skill to make sure it wasn't something missing on my end, but my experience with the cars has been a unfortunate mixed bag. I am very happy with the few cars I did think handle well, and upgraded them immediately and haven't had many issues since then. I personally absolutely hated flying other vehicles like helicopters and especially planes, but I didn't really spend much time practicing flying either.Special abilities for each character keep things fresh, with Franklin getting a mode where he can slow things down while driving and make precision maneuvers, Trevor getting a rage mode where he can take more and dish out more damage, and Michael getting his own combat boost too. All in all, the gameplay is sound mechanically though it doesn't exactly do much to stand out aside from the special abilities either (which you could argue are borrowed from previous games like Max Payne and others).SIDE MISSIONS/RANDOM EVENTSThis was by far one of the more engaging parts of the game for me, mostly because of how ridiculous some of they are. Side missions range from the standard stuff like assassinations and street races to new ones like bounty hunting, Trevor's \"rage\" missions, stealing celebrities clothing, to paparazzi stalking. Side missions are often unique to specific characters, and encourages you to try out and advance each character through each one. I frankly loved them because of just how ridiculous they were and how different they are from the standard stuff you've seen in previous open-world games including previous GTA games. The dialogue and banter on these kinds of missions is just great, and really adds a lot to flesh out the game and make it more immersive. There are also random characters you can encounter that give you some of these side activities and missions (again, specific to each character) and there are also random events that happen like robberies or car thefts that you can choose to intervene in or not. This is very similar to what Rockstar did in Red Dead Redemption with random strangers asking you for help on the road-side that you can choose to help or ignore. You can even stop a thief and keep the stolen money for yourself if you want.HEISTSThe big heists are what are always shown off in the game trailers, and they are definitely plenty of fun because of the planning you have to do before you can pull it off. You get to do everything from picking your crew, opting for the more qualified but higher cost members or going for the cheaper ones of questionable quality. Even how you set-up the heist matters, and will give you different results/rewards based on how well you pull things off. It gives you a great reason to go back and try things differently with a replay, and frankly makes it feel like a more authentic experience similar to most crime movies. The great set-piece moments keep things fun, though like most things they lose a bit of their luster after you've seen it the first few times. I love the fact that you can switch around between the characters on the heists, and see things from a different perspective and always get to try out the really cool parts of each heist that each character gets to do. Not much else I can say about the heists beyond this, since I want to keep this fairly spoiler free.IMMERSION/THE WORLD OF GTARockstar did a fantastic job recreating Los Angeles, speaking as someone living in LA right now. All the big recognizable landmark locations are there, from the Griffith Observatory to the Promenade and the Hollywood sign. When I say they have it down, I mean I was able to literally walk to the exact area where I took a picture at the observatory overlooking downtown, down to the staircase and pillars. They did their homework, and it absolutely shows in several parts of the game. There are lots of activities to do including shopping, tennis (one of my favorites), yoga, golf, hunting, marathons, mountain biking, flying, shooting, etc. There's plenty to keep you entertained for a while, and that's not counting other things like playing the stocks or buying up real-estate. I love how tied together the world is, and it feels like you're living in a continuously moving world that's reacting to your actions. For example, if you lets say go out of your way to deface/devalue a company and buy up stock in their competitor you can catch the news to see stock prices jump around and reap the rewards. Even just switching between the characters shows them going on living their lives when you're not controlling them. Trevor was driving around still in a semi-truck from a mission that he was in when I was playing as Michael.It's the little details like that which go a long way to making you feel like Los Santos is a living breathing world. Even just taking a walk around town and overhearing strangers can give you a good laugh, not to mention going in to see a shrink. It's because of how great a job Rockstar does with the little things that it makes it all the more apparent when they do drop the ball. There are a lot of buildings you can't go into, and plenty you cannot interact with. I went down to the Santa Monica pier and couldn't go into the main restaurants there, or go into many restaurants anywhere really. This isn't like Skyrim where nearly every person you run across has a story to tell. What GTA does offer is great, it's just a shame that after 5 years in development there's not more of it. The world size itself is huge, though to be fair the actual city part of it isn't exactly huge and sprawling. I appreciate all the wilderness and desert terrain since it adds some diversity in my opinion, but some people might find it boring.GRAPHICS AND SOUNDThe graphics are absolutely a solid step above GTA IV. But honestly compared to other games out today this isn't anything to write home about. I found the facial animations for anyone outside of the main characters to be very lacking in cutscenes and gameplay alike. But I understand that concessions have to be made to run such a huge open world without load times (except for the really long one when you first start it up). It's not an ugly game by any means, and there's a lot of great looking parts to it. It runs incredibly smoothly on what is now pretty old hardware for the consoles, and that's a great achievement. Rockstar clearly put in some serious time for optimization on the framerate front and it is much appreciated. It helps keep things rolling even in high action scenes unlike many other open-world games that start to chug.The sound design is absolutely fantastic, from the radio station selections to the voiceover quality and variety. Rockstar clearly put in some extra money here and it shows, with the game always feeling authentic sound-wise from street sounds to cars to environmental noises in the wilderness. Rockstar absolutely nailed this, and I think it'll absolutely set a bar for future open-world games to hit. One slight downside is that listening to the same few radiostations means you're probably going to know every song the station can play pretty early on into the game. Not the biggest deal in the world, but more songs are always appreciated and they could easily be updated with new DLC content down the road too.ONLINE/MULTIPLAYERThis is the main reason why I haven't given GTA a 5 star rating, because how GTA Online is going to play out is largely unknown. While based on the trailer it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, it's simply not out yet for me to pass judgement on and so I'm going to defer giving my final score until I see what Rockstar has to offer on this front.WRAP-UPGTA V is a lot of fun with a rich open-world to explore and keep yourself entertained in for hours on end. Is it perfect, no, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a lot to offer. It's the random crazy things that happen to you along the way that I remember most. Here's 1 of my most memorable moments. I started out driving down sunset blvd in a new mercedes SL that I just bought for Franklin since he just wrapped up a big heist and had some spending money. I got it all tricked out with the latest engine upgrades and a fresh paint job to top it off. As I pulled out of the auto-shop my screen flashed and the opportunity came up for me to stop a thief. So I did my civic duty and ran the guy down in my shiny new car and went to bring the poor guy his wallet. What ends up happening is a car I didn't see rams into me and pushes me into the poor guy waiting for his wallet and the police car sirens started to screech. I was already up at 2 stars and they were gunning right behind me. Thankfully I had my upgraded car to help me make a quick getaway at first, but then some cop cars slid around to stop me and I accidentally rammed right into several street cops at a barrier, up to 4 stars. Now the cops were really gunning for me, and I ended up driving up a parking structure all the way to the top to help avoid the chopper on my tail. I shot out the pilot of the chopper and saw it crash down into some more cop and FBI cars below, 5 stars. Only way off that roof was courtesy of a stunt ramp which I happily revved up my engine to take. After gunning it for the jump I ended up doing a flip and landing perfectly (completely by accident), and making my way to a construction site to hide out. I found a nice little corner tucked away from site, and decided to go and check my stocks, make a few trades, and rush right back out to avoid the cop car getting a little too close. I end up making a run for the mountains hitting ever winding turn at near top speed thanks to my car's upgrades. I see a nice place in the woods to go hide the car and watch the choppers and FBI scramble around to find me. Then I get out of my car, behind the \"Hollywood\" sign and take in the sights before making my way back to Franklin's mansion. That was all a completely unscripted random event, and though it doesn't always work out this neatly it sure it a lot of fun every time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Classic Goes to the Wii","reviewText":"Pros:+Reissue of one of the best Playstation 2 games.+A good storyline+A beautiful and stylish game+Incredible soundtrack+Wii Controls work wellCons:-There aren't any Wii Exclusive Extras-No voice acting, though this isn't a big issue-If you own this game on the Playstation 2, the new controls probably don't justify buying the gameIn 2006, Capcom released Okami.  It's a game that didn't have a long lifespan, despite being on the PS2.  It has commonly gone on to be labeled one of the most underrated (and probably underplayed) games of all time.  However, it quickly garnered a cult following.  For anyone who missed the Playstation 2 version, here's a chance to play it on the Wii.  Even if you played the Playstation 2 version to death, Okami on the Wii is worth giving a try.You play as Amaterasu.  She's the Sun God of Japan and must now save the it from being overtaken by an evil curse that has spread across the land.  Amaterasu is joined by her companion Issun.  The overall story of Okami is brilliant.  It's told through text dialog with no voice acting to speak of.  While there's some garbled gibberish going on when the words appear on screen, there's no voice acting whatsoever.  This is forgivable, though.  What may throw some people however, is that some of the games cutscenes are pretty long, and they're pretty text heavy.When it comes to graphics there are some games that put style over substance and some that put substance over style.  Okami manages to do both.  Not only is the game one of the most beautiful looking games ever released on a video game platform, it's also incredibly stylish, colorful, and detailed.  Despite being released in 2006, Okami still manages to be one of the best looking games out there.  Even today, there are few games that look as good as Okami does.  From time to time you may just want to stop your progress and admire the game's beauty.In terms of gameplay, Okami is very reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda games.  You'll go into dungeons and villages and battle bad guys and solve puzzles most of the time.  Combat itself is fairly simple, and the Wii controls are actually pretty good here.  You'll flick the Wii Remote to attack and you can use the Nunchuck to dodge.  For the most part, the controls are pretty similar to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  Combat is also pretty simple.  Even against the bosses.  It's very unlikely you'll die even once through Okami.  The biggest draw to Okami, however, and the main reason it makes sense to release this game on the Wii, is the Celestial Brush.The Celestial Brush is more than just a gimmick.  You'll need it to get through much of the game's moments and you'll find you have to use it very often.  Using the brush you can do things like, make the sun come out when it's dark, or cut through stone.  You'll gather more skills as you traverse through the game.  You'll even need to use it in combat to defeat enemies.  What makes the Wii Version so much better is that actions with the celestial brush can be executed much faster than could be done on the Playstation 2 version.  The moment you start using the Wii Remote as a paint brush, you probably won't want to go back to using an analog stick for the task again.If there was any problem concerning the gameplay, it would be that the controls take time to get used to and that they do not always respond.  The controls work well, but stringing together attacks can be a problem sometimes.  When you finally get the rhythm down, though, the controls are pretty solid.There may not be any voice acting in Okami, but there is a fantastic soundtrack at work.  There are still few games that sound as good as Okami does.  Part of what helps the music, however, is that it really gets you absorbed into this world.  More so than most video games.  The adventure also lasts for quite some time, but it isn't boring and just when you're positive you've mastered everything there is to master, the game throws in another mechanic to keep it interesting.The only major thing holding Okami back, really, is the lack of Wii exclusive extras.  It's worth trying the game if you played through the Playstation 2 version.  On the other hand, it might not be worth buying just for the controls alone if you've still got your original copy.The good news, however, is Okami has aged well.  Even by today's standards, the game is fresh.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2008"}

Helm \"THROW?\"","summary":"How has this game gotten such rave reviews?","reviewText":"First, the bugs.My screen frequently paused during the middle of movement to load more data.One time, I couldn't even get past a level b/c my team mate Rico just sat there and wouldn't come to the door to open it.I played it from the checkpoint half a dozen times and even restarted the PS3 2 times with no luck. Finally, I had to restart the level.I also want to mention that the glitches weren't \"goofy\" glitches where I was standing in a corner, jumping, and hitting reload and then melee and I transported kind of things. They were all glitches that happened while doing the normal linear campaign.The campaign is extremely linear.The aiming mechanics are atrocious on normal and just plain bad on high precision.Movement and aiming in general were a chore. I am ok with gun recoil, and moving slow when wearing a bunch of armor. I am talking about your gun floating around, moving your reticle left only to have it go left and then move back right. Letting go of your left stick only to have your guy gradually walk back and to the right, or slowly spin left. There is also a difference between movement being slow and clunky.For anyone who has played Gears of War, consider this Gears of War 0.5 beta without the cool features, and with tunnel vision. The field of view was just to narrow. It even has the same sound that gears uses during checkpoints.I am also personally getting tired of games being lazy about graphics and just calling it gritty. Then, they get great graphics scores because of the \"dark feel.\" Or, like one reviewer said that it makes you sick b/c it is so real. NO, REALISM DOES NOT MAKE YOU SICK. A crappy job on a game makes you sick.Lastly, I am a completionist. I like to finish everything no matter what. Not only did I not finish this game, but I quit during the fight with Radec (the last guy). I probably had 20 minutes at the most to finish the game and I just quit b/c I could not take it any more.Just a note to anyone who wants to flame me for being an MS fanboy due to my raving about Gears.

After staggering around for awhile outside of contract work post-Dark Cloud 2, it's great to see them release this kind of truly polished, inspired game again.You really know what you're getting just reading about Ni No Kuni, it's essentially a modern coat of paint on a good 16-32 bit traditional RPG (veering more towards 32 due to the more complicated system design). The narrative isn't very strong, but it does manage to be very endearing and charming in it's simplicity and earnestness. It has a great feeling of soul that Level-5 writer Hino often has tried for, but never quite managed until now.Presentation in this game is ASTOUNDING, literally top in class work and in a colorful vibrant genre that doesn't get much in this kind of budgeting.

Very few games, western or eastern, hit this level of content and design each generation. Typically only Bethesda games are reliable in this level of content so it's always wonderful when you get more. This game has 40-50 hours of base content and 80-100 of total, along the way it has fleshed out system design and quirks and things to do, read, see and enjoy en masse.I'm often a little cautious on Level-5 games but I wholeheartedly recommend this one.

The game also serves as a perfect bridge title between the genius of the 3D titles and the more conservative approach of the \"New\" 2D side scrollers.  The game is heavily based on the 2D sidescrollers.Personally I believe one of Nintendo's intents with \"Super Mario 3D Land\" is broaden their audience for the 3D titles.  For new players unfamiliar with 3D Mario (2D Mario has far outside the 3D Mario games, even if the 3D Mario games are held in high esteem critically), playing \"Super Mario 3D Land\" will feel both natural and loads of fun and plant seeds for otherwise casual players to want to experience the other 3D Mario games..  Eventually \"Super Mario 3D Land\" goes beyond the straight linear scope to game design more commonly found in the two \"Super Mario Galaxy\"titles.According to one of the developers of \"Super Mario 3D Land\", Mario 3D games have been officially reset, at least for hand-held titles. For the first time in Mario's history, the goal of 3D Mario is not to get power stars, but instead reach the end of the course, just like a 2D game. Built explicitly as a bridge between the game design sensibilities of the 2D side-scrollers and the open ended exploration of 3D, \"Super Mario 3D Land\" functions as a proto-\"Super Mario 64\". Let me explain what I mean by that.When Nintendo were originally designing \"Super Mario 64\" (back when they were doing \"Star Fox\" and during the early development cycle, maybe as early as whey they were going to release \"Super Mario 64\" on the SNES), the original concept was to create lots and lots of mini-courses with objectives.Ultimately, they abandoned this idea; instead going with only fifteen main courses with six stars each (not counting the 100 coin stars). However, they did stick with the original premise of mini courses during the Bowser Battles sequences, to give us a taste of the original idea behind the game. Personally I'm glad they went with fewer but much more expansive courses than originally conceived/designed. Gone are the expansive explorations - in the three Bower levels, you are continually guided on narrow paths to a specific goal.Undoubtly, Nintendo made the correct choice during that time frame. Miyamoto and company had a lot to prove with \"Super Mario 64\" - namely, the power of the N64 and just how radically fun 3D gaming could be. Just like the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" from 1985 defined 2D gaming, \"Super Mario 64\" defined 3D gaming, and both games wrote the rule book on their perspective genres. Both games were documenting and forging uncharted territory.Until 2006 with \"New Super Mario Bros.\", Nintendo left behind Mario's 2D heritage. Indeed, there is an eighteen year gap between home console 2D Mario titles (1991's \"Super Mario World\" and 2009's \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\"). If anything, \"New Super Mario Bros.\" proved there was still an enormous market for 2D Mario (largely because we hadn't gotten one in so long).While both \"Super Mario Galaxy\" games (2007 and 2010 respectively) are fantastic games, \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" far outperformed both titles COMBINED commercially, selling almost thirty million units. In contrast, \"Super Mario Galaxy\" has sold 10.68 million, and \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\" (arguably the best Mario game out there, and easily one of the most highly reviewed titles of all time, competing even against the critical acclaim of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\") 6.36 million. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", however, has moved 26.26 million copies. This reason alone is why I personally believe Nintendo is going with \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" as a launch title to the Wii U instead of a 3D Mario game - buying power.The video game landscape has changed drastically since 1996. We've had 3D games for years now. In 2011, Nintendo published \"Super Mario 3D Land\", a title explicitly harkening back to the original design philosophy of \"Super Mario 64\" - short, linear courses that, while 3D, are much more akin to the 2D Marios than its 3D brethren.The courses are short and compact. If you watch online video, you will see several stages that are only narrowly in 3D. Each course has a narrow path to follow early on. Being Mario, the courses are bright and colorful (a hallmark of these games). The development team that brought us the \"Galaxy\" games are also the principal designers behind this game, so you will see several conventions established in those titles present here, such as the red/blue platforms that change position when you jump and the disappearing / reappearing platforms that are synced to the beat of the music [audio track].True to its 2D roots, \"Super Mario 3D Land\" builds upon the formulas found in the four NES games, going all the way back to the original 1985 \"Super Mario Bros.\". After defeating Bowser early on, Bowser turns into another enemy (such a Goomba, a Magikoopa, etc) with a leaf and then falls into a lava. This magical transformation of common enemies into the form of Bowser is taken directly from \"Super Mario Bros.\"There are eight worlds, each with four to six levels and then a Bowser/Boom Boom fight. After defeating Bowser at the end of World 8, an additional 8 worlds are available. These eight worlds features both new and remixed levels. The \"second quest\" remix is a homage to both \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\".For the first time in a 3D game, Mario now has a flag at the end of the level. A \"new\" twist is that unless you jump at the top of the pole, the flag only goes up to where you jumped. If you reach the top, you get a 1-Up and also the the level is marked with a \"gold\" flag. Origianlly Miyamoto wanted to do this flag mechanism in the original NES title, twenty six years previously, but was unable to due to technical limitations.Mario has seven different forms: regular Mario (the first time small Mario has been seen in a 3D game), Super Mario, and Fire Mario, Tanooki Mario, Boomerang Mario, Statue Mario, Invicinable Mario, and White Tanooki Mario. Only Boomerang Mario is actually new. White Tanooki Mario requires an invincibility leaf.Nintendo, apparently, is obsessed with \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", even partially resurrecting the Tail Logo. Many gameplay elements are lifted directly from that game, notably the Tanooki Suit and Boom Boom, neither of which have been seen since \"SMB3\". There are also several airship levels also. You should note, however, that (strangely) Mario CANNOT FLY with the Tanooki Suit. Also, the Statue form of Mario does not appear until the second half (the last eight worlds) of the game.As far as length goes, the first half will be finished fairly quickly. However, the last half is much more challenging and will take longer. These two halves meet Nintendo's need for making Mario games both accessible and challenging, serving the same function as the Challenge Mode in \"New Super Mario Bros. U\".Each world has six levels, for a total of forty eight. After defeating Bowser, and the second half of the games open up, there are another forty eight levels, although several are remixed/speed run versions of previously played levels. There are only a handful of new levels present; the vast majority are pre-existing levels with new gameplay elements and some rather difficult design not present in the first eight worlds.  The first eight worlds were designed with accesibility in mind; the last eight were reconfiguring the stages for a more challenging experience.If you get five stars (for them to be shiny, you must now die ten times to allow the White Tanookie Suit to appear) on your game select screen, you must meet the following requirements: Beat the final boss Bowser, clear all levels with both Luigi and Mario, get the Golden Flag on all levels, and also collect all star coins.One you do these things, the final secret level is clear, Special World-Crown.  Similiar to \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\"'s Grandmaster Galaxy (but nowhere near as challenging as that beast of a level), \"Special World Crown\" is the ultimate test of your cereberal fitness on beating back the challenges Nintendo lays down and lead Mario and Luigi to victory.The only nitpick I would make is the requirement to beat the game completely with both Mario and Luigi.  You only have to reach the flagpole with each brother; you do not have to get all three star coins and the gold flag pole with both brothers, only one.  Like \"Super Mario Galaxy\" I feel Nintendo is just reaching for content.Here is a breakdown of the Special World levels:Special World 1:1-1: Similiar to 2-1 but with notable differances1-2: Modelled on World 1-2 but features different enemies, also has a Cosmic Clone chasing you1-3: Loosely based on World 2-31-4: Loosely based on World 6-11-Castle: Based on 1-Castle, only with a time limitSpecial World 2:2-1: The first new level, this is an autoscroller.2-2: Similiar to World 3-2, but with a 30 second timer2-3: 1-4 Remix [Similiar to 1-4]2-4: 6-5 Remix2-5: 4-5 Remix2-Airship: 3-Airship RemixSpecial World 3:3-1: 5-3 Remix3-2: 4-3 Remix3-3: 7-3 Remix3-4: 7-2 Remix3-5: 6-4 Remix3-Airship: 2-Airship RemixSpecial World 4:4-1: New level based on elevators4-2: 6-3 Ghost House Remix4-3: Based on 6-1 and Special 1-44-4: 1-3 Remix with 30 second clocks4-5: 3-3 Remix4-Airship: Original airship with Pom Pom boss battleSpecial World 55-1: New night level with reverasablie platforms5-2: 7-2 remix with cosmic clone5-3: Similiar to 1-4 and Special 2-35-4: 3-5 Remix5-5: Ghost house with some similiarties on the inintro to 6-35-Castle: World 5 castle with 30 second time limitSpecial World 66-1: 3-1 Remix but at night6-2: 3-3 remix with Goombas yielding seconds to a thirty second time limit6-3: 2-2 Remix6-4: 4-3 Remix with cosmic cone6-5: Ghost House, remix of 8-46-Airship: Similiar to World 4 AirshipSpecial World 7:7-1: 3-4 Remix7-2: 6-4 Remix with cosmic clone7-3: 7-4 Remix7-4: 2-4 Remix7-5: 7-Airship remix, no boss battle7-Castle: 1-Castle Remix with 30 timer and cosmic clone giantSpecial World 88-1: Special 1-1 remix but with player starting near exit.

This is Mario after all.  Mario is The Beatles or the gaming industry - his titles are frequently mind-bending, always tremendously accessible, wildly innovative, and essential purchases for those who love all things video games.  If you have a 3DS, pick this up now!And if it's a choice between \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\" and \"Super Mario 3D Land\", for the love of all that is holy, go with \"Super Mario 3D Land\".  \"New Super Mario Bros. Gold\" (the original tentative title) is an excellent game, but if you can only have one, \"3D Land\" far outshines the second 3DS title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}

Shaw \"Casual Reviewer\"","summary":"For Kids or Not?","reviewText":"Great Great Game!  So, here is a different take on reviewing this game.  I know everyone else loves the racing of the Burnout series, and surely this is some of the best racing on any platform.  However, for me, the absolute best thing about the Burnout series is the crash mode. INCREDIBLE!  It is hard to put into words why it is so much fun to drive as fast as you possibly can into a crowded intersection to see just how much monetary destruction you can cause.  It's like primordial fun.  Your inner beast gets to come out in the form of plowing through semi trucks cars and minivans.  Plus, every time you complete a crash intersection, you unlock another.  Each crash is different, each intersection is different.  Eventually you'll get to harder to crash intersections and the crash mode becomes somewhat of an addicting puzzler, trying to figure out how to get the gold.  Each crash intersection takes about 1 minute to complete lending this mode of the game to the perfect portable title.Bottom Line:  Is it fun? Yes.  If you like completely destroying cars and you don't mind using a little brainpower to do it, or if you just want the best racer anywhere, get this game.  Will I keep it?  It can be played forever.  Is it for kids?  Extremely violent car crashes with no people involved.  My kids can't get enough of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"... did I just slice that guy in half with my tommy gun?","reviewText":"I have to say it's a bit odd to hear streams of swear words coming from a game built for a Nintendo system.The Godfather: Blackhand Edition is a visceral experience for gamers, which is definitely brought on by the implementation of motion sensitive controls. Hand-to-hand fighting is done by swinging the Wiimote and Nunchuk, which is done with extreme precision and feels much more controlled than Wii Boxing.Some of the actions may take awhile to get. Of course, trying to get the character to slam someone's head into a table as opposed to headbutting them really isn't too much to complain about. :)Parents who are worried about the impressionable young minds of their children will most likely not want their kids playing this game (along with implementing the willful ignorance of the fact that they'll probably just play it over at their friend's house.) Grand Theft Auto was all about sandbox style car thievery with the added incentive of being able to kick people's butts. Blackhand is pretty much about organized crime, the incentive of getting to steal cars, and finding new and inventive ways to kill people... mainly the latter. My girlfriend was watching me play and at one point she just looked on in horror as I bent a guy over and shot him in the head with a shotgun at point blank range (while I, I'm sorry to say, laughed with testosterone filled glee.)I actually spent a good twenty minutes running in and out of the safehouse, chucking bottles at people.The game definitely earned it's M rating, but the overall gameplay is exemplary. The controls are fluid and intuitive, with the storyline mixing into the original movie complete with voice work from some of the cast members. It was a bit of a shock when \"Michael Corleone\" shows up and looks and sounds nothing at all like Al Pacino, which was a bit of a letdown.The ultimate problem with the game, though, comes down to the graphics. I'm all about the gameplay, but EA really took the low road when they just ported over the PS2 version. They've added a ton of gameplay and, of course, the controls, but there have been plenty of times where I've thought \"damn, these graphics are ten years old.\" Of course, with the realistic controls, maybe the world is better off with obviously shody graphics.The storyline missions keep the game moving and there are plenty of side missions to keep you occupied. It's advertised as offering around 50 hours of gameplay, so anyone who beat Zelda and is looking for their next big time consuming epic, this would be it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2007"}

But if you played the games as a kid and want to go back to the nostalgia of that, then you're in luck. You get what's advertised here, and a few more little extras that add a nice touch.One minor complaint: in both \"Kirby's Adventure\" and \"Kirby Superstar\" games, there is a mini-game where you have to hit a button as fast as you can to beat an enemy in a duel. On an NES and SNES, there's no lag time between when you hit the button and when the game registers that you hit the button. No such luck with a Wii-mote (due to there being no cord). I don't know exactly how much lag time there is on a Wii-mote, but it's apparently too much for most people to win this mini-game. I remember easily beating this mini-game as a kid, and can't get anywhere close now. Perhaps my reaction time has just suffered the same effects as my vision and lactose tolerance, but I suspect the Wii's lag time is to blame here. So, kind of a bummer, but not enough to really \"fault\" Nintendo.

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws.

In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun.

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"A terrific way to revisit the Metroid series","reviewText":"Metroid: Zero Mission is a remake of the original Metroid game that game out decades ago on the NES. Using upgraded graphics and some gameplay enhancements from the later sequel Super Metroid, the game provides an excellent rendition of Samus Aran's first mission. As became a pattern throughout the series, you take on the role of this mysterious bounty hunter as she fights her way through space pirates, alien monsters, and the titular creatures known as Metroids.If you're only familiar with the Metroid series through the Metroid Prime games, get ready for a surprise. This port goes back to Metroid's roots, presenting a side-scrolling adventure where you'll jump, shoot, and roll around in a morph ball through mazes and puzzles. The style of game is nostalgic for older players and fun for newer ones. Zero Mission is a good side-scroller in an era where those kind of games are hard to find.Being a port of an old NES game, Zero Mission is a little dated. The difficulty isn't terribly high, and most of the major bosses have a pattern to them that, once discovered, makes bypassing them easily. The game is also on the short side in terms of game play, although to its credit it does include a bonus mission that forces you to sneak through a space pirate lair as Samus without her power suit. These minor flaws get easily erased as necessary consequences of porting such an old game. With excellent graphics, fun game play, and more than a little bit of nostalgia involved, Metroid: Zero Mission is an excellent addition to your GBA library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

These games had great potential as First/Third-Person RPGs but the quality control problems was what prevented the series from ever becomingMorrowind. And what is worse, the game developer (Piranha Bytes) did not learn from its mistakes: as the series progressed, the problems only got worse.So notorious had the GOTHIC series become that the name itself was all but abandoned. RISEN is what GOTHIC 3 was supposed to be (a GOTHIC 3.5 if you will) and GOTHIC 4 will actually be named...\"ArcaniA: A Gothic Tale\"!. Although it was not completely able to escape its pedigree and it may not be at the cutting edge of developments, RISEN is a good game and it is (mostly) fun to play.You start off a castaway with no history but endless potential. There is some wreckage loot but do not get too greedy: veering off to far into the sea will bring a sea monster upon you.The progress is slow at the beginning and your character's initial weakness will tax your patience: expect quite a few deaths early on. However, if you weather out the initial steep incline you will be rewarded with a great cRPG that unfolds as you go on.The graphics are not top drawer but the environments are very tastefully made. And the game designers at least tried to avoid endless repetitions: most environments are original, with a lot of effort put into them.Like THE WITCHER, combat can be very engaging (but without the timed-clicking skill requirements). Where RISEN shines is the quality of its quests, the number and gravity of the choices offered and its story. And any true gamer will attest that those are the aspects that matter most for any cRPG game. After all, the greatest cRPG ever, BALDUR's GATE, hardly had graphics to phone home about.I bought this on the strength of its demo and the mostly positive reviews it received at Amazon (downloading and trying out the Demo is always a good idea). I was not disappointed.RECOMMENDED.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2009"}

For those who played it either loved it or hated it and since then most of them waited for his next big adventure. Nintendo was under intense pressure to deliver something epic for their brand new Wii console and Super Mario Galaxy was released in 2007. Did they deliver? Absolutely!While there is not much of a story behind this game (or any Mario game but that's to be expected), this time around Mario goes from one galaxy to the next one, beating up (classic & new) enemies and using power ups, all to collect stars he will need to reach Bowser. There are many galaxies to explore and they can all be reached via a floating space hub. Collecting stars unlocks parts of the space hub that leads to more galaxies. Get 60 stars and you face Bowser. If you get all 120 stars, you will unlock Luigi as a playable character. Play as Luigi and get all 120 stars and you'll get access to a secret galaxy.The PROS: Just like Metroid Prime 3 Corruption showed what the Wii can do, Super Mario Galaxy doesthe same thing and it shows. This game is beautiful! The presentation is top notch, the controls are spot on (motion gestures are kept to a minimum), the music sets the mood perfectly and the sounds are exactly what you expect to hear in the game. The new power ups are cool and so are the themes for the galaxies you get to explore. There is an incentive to get all 120 stars since you'll be rewarded for all the hard work. Speaking of hard work, SMG is challenging but not overwhelming so it will take you some time before you truly beat the game. This time, there is limited 2 player co op support (though the second player takes control of a little star who can help shoot and collect Star Bits; that's about it.)The CONS: It seems that with every major Mario title, the camera is really the only issue in the game. It's a lot better since the days of Super Mario 64 but it's only slightly better than the camera in Super Mario Sunshine. One day we will get a Mario game where the camera works flawlessly.Do not read what the 1 and 2 star rating reviews say. There are many people who play the Wii but aren't used to the demands of certain games where you do more than just point and shoot so they go ahead and give this game a bad rating. If you've been playing games for a long time and are into more than first person shooting games, then you will see why this game earned glowing reviews and praise. Super Mario Galaxy sold very well and now that it has been lowered to $19.99, it's a perfect time to play it for yourself if you hadn't done so already.

While they're great games and all, they take so long to finish and with a busy gaming schedule this year, it's hard to sink another 40 hours into one game when you could've beat 3 others and had a raucously good time on their multiplayers. However with Valkyria Chronicles, not only did it look stunning but it had a unique way of fighting and seemed to have that certain \"something\" where you probably don't really know what you're getting into but you want it anyway. But we warned, this isn't an RPG to be taken lightly but like a lot of things, the more you put into it then the sweeter the rewards.Story: It's a period meant to feel like Europe in the 1930 though with a couple changes. Europe's divided in 2, The Federation and the Eastern European Imperial Alliance or just simply Empire, the latter of whom tries to do anything and everything to get what they want. What they want is ragnite, a valuable and incredibly useful resource and where it's abundant is the small country in the middle, Gallia, who has ties to neither side. But when the Empire invades and with a strange, powerful race thought only to exist in legend for a weapon, it's up to Welkin Gunther, Alicia Melchiott and several others to bring down the powerful Empire.Graphics: The team behind this game worked on the highly-praised Skies of Arcadia for the Dreamcast and while the art style and character designs are similar, Valkyria is really in a class of its own. Using Sega's Canvas engine, they decide to create a different approach to the visuals and while Okami was made to resemble a painting, Valkyria looks more like a drawing that's being animated at lightning speed and it's gorgeous. Kind of reminds me of the cutscenes for the Final Fantasy Tactics port for the PSP only more colorful. The 3D fighting visuals are also welcome and the \"boom\" and \"ratta\" visuals showing up when you explode something or fire your weapon has a great charm to it. It's not going for realism so don't compare it to tech-heavy games but what it lacks in realistic lighting and photo-realistic characters, it makes up for in style and art.Sound/Music: Ditto for the music which was done by Hitoshi Sakimoto who did the Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story and Odin Sphere soundtracks though he's probably best known (positively or negatively depending on how you see it) as the composer for Final Fantasy XII. The soundtrack here is pleasing and there's some good themes but it doesn't really have any tracks that can stand outside the game but when it's on in the game, it's welcome. Using an option to change the language to Japanese or English and either or, the voice acting is quite well-done though some roles are either overacted or lacking in emotion but I didn't mind either tracks.Gameplay: One can make a case that Valkyria's combat is a 3D version of a chess match, with soldiers and tanks replacing the rooks and queens but essentially here's how it works: a map reveals your position of your characters as well as known enemy positions. You then select who you want to control (which uses up CP, a certain amount of \"moves\" you can make your characters do with tanks taking up 2 of them), game switches to a 3D view and you can run where you want to go which drains an AP gauge and if you run out, you stop permanently till the next turn. Found in the stages are places that could make good cover such as sandbags. When you've found your spot, you can press R1 which brings up your targeting where you can aim where you want to shoot, throw your grenade or to use a first aid on members with low health and after your turn it's best to crouch and end your turn right away to minimize enemies firing back (which is unfair because they counterattack your attack in addition to when your attack is over so they're really getting 2 shots at you so it's best to end your turn quickly).Here's where it gets fun: you basically have 5 classes from standard scouts with decent weaponry to long-range snipers (Marina is my preferred one due to her cute and deadly bad***ness), shocktroopers with assault rifles, lancers who are perfect for nailing tanks and engineers who can either replenish your ammo, fix/build places for cover or provide tank maintenance though they're more susceptible to damage. Knowing who to use and where to use them is key. Should a character lose all their health, they're knocked out but here's the kicker: they'll be gone forever unless you get a member of your team over, a cutscene will show a medic rushing in and that member is taking off the field, still able to be used later but gone for the rest of the battle. While you get many reserves anyway, it's probably best to keep your entire team alive.Speaking of your team, you get 20 people to use in a battle unless stated otherwise in the battle so that can make levelling up tedious right? Wrong. Using the headquarter tab (the whole narrative is played out like a book with pictures on the page being your cutscenes/battles), you can level up your characters in an amusing drill instructor way but should you say level up your snipers, every single one of your snipers levels up as well and not just whoever you use the most. Your equipment can be upgraded for better accuracy, health and whatnot and your tank can be fitted with spare treads should the enemy blast yours off leaving you immobile or strengtening the range of your fire. But don't think this game is immune to grinding as it's best to click the Skirmishes tab and take on the battles which can be fought as many times as you want and it's not just recommended, it's almost necessary since enemies after a certain amount of time will positively own your *** so why not fight fire with fire and make your guys just as tough.I know this fall and winter has been a particularly crowded season, especially those who own all 3 consoles and the 2 handhelds (like me) but I implore you not to miss Valkyria Chronicles. It doesn't have the advertising of Gears of War 2 or the recognition of the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII but this game is well worth tracking down.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

The number one problem that totally annihilated this game is the need for a persistent internet connection to play the single player campaign!  This makes absolutely no sense.  This means that, for those with a shaky internet connection, you will get booted out of the game with no ability to save your progress!  Furthermore, there is no real base building (you have a crawler that you basically take with you and unpack where you want).  No resource gathering (you have what are essentially action points that enable you to build a certain number of units).

McKenzie","summary":"Christmas Comes Early!","reviewText":"UPDATE Nov. 1, 2013 ---> I stand by my original review, but since I posted it, I should report that it's near-impossible to get a multiplayer match going lately.  Also, my New Game Plus playthrough has encountered a glitch where I can't proceed after accidentally retracing my steps, so I now the required door is permanently locked.  Hopefully the upcoming patch will fix these issues.  I still think this is a must-play video game, but I better understand its criticisms.***ORIGINAL REVIEW***So...Batman returns in \"Arkham Origins\" in one of the year's most anticipated releases.  The reviews seem pretty mixed, with the general consensus being that - for better or worse - it's very similar to the two previous \"Arkham\" games that came before.  As for me?  Put me in the camp of those who believe that this is a more than worthy follow-up to the stellar Batman games that came before.STORYLet me be clear right off the bat (no pun intended) that I believe the plot of \"Arkham Origins\" is just as exciting, dense, and action-packed as its predecessors.  However, I think some will be confused or bored with how it starts out.  This game has been advertised as \"Batman vs Black Mask & The Assassins!\" with some bonus side quests thrown in.  The truth is that the story doesn't really go in that direction for very long, nor very often.  Forgive me for the slighty-SPOILERISH note, but Batman does not encounter all of the 8 Assassins in the main campaign.  A few have been moved to the sidequests sections.  I wont say who or why, but I believe that it's worth the tradeoff.  Warner Bros Montreal was wise to keep some of the story's true highlights secret, but the early hour or two of \"Arkham Origins\" gets distracted with seemingly unrelated plot points that might frustrate unprepared gamers.  But I hope you'll take my word that the game's drama pays off in exhilarating ways.  As I reflected when the story was completed, I realized that \"Origins\" has just as many tangents as \"Arkham City\" does.  But just like the earlier games, the storytelling is done in a way that I can believe the over-the-top elements while I'm playing the game, and I was just as moved and intrigued at the game's finale as I was with the earlier \"Arkham\" games.  Like most good stories, I think I'll better appreciate the fan service and plot structure on a second playthrough.It's important to remember that it's hard to enjoy an open world game's plot if you keep exploring the collectibles and side quests.  Of course the plot is going to feel disjointed, because YOU the gamer keep letting your curiosity interrupt your playthrough.  If you just want to follow the main story missions, you can.The \"Arkham\" video games are about Batman having one of the worst nights of his life, with a little dramatic gravitas and pathos thrown in.  \"Arkham Origins\" tells this story with great success.GOTHAM CITY COMPARED TO ASYLUM & CITYOverall, \"Origins\" open world experience is a very satisfying playground, but I have to admit that it isn't as atmospheric as the \"Asylum\" or as filled with details as \"Arkham City\".  In previous games (especially City) I felt that there was an Easter egg or obscure detail around every corner.  This probably had more to do with the Scan Riddles that made you look for a particular object, so you were compelled to explore the nooks and crannies.  While there is still a ton of detail in \"Origins\", I felt that it was buried beneath the winter snow and black/grey skyscrapers.  There's no real incentive to admire the craftsmanship.  Some people have said that Gotham feels lifeless because there's nobody around.  I would add that it's also because the buildings aren't very distinguishable from the other except for obvious spots like the Bridge or interior levels.That being said, the interior levels are just as unique as previous games.  Without giving away too much, you will get to explore an old ship and the Gotham City Police Department early in the game.  What you find inside, and where you get to explore afterwards, I won't give away.  Finally, you can once again expect a large map of collectibles to find (with some clever puzzles for some), plenty of thugs to beat up, and long side quests with good payoffs.  In the early part of the game (sensing a pattern here?), it's tough to tell what's a sidequest and what's a main story mission.  Without giving too much away, at least 3 villains are encountered in the campaign, and then reinserted with their own sidequests.  But thankfully it all pays off well once you get past the confusion.  For example, Anarky's long-winded rant after being defeated is an intelligent dissection of the Batman character.  The rest, I will let you discover.TECHNICAL ISSUESUnfortunately, \"Arkham Origins\" suffers from some polish, at least on my PS3.  Now breathe easy!  We're not talking about game-breaking stuff like Bethesda's \"Fallout\" or \"Elder Scrolls\" titles where quests are permanently broken.  However, we are talking about performance issues (especially with multi-hour play sessions) that I never saw in the first two \"Arkham\" games.  The frame rate drops considerably whenever the game is doing multiple things at once.  If I find a collectible, stumble onto a crime-in-progress, AND don't clear my upgrade screen right away...man the game gets choppy.  \"Origins\" introduces a fast travel system to help navigate the larger map.  The odd part is that there's a brief cutscene showing Batman get into the Batwing to fly off.  This cutscene has NEVER had properly synched video and audio in my 20 hours.  It's almost as if I'm being penalized for not walking and gliding my way around the city.  I also saw the occasional hiccup in the cinematics, kinda like Telltale's \"Walking Dead\".  Not as severe mind you, but noticeable.  I'm not sure what Rocksteady did or didn't do when they made the first two \"Arkham\" games, but Warner Bros Montreal has stumbled onto some new pitfalls that we didn't used to have.  My suggestion is that you disable your online network when going single-player, to avoid pop-up notifications and other 'busywork' your PS3 might not need to do.GAMEPLAYI won't say much about this, because (A) \"Origins\" plays about the same as \"Arkham City\" and (B) a video review will do a better job than whatever I type.  I will say that I think the game does a good job of introducing new players to the experience, but not taking too long for veteran players to get into the experience.  One odd thing is that the Detective and Gadget buttons have been reversed...takes getting used to for veterans.  But it's a small nitpick.  However, I found \"Origins\" to be much harder than the earlier games.  I completed \"Asylum\" and \"City\" with collectibles, challenges, and DLC...and I still found some good challenge in the combat sequences and boss fights.  The enemies will become increasingly better-armed and more clever as the game progresses.  The predator sequences, though, seemed easier than ever.  I never died once during a predator stage, where Batman has to stealthily take out enemies in an enclosed room.  It would've been nice to maybe add a new enemy type or two to these stages. The great thing about both of these level types, though, is that it gives the player a tremendous amount of flexibility in the way they wish to tackle these obstacles.  And the boss battles are just as varied as before, but it's hard to say which ones will be better received than others.  I enjoyed them all, especially the over-advertised Deathstroke encounter early in the game.As for multiplayer, it's fine if a bit unrefined.  I honestly believe I will play it for the Trophies more than the actual experience, but it's nice that the Splash Damage team has given players something to sink their teeth into once they've completed (or tired) of the story mode.  I like that the 3-3-2 setup forces players to focus on different strategies at all times.  Time will tell if the community grows and remains strong for the online mode.FINAL THOUGHTS\"Batman: Arkham Origins\" is an excellent piece of entertainment.  I don't begrudge gamers who find themselves disappointed by the lack of innovation in the gameplay mechanics or find the story uninteresting, but I honestly think they should give this game another chance.  The jump from \"Asylum\" to \"Arkham City\" was a huge change in scale.  How could anyone have followed \"Arkham City\" without dividing the audience?  Warner Bros Montreal wanted to make us feel like Batman at all times.  I doubt there were many other avenues for the team to take without completely changing the gameplay we all love.  They took on the daunting task of telling an origin story that remains consistent with the mythology, refining gameplay that wasn't flawed to begin with, and giving us as much content and fan service for us Batman fans to dive into.Yes, there are missteps, but the \"perfect\" video game does not exist.  \"Batman: Arkham Origins\" was such a wonderful experience for me, I hope others will share my enthusiasm.  ENJOY!2013 - Batman: Arkham Origins -- 9.12011 - Batman: Arkham City -- 9.42009 - Baman: Arkham Asylum -- 9.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000HX1P72","description":"The Darkness gives you awesome and terrible powers, in a new twist on horror-based adventure. On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Play it for the story, nothing more","reviewText":"The Darkness is one of those kind of games where you got to appreciate having it since it feels so radically different from other FPS games. It's got the slight linearity of games like Call of Duty and Fear yet there's some sidequests and exploration to be found but above all, it's completely geared towards its storytelling and atmosphere which is quite impeccable. But in a way some people might not like its pacing since it's not action-intensive as other games and then you'll not even be touching the controller as you stare at something (and even get an achievement for that very thing) but the shooting plus controlling the Darkness is a blast. Just stay away from the multiplayer...it's pretty bad.Story: You play as Jackie Estacado, part of a mob family that gets a hit put out on him during his 21st birthday. While being hunted, Jackie gets ensnared by the Darkness, an evil and powerful spirit that allows Jackie some incredible and destructive gifts at the cost of a constant voice in his head and occasionally being manipulated and controlled. But Jackie is out for revenge anyway against Uncle Paulie, the man who called the hit, and his lackey corrupt police officer Eddie Schrote so having the Darkness as an ally is the gift and curse.Graphics: Graphically the game looks similar to the Chronicles of Riddick with some incredibly realistic and moody lighting and some great art design such as one place you go to during the second act and New York City which for once FEELS like New York City rather than a bunch of buildings that look like its skyline. Character models as well look like actual people however the lip movements are incredibly off and half the time I don't even the see the lips actually moving. The game does look great and is quite memorable because of its unique look though if you were to compare it to say Modern Warfare or other games, it looks good.Sound/Music: What makes the storytelling work is the voice acting which is, quite simply, phenomenally. From Jackie to his girlfriend Jenny to even minor characters you meet along the way (gotta love the dude who sings part of his sentences) and even Mike Patton from the old Faith No More band does an incredibly raspy voice for the Darkness who will be a constant presence in your ear. As far as the music, it's not as prominent but it's there but the ambience is from the chatter and train rumblings of the subway to the moody place you'll go to at times, game also has a great ear.Gameplay: For the most part it's kind of basic. You get weapons which you select by left and right on the D-pad but the fun part is using the Darkness powers. There's 4: the creeping dark, a slithering snake you control (rather horribly I might add) to launch sneak attacks on foes, a tail-like move that'll impale enemies or move objects blocking your path, the Darkness guns and the destructive Black Hole which sucks in nearby enemies. They're all fun to use even with Black Hole becoming your trump card but sneaking up on people and biting their faces off never gets old. There's also a slight RPG element where you consume people's hearts (I like when the 2 heads try to fight for it, left never wins) and that'll level up your darkness powers to of course make you more awesome.Another part of your gift is the ability to summon darklings, little minions you can use to wreck havoc on your foes. From the melee-loving berserker, mini-gun toting gunner, the kamikaze and one who specifically targets lights out and zaps your foes. Speaking of lights, you'll want to shoot them out since they help your powers a lot better and there's even times where you can't take out your powers unless you shoot the lights. This however can make it tedious to always aim for lightbulbs. Another slight flaw I noticed is that Jackie walks.way.too.slow and trying to get close to an enemy to do the awesome execution move and yet he walks like he's got a limp or something. Also at times I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to actually go though at least there's a helpful menu that tells you but more often than not, I'm walking back and forth going \"where am I supposed to go anyway?\"Oh, and if you're into boosting, I'd do it with the Darkness and move on since how do I put this...the multiplayer sucks. The lag and just the general boringness of it all, this is clearly a multiplayer that was added on because developers were afraid people would just rent it, beat it and sell it to Gamestop or something. And wouldn't you know it, there's quite a few achievements in multiplayer for a game with a diminishing community by the day so go you.As a single player game, the Darkness is quite an underrated game with the occasional nitpick but for those into FPS games that are more or less entirely story driven like Half-Life 2 will find some fun here. But longevity, well, that multiplayer still sucks so I'd maybe rent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2009"}

That being said, if you're up to the challenge, it's one of the best games of its kind to be released in recent memory.  Most game review sites gave it high marks, and Gamespot recently awarded Demon's Souls its 2009 Game of the Year award, so it's clear that this game is doing something right.Demon's Souls is basically a combat RPG.  You run around and kill all sorts of different monsters with lots of different weapons and spells, get currency called \"demon's souls\" (hence the title of the game), and use that currency to level up, upgrade your weapons, buy items, learn spells, etc.  The game takes place in five different worlds, each of which has its own style, both artistically and in terms of gameplay.  The game world is one of the most atmospheric in any game I've ever played.  There isn't really much of a story (don't expect anything like Dragon Age or Final Fantasy), but you really do feel like you're in a kingdom being overrun by chaos and evil.The gameplay in Demon's Souls is spot on.  There's a great sense of progression, since you slowly but surely become more and more powerful throughout the course of the game.  A huge amount of the progression doesn't actually come from any statistical boosts, but from simply going through the game, dying a lot, and learning from your errors.  As you learn how to beat different monsters and bosses, you really do feel like you're accomplishing something nontrivial.  There aren't a huge number of weapons (maybe a few dozen?), but they each have a distinct role in combat, and the game really forces you to think about which weapons and armor you want to use.  You'll find that there isn't one best answer; rather, the best equipment and spells to use will depend on your playstyle and the monsters you need to fight.  One of the great things about Demon's Souls is that there are all sorts of different ways to progress through the game.  The boss fights in this game are fantastic - they involve lots of different sorts of crazy, mostly huge, monsters, some of which seem overwhelmingly powerful at first, but which upon closer inspection have their weak spots.Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Demon's Souls is the multiplayer system.  It's kind of hard to describe, but it involves you either helping or fighting other players by invading their worlds as a \"phantom\", or by leaving notes on the ground.  You can also touch other players' bloodstains to see how they died, which might serve as a warning for you.  You can't chat with other players, but this really adds to the atmosphere of the game.One of the most frequent complaints about this game is the difficulty.  It's true, this game is hard, but not unfair hard.  There are ways to beat every monster in the game using the tools available to you, and if you take the time to be patient and learn from your errors, you'll find that the game isn't unreasonably difficult.  That being said, Demon's Souls is more demanding than almost any other game out there, and probably isn't appropriate for more casual gamers.  If you're unsure if your skills are up to the task, try playing the game at a friends or renting it first.  The first few levels are pretty indicative of the difficulty of the rest of the game.Demon's Souls isn't a perfect game, but the flaws are all minor.  I don't know if this is the best game I've ever played on the PS3, but it certainly is one of the best games currently available for the system.  If you're unsure about whether this game is for you, rent it first, but I'm sure that many people will be pleasantly surprised with Demon's Souls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"TigerBite","summary":"\"Endure and Survive...\"","reviewText":"In my opinion, The Last of Us, is a better game than the Uncharted series. Don't get me wrong I do love Uncharted but The Last of Us delivers more. This game was the THE best game I have played in a while. The story is strong, gameplay is solid, and the visuals are stunning. I'm not gonna go in-depth on this review because I tend to write too much. Instead, I'll just go through the pros and cons of the game.Pros:* Strong storyline.* Gameplay is smooth, everthing works well.* Steady-paced.* Hand to hand combat (it's just so satisfying to beat the crap outta someone.)* Damage from gunshots deal alot of damage. (I like it, my opinion. Makes it more difficult.)* Realistic scarcity of items.* Amazing visuals, a step above Uncharted.* Smart human AIs.* Long story (nearly took me 18 gameplay hours to complete the game on Normal.)* The suspense (Oh how I love the suspense!)* Ellie's attitude :)Cons:* Placement if AIs can be stupid (ex. During a stealth mission, all the guards are looking the other way making it TOO easy to stealth kill them all.)* \"Listening Mode\" Hold R2 and reveal locations of enemies through walls. Makes things too easy though it can be turned off in the Options.* Fall and Winter chapters are short (You play through all four seasons.)* Like most games, predictable encounters. (Ex. No enemies around *Turns on generator* Enemies pop up like crazy!)* Repetitive puzzles. (Ex. Finding a ladder/dumpster so you can climb up and over the wall will be one that appears the most.)* No announcement of The Last of Us 2Despite all the cons I listed, this is still an amazing game and you should'nt be let down just because I listed those cons. I find them only to be a minor problem. The Last of Us does have multiplayer but I'm not really a fan of third-person shooters online. FPSs are more me but I do play The Last of Us multiplayer from time to time. Basically you can choose a faction and go online to compete in raids and such to gather supplies for your group of survivors. Right now I'm Week 1, Day 4 into my MP, and I have 12 survivors in my group. I don't really know in-depth how it works but I will update when I get the hang of things.Anyways this game is worth your money or if you don't want to but it now, a price drop is surely inevitable. There was never a part in the game that I didn't like (not counting the cons.) There are some games that when I replay them, I get to a part where I'm like \"I don't wanna go through this part again!\" or \"I hate this part in the game, why can't I skip it!\" No, I loved every minute of it. I think it deserves Game of the Year award AND a sequel, please hope there is a sequel because this game is a masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"Excellent Game Despite All The Bad Reviews","reviewText":"If you are a fan of the Call of Duty series there is no way you can dislike this one. I understand that a lot of reviews here on Amazon give Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 a negative review and a low score and honestly I do not know why that is. I read over 10 negative reviews and while the complaints are legitimate nearly no reviewer has it marked as a verified Amazon purchase, which means they did not even buy the game here on Amazon. If not, then why come review it here? I thought it is only fun to review a product if you bought it. I think there is a negative sentiment against Call of Duty because some people are annoyed with it and simply didn't get it, or never liked it from the start.Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is indeed very similar to its predecessors such as Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops. It is the same base engine, though fine tuned to perform better than before. The missions are similar to previous games, with lots of explosions, screaming, and outrageous chases and I think that is fine. The single player campaign offers many interesting scenarios and unexpected plot twists. Some aspects are cliche of course. It is like watching live action GI Joe with a bit more realism. This installment still has the same shocking moments that may have shocked us in Modern Warfare 1 (COD4). But this is more than made up for by very nice graphics when you compare this to other modern games. The game runs on stable 60 frames per second, very smooth and without a hitch. You get to fight in exotic locations such as Paris, India, and Africa.Of course it is true that some textures and animations are re-used from the previous Call of Duty games. Some death animations are the same as before, some buildings have the same textures as in earlier games, but I do not see that as a problem at all. The voices of enemies screaming in Russian are greatly improved. I speak Russian and heard immediately that there are more different phrases coming from the Russians. In fact they now include very bad profanities in Russian, which are more of a conversational taboo than in English language. The animations of dying enemies are more diverse than before.The plot is so so, it is continuation from Modern Warfare 2 which has Russia invading USA and Europe. You get to fight Russians and some Africans. Not very impressive, but the gameplay that comes from it is more than satisfactory.Some reviewers complain that the maps in the Multiplayer portion of the game are not very good. One in particular says that there are too many narrow claustrophobic places like corridors and hallways and not enough open spaces. In my opinion it is simply not true. In fact I noticed that Infinity Ward made sure that almost every map has good locations for snipers. For example you could go into one of the dark rooms in a middle eastern sandy map (the one that resembles dust in counter strike) and you'll see one or two clear visibility lines where enemies run through frequently. Of course the more you cooperate with other players on your team you will see the excellent design of the maps more clearly. If you stick out the window to snipe some opponents you'll need one person to cover the entrances behind you to prevent the foes from stabbing you.Some of the annoying things in the game include lack of blood. How can an M rated game like Call of Duty almost have no blood? Even World At War made by Treyarch had body parts after explosions and more realistic blood effects.

{"product_name":"B009EWHKAI","description":"The popular fantasy action franchise Monster Hunter is now one of the most iconic gaming series in the world selling over 21 million copies worldwide since the series began in 2004. Players take on the role of a hunter and are sent to explore a settlement within the Monster Hunter universe, completing quests on their journey to seek and slay monsters whilst improving their skills and earning equipment upgrades. With many challenging monsters and over 200 quests the latest edition to the series is set to be the most expansive offering to date. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate utilizes the functionalities of the Wii U console to provide players with a truly intuitive hunting experience. The touch screen feature of both platforms allows players to quickly access in-game books, weapons, field maps and mini games whilst the high quality graphics of Wii U powered by the latest iteration of Capcom's MT Framework deliver a unique and stunning world for players to explore. Wii U players will be able to enjoy the hunt with Nintendo 3DS players via a local wireless connection. Gamers that own both a Wii U and Nintendo 3DS can take advantage of the inter compatibility of save data between the two consoles, taking the hunt from the living room wherever they go.","reviewerName":"Phoj","summary":"Hunting monsters was never more exhilarating!","reviewText":"I had Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii which I understand is very similar to this version; minus some monster/equipment additions.Overall it looks nice on the Wii U while playing exactly the same. It's what I expected as in it's basically the same game dressed up a bit more while having content additions.You start off pretty slow in the adventure. You're restricted to few weapon/armor choices. That quickly changes as you begin hunting, and gathering resources from your kills as well as plant life, or metal ore.It won't be long until you're accepting one of the many quests catagoriezed by difficulty level associated to your characters strength. You'll face monsters on the ground and even under water; all of which of varying sizes.Some enemies will be tiny, while others enormous. It's very exciting for the first time entering the map with a monster that could easily eat your character in one gulp!If you havn't had the opportunity to enjoy a Monster Hunter game, I would recommend picking this one up. That is if you enjoy action rpg's where you gather resources and have the opportunity to create your own weapons and armor. The choices there are vast.Overall a good game to own on the Wii U.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"more Castlevania","reviewText":"My biggest problem with Dawn of Sorrow is that it wants to be Symphony of the Night *so bad* that it actually ends up missing the mark by quite a bit.First of all, there's an assortment of problems with this game.  I grew up with Symphony of the Night from the Playstation 1 and let me tell ya- THAT game is an absolute masterpiece in every way imaginable.  Back when it came out, everyone knew there was something incredibly special about it.  Symphony of the Night is the kind of game that only comes along once in a blue moon.  The kind of game that does just about everything right, making it extremely hard (almost impossible) for the Castlevania series to ever reach that kind of greatness ever again.Keeping Symphony of the Night in my thoughts the entire time I was playing through Dawn of Sorrow, this game had major expectations, most of which fell short, BUT not enough of a fall for me to claim Dawn of Sorrow is a complete failure.  Nope, not at all.I personally have a major problem with the countless amounts of text you have to witness in the beginning of the game.  I mean LOTS and LOTS of text.  One of the main reasons Symphony of the Night was such a charming game is because you didn't have to read through all kinds of unnecessary text- you simply jump right into the game and play it.  Konami made sure SOTN was playable for everyone, Castlevania fans or otherwise.It's not that the story in Dawn of Sorrow is bad and all that text reading is boring as a result, it's just that, Symphony of the Night was able to become a timeless classic without having to rely on the player reading text upon text, so Dawn of Sorrow misses the mark there and HAS to be seen as somewhat of a disappointment in comparison.  If this game is supposed to be a combination of RPG and action elements similar to the Zelda series, well once again, Symphony of the Night was able to do it better.Also, the enemies in this game are pretty much nothing but the *same exact enemies* we'd already seen and loved in Symphony of the Night.  I fail to see why we have to deal with exact replicas of the same enemies once again.How can it be possible to carry the same kind of excitement in a sequel when all we're doing is fighting the same enemies all over again?  We shouldn't have to- Konami should have found some developers who were willing to lend their creative ideas for more variety in the enemy department.  Folks, I kid you not-  most of the enemies in Dawn of Sorrow can be found in Symphony of the Night doing their same routine once again.  Those skeletons that throw flame barrels?  Well they're all OVER the place here.  I can pretty much run down a list of enemies in both games and conclude there's just way too many of them in this game that simply don't belong.  When you first encountered these same enemies in Symphony of the Night, it was truly an incredible experience because you've never seen anything like them before.  Dawn of Sorrow has that \"been there done that\" vibe mostly because of the enemies, but also because of the gameplay.Which leads us to the next problem- the animation of the enemy movements (and the way they die) aren't nearly as good as the ones in Symphony of the Night.  Everything moved in such a fluid and near-perfect way in Symphony of the Night, but unfortunately this game comes up way way short thanks to some unnecessary choppiness in the animations.  Watching enemies die isn't nearly as thrilling either.The gameplay is NOT as much fun this time around since we're dealing with the same enemies and movements once again.  I don't know what went wrong.  If anything, now it feels like we're playing a cheaper or watered down version of Symphony of the Night.  Unacceptable.The weapons are alright, but they aren't animated as nicely as the sword swings from Symphony of the Night.  I feel a bit of choppiness in each swing that makes the game feel tacky most of the time.  Also each weapon really stood apart in Symphony of the Night (except for a few swords here and there) but in this game, most of the weapons blend together and there's hardly any truly memorable ones.The areas themselves aren't that great to explore either- one place has these square rooms and number puzzles that end up being a nightmare of confusion and annoyances, something Symphony of the Night avoided entirely.The boss fights are a LOT worse than the ones in Symphony of the Night.  These ones are almost terrible in comparison.  Just swing at them as quickly as you can with your sword until they die.  No strategy or anything involved, and especially no creativity as far as dodging boss attacks are concerned.  Completely uncreative.  The bosses don't really feel like much of a fight either because most of them have only a couple attacks and that's it.  Play Symphony of the Night for a solid year and you'll STILL be surprised when a boss throws a new attack at you that you haven't seen before.With all these complains, the game DOES do one thing right- the game is loaded with action.  Lots and lots of action, at almost every single turn.  Perhaps even slightly more than Symphony of the Night.Unfortunately, this game comes up way short compared to Symphony of the Night.  Dawn of Sorrow doesn't have the crisp graphics, fluid animations, incredible weapon variety, or incredible soundtrack that SOTN had (though the music IS quite catchy in this game I admit).In addition to these problems, Dawn of Sorrow seriously feels like playing as Zero from the Mega Man X series thanks to the way the main character spins around and slashes at enemies with his sword.  It's TOO reminiscent of Zero from the X series.  Plus the anime style graphics were a bad idea.  It's been done a thousand times, and it doesn't belong in Castlevania.  Just not a classic game in my mind, but if we ignore many of the problems and focus on all the action (and of course ignore the fact Symphony of the Night completely smears it) this is a pretty good game despite its many flaws.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2006"}

Aliens are unleashed, causing havoc, you take out their HQ, find out that you need to \"finish the fight\", cliffhanger ending. I hate cliffhanger endings, but I will say, at least we didn't get a \"To be continued...\" generic ending like Rainbow 6: Vegas. The ending of this game is more like the Marvel movies. They tell you right at the end that there will be another game. Can we please do something more original? It's the 21st century! The story puts you in the role of a soldier from the US, taking out Koreans on one of their islands. Upon traveling through their land, you begin to notice strange crafts flying around, even capturing one of your squad members (who actually do nothing in the game aside from talk to you). The rest I can't really reveal because it may ruin it for some, but you'll have the same \"I knew that was coming...\" as you would in any Halo game.The first few missions are probably the best in the game, aside from one of the last missions. You really get to experience what the designers put into the game. One of the biggest things in the game is the ability to pick up random items from the ground and tables. There's almost unlimited ability to what you can pick up. This really isn't a revolutionary feature, as an older, much more generic shooter did this in the 90's called Trespasser. It wasn't the best game, but it's feature of hurling a rock that you found on the ground or a stick and hurling it at a raptor was all fun. The problem with Crysis' items is the lack of really. There's a dozen items you can pick up ranging from broken garbage, barrels (those generic things used in every shooter), and animals. There's also a lot of generic items inside Korean huts, such as fruit or bottles. It's a nice feature, but really hardly used in the game for a purpose other than a certain \"wow\" effect. For instance, when you're in the middle of the game, you'll almost have deja vu on how much of the stuff is the same, like the one hut you'll run into several times through the game. It's the hut that is fun to blow up but after a few times of blowing up the only hut in the game, it loses that coolness effect. Maybe next time, we'll get two or three huts and houses to blow away.The graphics are outstanding, but at a very steep price. The game is a powerhouse of a game and you're really lucky (or rich) to have the game with everything running on Very High with 30 frames per second. PC Gamer claims that games have been doing this for a while, and it just means that the game wasn't meant to be running at full graphics at this time. Well, that's fine and dandy but after you beat the game a few times, you probably won't care about it afterwards. (I'll explain later). If you don't mind setting the graphics (or at least just the shaders) to medium, then the game should run outstanding with very little choppy frames. The game on medium looks fantastic and is something to really be admired. One of the best graphical features in the game is the water effects. They're absolutely stunning, especially with the settings set to the highest. Water flying through the air and hitting the bloom effects in the game create a realistic rainbow effect that is just wonderful to look at. The trees at really good looking too. Throwing a grenade in a mix of them will cause the most realistic looking effect on the way the tree moves around that I've ever seen. As far as character models and such, the game is top notch.AI is one of the big problems in the game. At first they seem really smart, but once you master the suit you wear, you'll quickly find out that jumping into the invisible mode is basically the best option for crowded combat. You can jump in and out of it so fast that it quickly confuses the enemies, making them just as dumb as a game from the early 90's, if that. Some of the aliens you fight toward the end are so dumb, you literally can run right past them in some of the difficulties. I'm not sure why critics have been saying this game revolutionized the AI, because it really didn't. It's about as well done as Call of Duty 4, being it's a little too easy to outsmart your enemies. Really, really easy. Speaking of the suit, though, that is probably the best feature of the game. It actually gives you a strategy on how you're going to go at something.The mulitplayer is fun, although it's the same as Far Cry. The maps are well designed and the combat gets really intense at times. Overall, it's just the same thing we've been doing, but with better graphics. The one really big letdown is the lack of object physics in the multiplayer. I'd have lover to hurl bananas at my foes for that No One Lives Forever humor. Crysis is pretty cool for a show and effects of what we can do, but with it's generic story and horrible AI, I can't see this game revolutionized the gaming industry. Pretty graphics are not revolutionary unless they do something for you. BioShock revolutionized story telling; Half-Life 2 revolutionized physics... what did Crysis really do aside from show us that our computers need some new upgrades? I really hope that the team works harder on Far Cry 2 and puts out a terrific game with beautiful graphics and a top-notch multiplayer.Also, DRM.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}

It uses a very similar engine, island design and science-fiction type atmosphere to produce what has to be one of the top edge-of-your-seat frenzied blasters ever. You play platoon member Nomad who wears a special Nano suit that gives him extraordinary powers such as maximum armour, strength and speed that allow him to behave in superhuman ways as he is sent to a mysterious island to find out why the local militia has started a hotbed of fighting over something unexplained from another dimension. Cue lots of mowing down trees with high calibre rifles to floating around inside extraterrestrial spacecraft trying to pick off shark-like aliens.Crysis is a two part FPS starting off with island village raids, developing into full scale war maps to eventually become a science-fiction deep space boss beating battler. While it may start off a bit slow as the story progresses (and your guns get bigger) it takes some interesting turns and the graphics and virtually film-like in places. The design inside of the alien ship has to be best level design for any game, ever. In fact like FarCry it is the island and the spaceship that are the stars.While Crysis is simply a must have for any FPS fan, especially those who enjoyed FarCry, it does have some failings. The first is that the graphics are so overkill even on a high-end machine with the latest tech you will not be able to run some parts on anything more than medium settings, especially the cut scenes and the end boss battle. Even on a quad-core with an 8800 card only SLI will stand a chance at greater than medium settings for certain parts. So quite simply many people will not be able to play Crysis and no one has played it on the very highest settings because those PCs are not on the market. The other failing is that for some reason the first quarter of the game is quite boring as you just seem to be raiding village after village doing the same stuff over and over again. It takes a few levels, maybe 4, before Crysis actually kicks in.All in all this is a well made FPS game with lots of new ideas, many features to come to terms with and replay value. FPS lovers shouldn't hold back on trying to play Crysis, the question is if the world was really ready for it but when it will be Crysis will go down as a game that showed that there are no limits to how the FPS can evolve.Pros:GraphicsThe islandThe alien shipGuns and Nano suitCons:High spec requirements are beyond even the best of PCsBoring 1st quarterAI underperformance at times","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2008"}

More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Jeff A.","summary":"the best first person shooter of all time...","reviewText":"...for it's timeGoing back and replaying this game is weird and fun. it's fun to see how bad the graphics were, and how you didn't see it that way back in the day.considering how easy it is to buy old games, this is a must buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

It's the only video game I have ever received for Christmas so it was quite an appreciated gift! Nevertheless hard times caused me to part with the DC original for some quick cash. I was relieved when they announced the title for the GameCube, with some additional material.While there are a few new elements added to the saga I must confess that by and large the game is largely true to the original, which can be both good and bad. In the ways its good is that the story remains largely unchanged, and what has changed helps to advance the story. However the game's graphics have not been enhanced much at all, and on my TV (Wide screen, HD, and 53\") the graphical flaws can really stand out. While the colors seem more vibrant, but there is visible rendering quite close to the main character as he navigates the game. The scenery looks muddy, but smoothes out gradually as Vyse approaches, and you can actually see the lines render the graphics. This was an eye sore in the original, and I had hoped Sega would fix it, but they didn't. Character models are far from impressive by today's standard, and let's face it; the day of random encounters is long past. Games like Chrono Cross and Xenosaga have shown an encounter system that is a lot more fun. Battles in Skies can go for a very long time, but that doesn't mean they aren't fun. I just wish I could skip the opening animations for the battles.Despite the games flaws its still a fun story, with loveable and memorable characters.

One thing that impressed me the most is the views of the city you get,is like you actually are seeing a devastated city, the controls at first are a bit confusing, but after 30 minutes of play time you'll get the hang of it with out problems, you get to use weapons, like guns. grenades, machine guns, but the fun part is to only use the bionic arm, which that will take a bit longer, but once you get the hang of it, you'll never use the guns.Hope this helps.Play on!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2009"}

The other 40 goes toward a Wii remote, and if you look at it that way I guess these games don't seem like such a waste.  Unlike Wii Sports, which I think is actually a lot of fun, these simple games seem to be more gimmicks than anything and aimed purely at showcasing the Wii remote.There are several games here--find the Mii, a ping pong game, a fishing game, etc--but I was bored by the time I'd played them all through once.  I'd say the shooting game was the most fun for me--the ping pong had the potential but the controls were a bit awkward and even once I got the hang of it I couldn't find anyone who wanted to play that could control the darn thing well.  The tank game is okay, the fishing game is okay, the pool game feels awkward with the way you move the remote...I could go on, but the point here is that these games just aren't that much fun.  Even with the few amusing minutes I had when I first put the game in I've found the replay value here to be pretty low, and haven't played the game since that first time.Now the big question: is it worth the money?  Well, if I had it to do over again I'd just buy the Wii remote and save the 10 bucks, but I guess if you're looking for some simple games that let you use the Wii remote in various ways this game might provide that.  Just don't expect great amounts of entertainment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2007"}

Get a $40 wiimote and save the $10 for a better game, like a cheap Wario or Rayman game.  Wii Sport is 3x as good as this 9 set of games.  While the physic isn't bad, the execution is lame and you lose interest within a hour.Save your $10 and just get a remote by itself.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2008"}

Bad","summary":"One of the best games this year for the 3DS!!!","reviewText":"I always ask myself what is the hype with pokemon games. I did play one of them years back but never got into the game much. I decided to give try to this and it's blowing my mind. Really great addictive game. Now I'm between Pokemon Y and Animal Crossing everyday cause I love both games. I love the 3D in the game, the background move when I move my 3DS and the 3D is superb. My characters are stack up right now and the extras and multiplayer is really good. The graphics improvement is well noticeable and the music and sound keep you in the game. I don't care how old you are but if you never play a Pokemon before don't do the mistake that I was about to make of not getting the game!!!! Got to catch them all!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007V9QKH0","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"A cautionary tale","reviewText":"This review will be a bit different than my other reviews. Before I go any further, it's important to note that I didn't finish the game. I really wanted to like this game. I did everything in my power to fall in love with it. But when it was all said and done, Dragon's Crown did not meet my expectations. I want to be very specific in regards to who this review is directed towards. It's not meant for those who may have played other beat'em ups recently, nor is it meant for the RPG lover. My review is meant to help the gamer(s) like me. The ones who enjoyed this type of game once upon a time ago, and are hoping to relive some of that Streets of Rage 2 and Double Dragon magic.I played about 14 hours of Dragon's Crown, and the first several hours were fun. However, I started to become extremely bored once I realized I had nothing else in the game to look forward to. Perhaps I unfairly compared this to recent action games that I've played, who knows. But at any rate, I feel it's lacking in several areas, regardless of the genre. I enjoyed it the most when I was fighting alongside one other companion, as opposed to the recommended 3. Once I reached a point where I was pretty much forced to bring along 3 allies (due to the difficulty), the game started to go downhill for me. My character, along with 3 allies, and the various enemies is far too many characters on the screen at one time. I found myself just pressing the attack button over and over, without knowing where I was on the damn screen. This shouldn't happen, regardless of the genre.The other major issue I encountered was the lack luster combat and poor weaponry choice. Hell, even old games like Streets of Rage 2 had better combat (I watched youtube clips to make sure I remembered correctly). I decided to play as the fighter class because I enjoy melee combat a bit more than magic attacks. The melee attacks were limited, and boring. In my humble opinion, if a game markets itself as a beat'em up, said game needs to hang it's hat on combat, and I don't think that happened in Dragon's Crown. As I mentioned, I didn't finish the game. But I'm willing to bet the fighter class never had the option to use another weapon besides a sword. After playing games like DmC, Darksiders, Castlevania, inFamous, God of War, etc - I need a little more.Some of you may think I didn't finish the game because it's a side-scrolling beat'em up RPG, and that's not true. The truth is I didn't finish it because it's a side-scrolling beat'em RPG that wasn't very fun. If you haven't played this type of game since the 1990's, please proceed with caution because it may not be as nostalgic as you think. People that have already played the game or have a preconceived notion about it may not agree with my review, but my review is for those who are thinking Dragon's Crown is comparable to some of those old school classics, and it's really not. It's best for me to stop now because if I continue, I'll end up giving it a one star rating, and I really don't want to do that. Deadpool, you're up next!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}
