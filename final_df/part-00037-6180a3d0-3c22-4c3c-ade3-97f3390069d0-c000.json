{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"JSiph","summary":"L.A. Noire is underrated to me.","reviewText":"L.A. Noire to me seems underrated today. I can see the letdown for the people who got this game closer to when it originally was released because of all the hype it received and especially since it was a Rockstar game. At first glance this game seems like an action/third-person shooter game. However, most of the game is actually an adventure/puzzle game with parts that turn into cover-based third person shooters(mainly side quests like street crime cases or the end to a case).If you can get over the fact that the game is more of a puzzle game, and it does require a lot of thinking and good deductive reasoning during interrogations/interviews, you'll have a great experience.Story:- Set in the late 1940s to early 1950s, the first half of the game focuses on a fictional depiction of &#34;The Black Dahlia&#34; murder, which is put together perfectly and executed nicely in the game. The second half focuses on the main character's post-war problems. I'd say the first half is a lot better than the second half of the game. Nevertheless, this game has mastered a unique way of storytelling, which makes the game ten times better.Pros:- Characters are memorable and unique.- Side quests are actually pretty fun and offer a relaxing break and change of pace from the main story.- Storytelling at its best.- Actually challenging puzzles (mainly interrogations/interviews as one wrong answer can greatly effect the case's outcome).- Immersive atmosphere (it really feels like driving around a 1950s L.A.)- The action bits are extremely fun.- Fast travel- Graphics are basically the same as any other Rockstar game (Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, etc). Shouldn't really effect anything since it is a game and not a movie.Cons:- Driving is really annoying (I guess it's realistic though).- You can skip some cutscenes and you can't skip others.- Interviews/Interrogations take forever if you try to do it right (without cheating).- CollectiblesOther:- I got 1060G on one playthrough with all DLC cases (four extra).- If you're on the border about which DLC cases to get, if you get any and not the Rockstar Pass(gives all four cases), get the electroplating case (they should have put it in the regular game).Buy this game if:- You want to experience a well thought out story- Have moderate patience- Enjoy puzzles- You want to be a copDon't buy this game if:- You want fast-paced, or even medium-paced, action (it's a pretty slow game)- it's more than $20","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Awesome game, except...","reviewText":"I loved L.A. Noire for the first 6-8 hours.  The setting, car chases, gun battles, and interesting stories made it lots of fun to play.  Then a couple things made me lose interest very quickly.  1.) Hand-to-hand combat became impossible somewhere around the time I inserted disc 2.  My character stopped responding when I'd push buttons to punch, dodge, grapple, etc.  It forced me to skip fight scenes.  2.) The stories became very repetitive.  There was little difference from one case to the next.  I'm about halfway through and I think I'll get rid of it while trade-in value is still high, but until I reached those two big obstacles I thought this was one of the cooler games I'd played.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2011"}

It's my own fault for not reading thoroughly, but I'm sure I'm not alone. I initially thought this game was going to be new, as in the levels and world map would be completely different from what we see in Super Mario Bros U. Instead, they are nearly identical. They are not exactly the same, but they are close enough to where I feel as though I am playing the same game. Furthermore, your time is reduced to 100 seconds for each level. This creates a challenge, but it's one of those challenges that I personally do not enjoy. I do not like being rushed. I enjoy taking my time to explore the level thoroughly, instead of running through it 10 times to figure out where everything is.Don't get me wrong. The game is still fun. I still want to beat it. And I love Luigi as a character. I guess I'm just getting bored of the same old same old with all the Super Mario/Luigi games on the Wii and Wii U. I want something new and refreshing. Maybe if they created new power ups or new challenges to the games or new enemies ... just something different.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2013"}

I've been wanting this game for a while now, but it took so long to come out that I forgot about it. It was on sale on the PSN store so I picked it up. All I can say is that i haven't had this much fun in a long time with the move. The story is pretty good, and the game play is a lot better than I expected. Be warned your arm will get tired (I swapped arms, and not only was that interesting but fun), but that is a good thing right? I found myself standing while I was playing and walking like I was in the game. (I need the exercise) I luckily had the other Move remote, and that is the first time I actually used it for anything. I'm glad I had it, because it's much easier than trying to hold the regular controller in on hand. I played a hour straight and would have kept going if I didn't have to go to work. The only negative is sometimes it can be hard to hit a certain target, but I just think I have my camera in a bad spot. Regardless, it is actually very accurate. So if something is \"off\" if you do the exact same move it will go in the exact spot. I hope another sequel comes out.

Now that might suck for some people but there is the option to disarm enemies and shoot them with their own gun which you can do in Assassin's Creed also.  Now by no stretch of the imagination are these games identical.Visually AC is extremely superior but the style and platforming makes this game just as good as AC.Graphically this game is not great.  Im not a fan of boxy pixelated textures. Picture the training arena in assassins creed brotherhood that is pretty much the whole game.Gameplay is great.  Dispite the overall look of this game i enjoy playing through it because of the action and platforming.  The chase scenes are so great that you forget sometimes that this is not free roam and sometimes end up diving off the wrong roof to your death.  As chuckle inducing as it is the first time it gets old around death 5 or so.  At this point you wish the platforming wasn't so harsh in some parts but then again it gives you the illusion that your actually a skilled rooftop runner.Replayability is up there.  I know people who say they played it once and never touched it again but i can see myself giving it more than that.  Twice at the very least to see if i can run through the game not using any guns.Controls were funky to me at first.  L1 is the default jump button and L2 is crouch.  That felt funny to me so i switched it to other side and had to switch back because the action button R2 turned into L2 and now that felt even funnier.  Regardless after getting far enough into the game with the setting that you eventually choose you get used to it.Story wasn't nothing special.  Your sister is setup so you have to find the people who set her up and clear her name all while jumping and running away from cops and baddies.

{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"Still crazy, after all these years...","reviewText":"There's something about this quiet little resort town that seems to draw all the darkness together into one place, all the madness from deep-seated nightmares into one name: Silent Hill. The name itself evokes visions of twisted creatures and primal fears come to life, and it's been this way for years, after four games, several comic series, and a feature film. But here is where it all started, the game that introduced us to the little town of Silent Hill.It begins with a compelling hook -- Harry Mason is driving along a lonely road with his seven year-old daughter Cheryl, when he is driven from the road and crashes. When he regains conciousness, Cheryl is gone, and Harry is stuck in Silent Hill. The rest of the game becomes an increasingly desperate search for Harry's daughter, leading not only into the depths of the town and its many secrets, but also into his own past and into the depths of his sanity.As Harry travels through the town he meets other characters - Cybil Bennett, a police officer also trapped in the town like him, Dahlia Gillespie, priestess of an ancient religion, Lisa Garland, a nurse haunted by something she has seen, and Alessa, a girl who seems to be at the center of the mystery of the town itself. He amasses weapons to fight the many creatures in the town, twisted creations of a demented mind, and finds objects to help him solve puzzles along the way. And as he progresses, he travels between worlds...from this world's dangers to the warped Otherworld of Silent Hill, where nothing seems to make sense but everything is connected.Even playing Silent Hill today, in the time of hyper-realistic games, full-scale production on par with Hollywood, and high-definition graphics, the original Silent Hill still stands the test of time. It is challenging, and production values are high given the limitations of the time it was made. The original Playstation graphics may seem a little choppy by modern standards, but in a way this works for the game too, giving it a surreal quality as Harry's perspective shifts from one reality to another. There is a minimalistic approach to the look of the whole game that works for it rather than against it -- the old concept that the less you show, the greater the potential fear is. Voice acting is a little shaky, but this is more than made up for by the quality of mood-setting sound effects and music which create a constant (and ever-escalating) sense of dread.In the world of survival-horror games, some go for the gore-fest and others for cheap thrills. Silent Hill stands apart, as a game that tells a compelling story and accompanies every moment of that story with a shot of pure, creeping fear. It's not the kind of game to make you feel queasy or get your heart pumping, but it evokes the feeling of shivers running up your spine like cold fingers and skin that doesn't seem to feel comfortable anymore on your bones.There's a reason the very name of Silent Hill makes people quiver just a little. Take a look at where it all began and find out for yourself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2007"}

American McGee took the series and twisted it into a sick gothic horror adventure back in 2000 on the PS1 and PC. The game's atmosphere, art, and overall design was amazing for the time, but everything else was sub-par at best. The game returns 11 years later and with tons of improvements. If you haven't read the books or seen any of the many films or TV shows then you'll be fine. The story is kind of confusing even at the end, but the story is supposed to be. The whole world of Wonderland doesn't really make any sense except the fact that Alice has been locked away in an asylum because she can't get over the death of her sister. She lost her family in a fire that burned her house down, but there are some shady characters around her that seem to be manipulating her. She falls into Wonderland (her own mind) and has to stop the Infernal Train from destroying the place.You get to meet classic characters like the Cheshire Cat, Caterpillar, The Mad Hatter and March Hare, the Door Mouse, The Queen of Hearts and so on. Each character is wonderfully designed for the atmosphere and they are just sick and twisted and unlike anything I have ever seen. However, the game is made up of two main parts: Combat and platforming. Each is equal in flaws, but both are better than the last game and are a lot of fun.Platforming consists of puzzles, shrinking down on the fly to find invisible platforms, hidden keyholes to find hidden items, jumping around, floating, gliding, pulling switches, avoiding traps, heading through obstacle courses. Each level is very unique and looks completely different from the last, but the same elements apply through each level, and towards the end it gets kind of boring and repetitive since it's the same thing over and over without end. The combat and platforming are balanced, but by the end of the game you just get too much of both because the whole game mainly focuses on just that.The combat is fun and violent, but it's very simple with just one button for light attacks and another for heavy. You can use the pepper grinder and tea-pot cannon to shoot, the auto lock-on works well, but overall you can only upgrade your weapons and there aren't enough of them. The hobby-horse is for heavy attacks, the vorpal blade is for light attacks but those are the only four weapons in-game. You slowly acquire them, but I wanted to see more. The combat feels repetitive because there's not much substance to it and the enemies all play out almost the same. Each level has its own unique enemies with different weaknesses, but executing them is pretty much the same for each one.While combat and platforming are the same there are some mini-games tossed in for good measure that are a sigh of relief. These involve sliding puzzles, chess games, 2D platforming sections. These are fun and each level has its own unique mini-game. Speaking of uniqueness that's exactly why I rated this game so high. The art, atmosphere, characters, and everything combined is just so amazing and I have never seen anything quite like it. It's also the fact that something so sweet and innocent like Alice has turned in a screwed gothic adventure (some scenes are really messed up trust me) with dismemberment, cursing, gore, and downright freaky images. That's what I love about Alice so much and you always look forward to new levels to play. Even Alice's dress changes with each level so you can tell there's a lot of detail going into the game. The game technically is a little dated with some pretty bad low resolution textures in spots and there are a few collision detection bugs that can make you restart.If you can get past the repetition and some times very difficult spots then you will fall in love with the game. The game is amazing to look at, the characters are great, and it just oozes creativity. I just wish the combat and platforming wasn't the same through the whole game and lacking in depth.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

It is your basic rpg in that it involves a small group of characters trying to save the world from some sort of catastrophe, you fight random battles, you gain levels, you buy gear, and you trudge through 60+ hours of gameplay to come to the conclusion of a sureal storyline.Features unique to it include its settings in Japan and a typical Japanese high school(playing somewhat like a japanese teenage-life simulator as it were), an intricate and involved set of extra goals that not only lead to a better story, but a stronger group of allies in the battle against evil, and it is probably more dark and somewhat twisted in terms of story content than most typical rpg's these days. Anyone who has played any of the Shin Megami series will already know this, however.To put it plainly, I don't feel the need to go through every aspect of it to give you any indication as to whether you will love it as much as I do, but I will say this.

Now","reviewText":"Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game. While it may not be perfect, I'd consider it a must-have for any gamer.Story: 4.5/5You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop who's sent to take down one of Hong Kong's triads from within. This game has a gripping story that makes you want to keep playing the next mission to progress. Every mission holds great plot significance; no \"filler missions\" here. If I had any complaints, it would be that almost every time you meet up with your police force members, it's the same old \"we should pull you out\" business, making these cutscenes predictable and annoying. The game's ending is somewhat disappointing, considering everything that led up to it.Gameplay: 4.5/5There's quite a bit to do in Sleeping Dogs. Combat starts off simple but grows in complexity as you learn new moves by collecting jade statues and leveling up. You can perform basic combos, execute grab attacks, and use environmental objects for instant finishers. Besides hand-to-hand exchanges, there are also gun fights. The shooting mechanics in this game work, but they aren't the best; for example, accuracy is a small issue since you can't scope in further. The game makes up for this by throwing in a slow-motion system when you vault over cover, always making you feel like a boss. Combat never grows tedious because the developers knew how to space it out appropriately.  I'll go ahead and say that driving in this game is INSANELY fun. The driving controls are very responsive, and Sleeping Dogs even spices up car navigation with some action. You can ram into other vehicles, leap from your current vehicle and hijack one in front of you, and shoot pursuers as you drive. Blowing up the tires of other vehicles never grows old. Lastly, there are chase sequences, which aren't really chases. You'll run after someone trying to escape, vaulting and climbing over obstacles as you go. I say these aren't really chases because the point where you catch your target is predetermined. It's really more like just keeping up with them until you get to the destination, removing the thrill and sense of urgency that chase sequences should elicit. One small complaint I have is that earning points for police upgrades and increasing your Face Level is far too easy, and you'll likely be maxed out on those 75% through the game. Triad points are much more scarce since you can only earn them through the main missions. Some things I would like to have seen that weren't included are stealth sections and more parkour moves (it's basically just vaulting and climbing), but I'm still happy with the gameplay that's present.Side activities: 4/5There's plenty to do in Sleeping Dogs outside of your main missions. Collecting and returning Jade Statues to your dojo unlocks new moves. Praying at health shrines increases your maximum health. By opening lockboxes, you obtain cash. Each collectible serves a real purpose instead of just being for trophies/achievements. Throughout the game, there will also be Favors, which you can complete to increase your Face Level for bonuses. Drug Busts involve beating up a group of thugs, hacking a security camera, and using that camera to apprehend a drug dealer. A few times, you can can go on dates with girls to unlock perks like being able to see collectibles on your map. There are side activities that can be repeated to an extent, like finding and selling marked cars and harassing debtors. Also, unmarked world events crop up if you're in their immediate vicinity. And of course, what good would earning cash be if you had nothing to spend it on? There are plenty of cars to buy and even more clothes. Wearing clothes of a certain set provide bonuses like earning extra XP and dealing more damage. Then there are secret vendors who will sell upgrades to your apartments. Some gripes I had with the side activities are that opening lockboxes becomes very tiresome because of a combination-finding minigame and that side missions simply aren't fun sometimes. There are 20 car deliveries, which grow very old very fast, and Favors are often short but too similar to some you've done before.Setting/atmosphere: 5/5Hong Kong is a joy to explore. There's a very authentic feel. You'll hear Chinese and English dialogue mixed beautifully together, and you'll find Chinese and American songs on the radio as you drive around. Food vendors are all over the place, providing you with stat boosts. You can even sing karaoke! Overall, there's so much detail here that you can't help but feel like you're really in Hong Kong. The voice actor for Wei Shen does an amazing job. I find it odd, though, that he never actually speaks Chinese, but it is what it is.Technical side: 4.5/5For the most part, the game performs excellently. There are some outstanding issues I should point out, however. It's not unusual for the sound to turn off just for a brief moment when you crash violently or when you enter slow motion sometimes. And no, this is not intentional-it's a bug. The cutscenes are a little choppy, but it's not unbearable. Some bad pop-in is noticeable at times.Overall: 4.5/5Sleeping Dogs is an incredible experience that's very deserving of your time. It's not especially long for an open world game, taking a completionist about 30 hours to beat. At any price $20 and below, this game is a steal. Don't miss out!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2014"}

Either you're the fellowship, struggling to destroy the ring, or you are working for the lands of Mordor, hoping to conquer all.The game is very much like its Command & Conquer and Warcraft predecessors. You get to choose a side, and then use strategy and warfare to reach your goals. You harvest food, build barracks and stables, and track your progress. As your troops move across the land, you uncover more terrain.The graphics are relatively well done, with rolling hills, trees, flying birds, and appropriate buildings based on the locations. You end up in the Mines of Moria, Lothlorien, and other well known locations. You often include key members of the story in your parties, from Aragorn to Legolas to Eomer and more.There is an overview mode where you can choose which territory to work on next, and as you progress through the game you build up your units and your skills. In addition to the main objectives, there are often bonus objectives to give you extra tasks to aim for.Because of this combination of overall scope and individual battle, the game is much more epic feeling compared to other games out there. The game isn't \"realistic\" in its graphics but they do draw you into the game. Of course having the game set in Middle Earth is a huge advantage for us fans of the Lord of the Rings story! It is great fun to play a strategy game and see Rohan cavalry thunder across the screen :)When you work on setting up a strategic situation, and then watch as hundreds of your troops take on hundreds of the enemy, in a true middle earth setting, it really is a thing of beauty.Perhaps the only downside is that occasionally you end up with a storyline different than the books - but isn't that the point of the game? If you knew what was going to happen, there'd be no point in playing ...Highly recommended for strategists who enjoy the Lord of the Rings world!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

You and 3 friends (or bots) team up against a zombie apocalypse that has ravished possibly the world. There's no puzzles, get key to enter room or deep plot, it's grab a gun and try to make it to the next safe house for rescue. You murder tons and tons of zombies to get from point A to point B, while this may seem like it can get old really fast to some the game is different each time you play it with enemies in different spots, there are NO scripted events in this making replay easy. The game is only gets better with more players, making it more of an intense experience. To really throw a wrench into you surviving, there's 6 boss character zombies which are not as common as the horde but are a lot more deadly.The PC version holds more hope to me because Valve always does updates for their games adding levels, gameplay modes and weapons. Though they will probably update the 360's content it's likely that it would cost money. The other big plus for the PC version to me is others can make levels and such for the game as well if they know about editing half life 2 content. A few Team Fortress 2 levels have already been added.If you're looking to murder tons of zombies trying to make it to rescue this is a game for you, if you're looking for depth and puzzles you may want look elsewhere.

And this time, he is after his daughter that he believed had been dead all of these years.Fisher has left Third Echelon and wishes to be left alone...but, as seems to be the case with highly trained killing machines, reality keeps dragging him back into the fray. It turns out that the same thugs who killed his daughter are now planning a major attack on the nation's capitol, and Sam is called back into action to head them off at the pass.Now, suffice to say, Sam Fisher is not a man you want angry at you. While somewhat aged, he is still the baddest dude in gaming. He looks suitably grizzled and has the appropriately gravelly voice of Michael Ironside reprising his role. The writing is actually quite good as you see a world-weary and beaten-down Sam Fisher discover a new reason to live and to perform as only he can. This is as realistic a tale of revenge as gaming has ever been able to produce and the game, while not terribly long, will happily take you along for the ride.The game is a technical marvel. While the load times for levels can go on for a while, after the level loads, you don't load again unless you die. The entire level is available with no apparent load times anywhere, yet the levels all look stunning with the series' signature outstanding lighting effects. Your objectives are all flashed on the environment near you in one of the nicer looking visual effects in a while. The game is linear as the day as long, but you are pushed forward with such relentless force that you could probably beat the game in a sitting and not even notice that it is several hours later.The biggest change, though, is the vibe of the game. While stealth is still a major component, the action is ratcheted up tremendously. You CAN pull off running and gunning (it'd be hard, admittedly, but it is doable) through a level. Everybody is scared of you, given that your rep has very much preceded you into this title. If you melee a man down, you get to utilize Sam's execution technique, which allows you to target up to 4 men later in the game and kill them all in one fell swoop in an act that makes the game more strategic than one would expect.As expected, the story is not remotely as clear cut as initially told. You grow to realize that you have been lied to for a while now and Sam's target for revenge spreads out over more and more people. But, at no point, does it seem illogical. His motivations are quite understandable and you hope to see him achieve his goalSplinter Cell has spent a while trying to match up to the greatness of Chaos Theory and they seem to have pulled it off here. The single player is a blast. While I didn't get a chance to try it, the co-op is apparently a companion to the original story and, by all accounts, is quite good. There are several other game types rounding out the package, making this the ultimate Splinter Cell title to date.Which is odd, since it feels so different than Splinter Cell titles. You don't have to be super careful and you seem much faster than you were in past titles. It's been called a \"24\" ripoff, and it might well be...but that is hardly the same thing as saying the game isn't really good. I am curious as to what the original design of the game was planned to be (it changed a lot from the earlier builds), but I cannot say that they didn't make this game almost as good as it can be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Andrew K.","summary":"Welcome To The Madhouse","reviewText":"From Rocksteady studios, who's only previous credit comes in the form of 2006's budget title Urban Chaos Riot Response, comes Batman: Arkham Asylum. While Batman: Arkham Asylum might not be perfect, but it's definitely the best game to feature the Caped Crusader.If you're a fan of the Batman universe, you'll fall in love with the story. The story is penned by Paul Dini, a former producer and writer for Batman: The Animated series, and a man who clearly knows him his Batman. The story picks up just as the Dark Knight has captured The Joker, and is delivering him to the famed Gotham madhouse. Batman notices something suspicious, however, as The Joker didn't put up much of a fight, and, alas, he is quite right. When The Joker arrives at Arkham, all hell breaks loose, and he's the man behind it all. The events of the game will follow Batman's night in the asylum as he tries to put an end to The Joker's rampage. The plot throws in quite a number of characters from the Batman universe, and even the few who aren't included are referenced. During your adventures in the madhouse, you can find a ton of material about pretty much all of the significant characters in the Batman mythos from their background on down to their first comic book appearance. The game's main plot is fully featured as is, and all the extras will be sure to please any comic book fan.Arkham Asylum offers quite a number of gameplay elements, and pulls them off well. To put the core experience in simple terms; it's a lot like a Metroid game. You'll venture through the asylum, eager to explore as much as you can until you find a certain key item. You then use said item to venture further into the environment.But of course, what you do along the way is very important, and luckily Arkham Asylum has quite a variety of activities. To survive the Asylum with as many goodies in tow as possible, you'll have to fight, sneak, inspect, and explore. Arkham Asylum truly packs a lot of variety, but unfortunately falls for the old \"jack of all trades, master of none\" type deal.Combat and sneaking are both entertaining, and especially fun to watch, the problem is, however, it takes a while for either of these systems to get especially deep.The game's Freeflow combat system only consists of a few basic button presses at the start of the game, and one can easily dispatch most foes while just sticking to those few button presses; if you want to make things a little more complex, you'll pretty much only be doing it for the extra points.The stealth system falls in the same category. It's fun, but it's basic, you really only need your few basic takedowns and gadgets, and anything you do beyond that is superfluous.Exploration, however, is the meat of this game's fun factor. Arkham Asylum is huge, and at any given time you'll have a fair amount of free reign in terms of areas to explore. But what drives you to want to search every nook and cranny of the Asylum are the 240 riddles one Edward Nigma has set up for you around Arkham Island. These riddles will range from simply platforming to find question mark icons the Riddler has scattered about, or actually solving some riddles that can range from simple to devilishly tricky. Venturing throughout the island with all of Batman's gadgets is fun enough as is, but these riddles really serve to flesh out your experience.The game also features 8 Challenge Maps, unlocked by either progressing through the game, or solving riddles. These Challenge Maps recreate certain fighting, and stealth sequences found throughout the game, and each map consists of one round of brawling, and one of sneaking. Each map also features a ridiculously tricky \"Extreme\" mode counterpart which are sure to keep diehard fans occupied for a while. Your scores on each Challenge Map are also uploaded to online leaderboards, which is a nice touch for the particularly competitive players out there. Also, since I'm doing this review for the Playstation 3 version of the game, it's also worth noting that it features a playable Joker on the Challenge Maps, who is quite fun to tinker around with, but at the end of the day simply isn't cut out for the job as the Caped Crusader is.The graphics in Arkham Asylum are a mixed bag. The environment itself is beautiful, and surprisingly varied. The animations are superb as well, especially for Batman's Freeflow combat segments, which you might at first glance think is choreographed. But, unfortunately, not everything is so hot in the graphics department. For one, the character models, while stylized, need some work, and the animations for all non-Batman characters are stiff. But still, this game has a perfectly good graphics department.The sound on the other hand, is excellent. The game features awesome sound design, which is masterfully showcased throughout the Scarecrow segments of the game, and the sound effects as a whole are all very well done. What steals the show, though, are the voice talents. Much of the voice cast from Batman: The Animated series returns, and reprise their respective roles in top form, the standout being Mark Hamill's terrific performance as The Joker.The story mode in Arkham Asylum will last you about 10-12 hours if you try to get through while minimally working on riddles. If you do choose to pursue a good portion of the riddles, you'll likely see a pretty huge increase in the number of hours you'll sink in. The Challenge Maps also provide for a good bit of entertainment, and as previously stated, will be especially addicting for the perfectionist gamers out there.Arkham Asylum is a great game, it combines tons of different gameplay elements fairly well, has a great story, plenty of extras, good production values, and a surprisingly high replay value. While there are some flaws, mainly in the form of certain gameplay elements that are too basic, and some minor graphical issues, Batman Arkham Asylum is easily the Bat's best video game adventure. Here it is: the best game of this summer. If you're a fan of action adventure games, or of the Batman universe, you owe it to yourself to check out Batman: Arkham Asylum.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

I have just finished the game and can say it is more of the same.  The first game is a bit fuzzy in my memory, but I can't recall any major differences with the new game other than perhaps some new enemies.  The game reminds me a bit of Dead Space and Resident Evil 5 in that ammo and health kits are scarce and you are forced to carefully choose your weapons to match your foes.  The maps are big for plenty of exploration.  There is not much variety in the enemies, but the tasks are varied just enough to keep the game exciting.However, my biggest problem with the game is that it is glitchy.  I started the game and played for a few hours and saved.  When I came back to the game all of my saves and acheivements were gone from my hard drive.  I had to start over from the beginning.  Toward the end of the game during a hectic battle, both of my arms disappeared and I became invulnerable.  While this may sound cool, I could not do anything.  I had to restart from a previous save and replay a hour or so.  There was a final glitch toward the very end of the game where I had to get to an escape ship after completing several tasks.  I got to the ship and waited, but nothing ever happened.  I once again had to restart and replay about an hour.  If the glitches are fixed, I can recommend the game and would give it 4 stars.

I also hate that, like $1.99 iPhone games that you can pay to advance further. C'mon, we paid $60 for this, don't nickel and dime us.In all fairness, that's a reason for me to never buy another Turn 10 title.In more all fairness, it is a good looking fun game up to a point and a nice way to show your friends what your new xBox One can do, but it's still very, very disappointing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2014"}

At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Dubyac99 \"Dubyac99\"","summary":"Hands down, funnest game on the Nintendo SP!!!","reviewText":"Okay, first things first.  I want to let you know I am 40 years old.  I work in a business office in a financial district,and I wear a tie to work. AND I love this game!  So put away the stereotypes of Nintendo videogames, as this 40 year old plays this game proudly on Mass transit, and I am not ashamed to admit it.Now, getting on with the review.  I think this game gets the \"funnest videogame ever\" award. One thing that stands out in my mind is how easy it is, to learn and have fun with.  You never get too frustrated and want to quit, but it's so much fun, you never get bored and want to quit.  What a combination!  I highly recommend this game for any age.  My son has been playing it since he was about 3 1/2.  And he completes levels too!  It's that easy.  But at the same time, it is fun enough, so that an adult can enjoy it, and not feel like its a kid's game.Granted, you have to be a big videogamer like I am. But if you are, and you have a GBA or DS, than you have to get this game!  Hands down, one of the best of all Mario games out there, and certainly in the top 10 of funnest games.One think I love about this game, is the ability to steal time back, that is, lengthen the amount of time before you \"lose\" a life. So many games out there are \"instant death.\"  And for somebody like myself who doesn't have endless hours to play a videogame, this is the ultimate satisfaction.I also think this game converts to a portable game, much better than a console game.  But I bet the console game was super fun to play too.  I never had the pleasure of playing this game on the SNES.In conclusion, this game is at the top of its tier. Cream of the crop.  I highly recommend it!  Buy it now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2006"}

But even though the gameplay feels familiar, it's a totally new experience.First, if you've played the in-store demo, don't let its ease fool you. For one thing, I think the enemies in the first level actually hit quite a bit harder in the final game than they do in the demo. For another, it gets harder shortly after that level.Second, like others have said, this isn't a shooting game where your only goal is to wipe out anything that moves. It's mostly about exploration, figuring out what to do and how to get to the places that seem out of reach. Along the way there are plenty of enemies to get in your way, from hunched-over space pirates with decent AI (not as good as some dedicated FPS games, but they'll duck and cover, and hide behind things) to swarms of insects to enormous beasts.Third, the little details in the game are really something special. When you look upwards in the rain, little water droplets land on your visor, and when you jump out of a pool, your visor even fogs up briefly!I just got it and can't put it down.

I will mention what I like about the game and the flaws which are few. There is the ability to basically order hordes of gremlin like underlings to do your bidding. There is strategy to contend with though, namely that certain minions can only do certain tasks. It doesn't stop there, you have enemies that will attack while you're trying to figure things out, and there are obstacles which you I have to figure the best way to go through or around. The camera isn't friendly, it's an enemy too. The customization process of upgrading your dark tower and weapons of not only yourself but the minions as well is just as fun as watching your minions destroy a village and wreck places. This is solid addition to the 360 library but it's not pure hack and slash.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2007"}

But don't be fooled. Underneath the sunny exterior lies a sinister, insidious force that leaves you burnt to a crisp.The graphics are gorgeous. Watching the first few cutscenes left me with a slack jaw, and the in-game graphics are head and shoulders above most everything else I've seen. Character models are incredibly vibrant, colors are bright, and everything seems bathed in a soft glow. If these visuals could somehow be transplanted into a completely different game, we might have something here.The battle system earns a solid \"meh\". At least it's not the mess that we bore witness to in Star Ocean 3, but it's very mindless hack 'n slash. I just wish I had something more to do than mash the attack button!As all RPG fans know, though, exploration, not battle, is the heart of this genre. In my opinion, a successful RPG must somehow get the player excited about exploring towns and talking to NPCs. However, this is the area in which RS emits an endless, unforgivable stream of greenhouse gases.If you believe the PR, there is supposedly a real-time system that lets you recruit characters and complete sidequests as the day passes. But there are not nearly enough sidequests to do, and time passes veeeeery slowly...and the only way to fill it is with what I believe is the stupidest implementation of this generation: \"dueling\" the townsfolk.In order to be of proper level to proceed, you must provoke NPCs into fighting you. The problem? Most of these NPCs are as strong, if not stronger, than a boss, and you must fight them without the aid of your allies. This is extremely frustrating. I felt conned; nowhere in any of the reviews or other coverage of this game was this mentioned.Overall, RS made me feel stymied. Too much frustration, too little to do, and the added fact that you keep feeling like you \"should\" love it. Additionally, the game's much-touted humor seems like it was aimed at brain-damaged chimpanzees, although I admit that this is a matter of personal preference. I advise you to avoid this game, and all others by the developer, until Tri-Ace gets its act together.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2005"}

Love the puzzle solving, exploration, and some shooting and fighting. Not too much and not too little. Ok, maybe just a bit too much of the arm-hanging climbing at the edge of everything from buildings to caves!Story was good without knowing the first two. The background music, played with timely build-up, provides great anticipation of the unknown as if you are watching Indiana Jones (or National Treasure) movies for the first time! The above ground scenes, in the air, underground, and the hidden worlds are all fabulous. Overall took me about 25 - 30 hours to go through the campaign.This is very satisfying for me. A time well spent as entertainment. It's not for those wanting to *beat* the hardest levels (you can). I played the easy level, with the purpose to enjoy the story, exploration, and the overall experience. I also played 2/3 of the story in 3D, and the rest in standard 2D. 3D is all in-screen depth, and there wasn't any real memorable out-of-screen scenes (if any).I enjoyed so much, that I'm now playing the first one and will play second as well!Highly, highly recommended.

Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"I Wish I Lived There!","reviewText":"Okay, let's all admit it! Before playing Animal Crossing for the first time, you think that this is another baby game, just by Nintendo. Actually, you'd be half there. Animal Crossing may appeal to babies, but it will also greatly appeal to anybody else who loves games along the lines of Pikmin or Super Monkey Ball 2. I thought about buying this game for months, before finally deciding to pick up a copy, and even then, I questioned my purchase. However, within five minutes, I fell in love with the game. The whole point to Animal Crossing is trying to make a home for yourself in a town overrun with animals. It is similar to The Sims, the PC hit by Maxis, but only not as in-depth. However, in some ways it is better than The Sims. You have no momentum bar like you do in other Sims games, and you explore the whole town freely, unlike in The Sims where you call up cabs or buses to take you everywhere. AC is much more colorful than The Sims as well. The first thing that you will notice in AC is that the game is simply not hard. In fact, the hardest task that you may do is finding out who stole Leopold's glasses! Although it may sound corny, the concept is VERY fun. In the town, the time passes like a real day. One minute in our world is equivalent to a minute in Animal Crossing. it is really fun like this! Also, a calendar is kept, unlike The Sims, and you have four seasons come and go. The animals also celebrate holidays like Christmas and Halloween. There are fishing tournaments and even raffles to do in the town. The whole thing is really quite fun and charming. There is never an excuse for not doing anything in the town. There is always something to do, whether it's running an errand or catching bugs. The biggest problem with the game are the graphics and sound. The graphics are really about N64 quality and the sound is only okay. But, the fact is, everything is so endearing that it's hard to heavily nitpick Animal Crossing. This is definitely one of Nintendo's better projects, and in my opinion, Nintendo is still king when it comes to developing games. While most systems stride to become more and more violent with games like Silent Hill 3 and GTA Vice City, Nintendo strides to become more family-oriented, which is a refreshing favor. Even me, a diehard fan or Resident Evil and Vice City loves Animal Crossing. Whether you are three or fifty, you will find Animal Crossing very fun. I know that I will play this game for years to come!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2003"}

I tried Sports Champions and immediately loved the game. Now I purchased Sports Champions 2 and it just as great as the first one. Bowling was made perfectly as it feels just like the real thing as it is very responsive to spins and accuracy. It is better than bocce but bocce was great as well. Boxing is fun but you will be really tired as you get a great workout. Just like the fight: lights out game, it is the best workout for any move game. This could be a negative for many people as many people don't want to move around so much. Tennis? I think that I give the edge to the table tennis from the 1st game but this tennis is done very well. You don't control the character running around except charging the net but you do control the swing so that is why I prefer the table tennis. I wouldn't mind seeing the navigation controller used in this tennis game. This is another great game to get a good workout from. You will be sore if you play for long time. I actually nearly hurt my shoulder because the tennis game was getting crazy and I had to do some fast movements. Archery is great as the first. Golf and skiing? I haven't really tried those games as I don't have much interest in those sports. I find golf to be boring. I would give this game a 4.5 stars out of 5. More people should try move and sports champions 2 as they would enjoy it and sales would increase which would lead to more move games being supported. The move is far superior than kinect and wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"Not bad","reviewText":"Synopsis - Final Fantasy 13 is the newest installment of a disconnected series of role playing games. It involves seven playable characters trying to cope with being branded as l'Cie (individuals cursed with an unclear task, gifted with magical powers and feared by the populace) by powerful entities called Fal'Cie. They inhabit an advanced, futuristic planet called Cocoon, which hovers over a larger, wilder planet called Pulse.:)- Despite initially being irritating, the main characters gradually develop into rather likable individuals.- The game worlds are very beautiful, extremely colorful, and quite immaginative in design (to a fault).- The music is great but not very memorable. You probably won't be humming any of it between play.- The Combat system is new, fast paced, challenging and extremely fun. It requires memorization, predetermination and quick fingers. It does take a while to get used.- Overall the story is good, but...:(- The game relies on narrative text (found in the menu) to tell most of the story. Without these texts, neither the cutscenes nor the in-game dialogue would be adequate in relaying what exactly is going on.- The voice work of some of the characters leaves much to be desired. Often the character's body language suggests that their voices should be more emotional than they actually are (typical in Japanese to English translations). The inclusion of the original Japanese voice work would have been appreciated.- The voice actors of two particular characters, Vanille and Hope, seem miscast. Hope is presented as a timid, pathetic young boy, yet his voice is anything but. Vanille is presented as a young, cute, bubbly young girl but unfortunately her voice sounds painfully forced. It would have been better if Hope was voiced by an actual young boy or a woman acting as a boy (as is typical for animated boys). It would also have been better if Vanille's voice actress was allowed to just be herself, instead of trying (too hard) to sound cute.- Most of the game's npc's (none playable characters) are whiny, antagonizing irritants, making it difficult to care whether they live or die. Since much of the main character's emotional turmoil is based on this indecision, the drama tends to fall flat.Conclusion - Final Fantasy XIII is a great game that tries out some new ideas and succeeds with most of them. Given it's high visual quality, fun gameplay and current price of around $20, it is well worth the purchase.Worth - $55","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2011"}

When there was no final fantasy, DMC, Infamous, Uncharted...... just hand full of unknown titles. While I didn't know anything about folklore, every video I saw of it looked interesting, so I bought it and here is what I thought after completing it.****************PROS*****************GREAT NEW LIVE-ACTION COMBAT: This is the best part of the game. What defines great RPGs is how nicely the combat system is designed. In this game, you capture an enemy's \"soul\" so do speak and then use it to defeat stronger enemies. As you defeat stronger enemies, you can capture their souls to and have stronger attacks on your side. So basically more enemies you defeat and more souls you capture, more attacks you have. This gets to be quite fun, especially after you defeat and capture the powers of big bosses.UPGRADEABLE POWERS: All the powers you obtain from enemies are upgradeable. But it is not as simple as just defeating other enemies. To upgrade powers of particular soul you capture, you have to defeat particular enemy or meet some other condition. While it may sound confusing, it will be very straightforward once you play the game.GORGEOUS SCENARY AND LEVEL DESIGN: This RPG takes place in fantasyland so do speak. It has 7 chapters I think (sorry it has been a while). All 7 have very unique characteristics and scenery. If you like games like Prince of Persia (PS3) for their artstyle, this is a game you'll love. Again words just can't describe it right.VERY MYSTERIOUS AND SUSPENSEFUL STORY (NO SPOILERS): You are a girl trying to determine your identity as well as what happened in a village that led to string of murders. You start out doing so with aid of a mysterious male journalist friend. As you progress in the game, you will encounter more and more mysterious events and won't get the answers till the end. The ending and conclusion will surprise you.TWO PLAYABLE CHARACTERS: The story is divided into seven chapters. You HAVE to complete them with both characters to unveil the whole story. While majority of levels are similar for both characters, they do go through different events, fight different enemies and will encounter different areas. Even though some souls you capture are same, two characters use them differently. Loved it.BOSSES AND ENEMIES: There are plenty of different enemies and bosses in the game and then you have major bosses for each level. As you obtain your powers mainly through enemies, they are the heart and soul of this game. Thankfully there are plenty of different enemies. So this game will really drive you forward in terms of capturing more enemy powers.TRUE TREASURE FOR COMPLETIONIST: The game should last you 10-12 hrs to finish if you simply run through it. But if you are a completionist who wants go after all the powers, it will last you much longer. I strongly recommend you go after all the powers, which will make you revisit the levels, go to hidden areas and encounter enemies and events you probably won't if you simply rush through the game.************CONS****************LINEAR LEVEL DESIGN: This is not exactly a bad thing, but I truly wish it were more like old final fantasy games  where world is more open, more hidden bosses and items and areas.***********CONCLUSION**************I feel so sorry for this game. It is such a great RPG and experience. It is just very few people know about. If you are a fan of RPG and like games like Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts and Lost Odyssey, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

Fun but not as amazing as the 1st game.","reviewText":"I have to first identify myself. I am a huge Star Wars video game fan. The first Force Unleashed game was fantastic with some minor issues...but overall a fantastic game.With that said I was extremely excited to play the sequel, and now that I have beat the game already (around 7 hours on hard difficulty) I have to say it was fun but lackluster.The biggest complaint I have is the story isn't on par with the quality narrative we got in the first game. I don't want to spoil any aspects of the story for you, but believe me when I say you won't come out of this game feeling complete like you did with the first. I got the same feeling playing this as I did with Halo 2, where the story doesn't seemed finished and they are MAKING you wait for the next game to get the final pieces...that should have been in this game.The game play is definitely improved over the last game. Some of the game mechanics were pretty tough in the first Force Unleashed, but they have made them a lot easier to use. Control of the character is easier and the force abilities are easier to use.The graphics are fantastic! This game on a HD tv is absolutely gorgeous and run very smooth.Bottom line this is a great game still even with its short comings. If you played the first game you should still play this game. Even though it is short it is still fun. Even though the story is below the quality of the first game, it is still enjoyable.Is the game worth paying $60 for?

{"product_name":"B004QEWVLC","description":"","reviewerName":"Catfish Kozmo","summary":"Over the top AWESOME!","reviewText":"Saints Row The Third is just plain old awesome fun.Basically SRTT is a sandbox game just like Grand Theft Auto. The best part of Saints Row has always been that the series does not take itself very seriously. So unlike GTA, don't expect anything very serious. Right out of the box, I had a giant dildo bat to run around and beat people up with. So, definitely not for the delicate or for the young. Beyond that, this game has a ton of things to do and explore.The basic story is that the Saints took over the old city and are actually kidnapped and dropped off by the Syndicate in Steelport. So now, you're on a mission to take over Steelport and kick out the Syndicate. Basically, you'll fight 3 gangs. One gang of wrestlers, one gang of hackers and then a regular-ish gang. The missions keep you moving through the story but it's the side-missions and other activities that really fuel the game.Basically, if you want to upgrade your weapons, you need both respect and money. Taking over sections of the city gives you an hourly wage that you can use to upgrade weapons. Doing more missions gives you more respect and money. Both are needed if you want to get your character up to almost awesome level. At the higher levels, you can upgrade your character to never have to reload or unlimited ammo, if you max out. But it's worth it because once you get an upgraded weapon, it only serves to drive you further into conquering more and more. The pistols upgrade to either exploding or armor piercing. Once I got the exploding bullets, I was hooked. You can bring down helicopters pretty easily once you're dual-wielding both pistols.The graphics are an improvement over the last Saints Row as well. There are a few times where I've seen cars get stuck but it doesn't happen too often. Speaking of cars, there are a ton to try out and customize. I have yet to get tired of stealing cars and crashing them into things. In fact, you're rewarded for turning your car into a car torpedo. It just goes on and on.If you like mayhem & chaos, over the top characters and some silliness, this is your game. I'm 28 hours into a regular playthrough and I'm finding that I'm actually trying to get this game to 100% completion. I probably won't get there but I'm sure going to try. It's that much fun.

Then I loaned it to my autistic brother (8 yrs old), and it seemed like a good idea.I thought that making freinds with animals could really help his social skills, and he really liked the Wii version. However, hedid not know how to save on my DSi so he just cut it off. Every time you \"reset\" the game, a mole named Resetti comes outto lecture you. I never really cared much about what he made ME do, but he made my AUTISTIC brother type in\"I am a loser.\"! His therapy instructor is currently working to teach him not to say things like that, and then one of Nintendo'sstupid characters forced him to type negative stuff in! This game could have been a major step for him and me, but now I'm getting my copy back.And here is what I thought of the game:If you decide to purchase this for a more self-confident child or yourself, this is the worst installment of the Animal Crossing franchise. The whole point of Animal Crossing on the Gamecube was for your family to interact together in a virtual town, which can be pretty neat. That dosen't work out on the DS because it is a personal system, the Gamecube was a family system. Nintendo also tried using wireless connections for multiplayer, but that does not work out either. \"Local\" play makes me wonder what Nintendo thought about how many DS systems each family was going to have. Even that is not the social level the Gamecube / Wii provided. Then Wifi, the same thing as local play only over the internet. Friend codes... You work hard to get a friends randomly made number, then you will never know when they are online. Years later you upgrade from a DS lite to a DSi which requires a completly new friend code. Then you upgrade to a 3DS 6 months later... new code, your friends DS lite breaks, new code for him! Of course if you are really desperate you can always share a game card with your family, but then you have to share a house! In the Gamecube version they gave you a little square with 4 houses... one for each player. In the Wii version they spread the 4 houses across the town so you don't have to look at your sister's ugly roof! But on a Nintendo DS, you share a house. My brother and I barley get along in City Folk on the Wii, so we really can't get along in 1 house! Our houses in the Wii look completly different! My brother enjoyed putting fish (because he loves fish) in his house with a nice gentle song playing. My house is filled with 8-bit mario pieces (because I love Mario) and gold sofas with a rock tune playing. It would be kind of hard to combine fish with a bunch of Mario items and have room to spare. If you prefer to play Animal Crossing alone (I don't blame you), you'll have lots of other problems. The animal's AI is really annoying. They walk around, walk some more, and then say the same thing over and over. I was able to talk to Nibbles and then hear Sally say the same thing Nibbles said 5 minutes earlier! It really gets annoying because most of the animals are either jerks or poets. As mentioned earlier, the mean nieghbors were the main reason I stopped letting my brothers play. The rest are pretty much poets. I love poetry, but not in a Nintendo game. One example is that they use big words to describe the weather, when they could say \"I wish it would stop raining\". After having a conversation you heard within the week from somebody else, you would expect your nieghbor to do something else besides use complex metaphors and talk about dieting (FOR CRYING OUTLOUD THIS IS A CHILDREN'S GAME! WHY WOULD A CHILD CARE ABOUT DIET CUSTARD?), but they don't. In the Gamecube version you could do chores for the animals, and they occasionally built igloos and went camping. In this version all that they do on a normal basis is walk around. And forgot NES games, I know that is something that some people bought the game for. No classics in this version though, not even Super Tortimer.Overall, this game is weak compared to the versions on Gamecube and Wii. The mole is an insulting monster who made my Autisic brother type in negative things about himself. The Gamecube Resetti was much more amusing and less severe. The DS Resetti made me want to smash the game when my brother told me what happened. I am a HUGE Animal Crossing fan, but keep newer and younger fans away from this.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2012"}

There are a few extras including a brand new dungeon in addition to the four made for the Dawn of Souls release, but there isn't enough here to warrant picking up if you already own Final Fantasy in one of it's previous incarnations.  Not to mention that for new gamers or those who have only played the more recent installments of the series, the old school style of ultra random battles and mechanics will turn you off.

Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Amazon Jeff","summary":"Awesome screen, useless system","reviewText":"I just sold my year-old PSP.

There's some good software out there for it, but for the most part it's just not practical as a portable gaming machine. Sure the screen is gorgeous, although the pixels die quickly, but aside from messing with the firmware and playing a game here and there it just doesn't last as a game machine.Pros:- Great graphics (in most cases) on a very pretty screen...- Lots of watered down UMD movies to select from if DVDs aren't your thing or you have money ot burn.- A few really good games, particularly golf and puzzle games, and don't forget GTA.- Hackable and crackable, run emulators of old games (Against the warranty!! Warning!)Cons:- Lots of bad software, and with third-party support slowly dropping due to poor hardware sales and high production costs the future is not looking so bright. There's no killer app yet, and most games are just stripped down or modified ports of PS2 games.- The second \"P\" in PSP is a bit of an overstatement: The PSP is way too large and fragile for most situations, many games suffer from a lack of portability as a result of their design, very poor battery life, and WiFi support is obviously not very portable.- Slow load speeds and disc access, noisy disc drive, and a very expensive storage medium.- In seven months three pixels had died and turned permanently black.- Cost of hardware and games, not just for consumers but for game developers.My honest advise is to try a few games and consider the pros and cons before making your purchase.

Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Daniel V.","summary":"Perfect!","reviewText":"I have had this system for 7 months now and it's still working perfectly. So far I have 4 games and 6 UMD movies. This system is perfect because you can listen to music, watch movies, play videogames, look at pictures, go on the internet, watch TV, etc. But for the internet and TV you'll need a 2.5 upgrade which you'll eventually get.As for the games, there aren't many out right now and some I'm not even interested in playing, but I believe (and hope) that later this year there'll be more. The graphics are probably the best I've ever seen on a handheld system and the movies are perfectly clear. On my PSP I have 3 dead pixels but while you're playing or watching a movie, you'll hardly recognize them.This system is easily breakable and I mean if you drop it on concrete floor, it'll most likely break. So be really careful with it. As for the screen, it must be cleaned alot or you'll start seeing scratches which can make it look ugly.Overall, the PSP is worth you money and time and it's a system for everyone. But on second thought, I would rather wait for all the good games to come out and maybe even new colors for the PSP.Thanks for reading and I hope I really helped.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0029ZBZ0I","reviewerName":"Ben","summary":"Better on the PC","reviewText":"I had a PS3 briefly and RE5 was one of the games I really liked on it, but I think the PC version is the best. Any PC gamer will know there is just no comparison with the better accuracy you get with a mouse and keyboard versus a gamepad. Much more precise shooting, this is especially evident in the fast paced mercenaries mode. The game overall is pretty fun but my one complaint is that the story mode is a little short, compared to RE4 at least. Though the mercenaries mode hugely makes up for it with replay value (unlike older RE titles where I would only replay once in a blue moon). Its intense, addictive and incredibly fun - one of the best additions and modes to RE. Nothing like getting attacked by hordes of zombies and having a huge arsenal of weapons to fend them off..! Also in the PC version they added a new No Mercy mode with even larger swarms and it is absolutely nuts. Mercenaries is a blast and a MUST PLAY for all RE fans. Finally, the graphics look slightly better than the console version. You can make out a bit more detail in the PC version and it sure looks pretty. All in all I will say RE5 is right up there with RE2 and 4 as my favorites in the series. There seems to be a lot of negative reviews out there because the old RE survival horror style was abandoned. But I think the reverse would happen if they continued the same formula, there would be the \"seen it, done that before\" complaints. Personally I lovedd the new fresh direction RE4 took and RE5 just builds on that with more enemies and weapon upgrades.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements.

As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel.

They've created a massive planet sprawling with rocks and trees and grass and water. They've created an alien race called the Covenant, a deadly, yet intelligent species who serve as archenemies to humans. The amount of work and detail that went into the game is unbelievable. From the moment you pick up the controller to the moment you finish the game, you will be immersed in a first person shooter unlike any other. The game is magic the moment you pick up the controller. Simply put, Halo is one of the greatest games ever created.Halo is a pure action, shoot `em up blood bath, but it's done better than all of the other of its kind. First off, the AI is amazing. To this date the AI remains the absolute best, even better than the sequels. These are enemies who really don't want to die. When in danger, they take cover or run out of fear. Other games feature enemies who stand out in the open and have no sense of their own mortality. Not so in Halo. They fight back as though they don't want to die. They fight in large groups, never solo, so the sight of a single elite means there are also a few grunts nearby. While some enemies are easier to kill than others, all nonetheless pose big threats to you. The small, cowardly grunts attack in large groups; jackals take cover behind their powerful shields while firing their pistols at a rapid rate; hunters are massive, heavily armored, and carry giant weapons; and elites are the smartest and deadliest of all - almost equal to Master Chief. You have to be aware of each one to make sure they don't overcome you. In other words, don't be stupid and always be alert. In the legendary difficulty you find yourself in fifteen to twenty minute long gunfights with a single enemy group of covenant - that's how hard it gets.A mark of a great game is how much it has been imitated. As an example, the game's weapon system is one of the best out there. There are only eight weapons, and all are well-balanced. Before Halo came out, shooters were all about finding more and more powerful weapons as you progressed through the game. After Halo, everything changed. Now games are all about a handful of well-balanced weapons. Now, instead of carrying a huge arsenal of weapons, you can only carry two or three at once, so trading one for another means you are making a sacrifice. Also widely imitated is Halo's revolutionary health system. Halo relies on a shield that recharges over time, and ever since many other shooters have used the same system. It means you can enter all gunfights at your strongest at all times and the game can challenge you at every turn without you having to worry about entering the next tough gunfight with only a sliver of health.Halo sports wonderful visuals, which is one reason the worlds are so immersive. The bump-mapping, back when that term was popular, helps immerse you into the game's world. Characters also move and look realistic. It's hilarious to see a grunt running from you with arms flailing after you have just killed an elite. The sounds and music are awesomely done, also. Halo is one of the rare shooters that has such memorable music accompanying its name. There are so many things I could talk about with this game, including the brilliant, suspenseful build-up to the encounter with the Flood, and the great multiplayer. If you've never played this game, you really owe it to yourself to try it out. This is a rare game that will likely never meet its equal. Not even Bungie could reproduce the magic with any of its sequels. Halo is not just the best game for the Xbox, it is one of the best games ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2013"}

It may be the best looking game on any system to date, period. The environmental draw distance is tremendous, the car models are superbly detailed. The sense of speed you get from the game is amazing, and the tracks are both varied and fun.The game contains four modes of play: Rally, Ice Racing, Hill Climb, and Rallycross. Rallycross and Ice Racing are similar, in that they're both races against three other opponents, around circuit tracks. Rally and Hill Climb modes are both linear affairs, in which you traverse a section of track a single time, with no visible opponents, trying to best your opponents' times.There is a multiplayer split screen mode, but no system link mode - this is probably the most serious omission, but the split screen mode is quite fun, on its own terms. The damage models are simplified, as is some of the lighting, but it still clips along at 60 FPS, or thereabouts, and even in its somewhat scaled-back presentation, it's *still* the best looking game on the market.The driving model in the game is a little hard to get used to - at first, the cars feel a touch too slippery. But after an hour or so, you'll get used to needing to gas through the later parts of the turns, to regain traction, and you'll be powersliding through corners like it was second nature.Rallisport has some stiff competition in Project Gotham, Gran Turismo, and the other driving games out today. It's not a direct competitor, as rally racing is pretty different than street racing. But the fundamental aspect of driving cars around courses, really fast, is *best* exemplified in Rallisport - a fantastic combination of challenging, fun, and downright beautiful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"A decent effort; but could've been better","reviewText":"Just a quick side story, I've literally followed all the God of War games from God of War 1 on the PS2 to Ascension. To be honest, my favorite God of war games were God of War 1, 2, Ghosts of Sparta and GOW3. (though I enjoyed God of War 3 less than previous efforts)Anyway, here's my review-Graphics-Graphically, God of War Ascension's a mixed bag. When you first play the game's first level, it looks amazing. It also introduces a strange layer of motion blur that gives it more of a cinematic feel and it's good to actually see a full sized Kratos all scarred up from being chained up or from past battles.The backgrounds are nicely done too, even though they do not compare to past God of War games (just think about the first time you experienced God of war 2 or 3 for that matter. The scale of the games even with a fixed camera angle is impressive), and some levels I really didn't care for, but then there were other levels such as the furnace that looks incredible. (especially with the fire effects)The enemies are also something I wasn't too crazy about. The problem is, they're mostly the same enemies spammed in waves which boils down to Goat-men, a Harpy or two tossed in, a Giant spartan looking guy with a big hammer, bigger goat-men, every now and then some dogs and snake women, which you'll all fight throughout the game and they really aren't detailed enemies or cool looking in any way.But every now and then Ascension does toss in Huge Elephant creatures, Cyclops, Snake women (Medusa) and some ghost-like purplish creatures that revert to solid form once you grab them.One of the things I did like a lot about the graphics in Ascension is after executing mini bosses such as a Cyclops or an Elephant man, you'll see their intestines spill out whilst a pool of blood wooshes out their cut-open belly, or you'll see an Elephant man's Brain and spinal column after ripping it's face apart. There are also the little touches like slashing a Boss' giant hand and the cut still remaining intact that I thought was cool.Execution although brutal looking in this game do not compare to the likes of God of War 3 or God of War 1. (Remember defeating the Sea Serpent by pulling it's heads down on sharp wooden pikes? Or in GOW3 when you got to remove eyeballs?)The cutscenes are mostly in real time, but there are actual cutscenes that look dull and generic with mostly just dialogue and stills.My last quirk with this game lies in the motion blur that I actually gave credit to earlier.While Motion Blur looks nice in this game and does add a little something, sometimes it just looks very odd looking, especially up close when Kratos performs a roll and he has that odd blur following slower than usual. This is a classic example of motion blur being overdone at times. What was wrong with how GOW3 looked?Score- 8.5/10Sound-I really don't have anything bad to say about the sound other than the music just being the forgettable factor in Ascension. The voice acting is superb as usual and the sound effects are a tad different. You can really hear Kratos chain as he swings the Blades of Chaos, and enemies sound pretty cool.Score- 10/10Gameplay-Something about Ascension stops me from giving it a higher score than 3/5, and if I could, I'd give it a 3.5/5 for the following reasons.Ascension has good puzzles and lots of platforming at times, I didn't particularly care for the QTE chain grappling or some of the QTE's being that some of those QTE events are going to be the reason why you even die in the game. Even on the hardest difficulty.Let me elaborate further on this issue. Ascension is NOT a hard game at all. You'll always win in combat scenarios but during certain boss battles there are QTE events that you can fail. Sadly, failing these QTE events doesn't punish you much; and the difficulty settings only tweak the time you'll have to get QTE's right and how much damage Kratos takes.The boss battles also are more about timing or insanely mashing the attack button and never anything in the middle. For example, the first boss is ridiculously easy and has a \"1, 2, 3 ,4\" timing scheme.The boss battles are also less memorable in my opinion.There's also the combat system which completely takes away all the cool moves Kratos normally has available in other games by upgrade, and instead gives you these moves if you use Rage (which is done by pressing in both analog sticks), I wasn't particularly crazy about this change, especially considering the game uses a Devil May Cry combat system in which you'll have to constantly land hits on an opponent to fill the rage meter, but this can be hard considering some regular enemies cannot be hit and block you without even guarding. Take for example, fighting Juggernauts in this game who cannot be hit for a long time and there's really no indication as to when to hit them. You'll simply just land a hit on them after they take 8-10 seconds or more attacking you or trying to squash you from above.I won't touch on the story since I do not like spoiling anything for anyone that doesn't have the game, but in a nutshell, the story's just decent and centers around Kratos exacting revenge on The Furies.Also, the combat system features elemental attacks like Lightning, Fire, Ice and Hades. The upgrade system is also surprisingly easy and you'll also find some items which aren't available for use during your first playthrough that's a nice bonus. There's also multiplayer which I think I've played once and didn't really care for it.Score- 7/10Overall-If you can get this game cheap then by all means buy it, however, I'd have to say after finishing it, I wasn't really impressed. I loved the puzzles, the platforming was decent as well, the graphics are really good, but the boss battles and story fell flat in my opinion. Hopefully, Santa Monica will get the next game right.Overall score- 7.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2013"}

I generally prefer the more traditional RPG's, whether they be pure hack and slash, or heavily story based like the Final Fantasy series. I've never much cared for strategy style games when I used my PC as a gaming machine, so I stayed clear of Disgaea despite its tremendous reviews. But with my back acting up I grabbed the game as entertainment during a long bed rest - and that's more than enough about me.My first reaction to Disgaea was a bit of disappointment with the graphics of the game, which are pretty basic. An initially the strategy element reminded me of games I had played 10 years ago - you moved your characters around the field and hit the kill button. The story line seemed pretty mundane as well; an overly cute demon wakes from a very long nap to discover his father (the overlord) had choked to death on a pretzel, and now young Laharl has to win back the title for himself. Laharl is aided initially by a group of preset characters. But you will quickly discover that you can tailor make new characters to fit your needs and the game becomes very much your own creation.In fact, the real strategy elements to Disgaea stay hidden unless you go looking for them. There is a demonic council you can petition for an amazing list of things, including several major side quests, as well as better items and fighting skills. My favorite is the way weapons are leveled up, which requires you to take your party into the weapon and fight your way through an everlasting (almost) series of levels that are not just difficult, but extremely complex as well. This really brings out the strategy element much more than the straight foreward story line battles.And then, there are eight possible endings...My first pass through to the end took about 60 hours, and I thought I had covered most of the game. At this point I took a look at a walkthrough and promptly discovered I had missed almost half of the options available. That says a lot for the game's ability to hold interest on a repeat play through. It has certainly made me reconsider the 'strategy' style game as genre worth playing.The story line turns out to more depth and originality than it initially appears to have, as it ranges from hell to outer space and heaven. In fact, the only real downside to the game is the graphics and lack of animation. Here it is acceptable, but lacks inspiration. Since the game's success begs for a sequel, I'm hoping for improvement on that front.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2004"}

Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense.

{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"Chris Teague \"Chris\"","summary":"Fun, dark, and I'm satisfied.","reviewText":"First of all, I am not a Resident Evil fanboy. In fact, this was the first game I played of the series. I think it was the best choice in many ways actually, since the levels were split into hour-long episodes and I can let other people help me online if I don't want to gruel in single player, which I found very hard even when it was set on Easy.That being said, I think this new edition was great! I originally came to want this because I couldn't handle the stress and paranoia in games like Silent Hill. I figured it would be nice to have a game more oriented with a decent flow of action rather than chop-chop-chop run for the hills, keep running for ten minutes, look for scary things in the fog, now find an item. It was disappointing, and I was getting just too paranoid with games like SH.Aside from the tradition of Resident Evil, I LOVED this revolutionary game in the series because everything just worked! Unlike SH, I wasn't a tank in this game and I always knew I had either some fairly good AI on my side or some expert human players that have my back. The story, though I'm told doesn't have as much of the mystery and suspense as the other games, carries out wonderfully. The only issue I have that I haven't really seen in any other game is the fact that cutscenes and even mini-cutscenes(the ones that heighten model detail a little as opposed to alot) need a loading screen before they are shown, which can hinder online play a little since most players will skip them. If you've played a game on a next-gen console like PS2, you know that most cutscenes are integrated with gameplay so there is a smooth transition. Oh well, I got used to it, so can you.One other thing I'm not satisfied with, however, is the fact that the servers won't let you play online if you're profile doesnt show you as 17 or older, which I find totally pointless. If you're playing the game in Single player, they shouldn't hold the right to restrict you from playing on the Network. Forgive my critique on today's discipline methods, but that's what parenting is about people. Leave it to the parents, Capcom!Now if you want to get to the root of Outbreak, I'd give you this advice: Outbreak is the game you want to buy if you play games to beat them. Outbreak has episodes and a decent storyline, but it seems like it's more geared toward beating levels, gaining points, and spending them on extras. Extras and cheat costumes are also achieved by completing in-game scenarios and grabbing special items. So I just feel like you may enjoy the storyline, but it really seems like it's more about the gaming part of the game than anything, which is great in a sense because you can get up to 3 people to help you do just that!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2004"}

The latest entry, Liberty City Stories, is set in Liberty City in 1998, three years before  GTA:III. You play as Toni Cipriani, who was also in III.GAMEPLAY: It's GTA on the go, and it's as great as the PS2 titles. Liberty City is pretty much the same as it was in III, with a few differences. Also, it has features that weren't in III, like motorcycles, knives, ability to damage cars by punching them, etc.The gameplay is pretty much like others: kick-@$$ fun. Do missions for the Mafia, find hidden packages, go on rampages, steal cars, shoot people, fight in gang wars, do hidden missions, and much more.There's online multiplayer games, too. Although I don't know how to get online on my PSP (LOL.)GRAPHICS: Awesome for a portable game. They look as good as III's graphics.SOUND: Great voice acting, and awesome sound effects.MUSIC/RADIO STATIONS: Meh. The music on the radio station's OK, but I like III's better. However, you can listen to music that's downloaded onto your PSP instead. (Kind of like the X-Box versions.) Very neat.OVERALL: An AWESOME portable game that will keep you addicted for hours.

Developed by Ensemble Studios,Halo Warsfor Xbox 360&nbsp;brings all the drama of a real-time strategy game to the popular Halo Universe. Set in the year 2531, before the initial Halo first-person shooter game, this game lets you control the human armies of UNSC in a whole new way..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }Play as UNSC or Covenant and exploit your faction's unique strengths.View larger.Invade enemy strongholds full of advanced technology.View larger.Find ways to make the detailed environments work for you.View larger.Bring in air support to turn the tide of battle.View larger.Experience the Epic Battle from a New PerspectiveDefense, offense, and the ability to hold down a command center in the face of hostile attacks: there's a lot to think about when laying out tactics for an all-out alien war. Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Matthew K.

Right out the gate of the launch you can make use of the touch feature, the mic, the touch pad on the back. All of these features are available to use now instead of a year later like most new ideas when brought to a console or 3D gaming... It has a very clear look. The battery life was put out of what to expect so I never thought I'd get 15 hours of gaming like a Tablet(Transformer Prime) but I also never find myself out n about with a low battery, I guess that's the Vita's good power saving system which you really have no control over. After 3 mins. max the vita will go into standby soooooo yeah so the battery shouldn't be a problem here. There really isn't any flaws with the system, it's slighty bigger than the PSP but that was ok with me after seeing it's way powerful and all these features inside would be hard to make it slimmer/smaller so the size is OK.

The grip's frame is rubberized, making it easy to hold without risk of dropping it due to sweaty hands, which brings my next point,  this grip is very easy on the hands, I used to get pains in my left hand, but this grip took that away; it feels like a slightly larger PS3 controller.At the bottom you have a sliding, locking mechanism that keeps the Vita locked securely. On the back you have full access to the rear touch panel and I didn't experience any problems when playing games that use that feature. You have access to all the buttons,  bumpers, headset jack and the cameras as well. Also, the grip doesn't put any pressure on the Vita at all, so there's no chance of it scratching it; it grabs the vita by the edges and I haven't seen any marks left on it.The grip does have some flaws, first, there's no access to the charging port or the game slot, you have  to get the Vita out of the grip to change games and charge; also, the Volume and power buttons are kinda hard to press/access , not incredibly hard, but it takes some getting used to.Even with its flaws, this is probably the best grip on the market and it deserves the 5 star rank. If you want a huge improvement in comfort during your gaming sessions, do not hesitate to buy this grip, it is great.I took some pictures of it, so you can have an idea of what it looks like, you can view 'em above.

I picked it up after playing (and enjoying FFX) hoping to find a continuation of the innovative storyline, development and overall fun.  What I got was about as enjoyable as a knee to the groin.  At times I was tempted to break the game in half simply to assure that I would never accidentally put it in and play this beast again.Anger and spite aside, on with the review.This game continues the FFX story just about where you ended.  It is 2  years later and the land of Spira has turned into one giant theme park where everyone and their mother is a tourist.  Two factions, governed by what looks like 13 year olds, have taken control of the population and are about to come to blows.The game starts out at a concert where Yuna is performing a song and dance number, which is where I begin to taste a bit of bile.  It seems that Yuna has given up on her priestly ways completely, lost about 10 years of maturity, and started a life as a scavenger/pop star.  Throughout the game you are forced to deal with her singing and dancing and a poor attempt to build a plot around it.Other co-stars from the first installment are back as well.  Lulu, Wakka and Kimhari make their cameo appearances but contribute nothing to the story.  Rikku comes back as a playable character, but she seems to have de-evolved into a prepubescent child as well.I won't go into the storyline at all, simply because it would hard to say anything about it without giving the entire premise away completely.  Let me just say it is shallow, very shallow, and completely not worth investing the time to see the endings.  Just look them up on Youtube and that would be good enough.Game mechanics were severely underdone in my opinion.  After the success of FFX, square could have simply ported the game over, changed the names around, and made yet another success out of it.  This game consists of all of the bad parts ported over, and new dumbed down material.  The awkward conversation scripts, irritating voices, and giant plot holes are all back again.  Sadly, all of the good things are gone.  Gone is the sphere grid leveling system, the multiple character with some nice storyline, even a good underlying story is too much to ask of this game.The combat system is nice, I have to give it that.  You are given three characters for the entire game, but you have the ability to change their profession in mid-combat.  Sadly, because every battle is fast paced and all of your skills, magic and even items require a large amount of time to use, you will fight most of your battles by holding the button down and attacking madly until something dies.All of the visuals, monsters, characters and settings are a straight port from the previous release which I found odd since this game is far shorter.  I got through it with about 60% completion in under 20 hours.  While spending more time to get 100% will get you another 1.5 minutes of ending sequence, it is really not worth your time.In all, looks as good as the original.  While I liked the fast paced, quick thinking fight system, the omission of an interesting leveling system was irritating.  This game was a slap to the face of the fan base it was supposed to be made for.  At many points, the shear shallowness of the dialog, lack of character development and simpleminded mini-games make you feel like you are playing a game more suited for 11 year olds.  Then you get a thong shot of Rikku or you hit the point you have to give  a sensual massage to a woman for points and you wonder what the heck the creators were thinking.If you are a fan of Final Fantasy gaming, avoid this one.  If you are not a fan, well, you have no reason to touch this one anyway.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2008"}

A direct sequel to a FF game? Only 3 playable characters? A return to the Active Time Battle System (ATB)? Well, forget all your questions and complaints. FFX-2 is a Final Fantasy game through and through. If you are a Final Fantasy fan, you absolutely must get this game.Pros:Excellent (and fun!) battle system--very face pacedDress Spheres are like the job system found in FF Tactics. Each Dress Sphere makes the character adept at certain skills and abilities. There is a thief dress sphere, warrior dress sphere, alchemist dress sphere and gun mage (Blue Magic) dress sphere, along with many others. Each one is completely different and equally fun to use.The FMVS are absolutely amazing (although not as amazing as the ones seen in FFX)The mission based gameplay makes the game very non-linear--you can visit anyplace in the game from the get go.The story is very tight and well written, IF you complete all the sidequests and go to every single location (even the ones that aren't hotspots) in every chapter.The game incorporates cultural references, old school video game references (now you're playing with power), and all sorts of other jokes into the gameplay. FFX-2 has style and humor, which was sorely missing in FFX.Brother is hillarious. The Hypello are absolutely gut bustingly funny, nasty, and weird at the same time. Gotta love 'em!The game has all your Final Fantasy staples: chocobos, moogles, secret dungeons, ultimate items, amazingly hard bosses, and tons of mini-games.Cons:Game can get too girly/giddy at timesCharacter voices can get annoying (Mainly Rikky and Yuna).The graphics are mediocre for a PS2 game (uses the same engine as FFX; honestly FFX looked better than this). The facial expressions in the real time cut scenes are (most of time)absolutely ugly and horrendus. Just look at Yuna's eyes, and you'll see what I mean.Not enough FMV (I only counted 7 or 8, and most of them are quite short)Nearly impossible to get 100% in one playthrough (the game makes you do all sort of trite and annoying things to get 100%, many of which are easy to miss).The music is now mostly comprised of J-Pop, which is okay, but certainly will not appeal to every gamer or FF fan.Very difficult to level up your characters  until you reach chapter 5Most of the environments are the exact same as the ones in FFXThis game is short (took me 30 hours first time through), but it does have good replay value with the New Game Plus feature.Honestly, FFX-2 is the most fun I've ever had with a Final Fantasy. The battle system rocks, the cutscenes are hilarious, and the characters (for the most part) are likeable. FFX-2 has everything that all the other Final Fantasy games have--it just presents them with more style and laissez faire atitude then the other games. Square has crafted another masterpiece, which if not for the subpar visuals and forgetable music, would be the best in the series. Once you start to play, your heart will melt and you'll be completely enthralled for a long, long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2004"}

Even the little knobs sticking out of walls that you grab to climb up look cool.  The sword fighting, the moves and camera work etc.  look cool. Altair (your character) looks cool.  Getting to the point, every detail seems to incorporate the rules of design (rhythm, motion, scale, harmony, balance, tension, etc.) sorry- art major speaking.The Good: It looks good, we know that, but the gameplay is innovative and fun.  There's a button for the legs, a button for each hand, and one for the head. I rarely feel like I have to reach or move the controller in some odd way to do something quickly- except for weapon switching, which we'll get to in the bad.  Combo's are easy to pull off and always look awesome. Kills are also immensely satisfying.  The blade goes through them and comes out covered in blood, not to mention the sound effects. The cities are vast and interesting to navigate.  You'll find yourself constantly wondering \"street or rooftops, how to get back up, where are the hide spots, were are the helpers, how do I escape...\"and so on. the AI provides a few original and interesting aspects.  Streets are literally packed with NPCs and its your job to sort pick out the troublemakers, navigate them.  I've had to not-so-stealthily kill more than a few beggars and drunks.  All of this incorporates into the assassinations,  and that's the real key of the game.the bad: This game made the same mistake (though not nearly as badly) as Shadow of Colossus.  It gives you a great big beautiful world with some really fun missions and nothing in between. There are missions in-between assassinations, but they're all pretty much the same thing. Scale the tower, stealthily kill some guards, pickpockets, eavesdrop and fight without your plethora of pointy things.  Where's the busty barkeep needing someone to usher her landlord off the mortal coil? Where's the guy who wants that exceptionally fast horse that some exceptionally tough knight happens to own? Glitches are also a problem- Though not to the point that they make you not want to play anymore.  Sometimes you get stuck between things. It usually spits you back out though.  I had one assassination where I couldn't hide because the pile of hay or whatever wouldn't let me out.  Godness (not goodness) slaughtering a whole battalion of gaurds is nothing.  Slaughtering a city full is time consuming.  The enemies get some new abilities, but for the most part- R1  - square and you perform some sweet looking critical damage. weapon switching!!! grr!!  all your weapons are on the directional buttons- a minor pain to get to in a pinch- yet the L1, L2, L3 and R3 go unused! gah!Overall I liked this game a lot.  Did it live up to the hype?  Missed it by this ()much.  Replay is kind of nil once you know what the story is. Unless, perhaps,  you're a bit OCD and must get 100% completion at all costs.  is it worth the money? yeah, I think it is, and I paid the $60 for it new. Why would anyone keep it around with so little replay value?  Use it to show off your new HDTV and stuff, of course!

Set in the Middle East during the time of the Crusades, you play Altair, a member of history's first true guild of assassins.  Altair is working to repel the presence of King Richard and his various European allies from the Holy Land, and to this end his youthful indiscretion has placed him on a slow path to re-learning what it is to be discreet.  There is a science-fiction angle though:  in truth you are a modern-day descendant of Altair named Desmond.  Desmond has been captured by a secretive organization who has the ability to place him inside his own racial memories.  As Altair's descendant, Desmond is stepping back in time to relive the pivotal moments of Altair's life.You start the main storyline having been stripped of your capabilities, and as you complete your tasks you earn them back.  This means that missions usually fall to the same pattern:  travel to the city where your target is located, learn more about them from the locals, and when you receive permission from the local Guild office to perform the hit, you have a growing variety of choices as to how to do so.  If you've played any of the Hitman games, you know the value of slow and careful patience; otherwise, it's going to take some getting used to.  You need to be careful when moving through the city to avoid drawing attention to yourself (and shake it off if things get too hot).  Altair has a variety of tricks up his sleeve:  local 'scholars' will protect you in their midst and keep you disguised long enough to get into many places.  When the local villagers are being intimidated by the guard, if you take a moment to rescue them you will have more citizens on your side, willing to step between you and the authorities and buy you time to make your escape.  Learning the lay of the land can be fun because it involves running along rooftops and climbing tall towers:  at the top of certain landmarks you unlock your view to these areas on the map.Assassin's Creed is a bit more forgiving of mistakes than the Hitman games, but this can also be its drawback.  I have to admit that there were times I was supposed to lay low and instead enjoyed the havoc I could cause taking the brute-force path.  I could complete a hit any way I liked without consequence--and I also discovered that the bad guys are often completely helpless when you're on horseback.  If you can resist the temptation to scatter guards like so many trampled bowling pins, you can immerse yourself in the stealth mechanic.  Either way, you won't be bored due to the many side goals you can complete:  root out Templars hoarding your people's treasures and dispatch them.  Interrogate or pickpocket people to gain information.  And you can also collect hidden flags of various types all over the place.If you're new to the series, Assassin's Creed is a lot of fun.

How about that for a change!In my opinion, it's the extremely innovative style of being able to join two video games togather to create one GRAND adventure that makes Sega Genesis the most memorable game system I've ever played. Being able to in fact join two games together is an example of video gamemaking that is beyond anything that ever came before then.It's a pity that Playstation never had the brilliance to learn the uniquness of Sega Genesis and create a game that could join up with another game the way this and &quot;Sonic and Knuckles&quot; did.If you still have Sega Genesis, I strongly recommend buying this game NOW! Get all three of the SOnic games, and get the &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; and &quot;Sonic and Knuckles&quot; and BAM!

And this is a loving, high-effort tribute.  Still, for full retail it's a little on the short side.  Not being a huge Beatles-catalog fan, there were a good many of the songs I did not recognize.The game picked up speed when you get back to Abbey Road--and get to play some of their trippy songs with the great visuals.The whole experience is more 'muted' than you've come to expect--but I think that's fitting and a stylistic choice.I played all the way through it in one day on Expert, and didn't fail a song--and I'm not that good.  So the difficulty, at least on guitar, is way below that of the GH/RB series.  But again, that's not the point.It truly is a superb \"beatles experience.\"  I'm just not sure how good of a GAME it is for the casual Beatles fan.

Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"The mechanics of doing whatever a spider can...","reviewText":"Well, the verdict is in.  In Spider-man 2, you truly can do whatever a spider can, and much, much more.  You can swing through New York City, climb to the top of skyscrapers, battle thugs, gangs, robbers and supervillains and even deliver a few pizzas while you're at it.  Yes, sir.  This game is better than any 3D spider-man game up to this point.But it's not perfect.From the start of the game, you make it a habit to explore the city and resolve crimes, both petty and serious, for which you earn hero points, with which you can purchase new moves and enhancements at the spidey store.  This is a fine little method of making sure the game doesn't get boring over time.Overall, the strongest aspect of this game is in the gameplay of the regular New York City crime-hunting levels.  Swinging through the city and fighting bad guys, using your spider-sense to dodge their attack, then either punching them, webbing them up or kicking them from above is probably the most fun I have had in a long time gameplay-wise.The problems in this game stem largely from the storyline-based missions you're asked to perform.  For example, early on, you have to get past a fluctuating radiation field to reach a series of switches that you have to punch to turn off, then later, when Mysterio shows up, guess what?  Right.  Platform-moving, switch-hitting and such like tired gaming cliches abound.  Some of the bosses and mini-bosses gave me some trouble at first, but only until I learned how to use my powers.  As I said, it's really the gaming cliches and dumb-feeling mini-games that surround characters like Mysterio that take away from the gameplay.  If you want the best possible experience out of this game, you could absolutely refuse to undergo any storyline missions, and you'd still have the real fun of this game (swinging around, beating the snot out of bad guys.)And what kind of incentive does the game give you to finish?  Well, you can buy more upgrades at the spidey store every chapter or so, but after a while, they're just expensive speed upgrades that aren't too noticable.  If the game had given you a \"replay with different options, modifications, character, costume and so forth\" option like the N64 Spider-Man game did, I would have felt more compelled to keep playing after I beat it, because it would have felt like there was something to accomplish.Now, make no mistake, I WILL keep playing it, because it feels really good to be Spider-Man in New York City, but it disappoints me that such a wonderful gaming element should have to stand alone instead of being integrated into a true masterpiece.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2004"}

It was more fun than should be legal. Now there is &quot;Super Circuit&quot;, a game very similar, but with a few differences, to the SNES classic.The track designs are upgraded, with more of a 3D feel to them. The Bowser's Castle areas look more like those out of Mario 64 than Mario Kart. The rich texturing and colorful animation take full advantage of the GBA's capacity (which is more powerful than the SNES, believe it or not). Too prevent the total deja-vu for older games, the track layouts are different, with more tracks, different objects to use both offensively and defensively, and a host of new challenges. This is a major plus because I beat the old Mario Kart in evey way possible. It is nice to have some new fun with an old concept.The music is superb, and the sound effects are classic Mario. As usual, you have a bunch of characters to choose from, including Mario, Luigi, Princess, Bowser, DK, Toad and others. A nice addition is that each character is rated according to speed and weight, so you can be more informed about which racer to choose. The controls are easy to master, and allow for fluid control while driving on the circuit. For gamers on the go, I cannot think of a more fun game.Overall, this is one of the benchmark games for the GBA, and one that ensures many hours of fun and quality game time.

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life. In the old stories, archons were spirits of fire, who served the long-lost creator gods. But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch. Her mother's people are nomads and wanderers, skilled in both warfare and magic, Katarina has been trained in their ways. At long range, she fights with ensorcelled bullets and deadly curses. When foes get close, they fare no better, as they come face-to-muzzle with her pistol and her shotgun &ndash; or perhaps the jaws of her faithful black hound. Katarina is mischievous and unpredictable, but she is also devoted to the Legion's cause...ReinhartReinhart descended from a great line of Legion mages, but he spent most of his life in Stonebridge, studying magic at the Collegium. As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes. Or he can use Entropic magic to warp time and space, destroying large numbers of enemies from afar. Reinhart is known for his unconventional thinking and innovative magical techniques...and for his eccentricity, too.","reviewerName":"Night Lord 40K","summary":"Very nice and challenging game.","reviewText":"First off let me say that I have never played the previous installments of this series. I can not even give you a comparison to other games of this type because this is the first that I have played. Most role playing games I play are games like skyrim ( Skyrim is freaking awesome ) Oblivion and Two worlds 2 and the like..This game is a more linear game than Skyrim or other games in the same vain , but there is much exploration ,hidden items and loot to be found. there are many locations and dungeons to battle through , no one place is like the other, and nothing feels generic from place to place. From the start to the end you will never see dungeons or buildings or lands that look similar to the last. This keeps everything fresh and entertaining.Character creation : I know in most RPG games you have the option to select a character and mold them to the finest detail. Unfortunately on DS3 you can only select from four preset characters.1 : Lucas Montbarron - This is your soldier ( tanking ) class.2 : Anjali - This would be similar to a battle mage. you use meele attacks along with spells and such.3 : Katarina - This is your range character. Rifles , shotguns , pistols.4: Reinhart - This is your streight up mage class. All of your combat will require spells , traps and such.When you select your character you will have the option to use any of the other three as your companion. you will not have them at first , but within the first 30 to 45 minutes of the game you will have a chance to select a companion. Your selection of character and companion will really affect the difficulty of your game. I tried all four as a main character and settled with Lucas and Anjali as my permanent companion. This combanation ( In my opinion ) is the best . If you are one of those people that hate preset characters , believe me you will forget about that after you begin the game.Skill Tree : This game has a skill system unlike any other game I have played. It is broken down into three pieces and has many options to choose from from. The experience points ( XP ) work similar to all other games ( you get enough XP then you rank up ). When you have recieved enough XP you will get the option to upgrade your character and your companion as well. YOU NEED TO READ CAREFULLY AND MAKE WISE DECISIONS WHEN UPGRADING YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR COMPANION..Do not waste your upgrades, you will dearly need them when it comes to boss fights and especially the final boss. I have seen numerous reviews where the author says his AI companion is useless.. Well that is because of the unwise decisions that were made when upgrading their companion ( Im sure you could search the best character builds online if you want ). I can't tell you how many times my companion has pulled my butt out of the fire and really helped win some really challenging boss fights. I also advise you to do as many side quests as you can , because if you go into a boss fight under powered you will have much frustration ahead ( as in you probably wont beat the boss and will have to go back and grind a little more ).Graphics : The graphics may not be the best in the world but by no means are thay bad. I find them very pleasing to look at. Everything just looks and feels really good , and this is true to every place you will travel in this game. You can tell the developers put time and care into the look and detail of this game. here is a link to some screen shots.[...]Story : This game has lots of dialogue. You can speed through these sections but I really advise you not to do so. The story in this game is really good and is supported by the conversations you will have with other characters throughout the game. I really love a good story and this game has a really good story if you take the time to listen.Gameplay / length : This all depends on how you play. If you are not the type to explore and grind on the side quests then the game may seem kind of short. The length also depends on the difficulty you play the game on ( casual , normal , hard ). I have already beaten the game on normal , completed all side quests and I think I finished the game between 35 to 40 hours. The length of this game will depend on YOU !!Conclusion : This is a Hack and Slash RPG that has unfairly recieved a bad rap. If you are into dungeon crawler hack and slash RPG's this game will most definately give you many hours of enjoyment. Great story , great gameplay , great RPG machanics = Great gameNote: You have multiple save slots in this game. DO NOT SAVE OVER THE SAME SLOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I went into a boss fight that I couldn't beat and had to go back to the previous save to go grind some more. If I had saved in that one slot the whole time I would not have been able to go back and grind which would have resulted in lots of frustration and starting the game over..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2013"}

For example, combat is noticeably improved, so that in large battles, you're not swinging wildly at who knows what as often. For the first time, you can actually lead an attack on an enemy position and feel like you're in charge. The inventory system is dramatically improved; for instance, each item can now be examined in minute detail, instead of being a kind of clumsy doodle. Most of the enemies have a little more depth to them, and the environment as a whole is much more varied and art-driven, so that no two caves feel exactly the same. Not so in Oblivion, where many times the only difference between one tomb and another seemed to be where a door was or was not. The questing system also takes a huge leap forward, as there is more to be done, and many more decisions to make. Everything is a little more dynamic -- and thus more fun. The ridiculous conversation system of Oblivion has been dispensed with, so that the dialogue always seems more natural -- although the character you play still has no voice. But the script is huge, probably twice as large as Oblivion's. Thousands of lines of dialogue, and most of it well-crafted. Survivalist skills are improved, like smithing and making potions. Money means a bit more here, too: the homes you save up to buy are more realistic, with interactive elements rather than just boring static displays. The game itself feels slightly longer but the world is smaller -- things are condensed, so that there is less pointless wandering. Most of the stories you play through are more intricate than those in Oblivion, though still pretty predictable. Finally, there are your companions, or \"followers.\" They're much more intelligent this time around (although still too limited in number), and varied. They'll put up equipment from fallen enemies on their own, or you can do it. And they're hardier -- more like protectors. They usually get winded, but don't die, unless you hit them, or they are poisoned.On the negative side, it's no longer possible to make potions of the fly; now you have to do it at a fixed table. And it's not an enjoyable process. Mostly, it's advisable to just put ingredients together at random to save time and push up your alchemical skill. And the system by which some quests are active and others not (and so do not appear on the map) is pointless. A few of the quests also dispense with reality by seeming to be time-based when you are given them; yet you can show up whenever you want to advance the story. The new idea of \"shouts\" is a complete failure. Shouts are essentially spells that you have to find in the world to make them work, yet because you can only find a fragment of them here and there, it will be very late in the game indeed before you can get any real good out of them. The scheme also means that there are fewer in-world spells available as a whole. Finally, people simply don't look as good as they did in Oblivion, though they move much more smoothly and act more realistically. They look more like they did in Morrowind. A step backward here, not forward. And the main story, involving fighting dragons, is pathetically thin. You'll find the side stories much more entertaining to play through.Nonetheless, all the positive improvements here are really remarkable; there seems to be no aspect of the Elder Scrolls world that was left unaddressed. A lot of work must have gone into this game. Oblivion was a great time anyway, perhaps the best RPG ever made. And Skyrim is definitely better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2012"}

A master thief with a strictly non-violent approach who takes on jobs around his decrepit city. During a heist at a mansion with his vicious former apprentice, Erin, Garrett observes something and is knocked into a coma for a year, waking to find the city being ravaged by a plague and strangled by the police policies of the Baron. But all that loot is just waiting there for the taking.Graphics are sublime. Your hands are regularly visible, and the detailing on even the subtle things, such as boxes, books, and candles is wonderful. The city has a cramped, claustrophobic feel, but not one that makes you feel railroaded, with dozens of crisscrossing catwalks and overhands.Audio is similar. Garrett is wonderfully voiced as a calm, calculating thug. The other characters you meet are oft times caricatures of tried and true cliches (mad scientist, tyrannical guard) they had crucial elements, and other characters are so novel and well done its a treat to hide in the shadows and listen to the tiny slices of their lives.Gameplay is where the game both makes its greatest marks and loses its fifth and fourth star. Certain elements of the shadow motion are wonderfully done. You can slink within arms reach of a guard and not be spotted if you play your cards right. You can get by without any tools, but they do make life so much easier. The bow is well balanced and you find yourself using it as a tool rather than a crutch. Guards pay attention, so if you leave a safe open, they'll know you're nearby. However, other elements are frustrating and annoying. Certain noises wake the dead, such as missing a single tumbler in a lock can rouse the whole area. Certain elements that're obviously scripted break down at random times. I spent 10 minutes waiting for a servant to finish polishing a glass and leave before I realized the system had locked up. Distractions oft times do nothing except alert enemies, and many times they would not go investigate, and just stand locked in place, while I fumed at having to unnecessarily kill 2 more people to get at a crucial piece of loot. And navigating the city is nothing short of asinine. I spent hours trying to find a window to go through or a rooftop to climb to reach a door to the bank job, only to find I had to slink through an unmarked gap in some crates three blocks away.Nits do abound. The \"predator\" aspect is so easy to invoke, and the rational between opportunist and ghost is ridiculous if you're trying to be a master thief. Certain areas and quick moves can kill you because of a button hang up, meaning you'll jump off the roof rather than go down the ladder you're standing in front of.Overall, a great thief game with a wonderful look and feel, which requires several patches to finish polishing the handling and rework to navigation to make it not absurdly stupid, and this would be five stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

Bakehorn","summary":"This fantasy's still a classic.","reviewText":"Final Fantasy is a series that's almost as familiar to casual and hardcore gamers as Mario and Zelda, yet the franchise has been incomplete in America for 16 years. Well, that was the case until November 15th rolled around and Nintendo DS owners were treated to the first-ever American version of Final Fantasy III. Originally a 1990 NES game that has long since been a mystery to those who didn't illegally download ROMs or import the game, Final Fantasy III is a great game that has aged quite well and makes a great appearance on the Nintendo DS.The story is pretty bare for 2006 standards, but thinking of the classic style of the game, it is quite above other games of its time. The story revolves around Luneth, a boy from the dark world who forms a team with three other individuals destined to be the Warriors Of The Light. These Warriors are prophesied to save the world from darkness and protect the four precious, powerful crystals that maintain balance and peace. Luneth and Co. (Arc, Refia, and Ingus) set out to set everything in the world straight. Today we sit and think, \"How generic.\" Back then, though, it was as popular of an idea as playing a rhythm-based game with a guitar controller.Let's get one thing straight; this game's dated in a lot of ways. If you've played the PlayStation or Game Boy Advance remakes of Final Fantasy I & II, you've got an idea about how the pacing, battle system, and overall flow of the classic RPG goes. It's much different than SquareEnix's other recent RPG of the same franchise, Final Fantasy XII; which feels completely different without considering its gameplay and battle system alterations. Final Fantasy III isn't an easy game. It doesn't really hold your hand at any point, and it'll ruthlessly punish those unfortunate gamers who tread off of the suggested path. Still, it's got that classic hook, a hook that's almost impossible to describe but even harder to avoid once it's snagged you.Final Fantasy III keeps the four-person party standard of its two original predecessors and also has the traditional turn-based battle system. The result is a system that forces you to really think about your actions each turn because the enemy is going to attack no matter what their agility or speed parameters are. If Refia's running low on HP and you suspect a possible group attack by a boss character, it would be wise to cast a healing spell and maybe even prepare a Phoenix Down. It would have been nice to see SquareEnix adapt the Active Time Battle system of Final Fantasy VI, VII, and so on, but what's here works well anyway. The MP system is quite dated, and instead of having a set amount, each level of magic has its own number of points. Using a level one black magic spell like Fire will take one point away from your level one magic points, while a level three one like Fira takes away one level three magic point. No matter what spell you use, it takes away a single point. I don't like this system much, because it doesn't give much importance or power to each spell. For example, level three white magic spells Cura and Teleport are given the same point value, which doesn't make sense when Cura will be used at least fifty times as often as Teleport throughout the game. This seems to be a good place to mention the menu system, which is also quite dated and sometimes not as easy to use as newer entries. Because of the dated MP system, there are numbers all over the place and it seems a little sloppy.The new story here is the job system. Surely if you've been to a gaming Internet page or read a gaming magazine in the last few months, you've seen the Final Fantasy III ads that state that it offers 279,841 unique party combinations, with four characters and 23 different jobs. If you don't believe it, grab your nearest graphing calculator and figure up the equation for factorials. From the beginning, every character possesses the neutral (and undeveloped) Freelancer job. As you find and interact with more of the powerful crystals throughout the storyline, you'll unlock more jobs and develop your party even further. You can be a Warrior, Thief, Monk, Black, Red, or White Mage early in the game and eventually you'll unlock jobs like Geomancer, Dark Knight, Dragoon, Summoner and Ninja. Once you choose a job, you can power it up by increasing its job level; a value unique to each job for each individual character. For example, it's possible for Luneth to be a Level 15 Freelancer, Level 25 Warrior, and Level 30 Dark Knight before the end of the game. These levels, of course, are separate from the character's base level, which, as always, increases with experience points earned in random battles and boosts your general stats.More than anything, Final Fantasy III is a good way to introduce a foreign chapter of the series to long-term players and series veterans. I wasn't surprised when, after a 30-minute trek through a cave, I was killed in two turns by a boss character and forced to tread that long path all over again. It's unfortunate that so much backtracking is required, but even after dying a second time to the same boss using the same annoying attack, I picked the game back up. I trudged through it despite my bitterness and enjoyed every second of it. Classic RPGs like Final Fantasy III didn't introduce save points or crystals that are found in later games; the only save point is the overworld map. Here, the game can be saved from any point. Another big challenge comes when status-changing magic wreaks havoc on your party. Unlike recent RPGs, where negative status is often eliminated after battle, almost every single status ailment in Final Fantasy III remains afterward. Poison, paralysis, confusion, frog-all of these familiar effects will be a lot more familiar by the time players see ending credits. Unseasoned RPG players will probably be quite frustrated, and know that every time you see an enemy use the attack \"Bad Breath,\" you're in for quite a lot of trouble.Final Fantasy III is one of the best-looking DS games to date. SquareEnix introduced a visual style that's reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. As a result the game is very colorful and detailed. Spell effects are as impressive as one could expect from the DS and trump those of some console games. The boss and monster models are fun to look at and defeat. I would have liked to see some more animation during battle; rather than running up and attacking enemies, like in Final Fantasy X, characters stand in place and swing their weapons in classic RPG style. It would have been really nice to see SquareEnix go those extra two miles (they already went one by reworking the graphics) but what's done here is great. The music seems to be standard RPG fare, and I'm not totally sure whether or not the tunes are high-quality rips from classic NES MIDI, but what's here sounds pretty nice. At least there's that unforgettable nine-note victory tune; that'll always get a smile out of a Final Fantasy fan.Final Fantasy III serves its purpose by introducing an unknown chapter to fans and doing so in a very respectable fashion. There are things that could have been better, sure. SquareEnix could have put a little more time in modernizing the battle system, animation, menus, and save system. That would have put two cherries on top of a sweet, tasty treat. Even with all of these little kinks, Final Fantasy III is great. It's got that classic replay value. It's got that punishing challenge that will appeal to fans of older games. It's got production values that are topped only by SquareEnix's other DS game, Mario Hoops 3-On-3. The end all to end all, it's a well-done Final Fantasy game. It's one of the best handheld RPGs in a long time, and needs to be in a DS owner's collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2006"}

Why?Because now you have to do the same raids over and over and over until that item with probability of appears of 0.001% appears and you have the luck in the rolls and win the item. If you lose in the rolls, the complete run in the raid is a waste of time. And also you have to deal with guild's GMs with some kind of God complex, really jerks.So in a nutshell, any MMORPG in the max level is = kill N mobs in a raid + have luck in the rolls.And you wonders to yourself, WTF?In the single player RPG, you are able to change the world and the adventure in each thing that you do.In a MMORPG, you can't change the world, no matter what you do.So here is the big question:play more MMORPGs where you only have to kill mobs all the time and have luck in the rolls?orplay more single player RPG like Dragon Age: Origins where you have to think and set the strategy in order to achieve the victory.The choice is yours.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"Small Tidbits Keep it From Being as Legendary as Secret of Mana","reviewText":"Squaresoft was having quite a time in the year 2000.  They released a lot of good fun and classics games.  Among them were Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy IX and Threads of Fate to name a few.  Legend of Mana came around and was a well liked game by quite a few who were quite taken with Secret of Mana years prior.  That being said, Legend of Mana was a great game that holds up well today that is mostly troubled by strange problems more so than big ones.There's no overall plot to Legend of Mana.  In fact, the game in and of itself has a storybook like feel.  You'll choose a character (boy or girl) and give him or her a weapon (it doesn't matter which).  After that you'll pick a spot in the world to occupy and start building.  The system at work here is a pretty complex but can be quite nice at times.  You build on a world map by taking artifacts and placing them. Once you do a new area on the map will spring up for you to venture to.  Legend of Mana is very much a dungeon crawler by every respect.  By going to new locations or speaking to people in towns you've built from your artifacts you'll be able to start missions, which are usually stories in and of themselves.  Each has a beginning and end.  Usually ending with you defeating a boss and often collecting an artifact.  There are a lot of missions.  Some are as simple as finding the right person and speaking to them.  Others are more complex, having you crawling through dungeons to defeat bosses and to return certain items to other characters.  They're varied in structure.  You might get an action heavy story that has you in several battles only to later help someone by simply running about a town and talking to various citizens.  There might not be a single battle in this instance.  It gives a nice varied pace to Legend of Mana.You'll also help out some who may later open up various secrets.  For instance, after completing one mission I unlocked a workshop that allowed me to create and temper weapons.  And to get the best of the best requires a lot of work and grinding to do.Just because Legend of Mana doesn't have an OVERALL plot doesn't mean there aren't plot threads within it.  Many missions you undergo lead to other missions to continue a particular narrative at work.  It may seem like Niccolo is nothing special from his first mission, but stick with him and it becomes quite an interesting story arc.  There are many minor characters who have big involved stories.  There are three different story arcs in particular that you can view that will get you to the endgame itself.  And they are by far the three most involving, heartbreaking and well told stories of the lot.  The first involves a mysterious girl named Pearl and her partner Elazul from the dying race of Jumi.  A jewel thief named Sandra steals their jewel which kills them.  Your role in this quest is to stop her and save the Jumi race from dying out entirely.  The second involves two Dragoons, Larc and Sierra and a lord named Drakonis who must be stopped from taking over the world.  The last story arc involves Escad, Matilda, Irwin and Deana as their friendshps cripple and war between humans and faeries seems inevitable.All three of those arcs are extremely good stories.  That being said, it's a shame that none of these subplots and stories ever come together to form a main storyline.  For quite some time the main objective of the game is fairly unclear.  And without a walkthrough of some sort you'll find it particularly hard to get to the endgame as the path to get there isn't exactly straightforward.  And the lack of an overall plot means there are very few hints on how to get there or even what exactly you're searching for to get there.  At the very least most of the stories are fairly good in and of themselves.Gameplay wise, Legend of Mana is a lot more straightforward than most games.  For gamers who were quite impressed with Secret of Mana's action oriented battle system they'll be surprised to know the approach here is a lot different.  Legend of Mana plays more like a beat 'em up at times than an actual RPG.  By that I mean that before battle your characters run around quite normally.  When enemies are encountered you'll enter battle mode and pull out your weapons.  You'll have to beat up the baddies before you can press on.  The screen will also no longer scroll at that time.  Your HP is shown in percentages as opposed to a numerical value as in other RPGs.  In battle mode you'll be able to use abilities and techniques.  This may, in fact be the most overlooked (and important part) of Legend of Mana.  The abilities you equip start as things like only being able to jump and crouch, but later you get more of them.  And these play a role in helping you learn battle techniques.  As you battle and deal damage a gauge under you HP gauge fills up.  When full you can initiate special attacks.  The only way to learn these special techniques, however, is if you are willing to mix and match your abilities.  Likewise, special techniques are also based on weapons.  So a sword will learn a whole different set of special techniques than a dagger.  This gives A LOT of variety to Legend of Mana's battle system.You'll sometimes run around on your own, but on occasion you'll be joined by a partner that you can recruit.  Most partners only stick around for a brief amount of time or until they're dismissed.  It's possible to run around all of Legend of Mana will two partners at all times.  It's a good thing too, because Legend of Mana supports multiplayer.  While you control the main hero your ally will control the other.  And if you both have Legend of Mana data on your memory cards you can import your partners character or jump into his game with yours.The battles themselves are fine, but Legend of Mana can certainly be repetitive to play after a while.  When getting into battles with your enemies there is no way to simply skip them should you be tired of battling.  You can't &#34;run&#34; from battle.  They must always be fought 'til the end.  In some instances this will be extremely annoying.  Especially because enemies respond the moment you leave the area and return.  In some dungeons this can make battling feel like a chore.  In others it can just feel downright exhausting.  At least you always start a battle at full HP.  Likewise your HP will also regenerate if you're not taking too much damage in battle (or you use the crouch ability).  That being said, Legend of Mana is not a difficult game at all.  If you fall in battle you can start it over right on the spot.  If something should go wrong in a battle it's fairly easy to recover.  You can also get a lot of experience in some areas by constantly running in and out of the same rooms.On the other hand, your AI controlled allies are not smart at all.  At least you don't have to babysit them.  For two reasons.  The first is that if they die in battle after a little while they'll be automatically revived.  The second is that most encounters won't last too long for them to be a problem anyway.  It's impossible for them to deplete their reserves of MP.  They also have special attacks of their own.  Everything they do is independent of you, but you needn't restore them to full power ever.  They can be fairly good at soaking up damage at least, but for the most part they're not too useful in battle.Legend of Mana isn't a hard game to get through.  Depending on how many quest you can do it can be very short (around five or six hours) or really long, but you're not likely to spend much more than 20-30 hours.  And that's upon choosing do to every quest.  There are some things to extend the time, but not much.  There's a lot of tempering with your weapons and armor, but given the nature of how Legend of Mana is there isn't really such a thing as a &#34;sidequest&#34; and there aren't really any mini-games to play through.  In the way of extra content, Legend of Mana only offers a New Game+ where you'll carry over all your equipment and you'll have a chance to increase the difficulty level of the game.  Aside from that, Legend of Mana isn't a game that's filled with an untold number of secrets or sidequests.  There is already a lot in the way of quests as it is.  And since not all of them need to be done to complete the game everything within it can be tackled at your leisure.Graphically, Legend of Mana may be the best example of what it means for a game to be aesthetically pleasing.  A lot of gamers don't seem to realize that graphics are really nothing more than pixels.  The aesthetics is what gives the game the visual characteristics you associate with it.  Legend of Mana is not a graphically powerful game, but it sure does have a lot of great aesthetic quality.  There are few Playstation games that have aged as well as Legend of Mana.  The game looks absolutely gorgeous in every way.  There are no blocky pixels.  Everything in it is handrawn and hand crafted with sprites and artistic backgrounds.  This makes Legend of Mana look better than many of its contemporaries of the day.  It might not be as powerful as Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy IX or Vagrant Story, but it most certainly is a lot easier on the eyes fourteen years later than those particular games.  The art style is simply an assault on the senses.  To put it one way, many Playstation games had an artists rendition of a character that you saw (the way they were supposed to look) but given the power of the Playstation couldn't exactly make them look like that.  Since Legend of Mana utilizes sprites as opposed to polygons every character actually DOES look like the artist rendition.  And this makes the game look extremely good.  The artstyle doesn't just stop with character sprites.  The scenery, spells, special techniques and special movies are all illustrated this way.  Legend of Mana is simply gorgeous.  Complimenting the fantastic art style is a near perfect soundtrack.  From a presentation standpoint it's hard to find fault with Legend of Mana.All that being said, Legend of Mana is a good game.  The gripes I have with it aren't big, they're just strange.  It's hard to criticize the overall plot when the game doesn't present one to us to begin with.  Likewise, with battling, there's nothing inherently &#34;wrong&#34; with the battle system, it just happens to get more repetitive than other games.  Overall Legend of Mana is a good game, but it might not necessarily be the greatest to come out of the Mana franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2000"}

I bought it from gamestop but if youre like me, always using amazon as a place to get review knowledge.First, this game is great, especially for consoles!  I dont think this rpg could compete with some of the major pc games like diablo or wow or whatever since its not a traditional rpg in the sense, but if youre an avid fps on consoles but you like the occasion rpg, say like skyrim then this game is the perfect choice!  It is a fps with the elements of an rpg, gain levels, unlock skills, do quests etc.What else adds to the fun is that this game actually supports coop play!  Oh how I miss the days of coop games..I swear those days are now becoming far and in between.. I couldnt stand split screen on cod games, blops or mw3 (seemed more laggy then usual..plus I think cod games are a joke with the p2p connection...but that review belongs somewhere else;)**KNOW THIS** and this does not make me very happy and probably should knock off a couple stars, but I cant bc I am in love with this game.  I bought this game along with my brother..we play over XBL but my wife surprisingly liked the first one so she was all about getting the second one, perfect right?  We can all play like one big happy family!..I put the disc in, pull up the menu and I go to add her in the party but guess what?!  She cant be my guest and have anything of hers saved..nor can she log onto any account that isnt a \"Gold membership\"  FAIL!  So now I have to go buy her a xbl account JUST to play over xbl with my brother in our party.  (ONLY MICROSOFT XBOX PS3 IS EXEMPT)  So people BEWARE...if you are planning on using XBL on your parties and you are split screening, your 2nd player HAS TO HAVE AN XBL GOLD ACCOUNT.  Or you can always play offline as a system link split but that defeats the awesome additions to the xbl multiplayer..(ie, 4 player parties from friends/family around the world, drop in and out of quests that your friends are doing..already did the quest? no problem, help them complete their quests and get xp..havent got to the quest your friend is working on?  No problem, still do the quest and once you get there on your own story you have the chance of skipping it!)  These elements are great, and its worth the extra account $$$ to see them in action..but it still rubs me the wrong way..(anyone know if borderlands 1 was like this?  BC I sure dont remember that whatsoever)Also the UI is alot better in this game, like mini map, options menu, oh and you are able to choose between horizontal or vertical split screen, def a plus!This game is def made to play with other people.  Make sure you are friends somehow with the people in your party..I can potentially see alot of ninja looting going on from a complete stranger making you miss out on some solid loot after taking down a baddy!!solid 5 stars IMO..but a negative 5 stars for money grubbin microsoft forcing me into multiple accounts (interesting thought, if microsoft didnt own the rights of halo, I would imagine most of us would be playing for free on ps3..but because we all signed up years ago, we all dont want to switch)thank you for reading my review and I apologize for the offshoots of my opinions./endrantAlso if I could use your help..Ive read many things online stating that you cannot have 2-2 split screen players to form a 4 player party over XBL..is this true?  That only 1 console can have split screen?  If anyone can comment below who have already tried this I would greatly appreciate it.Just know your 60$ is well spent in this game..plenty to offer and GREAT improvements since borderlands 1 with multiplayer..I wish I had more experience with the game but alas it is still day 1 of release!Happy Hunting!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

Enabling &ldquo;Ninja Vision&rdquo; will allow players to detect and analyze potential enemy weak points, secret paths, and hidden information within the environment. Beware though, while using &ldquo;Ninja Vision,&rdquo; characters become susceptible to excess damage.

Ninjutsu is a special power that results in an explosive electrical force to either stun enemies or protect oneself from attack. Only true Ninja Masters can achieve this technique.Interactive quick-time events:Scattered throughout integral parts of the storyline, characters will come across various quick-time events where players will have the opportunity to directly interact with in-game cut-scenes. Quick reflexes will be rewarded as players interact with controller buttons as directed on screen during intense battles.Modern Realism:Ninja Blade offers a fresh twist to the classic ninja saga by basing all 3D gaming maps directly from the actual skyscrapers and building tops in modern day Tokyo.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"3.5; a Ninja Gaiden for the less hardcore","reviewText":"A funny thing happened when I was playing Ninja Blade: my opinion regarding Team Ninja's infuriating and way-too-difficult-past-the-point-of-fun Ninja Gaiden II started to change a bit. Granted its still beyond challenging still but the combat system is probably the funnest of all combat systems which to me best God of War or Devil May Cry. Ninja Blade however is one of those games that likes to borrow elements from everywhere and shine those up to such finesse you go \"wow!\" and hopefully you won't see the seams. The game is over-the-top and so ridiculous that it almost becomes like a dumb blockbuster, theres barely any substance or plot and the game has several issues but you're like \"yeah but dude, I just drove a motorcycle on a bus and threw it at a giant worm...while it was in mid-air, even!\"Story: It's the future and Tokyo is being attacked by transformed citizens which they dub \"carriers\", thanks to the worm organism that infects a person and turns them incredibly hostile. Some of them grow even to the size of jets so in comes Ken Ogawa, talented ninja to take them on but it's not long before betrayal sets in and he's got more to do than just beat a couple of mutated people.Graphics: The team that worked on the awesome Otogi series does bring a sense of style to the game though it's not flashly or awe-inducing but it is cool. Shades of the Matrix are a-plenty here with slo-mo, neon and skyscrapers lit at night give it a very stylish look. In-game it looks alright but it's nothing spectacular. I noticed some really harsh slowdown at one point which made me wonder whether it was the game showing off and looking cool or if it was actually being that slow. The QTE cutscenes are outlandish and crazy and if you can stomach the Simon Says button prompts, you'll be treated to some pretty nifty sequences.Sound/Music: Rather forgettable on all counts. Music is there and I suppose it works but it never seems to call attention to itself, even during high octane parts the music never seems to elevate the game it just...sits there. Same for the voice acting which is pretty flat and not really emotive. But then again, we're here for the blood and killing demons with wrecking balls so take the seriousness of Metal Gear games away from this one.Gameplay: The game can essentially be boiled down to 2 ways of progressing: quicktime events and Ninja Gaiden-inspired combat, right down to pressing D-pad to change weaponry, combos, small platforming parts and huge boss fights. The combat here isn't as button-heavy as other games though it's somewhat maddening. Hit detection can be off, aiming certain moves is tricky since you can actually miss rather than target the nearest enemy and some enemies even go through your moves and get a hit. There's even sections where they'll burst out of barrels or walls you break down and hit you and it always feels like a cheap shot since otherwise, how would you know they were even there? Or even knew when to block?Critics have been lambasting the game for its over-excessive use of quicktime events, first shown with Shenmue but got even more attention thanks to Resident Evil 4 and God of War. And just like Devil May Cry, all the coolest maneuvers are reserved for the cutscenes but it looks cool anyway, but here's a tip: never put down your controller. You'll know when a sequence will pop up when there's a big close-up of Ken's eye (extreme closeup! waaaaaaaaahh!...sorry) and you'll be prompted to press a button, a direction or button mash with ratings based on each one. Thing is if you fail you don't die per se you just rewind Prince of Persia-style and try again. I actually found these sequences funner than actually fighting so go figure.Weapons are the basics: the big beast of a sword for strong attacks, typical sword and a dual-blade which acts more like whips akin to Kratos' arms or that one sword from Heavenly Sword, which these are perfect for these annoying bats. Added in are ninpo...sorry, ninjitsu. While these are useful, enemies are so annoying and always attacking that using say the fire one will just cause you to get hit anyway. Though clearing out obstacles like fire or blowing up flammable barrels is always fun but since enemies I noticed where the armored variety, I always ended up just using the big beast anyway. You can activate ninja vision with LB which'll highlight enemies or things you couldnt see otherwise which helps quite a bit though because it's tied to your spells use, you'll probably just drain it anyway while you wait till it replenishes. Call if difficult all you want but Ninja Gaiden's combat was more refined than here which seems like it could be something good but just not perfected.Would I recommend Ninja Blade? Well if you find Ninja Gaiden too hard then yeah but fair warning: if you hate quicktime events, then this'll be your least favorite game ever...probably.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2009"}

It always saddens me how indie games can't get the AAA budgets because there are some out there that have better elements than AAA titles. Deadly Premonition is one of them when it comes to story, characters, and atmosphere. The game looks, plays, and feels like a pre-2003 PS2 game and is just down right ugly. I'll get to that later but right now you have to know how excellent this riveting story is. You play as FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is investigating a murder in a small countryside town Greenvale. You meet the Sheriff's and other citizens throughout the game, and the story is always unwinding plot twists and revealing dark secrets about every single character.The premise is a legend of the Raincoat Killer that rampaged through the town in the 50's. It appears that there is a \"New Raincoat Killer\" mimicking the old one, and Morgan must stop this guy before he kills everyone Morgan grows close to. There are two parts to the game and this consists of driving around the regular world then entering the \"Other World\" to investigate crime scenes and find clues. This \"Other World\" is a lot like Silent Hill's, but the game never explains what this world is and why it appears in the town. I hate how that was never answered so it feels like it may just be tacked on. When you are in this \"Other World\" you get to use your guns and shoot creepy zombies. These zombies are really brain dead and can only really hurt you if you are overwhelmed or backed into a corner. The AI is cheap, but that's fine because you just want to know more of the story.When you enter this world Morgan will start profiling fuzzy clues together and it's up to you to find them, but thankfully the game scraps Silent Hill's labyrinthine maze like levels for straight forward linear ones and I never got lost. There are red areas that show where to go so you never get lost. The puzzles are very simple and don't even require exercising your cerebral cortex, but it's OK because you just want the game to move on to uncover more of the juicy story. The controls are very unintuitive, but the game works around them so it's never really frustrating. You hold X down to run but you hold down RT to aim and A to attack, but LT is to lock-on. The controls are strange and archaic but they work for the most part. The weapons are your typical survival horror stuff like shotguns, pistols, and melee weapons so don't expect much in that regard.The rest of the game is completely boring and down right yawn inducing. Driving around Greenvale from place to place will make you fall asleep because the cars feel, sound, and drive like something from pre-2000 games. The game doesn't even use real time or dynamic lighting but static lighting! Cones for headlights? I felt like I was playing a PS1 game some times. The cars sound like dying lawn mowers and drive like one too. There aren't any people walking around and the cars appear out of nowhere like they just came out of hyper drive. The developers even put in side quests and some sort of collectible card hunt but why would you bore yourself so much? It's dry, dull, and just not fun at all.There are some RPG elements like having to watch Morgan's hunger, tiredness, and even how dirty his suit gets, plus you can shave. Yeah it's WTF moments that are thrown in like that that really make no sense. They are unnecessary but hey they're there. What really saves Deadly Premonition is that the developers knew the game's flaws and built everything to accommodate for it like quick time events during boss fights instead of a dodge button. It makes the game very playable and I applaud them for doing this.The only reason to trudge through the is for the amazing story. You really care about the characters, and there is some freaky crap in this game that would even put some stuff in Silent Hill to shame. The game does drag a little bit with about 15 hours of game play, but they could have cut the fat out and made it about 8-10 if there wasn't the terrible \"open world\" part thrown in. If you can forgive horrible graphics, terrible animations, abysmal sounds, and archaic controls you will be rewarded with a thrilling and deep story that is unforgettable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Not because of the issues the game has - of which there is plenty - but rather it's frustrating because you're playing something that you know should be better than this. Earlier this year, 2 games came out which also had some real lack of polish and iffy design decisions but they were games that I put in quite a bit of time into anyway: those being Nier and Deadly Premonition. Those 2 and including Alpha Protocol are games where half of your brain is completely criticizing nearly every facet of what it has from the graphics to the AI to the unrefined gameplay and yet the other half keeps playing regardless and you're left wondering how's that possible with a game this flawed. Of course the game did have its share of problems from the delays to Sega apparently saying it wasn't \"RPG enough\" yet the game, which was supposed to come out in October, was delayed till the very beginning of June so that's roughly 8 months or so for polishing so makes you wonder if the game needed more time or if Sega interfered too much. Let me say now that this is a very hard game to recommend since you'll either be like me and can see yourself doing a 2nd playthrough just for the hell of it and the others will be like \"I can't even finish it, it's so bad\".Story: The story centers on Michael Thorton, an agent in Alpha Protocol, one of those secret spy organizations that gets the job done without the official acknowledgment or help from the US government. His latest mission is to go after the leader of a terrorist organization who shot a commercial airliner while in-flight but when evidence surfaces that a defense contractor, Halbech, supplied the missiles, Michael goes into investigating Halbech and what their motives are for the attack.One thing I never liked about Bioware's approach to choice in Mass Effect was that they wanted you to feel like the game was all about choice and repercussions yet most of it was small lines of dialogue that were changed and only in a few instances were things outright different. Alpha Protocol on the other hand you really feel that your progression in the story can divert completely based on what you do and you might even find complete cinematics that you didn't receive your first time through based on what you did or said, choices that have nothing to do with whether you were a nice guy or an evil prick.Graphics: There's 2 types of ugly graphics: game's like the aforementioned Deadly Premonition with bad textures, wonky framerate, technical glitches and a general presentation that does not scream \"HD graphics\". On the other hand we have what Alpha Protocol has which are \"HD graphics done poorly\". There's a whole host of issues with the game graphically such as slowdown (with me thinking my Xbox might be warping or it's too hot), textures that load in eventually and even load back out, an almost pervasive amount of motion blur at times and this game is really bogged down graphically by these issues. Strangely enough, Obsidian is no stranger to these kind of things from Neverwinter Nights 2 and KOTOR 2 both having graphic problems so not sure if that's just how they are or whether they're a better developer that can never get it right due to money or time. On a sidenote: the girls of the game look cute.Sound/Music: One thing I will commend the game on is the voice acting which is like Bioware games in that they're really top notch. While the VA for Michael Thorton isn't the most emotive guy, he does a commendable job at being likable and especially tolerable considering how much we have to hear him talk. And practically everyone from your handler Mina to journalist Scarlet and the various villains you'll come across. Music also has that very Bond-esque tones with some bigger action scores to the intrigue and quiet moments. Sound effects though are...okay. Guns are quite loud but aren't satisfying loud a la Battlefield but everything works fine, it's just not wholly impressive.Gameplay: Here's where the sleeves get rolled up, the part where you basically get ready and go \"alright game, you're gonna get it\". Let's start with what the game bills itself which is the \"espionage RPG\" so let's look at the RPG bits. The game does offer a range of skills that you can maximize yourself in from better gun handling and skills, stealth, gadgetry such as grenades or even a big fist fighter but the problem is is that unlike Mass Effect, you always feel like you can't rely entirely on one \"build\" since you never know when the other build will be needed. So for instance, let's say you make the ultimate Splinter Cell build and make him entirely stealth-based and silenced pistol but then there's moments where you're basically in a shoot out and a more offensive force is required such as shotguns or assault rifles well tough. It pays to be a more well-rounder then go for one total approach because half the time you might be lamenting not being able to do certain aspects. And unlike Mass Effect 2 where the RPG stuff was your character and skill build and the shooting was normal shooting, this has the Fallout 3-esque dice roll where your attacks can hit or not hit so even though you're 4 feet away from a guy with a shotgun with a good spread, this health bar's barely going down cause that's what the dice of Vegas say so...or something. The counter to this is the more precision aim where the longer you hold your gun aimed towards a specific spot, the smaller the reticule gets, making for a very precise shot but when everyone's running around or not standing still, it can get a bit annoying.Speaking of \"everyone's running around\", the AI is a bit of a mess and that's putting it lightly. Some will stand there and not fire while I'm shooting at his 3 other companions and THEN starts firing, some will run up to you like they want to shoot you, stop, get down on one knee and start firing completely out in the open, start running in circles like a dog chasing their tail and goes on and on. Even the game says it's best not to do anything while in sight of cameras so no killing dudes on camera or anything of the sort yet if you takedown a guy near a camera and it looks over the knocked out or dead body, no alarms trip. That however is not taken into account when you take on boss fights which are some of the more infuriating to get through and I guarantee you most of your deaths will come from these guys. They tend to be more accurate, take a lot more punishment and have unblockable attacks that do a fair bit of hurt and you can't do bugger all. Let's just say that if Obsidian were to name this the \"espionage shooter RPG\" well the shooting part would be kind of laughable.Then there is the mini-games. There's 3 types: a word search type where you have to find 2 codes buried in a mix of rapidly changing codes to find the 2 that aren't moving but when you're scanning over the entire grid and literally seeing nothing standing still, it gets a bummer, not to mention the controls are incredibly sluggish and more than once you'll be like \"hurry up!\" The 2nd type is akin to those \"follow the line to the end\" mazes where you have to turn on circuits in order as you follow their number back to whichever circuit it ends on. When there's like 4 or 5, it's fine but when there's 8? And you don't have much time to do it in and the slow cursor doesn't help makes it a bother yet there's points in the game where you literally can't progress unless you hack it so be a good spy and buy the upgrade that slows down the hacking mini-game timer. The 3rd is less of a bother: the left trigger controls the pressure of a lock and by based on how hard or light you're pressing, it raises the lock while the right trigger locks it so you're aiming for that small space in between the 2 segments. It's decent and not as bothersome but can potentially be a hassle.The last bit of gameplay isn't so much gameplay but it's part of the experience anyway which is the dialogue trees. Occasionally in conversation, you'll have the option to give a certain tone or response to an NPC so against the females you might have dismissive, flirty or professional whereas against a character you're not completely trusting of, you might get flippant, curious and understanding and it's based on these responses that will dictate where the game will go. For instance in one scenario you meet a German commando/milf type woman named SIE who you can befriend and potentially even bed later on. When you're on a mission, you can either bring the leader of a military group you've fallen in good graces with or you can bring SIE, which results in not only useful information and even help in-mission but dialogue between her, you and your normal handler Mina with some jealously going on between Mina but bringing the G22 guys as they're called, you might get a completely different cinematic or dialogue. This helps the game's replayability since you really feel like there's so much of the story you didn't see and unlike Mass Effect where you can make 2 or 3 big choices and the rest is really just how thorough you are, Alpha Protocol's narrative and story feels a lot bigger than just that first playthrough. Whether you can stomach additional playthroughs though is another thing.You know that old saying which can be something like \"this is really bad but I can't stop watching?\", like you know you should be liking this less than you are but you keep doing it anyway? Alpha Protocol is similar in that in a year which has had so many polished and worthwhile games, this one comes out and it's unpolished in nearly every aspect except its story and characters (which seem to be an Obsidian trademark: iffy to decent gameplay but excellent storytelling) yet you keep going. Like Nier and Deadly Premonition, these are games that I'm enjoying and could easily see myself playing it again yet the more I want to see more of the game, the more I'll be seeing the glitches, bugs, unrefined...well everything yet I tolerate it because I want to see more of what else it has. It's like a sick gaming circle of life thing or something.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

First off I tried this unit with GH World Tour on PS2 worked great 5 stars on 2 songs that I had only 4 starred previously.  Next up the PS3 and a SINGSTAR title NO GO as these games only work with SONYS mics/adapters, this is not a surprise but I thought I would give it a try.  The mic worked great on AC/DC rock band,RB track pack 2 as expected.  Next up the XBOX360 and GH Metallica, 2 songs later and I am scoring better on that game as a vocalist as well.  Very clear reception is offered on this mic and there are no CRACKS or POPS as I sometimes experienced with the old wired LOGITECH mics, also it feels lighter even with batteries but that is probably from the weight drag of the old cord. If you want to sing and play guitar the little mic stand allows for this but you probably are gonna have to sit down and that defeats the wirelss aspect.  The price tag should have included a rechargable battery so 1 star off.  Now the singer can have the same wireless joy as the rest of the band the next time you fire up your favorite USB MIC supported music game.

The Orange Box 9849 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Bang for the buck","reviewText":"For what you pay with this title, you get a lot of content. Five titles including Half-Life 2 incl. Episodes 1 and 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2 ensure that you won't be getting tired of this game anytime soon.I especially enjoyed Portal which is one of the trippiest games I've ever played, not to mention laugh out loud hilarious. It's a first person shooter/ puzzle type game that has you using a gun that throws out two portals (think of it as an in door and an out door that you can place on walls and/or ceilings) which you use to navigate the maze like levels. All the while you are being spoken to by a computerized voice that simultaneously guides you and threatens you. It's one of the most original experiences I've had playing a videogame and almost worth the price of admission alone. It's a bit on the short side but it does get some life extension with advanced levels once you beat the game's main storyline.The graphics are pretty nice across the board, especially on Team Fortress 2 which has this kind of cartoony look to it that gives the game a humorous touch to all the violence. Team Fortress 2 also has an online component that is everything you'd expect from a first person shooter except that it requires a bit more teamwork than other games because every character class is designed to achieve a certain function and in order to win in most cases, you've got to know what class to play with as well as what other players are playing with.The Half-Life games are impressive themselves as their use of surround sound makes the game an immersive experience coupled with really nice graphics. Make no mistake, this is a LOUD game when you start firing your weapons but it's in the moments where you might be standing on a beachfront and all you can hear is the wind blowing all around you and the  sound of the ocean and birds overhead that you really start to appreciate the subtlety of the sound design. This is the game that's probably the main attraction for most buyers and understandably so. It's one of those games that does a really good job of putting you into the world of the story and making you feel like you're really a part of what's going on in it.This is a great package and highly recommended as you don't really see this kind of deal too often.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2007"}

If you still think that XBox is the end all tell of video games, shame on you. Once more Capcom has put out a game of amazing beauty for the GameCube, once more they have given us a game containing better graphics than anything on XBox, and once more they manage to scare us half to death, and make us have a blast at the same time.This game is not without faults, however. I play this game on a 27\" GE TV. I guess because of the large screen (there are larger) I can see a lot more of the flaws that SOME, but not all of the game's cut scenes contain. Over all this game looks better than the RE-make released earlier this year, but there are some scenes that contain a jarring amount of aliasing (jaggies), which I firmly believe, could have been smoothed out better. On the other side of the coin there is not one hick up in the flow of the cinemas, where as the RE Make had occasional skipping in some parts of the game. I believe that neither flaw needs to exist, but neither the occasional jaggies, nor vinyl looking FMV sequences detract much from the enjoyability of RE 0 which is still a fantastic game.The control is still an issue. While I agree that the control style is clunky, I am so used to it these days that it doesn't matter to me. I'll take this control style over the mouse & keyboard dual analogue control style that has been rearing its ugly head a lot of late. I also enjoyed the character swapping; it was smooth, with no additional loading like I feared it would need. It ads a lot to the game play.I think that the ability to drop items anywhere is a double edge sword. On one hand its nice to be able to do that for an emergency when you need a really big gun and can't grab it because you have two herbs that are wasting space, or a brief case, or whatever... but I miss the item boxes where I could dump everything and be able to magically get it from another box further in the game. Having both would have been nice.Over all RE 0 is a worthy addition to the Resident Evil Saga, and a welcome one at that. I still wish that they would completely remake RE 2, 3 and Code Veronica while they're at it. So far these GameCube Resident Evils have been phenomenal... I am eager to get my hands on part 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2002"}

The tricky thing is...This is acctually a Prequal.  The game shows how this whole Zombie incident happened.  How the Stars Members met there fait and thus the nightmarish adventure of Chris and Jill.  In this though our hero's are Rebecka Chambers and Bill Coehn.  Both are likable just like Chris and Jill.  The game has a simple Plot which I won't get into but I must say this is a great game but also a huge disapointment.The games biggest aspect was the story!  Alot of people wanted a really good, decent god honest truth on how this alstarted.  Well it really doesn't expect that this was more of a side story then the real thing.  The game gives you somethings like who did all those things in the Mansion in RE1 and some other plots but ultimatley there is just so many plot holes in the game.  The game had an ok story but I wish you could have more simpathy for Rebecca and Billy, which you do, but they don't show as much emotion as what Jill and Chris go through.  The game does feel like a side story then a real pure prequal/sequal.  The game also features some good twists which keeps you playing on and on but not good enough!  The game features some RE1 characters like Weskers and Enrico and some more characters that didn't have enough spot light in RE1 or RE0 either!  I mean it's a prequal you're suppose to show things before what happend man!  Like I said before..there is too much things left out.  Now that I got that out of the way..The gameplay is pretty solid like the rest of RE games and this one is no different.  The game is pretty good just as good as the Remake and has some really cool creatures that are not seen in any other RE game.  The Crimzin heads are gone but that doesn't take away the feel or fright you get from this game.  The game scores big time on music and I really loved the music in this game, especially the parts were you're in the saving room.  The game has some really memorable music and is one of my favorites in anygame other then Zelda Oot.Other then Music and gameplay the visuals in this game are abosolutley incredible and amazing.  One of the most memerable parts in the RE series is the Train scenario in RE0 which is absolutley amazing.  The graphics and background of the train station is just sooooo realistic.  The visuals score big time and are just as good if not better then the visuals on the Remake.  The zombies look even more realistic in RE0 then in REmake.  Simply...The graphics in this game are awesome and one of the best in the gamecube.  The weapons look just as good as the characters and I must say the character models for both Rebecca and Billy look incredible.  The visuals in this game Get a * just...Awesome..The new Zapping system is really great too.  It's a great addition to the RE series.  You can switch between partners to do puzzles and switch ammo, Guns and medicene.  The Zap system is a really fun to but do no think your characters will always be together NO-HO this game will have you fighting for your life...ALONE...in some parts in the game and that's another thing that I loved about RE0 is that when the two main characters are back together you'll feel somewhat...safe..In the game.  It's truly a great edition in the game.OVERALLGood-Great gameplay and tons of exploring-The new zapping system is awesome-The games story will keep few on the verge of playing all night to say how it all ends...don't!-The game has amazing visuals and one of the best on the gamecube-Switching guns, ammo ect makes it tricky but fun.-lots and lots of Puzzles to solve once again..fun aint it?..Bad-More like a side story then the real thing-some will be dissapointed on how this game ends..overall I mean.-The game can get annoying with the switching and zapping..The ugly-The last boss.ehehehOverallResident Evil had the chance to reveal everything and be one of the best RE ever but it fails...badly!  It's a great game but a huge dissapointment at the same time.  The game has amazing visuals, great gameplay, lots and lots memerable moments, great music, lots of cool boss battles and nice Puzzles added to it.  Besides the whole Zapping system and everything I mention the game should have revealed more.....This seemed like a big side story then a REAL DEAL prequal/sequal...Overall this game is great and...of course..a disspointment and I give it a..4.3 out of 5 stars..Lates","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2004"}

If you ever owned a ps2, it will be hard for anyone to argue against the ps2 that since the beginning it has had the best games ever hands down. I played my old ps2 years ago for a long time untill it broke. :'( RIP. But now just recently I decided to go back to the good times and went and ordered myself a brand new newer version, the ps2 slim. Before I got it I read a little about it online and new that it was going to be small and lighter, but I had no idea how small it was till I first opened it, it was so amazing!It was so light and small compared to the old ps2 that it was like carrying a small sony dvd player. I thought the disc tray opened like it did for the old ps2 in the front, but the ps2 slim pops open a lid on top. And for noise the ps2 slim is so much quieter than the older modole expcially when it would get over heated and the fan was running like crazy. Though I know you can buy wireless ps2 controlers I prefer a wired one and I have enough room to play when I set the ps2 slim on my coffee table with the one controller it came with. If you are buying a new ps2 slim like i did, it DOES NOT COME WITH A PS2 MEMORY CARD so you will have to buy it separately.Reason why I bough a ps2 slim and sold my xbox 360 and ps3 is becasue I do not like how the consoles and games are set up now-a-days. Yes, when i had them at first the ps3 and xbox 360 were fun to play online but that was it. Most of the new games out there have little to no good story and can be beaten in hours, which the games are mainly made for just online game play. Plus there are so many menu selections on the xbox 360 and ps3 start-up main menu,  which is too much and you pretty much need to have an internet conection. The ps2 slim is simple and gets the job done right even better than the old ps2. I don't even need the internet connection for my ps2, who really did anyways? Get a friend or 2 more with the multitap and have more fun playing in the same room together.Like i said the ps2 has hundreds and hundreds of great titles and what is more fun then re-collectioning all the classic titles, bring back great memories and going through all the great storys all over again. I only have a few cons about the ps2 slim. It is so light that when you want to turn it on you have to hold the ps2 slim in place becasue you will just end up pushing it around. The power button and open button are smaller compared to the old ps2, one thing good about this though is that you do not accidently open the tray or restart the ps2 like I remember doing a few times on the old ps2 before I was able to save, *Noooo!!!*. But the bad part about the small buttons is it is not as easy to open or power on when you accually want too.Then there is one problem I was stunnded that sony did not catch or see that this would be a problem. Sine the tray pops open on top it is very thin and when a disc is running if there is any pressure on top of the disc lid like you pressing your fingers down on it or something sitting on top or falling on it, the disc will stop running and the screen will say for you to \"restart your disc\", but in a few seconds if you fix the problem it will start up playing again. Also when I move my ps2 slim from room to room to differnt tvs in my house and doing this alot scratches the top easily but it is not much of a big deal.If you are thinking about getting a ps2 slim, get it! To either relive the past or even replace your old ps2 which they fixed the bugs that were found in it so the ps2 slim will not have them. So do what I did and got a ps2 slim, you will not regret it. Well, what are you waiting for?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

The point is that this is not Fallout 4.  This is not a big improvement, an evolution or a technical upgrade from Fallout 3, it's the same game in a new setting.

The story is ok...it's not grabbing you and pulling you in, it's an excuse to explore the locations in the game. They are heavily detailed, and clearly a lot of time was put into the creation of this new world.

Featuring 30 hours of battery life off 4 AA batteries (included) and a unique power saver mode with audible alarm, the Wireless Sensor Bar is designed for ultimate convenience.","reviewerName":"Rorke Haining","summary":"Read this review to know if you need this product","reviewText":"The Wii requires a \"sensor bar\" above or below your TV screen, so it can tell where on the screen you're pointing your remote controller.  The Wii comes with a wired sensor bar that will work great for most homes.  Don't buy an extra wireless sensor bar unless you actually need it.To help you decide, it's really useful to understand how this device works.  The name \"wireless sensor bar\" is actually quite misleading in 2 specific ways.I at first assumed the \"sensor bar\" was communicating with the Wii console -- that a wired sensor bar sends communications over the wire, and that a wireless sensor bar sends information wirelessly to the console.  After all, it's a sensor bar, so it must be sensing something and communicating that information, right?Wrong.  In fact, the sensor bar is nothing more than a fancy flashlight.  All it does is turn on some infrared lights with specific spacing and orientation.  In fact, it's your Wii remote controller that senses the infrared lights and transmits this information wirelessly to your console, which can then calculate where you are pointing the remote and display a little icon on the screen.So, misconception #1:  the \"sensor bar\" doesn't sense anything, it's just a little flashlight.  Misconception #2, the word \"wireless\" often means \"wireless communication\", but in this case, the \"sensor bar\" is just a dumb device that can't communicate in any way, so the wire is just for power.So you have 2 options:* Use the fancy flashlight that you've already purchased, as it came bundled with your Wii, which is powered by a wire connected to your Wii.* Buy a second fancy flashlight powered by a battery.OK, with those misconceptions out of the way, you can make a much better choice about whether or not wireless is right for you.  For example, don't fret about wireless network interference -- this device doesn't cause any.  Likewise, don't worry about having a hard time setting up the \"wireless sensor bar\" with your Wii -- it doesn't require pairing or any extra configuration at all, it's just a flashlight.Personally, I normally groove on everything wireless.  I adore my Mac wireless mouse.  I use only wireless peripherals for all my computers.  I have a wireless home network.  But in this case, I definitely prefer the bundled, wired \"sensor bar\".  I have too many devices that need batteries as it is, but I was mostly bothered by the 2nd on/off switch.Let me explain that last comment.  You can turn on and off your Wii system with a single, remote controlled button click, just like a TV remote control.  Grab any game controller (which of course is wireless and remote) and click the power button from any seat in the room, and the system powers itself on -- plus, that game controller is now designated controller #1.  Hold the power button on the remote for several seconds and the system turns itself off -- and all the game controllers you were using are smart enough to power themselves off as well.  Sweet!  I vastly prefer this over the GameCube, which had to be powered on/off by pushing a button on the console itself.Unfortunately, the \"wireless sensor bar\" breaks this elegance.  Every time I wanted to play the Wii, I'd sit down, grab the nearest remote, click the power button -- and it would fail to work properly because the wireless sensor bar wasn't turned on.  Nor was it able to turn itself on wirelessly, it's just a flashlight, it can't receive wireless commands in any way.  So I'd get up, walk to this device, turn it on, and then be able to play.  Turning off, same thing -- now I have to turn off 2 items instead of 1.  Worse still, the 2nd on/off switch on the \"wireless sensor bar\" is near the TV, so you have to physically get up and walk around the coffee table, etc. etc., or just leave the flashlight on and have your batteries run down.Yes, it's a minor complaint.  But given that you've already paid for a \"sensor bar\" that works great, why pay extra for one that doesn't work as well?There are undoubtedly good reasons to get this device in specific circumstances.  If your screen is huge or unusually far away, or if you have a cabling nightmare behind your entertainment center and loathe the thought of adding one more unnecessary wire, you may need or prefer this device over the one that comes with your Wii.  I'll defer to other reviewers who can explain what circumstances make this device useful.  But for a typical living room setup, with a normal sized TV 5-15 feet away, the wired sensor bar that comes with the Wii works great.And P.S.:  ditch the coffee table, you'll enjoy your Wii more without it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to theChinatown Warsas well as the greaterGrand Theft Autocommunities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments. The DS' Wi-Fi capabilities also gives players the opportunity to take their game online as they battle for supremacy in their own little corner of Liberty City in both head-to-head and co-op multiplayer battles.","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"The most technically impressive game I've seen on the DS yet.","reviewText":"Chinatown Wars somehow manages to push the technology in the DS more than anything I've seen.  On top of that, the developer has managed to make one of the largest and most in depth games on the system as well.  I won't go so far as to say this is the best game on the DS, but I am nothing short of impressed.  This game isn't some attempt to make a quick buck... the developers went out of their way to do a great job.GRAPHICS: Fully 3-d environment with an amazing amount of detail all presented in cell shaded style.  You can even read many of the billboards and signs on the buildings even though the game is presented in a top-down perspective.  There is so much detail in the graphics I am constantly discovering new things every time I boot the game up.  My only major complaint about the graphics is that I think story-board presentation is flat, lifeless, and kind of ugly.SOUND: Sadly this game doesn't have the quality of sound that the big console versions have.  The funny, wacky radio stations with hours of dialogue are gone, but that isn't surprising since this is a DS game.  The sound that the game gives us is still pretty good though and above average for most DS games.CONTROLS: Probably the weakest part of this game, the controls are still very solid.  Driving a vehicle with the d-pad on the DS can cause a lot of fatigue, but that's more a problem with the DS than the controls themselves.  While running around on foot the camera sometimes gets positioned at a bad angle and requires re-centering constantly.  A moderate annoyance, honestly.  More annoying is the fact that I have trouble finding the \"sweet spot\" where you can hijack a vehicle, which sometimes results in me slowly walking around the vehicle pressing the button until my character climbs in.  Combat controls are pretty solid and the lock-on feature works very nicely.  In fact, the lock-on is almost a little to easy to use.  Selecting weapons and throwing weapons is kind of clunky and requires use of the stylus, but it still works.STORY: This is a standard Grand Theft Auto crime story with a lot of contrived elements.  You are a member of the Triad aspiring to avenge your father's death and uphold the family honor.  Entertaining and often humorous at times, but nothing amazing.GAMEPLAY: Lots of stuff to do in a huge city with three major islands.  The DS game has almost the level of depth of the preceding console versions.>> In addition to standard GTA style missions (travel here, do something, come back to hideout), the game offers many other distractions: scratch lotto cards, drug dealing, ambulance rescue, security camera destruction, insane jumps, buying property, and so on and so on.  The amount of stuff to do is almost overwhelming if you are a completionist.>> The game has a very enjoyable and solid driving and physics engine which emphasizes wild arcade driving action.>> Taxi system for those times when you don't want to actually take the time to drive to a location.  Helps eliminate some of the repetition you would otherwise experience in the game.>> Clever and intelligent use of the stylus for hot wiring cars, making Molotov cocktails, etc.>> Police chases are really fun and focus less on escape and instead emphasize disabling the police cruisers, a welcome change in the GTA formula.  Very fun.>> A mission replay feature is available in Chinatown wars.  I love this because in previous GTA games it wasn't possible to replay my favorite missions over after completing them.  It is a great feature that should have been in the previous games from day one.REPLAY VALUE: Game length is pretty hefty for a DS title.  Based on my current percentage of completion I expect about 12 to 16 hours of gameplay, but that is only if I were to plow straight through the missions and ignore all of the interesting stuff to do off the beaten path.  To get 100% completion I expect at I'll have to pour in at least 25 hours of gameplay, possibly much more... I can't really tell.  Multiplayer is present in this game with couple of modes, but I haven't tried any of them out yet.All in all, GTA: Chinatown Wars is one of the most full-featured games to be released on the DS.  I'd prefer to give the game only 4.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn't allow half-stars I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and round up to a rare 5-star rating.  I highly recommend this mature-themed title to every fan of the GTA series or to anyone looking for a quality crime-themed action title.[NOTE: Be aware that my first copy of this game was defective, but the retailer was gracious enough to provide a working replacement free of charge and without any hassle.  I hope that my original faulty copy was the exception and not the rule.]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

One helluva story revolving around intrigue--incredibly written.  Unique battle action emphasizing timing and weapon management.DEPTH. . . This word doesn't properly describe it.  This game, if you attempt to fully understand all of the management options, is almost overwhelming.  Monster type and element affinities for each individual weapon is a start to this depth.  Then the variety of weapons (anything from crossbows to swords to axes to sledge-hammers), each attuned to further damaging a few different types of enemies comes next.  Not only must you micromanage with a magnifying glass, but you must also power up a certain type of weapon for each of the six classes of monsters (can usually get away with one weapon per two classes).  This adds a strategic element to a game based in action.If you need a thinking game that doesn't fail to please, give Vagrant Story a try.

{"product_name":"B001C58T46","reviewerName":"C. Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Fun for casual and hard-core gamer.","reviewText":"My wife and I played this with our 5 year old son.  It's easy enough for him to get through most levels to move the story along which is why it's fun for the casual gamer.  You don't easily die or lose.  There are usually 5 or so additional goals to beat if you really want more of a challenge (ie: collect over x number of gold, finish with more than 2 minutes left, make it through the level without getting wet, don't take any damage, etc etc) along with 3 special treasures to find in each level.  Plenty of replay opportunities and difficult tasks for the hard core check-lister type player.My 5 year old enjoyed it more than my wife and I.  We enjoyed the comic style, hand drawn art, and puzzle/level design.  Some of the wii remote gimmicks were excellent (ie: controlling your rocket ship thrusters or Subwarine with the wii remote).  Wario is not a lovable character / hero nor is the story much (not that we expected a lot).  I was ready to be finished with it by the halfway point, but we continued through the end for my son's sake.  Luckily it wasn't too long to complete since we weren't trying to finish all the goals...it's great that the designers created it for casual and hard core gamers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004RMK5QG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A Subscription Service With Plenty of PLUS...","reviewText":"Playstation Plus is a paid service that is OPTIONAL for users of the Playstation Network. The service provides users with discounts, free games, online storage and much more that I will outline below. The offered digital Playstation Plus subscription code is a safe alternative for users who do not Own, or wish to give their credit card to Sony, or use Playstation Network Cash cards.COSTThere are currently two models of subscription; 3mo @ $17.99 or ~$6.00/mo and 12mo @ $49.99 or ~4.17/mo. Obviously the best deal is the 12mo offer. **This card gives you a 12mo subscription**ADVANTAGES- Every month the Playstation Store will have featured products available for Playstation Plus users. This often amounts to at least one free \"featured\" game offered per month, as well as various other free titles.- Playstation plus holders will also receive special discounts on select items, which changes every month. The price reduction can be anywhere from 10% to 75% off an item or package deal.- Exclusive features! Automatic Download service to keep all your games up-to-date without physically having to launch the title. 150MB of online data storage for your save game files or data files (You can even back up copy-restricted saves)- FULL GAME TRIALS. That is right folks. On the boarder about that new title that just came out. Playstation Plus members get a \"full game trial\". It acts as if you physically bought the game and allows you 1 full hour of game play before disabling itself.- Early access! As a Plus member you will receive early access to game demos and be given priority when it comes to specific Beta invite handouts, Plus members are first to get access.- Free Plus themes and avatars. Not exactly amazing but who doesn't love free stuff!DISADVANTAGES- As a playstation plus member you have access and perks from all the above. HOWEVER if you do not renew your subscription things can get a little complicated.*** Any content received that was *FREE* will become \"disabled\" upon expiration of your PLUS subscription (Excluding: Avatars and Themes)**Note: Any Item you had to physically pay for, even if it had a special PLUS discount of 99% will not be disabled upon expiration of your subscriptionSo what it amounts to mostly is that the GAMES you get for FREE are essentially long term rentals so long as you keep PS+ ... While Free avatars, Free themes, and items purchased at a discount will always be yours.OVERALLThe playstation plus plan is not for everyone. However it is a plan that rewards its subscribers with plenty of perks and loads of content each month. If you think about it, at $4-$6/mo and a free $10-$15 game each month in theory the subscription pays for itself each month, not even factoring in all the other perks like the free full game demos. At just $4.17/mo you are getting quite a great price for a PLUS subscription; one that could easily pay for itself in just a few months.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2011"}

Nintendo really had dominated at the beginning with the continued success of the NES and the start of what became the Super Nintendo. As for Sega, they had much more out there that seemed to dominate at the beginning with the success of the Sega Genesis, and the portable Game Gear system. But at the midway point of the decade, their systems were losing appeal from overexposure, which cause them to lose sales for the Genesis, Saturn and Dreamcast systems, and gamers were going to Sony and staying at Nintendo for their gaming needs. Now, Sega's glory days are returning to the Playstation 3.Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection is really something that delivers well for nostaligic fans of the classic Sega Genesis era of the 90's. The game compilation contains over 40 classic Sega games that have been the constants of the Sega Genesis library, and what made Sega so dominant to hard cpore fans today. The game have all been remastered beautifully from top to bottom, and redesigned to give it a new introduction in High Defiinition. The compilation includes a lot of classic games including the original Sonic The Hedgehog, and its sequels 2, 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, as well as other great Sega titles like Columns, the addictive puzzler that was Sega's answer to the addictive Tetris, the epic Golden Axe, the innovative Vectorman, and many other greats. The control is just as simple to pick up as it was made years earlier, and the gameplay is just as exciting as has been years ealier. Sadly though, I do feel a bit upset though that there could've upset that there could've been some overlooked greats here like the innovative 3-D Virtua Racing here, as well as Earthworm Jim to just name a few.All in all for what it is worth Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Playstation 3 works very well for Sega as a strong and innovative reintroduction to what Sega had made special for video game fanatics young and old back in the 90's. While it is sad that Sega will never be able to duplicate those days with making new systems, they still are showing they still have the stuff with what their classics are absolutely made of. If you have never owned a Genesis system, or are just looking for something completely different, than I absolutely recommend this as a must buy for PS3 owners.Graphics: BSound: B+Price: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}

The characters you can play with are very numerous a nice selection to choose from and as you win money during battles you can upgrade your characters equipment or get more powerful weapons to help you out during the next time you have to fight. The online extras are very good as well and as far as I've played against another person there isn't any lag time to worry about at all there's not stuttering or slowing during fight rounds an the like.

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Davidovich53","summary":"Gets old real fast, and combat is problematic","reviewText":"I usually don't like platformers, but I took a chance on this game after IGN raved about it.  The result is a mixed bag: the platforming action is enjoyable, but I find the combat engine to be unresponsive and annoying.The heart of the Prince of Persia series - going back to the franchise's side-scrolling days - has always been an agile, acrobatic hero as opposed to a muscle-bound brute.  The newest iteration stays true to that formula, and the hero, who isn't really a \"prince\" at all but a Han Solo type rogue, has all the moves from the Sands of Time trilogy and more, and it's really cool to pretend that I'm the one doing the wall runs, ceiling runs, and rebound jumps to scale impossible heights.One IGN reviewer complained that the hero's abrasive personality really annoyed him, but I found the opposite to be true.  While the hero is a selfish mercenary-type who helps Elika only because he's forced to, his witty back-and-forth banter with her is entertaining and serves as a nice diversion from the usual platforming - \"Run, jump die, repeat, run, jump, die, repeat.  I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.\"  It's a good thing that Elika has the intelligence, wit, and (sometimes) sarcasm to go toe-to-toe with the hero and hold her own; this is a credit to the scriptwriters.Elika is a wonderful AI character.  She is the first AI partner I've had in a game whom I don't have to constantly babysit (yes, I'm looking at you, Fallout 3!  And you, Saints Row 2!).  In the platforming segments, she can perform every action you can, so there's never a worry that she'll fall behind (I'm looking at you, Silent Hill 4!).  She never bumps into you or obstructs your path.  I also thank Ubisoft for Elika's \"compass power\" which shows me how I can reach my next destination (unlike in The Sands of Time, where I once searched for my next jump for over 2 hours - no joke).The fact that Elika saves the hero whenever he's about to die has brought some criticism from players, but I say this is a good thing; when you die in a game, you simply load the most recent save file and try again, right?  So having Elika rescue you saves time and makes the gameplay smoother.  But to encourage players to not be too reckless, Ubisoft has included an Achievement which is unlocked if Elika saves you less than 100 times in a single play-through.So if I like this game so much, why did I give it only 3 stars?  One reason is that it gets real repetitive real fast (again, it's \"Run, jump die, repeat, run, jump, die, repeat\").  The other big reason is the combat system.  If Ubisoft was going to give me only four enemy types in the whole game, they could have at least varied up the enemies from one encounter to the next.  For example, fighting the Concubine feels exactly the same whether I'm fighting her for the first time or the fourth time.  She employs the same tactics, same patterns, same everything, so I too have to do the same things over and over (since there is only one type of attack that damages her).The timing of hitting buttons during combat also proved problematic: I hold Right Trigger to block, then release, then hit X to attack, but nothing happens on the first press.  So I lose a fraction of a second there, which is just long enough for the enemy to hit me.  This happens time and time again!  Enemies also have the uncanny ability to interrupt my combos, but I can't interrupt theirs.  Whenever I'm on the offensive, pushing the enemy back, he will somehow miraculously interrupt my combo and instantly turn the tables.  This feels so unbelievably cheap and frustrating that I have to keep from throwing my controller into the wall.So the end result?  Only a \"meh\" rather than a \"wow.\"  If the monotony of the platforming segments were broken up with more variety, and if the combat system had been tightened up, we could have had a real winner here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2009"}

The movies put such a bad taste in my mouth, I never bothered to even try one of the beloved games. What a mistake! After 18 hours and 33 minutes of playtime with the newest Pokemon, I can see why these games have been enduring hits for 15 years.The game is cater-made for handheld devices. You can play for a few minutes and make quite a bit of progress, but that doesn't make it any easier to quit playing after a few hours. This game has made waiting rooms, subway rides and all other forms of tedium an absolute pleasure! At my dental checkup, I actually found myself irritated when my name was called. I was in the middle of a battle and I didn't want to turn the game off. Being disappointed when your name is finally called to see the doctor is a first, and a testament to just how great these games really are -- At least if Pokemon Black and White are any indication.I've read that Pokemon Black and White are perfect entry points to the series. This is very true. I'm having an easy time picking up and playing the games and am having no trouble understanding the appeal. With great online support (when it's working -- which, disappointingly, it often isn't), a slew of features and endless gameplay opportunities, it's hard to imagine that this isn't the most feature-packed Pokemon yet.Needless to say, I am now a Pok&eacute;fan! I still doubt I'd find anything fun about those animated movies that had kids lining up long ago, but I've learned a lesson: Don't judge a game by its film adaptation. I don't want to even think about the years of great Pokemon gameplay I passed up simply because I didn't like the movie tie-ins. The games are simple enough for a child to pick up and play but deep and complex enough to addict their parents.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

The game is based on missions usually revolve around collecting items as you go across maps killing mutants and making a choice over if you should harvest `Adam' from little zombie girls or not. If you don't you get a positive ending. If you do, you get a negative game ending.The real star of this game is the underwater city. It looks like the cities in Star Wars episode II but underwater with a 1920's feel. The city has been created by Fontaine, who installed genetic gene banks and dispensers to allow the citizens to perk themselves up, only the citizens hacked the machines, overdosed on Adam and turned themselves into killing freaks. They run around the place barking mad and you must kill them with a choice of either using special powers, a wrench, pistol, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, flame thrower or crossbow. You can take pictures of the enemy to learn more about them and inflict more damage. You collect money to buy upgrades to your body and guns.All in all Bioshock is worth playing on a Directx 10 machine for the full effect. Most of it is standard run around and kill everything on the screen without thinking too much and the story is worth following as you listen to tape recorders reveal what is happening to you. Although it takes awhile to break into the swing of things the game is worth sticking with and genuinely becomes a little addictive like the mutagen `Adam'. At the same time as having some of the best graphics for any FPS game available it does get a little clich&eacute;d and doesn't really do anything new or anything you haven't seen before. Granted the AI is not bad but sometimes security can get a little boring to deal with, especially the 50 second alarm attacks. There isn't a whole lot to complain about and when this game gets fun, it really does take off.

I didn't notice.","reviewText":"Minigame collections are, admittedly, wearing out their welcome. Seriously. It was annoying to see party games fly out into shelves for people to go out and buy those, thinking they would be as good as promised. While there are exceptions, the minigame genre is fading away quickly. BUT, you know what makes Wario Ware so special? It's unlike anything else out there (Until Spongebob Squigglepants came and went).Wario Ware, Inc. consists of several stages in which you play some of the most bizarre and shortest minigames in the world that fit with a certain genre that each stage contains. For example, there are minigames based off of Nature, Reality (Term used loosely?), Strange, Science Fiction, etc. My favorite stage is >SPOILER ALERT&lt; the one with Nintendo-themed minigames, in which they would be based off of classic games like Super Mario Bros, F-Zero, Dr. Mario, and arcade game Donkey Kong.Each minigame would last only a few seconds (Except for Boss minigames, which aren't timed), and they would show a one-word command (Catch!, Collect!, Stomp!, Get it!, Smash!, to name a few). You use the D-Pad and/or the A and B buttons to figure out how to succeed in the minigame. The result is pretty addictive and fun (Although it could be a bit frustrating at first), especially since there are hundreds more where these minigames came from.After beating all of the stages, you may think that that's all the game has to offer, but NOPE! It turns out that there are bonus games rewarded to you if you either beat all the stages and/or go on to beat all the individual minigames! Ah, Nintendo....you are always so generous to your fans.Some bonus games are remakes of Nintendo's classics, like FULL VERSIONS of Dr. Mario (Despite it being Dr. Wario here) and late 70s arcade game Sheriff! Other addicting unlockables are Pyoro, Pyoro 2, Paper Airplane, and some Vs minigames that have you and your friend play against each other by holding both sides of the Game Boy Advance!Overall, even if the bonus content were absent, this would still be one heck of a game collection!

Now, I'm a huge RPG gamer and rarely buy games outside of that genre so I hold a pretty high bar for others and was not let down at all by this game.Cautionary warning for those less informed (likely the reason they post warnings on hair dryers not to drop them in bathtubs / Darwin Awards) this game is not for children at all. There are drugs, questionable language moments, and generally obscene behavior all around. It's wonderful. :)Enter Niko Bellic, an Eastern European thug fresh off the boat with an idealistic view of Liberty City. He quickly learns that life is not all its cracked up to be and slips back into the same mistakes he had made in the past and was trying to run away from. In general the game does glorify violence, materialism, and thug life but it also carries a strong message of defiance to them as well as you see as you progress through the story. You see love, betrayal, and the truth about the so-called wonderful life of organized crime. It's not as mindless as some in the media may try to portray as they review the game on a merely superficial level.Pros:1. The game loads very fast and there are very few loading screens beyond your initial loading of the game.2. The difficulty is pretty well developed such that as the game progresses you find you have to plan out your actions more thoroughly to adjust to increased dangers.3. It's fun to run around in the city and cause chaos even if you're ignoring the main mission.4. Unlike Assassin's Creed (for example) the missions are all unique and each has exciting twists which help keep you on the edge of your seat.5. The graphics and sound are amazing.6. The in-game material such as the comedy show and television shows help make this world seem even more realistic --- I had a friend who spent a Saturday just watching the in-game TV even.7. The multiplayer modes are fun when you get into them... (more on the cons though).Cons:1. The multiplayer lounge system is horrid --- the loading times to get to multiplayer are bad enough but sometimes you find yourself stuck waiting after a match is over and just generally it seems like a rushed addition to a perfect game.2. The party mode loads you up in a fake world but it's a pain to invite people and a better interface similar to Halo's for partying would have been better (if you wanted to visit the world with your party why not just go into free play mode?).In general the game is amazing and is worth the little it costs for such an experience. It's not a game for children and that's why it's rated mature so if you buy it for your child it's your own fault for not paying attention to the rating applied to the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2008"}

The DLC has been good so far but in the end it will be an extra $60 of stuff that should've been in it from the beginning. The only thing that's not good here is the off-balanced knifing and the characters.Multiplayer:Horrible community consisting mostly of aim bots and boosters, The weapons aren't that interesting, The maps have much less variety (not a single snow map, you have to get the DLC to get \"one\" snow map which is tiny) And most of the time, I get plauged with \"error connecting to server\" or \"switching host\" every several minutes, this cuts away from play time more than you could possibly imagine.WORST PART OF THIS GAME:The knifing. I don't know how they managed to mess it up this bad but the knifing mechanics are horrible! There is a 1/10 chance that a knife kill will actually kill. Back in Black Ops and every Modern Warfare game, the knifes actually kill when timed out. In this game, it looks like all that timing and skill went out the window and you now have to rely only on luck to get it, but there will usually be a person with a silenced shotgun killing you before you can knife them (in Black Ops 1, a well timed knife attack would kill a shotgun wielder when that close) and for some reason, you notice in every single killcam that the person getting knifed was way off screen when they died from the knife, but the person right in range of the knife never gets hurt.All in all, Treyarch did a pretty good job with this game but they need to stop counting the money for a second and fix the many glitches and errors that infest this game.Nuketown 2025 - The worst gimmick, don't expect to survive 5 seconds in this junky map.

Argh!)That being said, my grievances with GTA IV were all fixed in EPISODES FROM LIBERTY CITY.  The driving mechanics, especially the motorcycles, have been smoothed out.  Driving in the game has now actually become fun, and it is now easier to handle a motorcycle than a car.  Also, when you get killed on a mission, the game will take you back to the start of the action.  These two changes alone radically change the gaming experience and make EPISODES one of the most fun video games I've ever played.

First off, lemme just say that I haven't gotten into the Single Player mode. If you want to know about that, read other reviews. Plus, this is the first COD game I ever actually played, so I'm not sure how accurate this review may be for you if you are one to be a COD fan.Anyway, I had always known that COD: Modern Warfare 3 was one of the most overrated things ever, but I never actually known that to the fullest extent, because, of course, I hadn't played it. So yesterday, the Multiplayer happened to be available on Steam for free (At the time of the this writing, it still is for 3 more hours). Taking a risk, I downloaded it. It was a long download time, so I had to wait until today. And then I played the game...The game was a freaking mess.While the graphics were pretty good, they just aren't really full of life, and they are talked about too much as being \"the best/most realistic graphics ever\".As for the sound department....All you'll hear are gun sounds. No enemy footsteps. I desperately tried to find enemies around. There was a radar at the top-left corner of the screen, so I thought I'd use that for my advantage. BOY was I wrong. My opponents somehow pop up out of nowhere without appearing on the radar! I was killed before I realized it. Every. Single. Time. You die way too easily in this, unless you're an obsessed professional.And on top of that, chances are you will encounter players that love to talk trash for some reason. The first time I played, there was some random guy insulting me repeatedly. Fortunately, not all servers are like that, but since you can't pick the servers you go into, you'll never know if you'll end up playing with trolls or not. I know this isn't the game's fault, but it's no less moronic and distracting, especially when the insults are aimed directly at you.Overall, you are so much better off not buying this crap. I got it (at least the Multiplayer) for FREE, and I say it sucks. And since you guys are usually stuck with the option of buying it.......You're just flat-out screwed.

Simple you choose the best, and rent the others. Many great titles are coming out following the release of this, one must pinch a penny to get to them all. Dead Space delivers, and is a very gruesome, dark, and nerve wracking struggle for survival.To begin with the game has a strong resemblance to 2005's Resident Evil 4 for the Game Cube. With the over the shoulder view and implemented horror, one can easily draw comparisons. The gameplay though is very tight, close quarter confrontations. With many scares from a myriad of things. Once you feel you have the nerves of steel, a new scare awaits you.Although taking the right cues from RE4, the game also features many new elements. The weapons are essentially tools, as Issac Clarke (the character the player takes on) is an engineer. Arriving with a crew to check up on a minor issue upon a mining ship they notice many oddities, and may trouble pursue. Stasis is another great feature. One has the ability to improvise the use of it, and can slow down objects. From doors, to enemies, to parts located on the ship stasis is essential. Even  more essential is the need for air, some areas have no steady air flow, one must resort to using limited quantities of air. Traditional HUD elements are thrown out, in replace of a more cinematic approach. Replacing the normal HUD in favor of featuring on Issac's suit. Ammo can be kept in check when pulling out a weapon. Lastly is the 'zero gravity' portions, sleek effects from floating debris to cool ways to render the enemy limbless, one will take a liking to this.The controls feel odd at first, but are great after getting use to them. The left bumper (LB) serves as the run option. Little weird at first, but now it feels second nature, same with reloading. 'X' serves as health, many times I found my self replenishing my health thinking I was reloading! The graphics are great, the sound has a eerily atmospheric knowing when to strike dynamic range. The enemies are violent, and grizzly looking. The gore is over the top, limbs splitting off left and right. The scares are good and all over the place, from feigning deaths to popping out of vents, time well worth spent.Now to answer the question, is it worth a purchase? The game can be completed in 12 hours or under with difficulty levels as variables. A player opting a second run through has a few options, but a rental seems more worthwhile (money wise). The game is phenomenal, exactly what many of us have been looking for, even with such a positive view on the game, I feel it should be rented. The game offers no real multiplayer modes, and the DLC is okay. A purchase is justifiable due to the amazement that lurks within the game, but after completion their is not too much to do.If you enjoy it enough after a rental purchase it, I don't speak for everyone though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

I'm sorry to say it was a huge disappointment.  I just found it all to be too slow paced and so nit pickingly complicated that I didn't even want to try and finish playing it.  I guess I just like games to be more straightforward and fast paced.  I have played both Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 which are RPGs and enjoyed them but Fallout just has so many variables that you have to constantly take into account with every single action that you take.  It required too much time and effort.  I play video games for fun and to relax and Fallout wasn't fun or relaxing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2011"}

It hits everything I need it to. Or at least it should.There are two major problems with Forza 3 and one minor one. The first being of course at least for me, is the Invalidation of your times around a race track. I never thought I would say this but I miss the overly harsh and nonsensical penalties of Forza and Forza 2. (Your lap time is already borked, if you get in a situation where you got a penalty anyway, or at least wouldn't be as fast of a lap, so penalties are stupid anyway)This time around? Oh no. They went and one upped the shenanigans now, if you get a little bit off track (and I mean just part of one tire in many cases), your lap time is completely invalidated and won't show up AT ALL on Leaderboards. Oh and the same applies for your race time too. That alone would cause a major issue to me. But it doesn't stop there. No sir. Of course if you hit someone (or they hit you for no reason) you get an invalidated time. Okay fine. It continues though, if you DRAFT SOMEONE yes, Drafting you know that thing that is pretty much ESSENTIAL to winning races, and often posting a hot lap in real life racing it invalidates your time. Colossal screw up Turn 10. Epic failure. Oh but it gets better! How you might ask? If someone Drafts you, your time is invalidated. If you use the new rewind feature to fix an other wise good lap? Invalidated. That one I can at least stomach. and that's the only one.This alone detracted a full star for me and 2 points on my gamer scale. Especially since something quintessential to racing (lap times) are now screwed out.\"But that appeals to the hardcore!\" Actually it doesn't, especially since there are some tracks where it is practically impossible to keep within the boundaries of a track while racing without incurring an invalidation either from wrecking someone or going off track. Also, it makes your Granny Lap often your best lap of the race because it only registers your \"screw up free\" lap. They better fix this in a patch, but it should have never been a problem in the first place.The next major screw up of this game is what they did to the Multiplayer. This is atrocious. Utterly atrocious and there is no excuse for this at all ever. Matchmaking in my opinion is one of the dumbest things to ever hit gaming, the only time it is \"passable\" is in Shooters but guess what? It's not passable there because of the tendency of it to give you the same maps every time you go to a new match. In a racing game? This is even worse. You only get to race in whatever class happens to be available online at the time. Effectively meaning, those really cool cars you have? Yeah, you might not get to race with them at all. No instead you might get the shaft and get stuck racing your **** of ****** Chevrolet Aveo. Yeah, imagine that happening all night. When in your garage is sitting your Realistically flame jobbed Corvette ZO6. And you don't get to pick the tracks you race on... so you remember my mentioning of a few horrible tracks that you virtually can't pass on, and stay within the Valid lap area? Imagine getting stuck on that all night too. You've got a You are In Gamer Hell scenario just exploding all over you there.Forza 1, with it's online component turned things on it's head and did it perfectly. You got to pick your car, pick your track and have a blast racing against other people and their cool cars. Forza 2 carried on with this because frankly it was right, and it wasn't perfect but it was damn close.  Forza 3? Took this feature (which is easily the Forza series best feature) shot it in the face and peed on the corpse, and left it with a parody of multiplayer.And now we come to the not as major screw up in the game. Car Accuracy. For alot of cars and I do mean alot of cars. They hit it spot on. For others? (namely three that I have found so far, and I've owned all in real life, and know the technical data of them by heart down to the spark plug gaps) they dropped the ball.  The 1990 Iroc Camaro, 2002 Camaro, and Trans Am. The first one they screwed up the Weight. By about 200 pounds. The Camaro 2002 SS weighs in at 3200lbs and some pocket change. What does Forza 3 think? 3500. Same with the Birdy, of that same year. But they one upped it with the Bird. The Bird is the WS6 version, meaning it should be packing 345 horse power, and weighs the same as the Camaro SS. It also has slightly better brakes. Forza 3 short it 25 horse power, and the better brakes along with the weight. Now the Iroc. The first screw up they did was again vehicle weight. Fully loaded with T-tops a Gen III camaro tips the scales at 3498 pounds. They say? 3600 and some change. A stripper car, like the one in the game tips in at 3234 or something like that. They also screwed up the torque curve. A Gen III with TPI injection, hits hardest at 2000 RPM on the torque, horse power following soon after and falls dead at anything past 5500. It's a rather unique looking powercurve which they messed up on.Also, please Turn 10 do note, the Chevrolet Aveo and it's ilk are not cars people willingly race. Just like we don't want to do crap license tests we don't want to drive cars that would probably sooner fall apart than hit 100 mph.That being all said. The Single Player is amazing. Pure amazing. The physics engine is easily the best in any racing game I've played, the opponent AI doesn't seem totally slaved to the racing line anymore. The new experience point system works better than the money system and the achievement progress is steady. The races are for the most part entertaining enough to keep you racing for a while. (Which is a very good thing given the multiplayer and lap time Shenanigans) The car painter is at least just as robust as it used to be, and they even added a feature. I don't know how it works yet but I will figure it out sooner or later. It's a new painter tool. Which will require more time to figure it out. Don't change this in a Forza 4.Cars are NOT LOCKED based off of level anymore. Thank God. Instead of course they locked cars based on which version of the game you bought and if you have xbox live or not (insert roll eyes here). But at least the locked car total is alot lower than it used to be.The Season system is genius and it actually feels pretty organic. I'd like to see it in a Forza 4.The in car view while it needs more polish (set too low in some cars. namely some of the cars which have accuracy issues...... making me wonder if they actually did anything with those cars in the first place) is a very nice thing to have. I bounce between it and the hood cam. (the hood cam just looks better. making me wonder if the incar view was something from beta they didn't update in time)There is one thing they did right in multiplayer and that's the Storefront feature and the Groups feature. Basically if you are a car painter or tuner you can sell set ups, and paint jobs through Live now and earn credits. Genius, and I like the feature.As long as you are playing Single Player and perhaps split screen this game is amazingly good. Just stay away from the racing aspect of multiplayer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}

It's made even worse this time because those sections are in first person.  Ugh.  Other than that, it is a stellar game with tons of things to do.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"terpfan1980 \"Barry\"","summary":"This game is just so much fun","reviewText":"This game is just so much fun I find myself ignoring other games that I really thought I'd have been engrossed in.  (Though in the case of one or two of those games, it might be for the best, as I wait out the time that is needed for the developers to do some patching and troubleshooting for those games -- I'm looking in your general direction Battlefield 4)Let me back up just a little bit and note a couple of things.  First, I've been playing this game on the Easy level, as I appreciate being able to play through without finding myself incredibly frustrated at repetitively being killed and restarting back at whatever the last checkpoint was.  I play games to have fun, not raise my blood pressure while seemingly trying to complete an impossible task that will inevitably take me dozens of tries. I tend to play through games like this on Easy mode/level and then after I've learned how to play, well, I can go back and play again on the higher difficulty level and not feel so terribly disadvantaged at my n00blar status.Something that readers of the reviews will likely hear or read over and over again is that this game very much has the oldCrash Bandicootflavor to it.  Others may point a bit atRatchet and Clankor something similar.  It offers repetitive tasks that must be completed as the player walks through the map staying within the lines that were drawn out by the developers.  (It reminds me a bit of going to an amusement park, riding the go-carts or old fashioned cars that are held within certain areas of the track by the rails that are on the ground)  While that is the case, it doesn't mean that playing through this game isn't fun.  Reviewers that expect a whole lot more may disagree (and it seems many of the 'professional reviewers' did just that), but the people that have this game a chance seemed to have figured out quickly that this game has much more to enjoy than those seemingly impatient and highly demanding gamers did.Knack isn't a First Person Shooter.  It isn't an RPG, or combo there-of.  It is instead a side-scrolling (primarily) platform game that mixes a bit of puzzle solving with button mashing goodness to destroy enemies and fight your way onto the next objective as you continue on your quest to save your party and perhaps the world from certain doom.Knack involves cartoon violence that a few people might object to, but it is rated E for everyone and for the vast majority of potential gamers it should be just fine to play with minimal supervision.  Cooperative game play is possible, but the co-op play is an area where the professional reviewers probably have a good point in saying it isn't as fun or useful to play through that way (for at least one of the players).The artwork is nicely done, though the graphics are very cartoonish (intentionally so), rather than realistic.  It seems that some reviewers knock the game because it wasn't as graphically impressive as some might have expected from a next generation system.  I'm not sure what those reviewers expected to find, but I think the graphics are very well done and fit very well for the style that it seems the developers were looking for.{originally said: All of that said, I would note that I have not purchased Knack yet.  I bought other games as part of my own release day collection, and wound up renting Knack since I wasn't quite sure what to expect with it.  After a few days of playing it, I was really ready to place an order for my own copy but then I slowed down and asked myself again if I really thought that I'd play through the game more than a few times and I must admit that has stopped me (thus far) from ordering a copy to keep long term.  While I do think I'll play through at least a bit on a higher difficulty level, I still don't know that I'd play enough in the future to justify the total outlay of my disposable income.  When this game is re-released as a discounted greatest hits type game, it would certainly be worth purchasing, but at the original MSRP, it might be much harder to justify for most people.Personally, I do love the game.  I'd love to see an expansion pack or other DLC that would add value and additional play to enjoy and derive value from.  It may yet come to pass, but for now, this is a game that deserves to be played, but not necessarily one that mandates purchasing.}* Edited to note: I couldn't resist and did wind up buying a copy of this game.  I was given an offer that made it a pretty good deal and just couldn't resist.  It is a ton of fun and I've been enjoying going back through the game collecting all of the collectibles that I can find.  Certainly worth a purchase if you can find the game discounted at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

That said there's a lot of issue. I'm going to preface the rest of this review by saying, I'm not a huge fan of FPS in the first place. I prefer more original games or RPG's for the most part. The story of this game, graphics and sound I thought were all great. The controls I didn't think were great or bad just serving their purpose. What I found frustrating what the &#34;box&#34; concept within the game, to purchase weapons and trade out your existing weapons. Personally one of the  things I enjoy in FPS is the ability to have a ton of weapons to choose from either on your person, or obtainable within the level your in. The other aspect of this game I thought was poorly executed was the multi player option. I found the levels for multi player to be confusing and too confining. All this said I would still recommend giving this game a play through, possibly borrow or rent instead of purchase though would be my personal recommendation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2013"}

Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

(yeah, you remember that video game store that used to rip people off, now replaced by gamestop. you probably still remember the song too)i forget what my first game was but i know i owned crazy taxi and hydrothunder at one point. loved both of those games. very fun. liked hydro thunder the most because of the way the boats \"transformed\" when you went over a power up. the graphics were amazing at that time and the games where very good.i even had a gameshark for it that you plugged into the controller. i didnt per say like the controller to much (the xbox seems to have modified the sega's controller a lil' bit, especiall considering the fact that the original xbox had memory units you plugged into the controller itself just like the dreamcast controller) the visual memory unit was probaby the best and is still the best memory card ever made in my opinion on any system from any year. the fact you can save and still play those games on it that you save is just amazing. no system has done that before and to tell you the truth probably never will since they all seemed to use hard drives now.i do remember some type of game disc that came out sometime in mid to late 99 or 2000 that you can use to play your playstation one games on the dreamcast. the man that created the disc had, i think, just one game and that was gran turismo 2. i had that disc and remember the graphics on gt2 and  how so much more improved they were.the creator said on his web site that he was trying to get other stores to participate and sell his product if he can sell enough of them but that never happened. i remember going to his web site and seeing sonic the hedgehog standing by a tomb stone weeping at the death of the product he was trying to create.then the unthinkable happened. the dreamcast itself died. i think it was only in production for a year or so before sega pulled the plug. very sad situation. and to think that the dreamcast was on its way to become something big. but all isnt lost, maybe the dreamcast paved the way for playstation and xbox to be where they are today, maybe, i dont know. i kept my dreamcast for another year and traded it in for the ps2 in 2001 and traded my ps2 in for the xbox in 2002. i never forgot about the dreamcast, though, and how great of a system it was to me and seeing this on amazon not only brings me back to when video games where really starting to get good but also just bring me back to my child hood. i think i was like 13 or something. but to me this was one of the best game systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Steve \"SBN\"","summary":"The Scariest Game ever Made!!!!","reviewText":"I like the RE games and this is one of my favorites. If you think you don't need you old PSone version, think again! this game is like playing a new sequal to the RE games. I actually think that this is the scariest game ever made for so many reasons. You never know what to expect! because this game is so realistic, Hunters can literally jump from the 2nd story of the East hallway (where one of the stair cases are at) and attack you from the 1st story. If you see a Zombie laying on the floor doesn't mean it's dead (unless you decapitate it or burn it!) because 5-10 minutes later it will get up again and they can run (you heard me!) and slash you or attack you by eating. They can once in a while enter rooms when you least expect it. Zombies can be in the bathroom and when other ones are breaking in, you can see the door slam and a zombie from the bathroom (if you didn't burn it or decapitate it) will run after you. This is a very well designed game and I would highly recommend you to get it. Even if you don't like the Gamecube, it's a great game to make you get one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2006"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"For once, a series ends with a bang","reviewText":"If recent news stories turn out to be true, then it's too bad Insomniac might not personally make a new entry in the Resistance franchise because for all intents and purposes, they pretty much nailed what the franchise should feel like. From the tone and pacing of the campaign, to the graphics and the engine and to smaller but very important changes such as the return of the weapon wheel, Resistance 3 improves on its predecessor in nearly every way. But there is some unfortunate omissions and if you're looking for a \"every question answered\" kind of finale, you're not going to get that here but with a promising multiplayer offering, and a great campaign, Resistance 3 might not end up getting everyone's money thanks to bigger games in a really crowded Fall season, but it sure feels like it deserves it.During an alternate 1950's, an alien/mutated human race known as the Chimera swept through all of Asia and either killed or converted everyone in their path eventually making their way to England. Fighting back and driving them off was a lone American soldier named Nathan Hale who was infected by the Chimeran strain (Resistance: Fall of Man). While defeated, the Chimera pursued and set their eyes on America leading once again for Hale to make a valiant effort to drive them back (Resistance 2). But it was all for naught as 4 years later, the Chimera have taken over the country and only pockets of civilization living underground exist, vastly outnumbered and lacking the resources to fight them off. Living underneath Haven, Oklahoma is Joseph Capelli, a former soldier and squadmate of Hale, who is newly married with a son. But when Dr. Malikov, the scientist from the second game finds him and explains a situation that threatens to completely wipe out humanity, Capelli and Malikov make the long trek to New York City to if nothing else, deal a huge blow to Chimeran forces and hopefully, wipe them out completely.What makes the Resistance 3 story way more effective than its 2 predecessors is that there's an emphasis not only in the situation humanity has found itself in but also the motivation of its protagonist. Things are grim and faced with the possibility of having his family and everyone else's wiped out, Capelli's journey is one of personal stake and not one of military orders like Hale's. The campaign is also incredibly well-paced and with each chapter (20 in all) promising the introduction of either a new weapon, setpiece or environment, the game does a good job at keeping things varied. The only slight misstep is the ending but I don't mean that in a abrupt scenes-are-missing feeling that Killzone 3's gave but rather it feels a bit too brief and for a series with a thick backstory and questions a mile long that need be asked, it's disappointing not everything is addressed.Learning from their mistakes, Insomniac also brought back some gameplay elements that were lacking in Resistance 2. Chief among them is the weapon wheel so while realistically, one man shouldn't be able to carry 2 assault rifles, one rocket launcher, a sniper rifle and others, gameplay wise it makes for more varied and dynamic firefights. No longer do you have to pick up the new weapon found to deal with the next situation, now you can just decide how to best approach it. With weapons having alternate fires such as the makeshift bomb that magnum rounds give, the shield the Auger puts up or a mini-turret the Marksman lays down, you can use one gun for most of it or change things up when you need to. And it's best if you mix things up since weapons will actually level up with use so bullseye can now tag up to 3 enemies instead of one or the shotgun can shoot a powerful concussive blast and even light them on fire which makes combat even more satisfying as it continues. Also returning are health packs and thankfully they're always around when you need them and not sneakily hidden or thin in numbers. While you can buy cheats to be used in campaign, among them is the shooter-standard regenerating health, the return of health packs is a welcome one.Graphically, this isn't the next Playstation 3 \"look what we can do\" powerhouse like God of War and Uncharted are but the game is remarkably improved over R2. More attention is paid to its atmosphere and lighting with wind kicking up tons of dust particles and debris, levels played out in the snow and some cool setpieces involving a foggy river trip and a stampede (it's best to see it for yourself), the extra year helped make not only a more pleasing looking campaign but a better designed one. Sound design is equally strong with guns such as the bullseye getting a more violent sound, the distinct Chimeran roars and death knells abound, and the setpieces and accompanying music are appropriately epic. Voice acting is also very solid and despite some rather stiff facial animation (though let's be honest: after LA Noire, everything looks bad in comparison), characters are believably voiced and though there's a lack of personalities among them, they're at least not laughable to hear.  One thing to note is the game does have a 3D mode option which I of course can't test because I'm not fortunate / rich enough to afford one but least it's there for people who do.Another overhaul is in its online modes so once there was a unique and addicting 8 player co-op mode, now it's just campaign co-op. Instead of a huge 60 player count in its multiplayer, now it's 8 on 8. While the missing co-op mode is cause for sadness, the actually multiplayer is a welcome change since the 60 matches were chaotic and almost cluster****-ish though the new offering is more \"Call of Duty with a Resistance skin\". Now I'm not completely adverse to anything with a CoD-like structure and what's on hand here is promising though not altogether spectacular. Getting XP to level up in rank so you can access abilities and get killstreaks (called \"berserks\") is fairly standard now but with the unique weaponry of the series, it's just different enough and plays well enough to be exciting. But there's some faults such as sometimes the game temporarily stops and freezes before it continues, weapons and abilities can be either underpowered and useless to overpowered and irritating. But then the matchmaking was remarkably quick and with promises of more updates in the future, the multiplayer should hopefully last quite awhile.Another thing to note: Resistance 3 is the first game to have an \"Online Pass\" system where new copies of the game will be shipped with a code that must be redeemed to access the online. The one caveat is that unlike some of EA's passes which at least contain a trial, if you rent or buy used, you're not allowed on there period so either you pay 10$ for a multiplayer you might not care for or it's all-in and you're paying full price for the game.While it's kicking off the busy-as-hell Fall season of games, I'm not entirely sure if Resistance 3 will be the big hit it should be. With bigger and even multi-platform titles on the horizon, people might just pass this game up to save for something else. Which is unfortunate because this is easily the best Resistance game with a campaign better than you'd think and a multiplayer that should have legs to it, it's a game that I found easy to enjoy despite its flaws. It's just too bad Insomniac is probably finished with the series when it feels like they're just getting started.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYDEQ","description":"","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"Not bad for Forza first installment in open world racing","reviewText":"I was kind of excited when I first heard that Forza was working on a (at that time) secret project. I am a big fan of Forza games so I was wondering what this \"secret project\" could be. Most were expecting an open world type game, a la test drive unlimited. When I finally got wind that this WOULD be an open world game I was even more excited.I didn't really care to much that it was being developed by a different company, however, but since T10 was still over the project I didn't mind.When the game finally came out, I wasn't as enthusiastic as I had once been. I guess after playing Forza 4 for so long (and dumping a lot of money into the game) I was kind of wore out on racing games. Most professional reviewers gave the Horizon 8 out of 10 stars and the game seemed pretty cool but I decided to wait til the demo came out. When it did, I downloaded it and played it and wasn't as impressed with it like I thought I would be. But about 3 weeks later (yesturday from this posts date) I decided to buy the game.Okay, the Good....Graphically the game is pretty good. It definitely has the Forza flavor/feel that I like. You can upgrade your car and change the paint, do designs, pretty much all the design stuff you could do in Forza 4 you can do it here. The music is pretty good as well and fits the theme of the game. Although I don't care for Dubstep, thats the only station I listen to, I like about 6 songs from it.The controls are pretty good. The cars seem to handle like those from Forza 4. It does feel a little like an arcade game but not to major. The state they use in this game, Colorado, is huge. Lots of driving to do in this game when you are not doing races. The traffic is not heavy at all and they actually use real cars that exist in real life like camry's and I seen a GMC Yukon Denali along with a few others although I don't think you can buy the traffic cars in game.The movie clips are pretty good and the acting is really good too. I like the shakey camera they use in the movie clips. The night time racing is nice and fun too. First Forza game to offer night time racing and they did an excellent job with it (yes I know the game is not completly forza but this can be a hint to what Forza 5 will be like hopefully). The cars headlights are very bright. They turn on and off by themselves. You will see a lot of other racers on the road as well and you can race them anytime. All you do is pull up behind them and hit \"x\". Depending on the difficulty of the car you are trying to race and the car you are going to race with determines your winning amount of money. The rewind feature is back as well.The map in the game is easy to read for me and is well laid out. You can do any race in any order. If you have a save file from Forza 4 then the game will award you with, I think, 10 cars from your garage. The game picks the cars for you. There are a few new cars in the game. One in particular is the 2012 Mercedes S65. They also put the newest Infiniti G37 and the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 with 662hp in the game as well. I don't know the exact number of cars in this game but I know its less than half of the cars from Forza 4.They will have monthly DLC's for you to download. That's all I can think of for the good.Now the Bad....Even though the graphics are pretty good, they are cartoonish and seem dated compared to Forza 4. You cannot fine tune any of your upgrades that you buy from the upgrade shop, which absolutely sucks unless there is a way to do it, I haven't found it. Cars only suffer cosmetic damage. No more simulation damage. You can knock over signs and small posts and fences but not light poles. If you crash into those, then the car will stop dead in its tracks.A lot of the higher powered cars seem to slide all over the road when driving. The character you play, when in movie scenes, never says a word. Not a big deal, but why he dosen't talk is beyond me. Lots of races, yes, but thats it really. You can drive around but there is really nothing else to do. There are no police cars, this is not Need for speed, so this game will get very boring, very fast.Just like with Forza 4 (and any other game for that matter) they charge quite a bit for DLC's. Its 400 MS points for just 6 cars a month. You can buy the season pass for 4000 MS points ($50) but I prefer to save my 50 bucks. I did the season pass thing with Forza 4 and I am not doing it again. I wish they had an actual garage where you can walk around and look at the cars like in Project Gothem Racing 2, 3 and 4.Overall this is a pretty good game. Once the game is complete, you can play online or the Rivals mode which is kinda fun but other than that the game will get boring. Oh, I guess you can try and get all the achievements. If you are a fan of racing and you like Forza then I guess you can buy this game. Had I had known I would have brought it from here instead since its so much cheaper then in the stores because this game, I assure you, is not worth $60 bucks since it brings nothing new to the table.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000K3X9","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"There are better Dreamcast titles...","reviewText":"Sonic AdventureWhen the Dreamcast first came out, this was one of the games you had to have. Sonic, being the cornerstone of Sega, was expected to be Sega'sSuper Mario 64. Although it failed to meet that expectation, they did create a fairly fun game. I still think if you own a Dreamcast that this needs to be in your collection. If you don't own a Dreamcast, there is no reason to find one just for this game.Graphics- 7/10At the time these were really good graphics. They couldn't stand up toSoul Calibur, but it was still solid. Many problems lie within the graphics though. The level design is poor. The Adventure Zones are small and yet have a loading screen every time you walk through a door. Action Zones are sometimes better, like in Twinkle Park, but not usually. The camera has all kinds of problems. You will become annoyed very quickly if you find yourself in a small room and the camera is caught. The graphics are smooth and have some good details, but overall the level design is just ugly.Story- 8.5/10This is probably the best aspect of the game. In this game you don't just play as Sonic, you can play as five other characters: Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E-102, and Big. You can't just pick whoever you want, you have to start as Sonic and earn other characters. One you earn another character, you can go play through their stories. You earn other characters by meeting them in the game. So, the stories sort of intertwine. You never wonder what other characters were doing because you can play as them all and figure out. Other than that, the story is you basic Sonic story. Dr. Robotnik is causes havoc and you have to stop him. It's just interesting because it shows how the story affects all the characters in the game.Sound- 6/10Your basic Sonic sounds. You have some decent music here and there, and that stupid jump noise. A lot of music is reused over and over again. The sound in this game is just above average and has nothing special about it.Gameplay- 6.5/10Although they added in the ability to play as different characters, this is still a very bad gameplay wise game. As Sonic, you go through the longest portions of the game. Sonic's story is probably one of the most interesting and well worth your time. Tails consists of you racing Sonic to try to prove that you are just as good as him. This is fairly fun, but you are practically just replaying a portion of Sonic's game. As Amy you will be protecting a bird. You have a hammer as a weapon, which is at least a little interesting. As Big you have to fish to find your friend, Froggy. This is a change in pace, but it is poorly done and very annoying trying to catch that stupid frog. Knuckles can glide and climb on things. As Knuckles you are looking for pieces of crystals. This is fun, but far too easy. As E-102 you are working for Robotnik for most of the game, but you also get to play the aftermath. He has probably the easiest game in the entire game as he uses a gun.Difficulty- 2/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)The game is either extremely easy, or it is annoying like Big's is. The game can be flown through. The only thing that keeps the length up is the multiple characters. Even with all the characters, this game can easily be beat within 2 days. I know the game is based for a younger audience, but it could offer a little challenge. The only hard part in the entire game is the final 7th character you unlock.Overall- 6.5/10This game is a fun game worth playing; it just fails at being a truly entertaining experience. If you own a Dreamcast, I suggest you buy this game. If you don't own a Dreamcast, forget you even read this review and go buy something awesome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2008"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Marvel fanboys will weep with joy","reviewText":"I played X-men: Legends for the Playstation 2 and, although I liked the idea of playing with four players at once, the actual game play left a lot to be desired.  There were a couple of problems, not the least of which was that four characters on the screen were difficult to keep track of or even see.  When the camera was hovering a thousand feet up, attractive graphics became irrelevant--everybody looked like ants.  Also, you couldn't play the cool characters right away but had to earn them, which made the game frustrating.Marvel Ultimate Alliance (MUA) fixes all those problems.  You start out playing the characters you WANT to play: Spider-Man, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Deadpool, the works.  The cooler characters you have to earn, but they're worth earning: Silver Surfer, Ghost Rider, Blade, Daredevil, Black Panther and even Nick Fury.  My team of choice was Doctor Strange, Blade, Ghost Rider, and Deadpool.  Pick your team of four heroes and you're off!Your team is assembled to beat bad guys at the behest of SHIELD Agent Nick Fury, he of the eye patch and white gloves. Then you proceed to battle an array of villains led by Doctor Doom, from Mephisto to Loki, Galactus to esoteric bad guys like Dragonman.  Just about everyone in the Marvel universe is in this game.The game play is standard: shoot things, slash things, and blow things up.  In turn, various minions will do their best to knock you out, leaving the hero unconscious for a period of time until he recovers.  There were a few times I ran through the game with just one hero left, like when Ghost Rider took on an entire legion of Skrull warriors and Galactus droids, tossing them off cliffs with his chains.  Man, that was fun...but I digress.Although most of the time you can't zoom in on the characters, you get a much better perspective of them when you handle the upgrades.  The upgrade system is intricate, detailing everything from the powers the heroes use to the gadgets they pick up to the outfits they wear.  This is especially good, because folks accustomed to the movie version of Blade will be horrified to see what his original costumes looked like in the comic (hint: think green). That said, the costumes actually matter, and you slowly unlock costumes throughout the game that will appeal to fans that know the characters from the comics (Doctor Strange's alternate costumes are friggin' weird).MUA gets a lot of things right.  The powers are evocative of the comic, from Ghost Rider's vengeance stare to Doctor Strange's magical bolts, to Blade's shotgun, katana, and pistol. The hero voices perfectly match their characters.  Blade SOUNDS like Wesley Snipes.  Doctor Strange sounds like the way I've always imagined him.  Ghost Rider is suitably gravelly. And Deadpool...well I've never imagined Deadpool speaking but it fits.The boards are interesting and interactive.  Most fun is Arcade, sort of a Joker for the Marvel universe, complete with funhouse and old-style games like Pong and Pitfall that you have to play (I imagine kids are scratching their heads...). The boss fights show off the detail of the characters, as they involve button-mashing sequences as opposed to straightforward combat.  This makes for a cinematic climax to every end battle.There are some things that are still a little silly.  While it's great that you can bash and smash nearly everything, from walls to sculptures to machinery, sometimes that simply doesn't make sense.  Our heroes begin on a SHIELD helicarrier that's about to crash, and they gain coinage by...smashing everything on the ship.  Isn't that exactly the opposite of what they're supposed to be doing?But that's a minor quibble.  The game has oodles of replayability, as you search for collectible action figures (I found all of the Daredevil ones, but not the Black Panther), find special mission discs that let you play out scenes from each heroes past, and even develop your team's powers.  GO TEAM VENTURE!I haven't played multiplayer, but you can play against an opponent or with up to four of your buddies.  That just sounds like a lot of fun.  Even the computer-controlled characters are not complete morons, which is a refreshing change for this sort of game.Everything that makes the Marvel comics universe great is here in obsessive levels of detail.  I enjoyed the game so much that I played it to completion and then some.  I can only hope that the next game will allow you to carry over your saved characters. It's enough to make a Marvel fanboy weep with joy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2007"}

For a shooter game it is unique because unlike all others you have to plan your moves carefully.I enjoyed playing it but there is a huge problem on the PS3: It doesn't save your progress unless you complete an entire mission.  Apparently, this works fine on the Xbox and PC versions.  My low rating is because the manufacturer said they \"might\" come out with a patch for the PS3 version.I have issues with the controller layout also.  When you look through the rifle scope or binoculars, you have to use the left up/down buttons to zoom in/out.  IMHO, the the left joystick should control zooming.If you plan on playing Campaign Mode, than you better be ready to complete an entire mission or your progress is lost.  This could be several hours of lost game play.  It is inexcusable to play for hours and have all of your progress is lost.PS3 owners should demand a fix for this bug.  If you haven't bought the PS3 version yet, check the forums to make sure that a patch was released to fix the save problem; otherwise, get the Xbox or PC version.If 505 fixes the bug, I'll change my review.

I decided to buy it to tide me over until Icewind Dale 2 comes out.  I have to say, I got a lot of enjoyment out of it.  It was better than I expected it to be.  It could have been better, but it is worth buying.  I, like a large and increasingly neglected group of gamers, have no interest whatsoever in the multiplayer aspect, or in the dungeon creation toolset.  Therefore, if you want a review of these parts of the game, then you'll have to skip to the next one.  If you want to learn about the single-player campaign, read on.The best part of this game is the new engine, and the interface.  It looks nice, and it's very slick.  The graphics don't deserve the criticism that they are getting.  The only shortcomings of the graphics show up if you have the camera zoomed in, which will probably be rare, since you need it zoomed out to get a wide view.  The faces are kind of featureless and blocky, but if you zoom out, you won't notice.The game is full of candy for the eyes and the ears.  The spell effects are great, and so are the fighting animations.  The battle cries and the taunts are great.  The ambient sounds in the city, like the moans of plague victims and the sounds of fighting in the distance, are great at setting the atmosphere.  The music, composed by Jeremy Soule (a guy who makes one great role-playing soundtrack after another) is wonderful.The interface is very easy to learn, and it's very flexible.  This keeps the game play moving along swiftly.  A teleportation stone lets you return instantly to town to sell your stuff or get healed.  If you are a D&D; purist, you might not like this addition, but if you aren't, then you will probably like the way that it keeps the game flowing.  It's nice to be able to get back to town and pawn your stuff without trudging out of the dungeon.This campaign, however, is definitely not the stuff that legends are made of.  It's pretty uncreative and uninspired.  The storyline is a typical \"move up the food chain and kill the bosses lackeys\" story with the usual shortfalls.  A no-name Level 1 character starts off the game having to save the whole city.  The Big Boss deals with you by sending progressively stronger, yet dumb henchmen, 1 by 1, to kill you.  Duh.  This is the weakest D&D; storyline yet.This problem applies for the magic items too.  There aren't many interesting items.  Lots of cookie-cutter items repeat themselves frequently, like in Diablo.  In chapter 1, you might find 3 pairs of \"Gloves of Swordplay\".  Then, in chapter 2, you find 3 pairs of \"Greater Gloves of Swordplay\".  The scenery is also \"blah\" and repetitive.  There are no memorable areas in this game, like Kuldahar in Icewind Dale, or Athlakta in Baldurs Gate 2.The biggest flaw of this game is the HORRIBLE decision to eliminate the party and replace it with a single, dumb-AI henchman that can only follow simple orders.  You can only give your henchman potions in combat.  You can't control their moves.  You can't give them items that they could use.  You can't choose their spells for them.  You can't control when they cast spells.  This is a huge step BACKWARDS, not forwards.  What were these people thinking?  D&D; is at it's best on the computer when you have a diverse party, and you can use all of their strengths to your advantage.  You won't get that in this game.  That is why I eagerly await Icewind Dale 2, which is a full-party 3rd Edition game.  Perhaps someone this new engine to create a party-based D&D; game someday.Still, despite my complaints, I enjoyed this game, and I would recommend it for RPG fans.  It has a great pace, and it is a fun game.  If you don't buy it now, at least pick it up in the bargain bin someday.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

GameBoy is just trying to make a quick buck. I bet you that within the next year there's going to be a GameBoy Advance SP Turbo or something. How long is it going to take for them to quit putting out new models that have all the same capabilities except for a light or the shape or something dumb like that, and really sit down and take some time to try and put out a decent model with decent graphics. The sound is useless because you mostly just hear music, which is the same 30 second tune played over and over. I have to admit, the quality of the graphics have improved since GameBoy Color, but barely improved since GameBoy Advance. There are nowhere near the amount of levels that you can play on PS2 or Xbox or even GameCube. Mostly not even half. In conclusion, GameBoy is not all it's cracked up to be. I'm sorry if you don't agree but that's my honest opinion. So, save a quick buck and buy a video game console instead. (PS2 is the best, then Xbox, then GameCube) So in a nutshell, if you have regular GameBoy Advance, there's really no need to get GameBoy Advance SP Platinum.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2004"}

Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"Surprisingly Fun Game","reviewText":"I was looking for something different this summer and I was glad I took a chance with Sleeping Dogs.  In short, this game is the love child of Shenmue and GTA.  Like Shenmue, you spend a lot of time wandering around Hong Kong using your karate and hand to hand combat moves to get around town and advance the story.  And much like GTA, you have the option of stealing cars, getting knee deep in gang (triad) politics, though here you get the nice twist of playing for the cops as well.The mechanics of the game are pretty straight forward.  You get a plethora of main and side missions, you have a huge sandbox to walk/drive/bike around all mixed in with a pretty decent storyline.  What I like about this game is it really brings me back to the days of Shenmue when it was so much fun to explore the city of Hong Kong (or in Shenmue's case, just Aberdeen - here in SD, the area you can cover in HK is MUCH bigger.  If you don't rely on the map, it's actually quite fun just driving around the city and checking out the sights and sounds of HK.  Victoria Peak is a nice place to drive up to, just like in real life).  You don't get as many RTES (real time events) like you did in Shenmue, aside from certain action scenes.  But it makes up for it with the freedom to explore and I like the variety of side missions.  My only gripe is that some missions are too short and end very abruptly.  The handling of vehicles can be tricky at times.  But all in all this is a fantastic action RPG/GTA style game that will definitely reward those looking for something different.In short:PROS:- Feels like the perfect hybrid of GTA & Shenmue- Great atmosphere, huge sandbox environment- Fair amount of stuff to do, nice/interesting variety of missions- Decent graphicsCONS:- Some missions too abrupt- Some vehicles are a pain to useAll in all a worthwhile purchase.  I've been a lot more mindful of the games I buy lately and I took a chance with this one.  It was definitely worth every cent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"Debra M.

You get to be Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf(Gandalfs the best!). You can use magic with Gandalf, use a LONG sword and bows with Aragorn, and you can put on the Ring with Frodo. You battle people wolves and a multiple # of cave trolls and Orcs. Now I know this doesn't amazing but it's fun while it lasts. The graphics are pretty good if the characters looked like that in the movie. But this is a game to rent. You'll beat it too quickly.

Pretty choppy but not in a terrible way, especially when you factor in Hordes of zombies and lickers.Gameplay: Like SOCOM (current gen). You cant crouch, but you can take cover behind low obstacles. Zombie murdering has never been more fun, ESPECIALLY when ragdoll physics send Zombies and other foes slamming into walls and over tables. However, there is a dive that is kind of fun, but I dont know what to do with it. The only bad thing is that when you play online, Head-shots are not AS effective, but they work. and you have an awesome melee moveset which includes pretty cool take-down/human-zombie shield moves.Controls: Be sure to set your controls properly and you cant go wrong. They are pretty fluid. I kind of wish there were some stylish rolls, and maybe some crouching, especially since these guys are Bad-ass.Story: CAMPY. but SERIOUS. FUNNY (even though they don't intend to be). but it is Good. especially for what it sets out to do.Overall: I REALLY WISH that they would focus on this elite squad on other things, letting this game be their last mission. The characters are cool, edgy and could use some character polish, because you care about them, even though you know nothing about them. The guns are awesome, and the Game needs a horde mode, because Wave survival would fit this game.Nutshell: Buy it. Update it. love it. especially at the $15-$20 range. I can see why $60 adopters would be furious, but hey, it is definitely worth $25-$30. I just may buy the DLC.PS. there is no local co-op or splitscreen. this game would have greatly benefit from this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

Rhodes","summary":"Perhaps the Best of all the Contra Games","reviewText":"Contra III: The Alien Wars was really one of the first games that really showed people what the Super Nintendo was capable of.  Released in 1992, this classic is now available on the Nintendo Wii's virtual console for 800 Wii Points (eight dollars respectively).  It's a short game, but it's fairly addictive and easy to get into.The Red Falcon is trying to take over the world, and the only two people who can stop this even alien menace are Bill (the blue guy) and Lance (the red guy).  Contra has NEVER been about story.  It's always been about gameplay.  No matter how you look at it, and Contra III is divine.The gameplay has been brought to new heights since the NES versions.  You've got guns, super bombs you can use and to make things even better, you're able to carry two guns and switch between them on the fly, and even use both at the same time.  Graphically it was one of the first SNES games to have a stylish look, and showed us just how much you could really put on the screen at any one time.  The environments are decorative, the explosions look good, and the bosses are still some of the most detailed the Super Nintendo ever had.Contra has always been known for its difficulty, and Contra III is no exception.  Old fans of Contra, of course, remember the classic Konami cheat.  It doesn't work in Contra III, but to compensate there are difficulty levels and you can choose to start off with more lives.  Of course hardcore fans will go through the game on Hard Mode with the default 3 lives.  If you thought the first two Contra games were hard, you haven't seen anything until you've played through Contra III on hard mode.The only real drawback to the game is that it's pretty short.  It's only six stages long and the levels themselves aren't really that long.  It's got a ton of replay value to its credit, however, and fans will probably be dying to go through the game without getting hit once.  So it has some good replay value at least.  The only other drawback to the game, for Virtual Console, users is simply that while the Virtual Console version supports the Gamecube Controller, it's almost impossible to use, unless you want to find out just what ways your fingers can bend.  A Super Nintendo game was no designed to be played with a Gamecube controller.  So those downloading on Nintendo Wii's virtual console, keep in mind that without a Classic Controller, gameplay will be next to impossible.Contra III is arguably the best one in the series, with the Sega Genesis version Hard Corp competing for this position.  Both are strong games, and both were probably the last good Contra games to ever be released.

{"product_name":"B007UM59AC","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Siddiqui","summary":"Dante may have changed but the core mechanics of Devil May Cry haven't","reviewText":"It has been over 4 years since we last saw Dante in his signature red coat, but the legendary demon hunter has undergone a new style in his new debut reboot DmC: Devil May Cry. Many people lament on the change, voicing their vulgar remarks at the sudden shift without trying the product for themselves. However DmC relies on the same lore and gameplay that made this beloved franchise a success while taking a new path. While the story remains bland throughout the adventure the strong voice-acting and intense gameplay makes this new addition to the notorious franchise a wonderful experience. DmC may look and sound different but it plays just like Devil May Cry.Dante and Vergil are Nephilim, a being imbued with the abilities of heaven and hell that are born from an angel and demon. These creatures are the only ones capable of killing the demon king Mundus and he wants nothing less but the complete extermination of all the Nephilim. There demonic father, Sparta, was imprisoned for betraying Mundus when he fell in love with an angel named Eva. He took his revenge by killing his beloved wife but failed to kill the twins. Now Mundus controls the world through debt, surveillance, media and a popular soft drink. But Vergil seeks to stop Mundus and recruits Dante to assist him in eliminating the demon king's hold on humanity. It's a simple tale but that has been present for all DMC games.Where the game truly distinguishes itself from other DMC titles is in the writing and soundtrack. Dante is still cocky and has an ego to match while Vergil maintains his calm attitude and his desire to be in control of everything. However unlike the other games characters interact more often, using strong language and sharing vital details about their personality, background and objectives. While the voice-acting is stellar the story is simple, don't expect a complex narrative that will leave you thinking. As for the music you can expect a lot of heavy metal music from Combichrist. While it fits the atmosphere of this new world it won't have you turning your headset on to deafening volume. These aspects alienate DmC from other Devil May Cry games but it doesn't go far enough to completely segregate it from the franchise.Where the game remains true to past games in the franchise is in its gameplay. Dante has access to both angelic and demonic powers, as well as an assortment of guns. In his demon form Dante can access slow but powerful weapons to break shielded enemies defenses and create devastating attacks. In his angel form Dante can use quick and effective crowd controlling weapons that lack offensive capabilities. Switching between each form is quick and easy, simply hold down the trigger for either form to access the weapons. In his standard form, known as \"human\", Dante can use his sword Rebellion and a selection of guns. This gives Dante the ability to use any weapon in his arsenal easily, allowing for some sophisticated combos to fill the ever popular stylish meter and your devil trigger gauge. By completing a certain combat objective players earn points that are displayed on the right hand of the screen. Earning more points will raise your rank to earn the desired SSS ranking at the end of the mission, as long as you don't die or use items to reduce your rating.Similar to Nero from Devil May Cry 4 Dante can now grapple enemies. Instead of have a specific style, like in DMC 3 or DMC 4, Dante uses both angelic and demonic forms allow him to pull enemies toward him or pull himself to them. This allows for easily combos without the need to properly use and maintain the enemy cancellation technique. Outside of combat these grappling hooks are used to pull platforms, move objects and swing onto ledges. It's a easy concept to grasp and a vital technique to master in both platforming and combat.But what is the point of having these abilities to your disposal without challenging enemies to face, fortunately DmC delivers a wide array of opponents to eliminate. Each demon has a specific pattern that is forced to follow. They highlight each attack with a pose before attacking, allowing you to anticipate each attack. This makes large and small fights relatively reasonable, forcing the player to be constantly alert of every enemy on the battlefield. And by killing these demons you are rewarded with red orbs that can be used to upgrade Dante in various ways such as health, devil trigger and moves. However the lack of lock-on mechanic and a shaky camera can cause the player to lose track of a specific target or grab the wrong one, making large fights annoying when trying to handle multiple foes with different fighting conditions. The boss fights, while impressive, rarely allow you to truly test your combat skills and rely solely on how you memorize striking patterns and weaknesses. But creating a bloody mosaic of your opponents is always satisfying regardless of who it is.The levels are beautifully crafted renditions of a real world dragged into a demonic land called Limbo. In this universe the ordinary world is twisted into a malevolent environment that seeks your death. The walls will attempt to crush you as vulgar words begin to show on the landscape or you'll suddenly be able to see the silhouettes of tortured humans in the real world. These environments are visually breathtaking but rarely have any affect on the combat, which is a shame. Limbo houses an array of hidden collectables such as keys and damn souls waiting to be freed by your blade. The keys however allow Dante to unlock hidden doors and access challenge areas that hold upgrades if completed. The issue is that these collectables affect your overall ranking, making them mandatory for those seeking to gain a SSS ranking in any mission. Limbo definitely reinforces the presentation of DmC and offers some challenging platforming such as navigating through a television show's graphics or escape a collapsing landscape.Those people who were fearful of Ninja Theory's new take on the Devil May Cry franchise, like I was, can abandon those feelings now. Despite his new look Dante retains the same attitude of the original character and his ability to perform impressive attacks using various weapons. While the story still remains tawdry its fast dynamic combat is more accessible than other Devil May Cry games. Despite the camera issues and the lack of lock-on mechanic the gameplay is thrilling throughout the game. While Dante's past adventures have provided hours of entertainment DmC: Devil May Cry has illuminated a brand new future for the demon hunter, and it's going to be a one hell of a party.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

Okay we know this. But is it good? Not really. Thing is there seems to have been a rushed effort with this game. Sure there were good intentions, but there was alot left unfinished in this game. You can't pick up hookers. Why even have beat-the-pimp-up levels when you can't even pick them up? The character you customize can't talk. Customization is limited to generic males. The missions are either ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard. There is no middle ground. The cheat system is also redundant since you can't get acheivements with the cheats on, thus you can't make any progress in the game with them on. So why have the feature to begin with?

So when you've got a winning design there's no need to change anything.  However, because of a legal battle with Immersion over rumble technology, Sony was forced to offer their Sixaxis controller without rumble.  The Sixaxis had the same Dualshock design but it felt too lightweight and cheap.  Thankfully the lawsuit has been settled and rumble has come back to the Playstation.For the most part, the DualShock 3 is almost identical to its PS2 precessor.  But it has all the features of the original Sixaxis controller in addition to rumble.  The controller is still wireless, can be charged by plugging it into your PS3 (or PC), rumble is compatible with all PS1 and PS2 games, and the PS3 supports up to 7 controllers at the same time via bluetooth.  Rumble in the DualShock 3 seems more responsive in regards to the location of its vibration depending on which side you get hit on during the games.  I don't know if this is something in the design or if it's the developers doing it for the games but I welcome it.All in all this is currently the best designed controller on the market right now.  The PS2's DS2 was incredible so \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" applies here.  I'll be enjoying rumble in my PS3 games from now on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2008"}

Sure it isn't perfect, but, if you can look passed what flaws it does have and accept it for what it is, you will truly have an amazing adventure. What I have to say about the game is completely spoiler free.Some pros that you can live with:+The game has a beautiful art style, almost like a storybook+The music in the game is extremely well done and will never drive you insane+The game has so much stuff to do between the main quest and side stuffSome cons that you might just have to accept:-The game is pretty darn easy-As you might have heard, some of the Wii Motion controls don't respond all that well (more below)-Occasional platforming snag-Controlling the camera with the d-pad (especially when it turns sooooooooo slow) can suck for any game on WiiHere's something I wanted to say about the motion controls:A lot of people bash this game because the games motion controls \"do not respond.\"They are partially correct in that the game is extremely sensitive in how you draw certain symbols to do certain things.I for one noticed that when I first began playing (as opposed to now, over 50 hours into the game) I botched every brush technique I attempted pretty much. I know it's a video game, but, just like drawing in real life it takes practice. After a time you will learn how to use brush techniques in a way that the game recognizes. Some techniques are harder to do than others, and might pop up when you swear you didn't even draw that particular symbol, but, just keep in mind that it's pretty much the only games touchy category and is nothing you're going to have to rely on luck to get it right... EVER.I've also noticed that sitting a comfortable distance away from the sensor bar (you can tell when you're too close as your cursor glitches in and out of existence) and not twisting the remote left or right while you draw makes symbols more recognizable to the game. Try to hold your remote flat when drawing.Hope this helps","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}

Danzig","summary":"GRAND Turismo","reviewText":"Because GT5 had been getting such mixed reviews -- and each new version of that game feels so much like the one before -- I decided to try this NFS equivalent of a race car driving simulation, and after several hours of playing the game, I'm enjoying it a great deal.For those who complain that the handling of the cars is too difficult to master here, I recommend making sure you have the \"Perfect Line\" option enabled.  This is a dotted green line on the pavement that shows the best steering trajectory; equally important, the line turns yellow or red if you need to slow down to take a tight curve.The game gives you a choice of viewpoints, but the one I'm using -- and appreciating -- is the \"inside the cockpit\" view, which is the actual driver's perspective -- you see your hands on the steering wheel, the dash instrumentation, and the view through the windshield and rear-view mirrors.As others have noted, the graphics and sound are superb -- fully on a par with the Gran Turismo games, as far as I can tell.  Like the GT games, NFS:S lets you race on actual race tracks from around the world.I can't comment on how well the game interfaces with third-party steering wheels.  I can say that it seems to work well with the standard wireless shock controller, and indeed I enjoy the \"feedback\" when I accelerate from a standing start or run off the track.The career mode gives you plenty to do.  As you progress, you are awarded more types of events, higher tiers of competition, and money to buy and upgrade better cars.  Compared to the Gran Turismo games, you don't have to spend as much time here with the \"spud cars\" -- Ford Focuses and the like.  You can upgrade pretty quickly to BMW M3's and other nice rides, with high-end Lamborghinis, Paganis, etc. just down the road.So if you would like to try a great-looking race simulator and are bored of the Gran Turismo series, give NFS:S a try.  At Amazon's current price, a purchase is a no-brainer.UPDATE: did I say this game is DEEP?  I've been playing it for hours now, and I keep opening up new events.  Cars of one country pitted against cars of another... special events pitting one supercar against another... lap eliminations... it goes on and on.Even though I have NFS: Hot Pursuit in the house -- and I love it -- I've been playing nothing but NFS:Shift since I got it a few weeks ago.So if you want to save a few pennies and you don't have either of these NFS titles, I suggest starting with Shift first.  It's available at a reduced \"Greatest Hits\" price.  By the time you're done with it -- this could be months of racing -- perhaps Hot Pursuit will also have dropped in price.  Again, I highly recommend both titles!UPDATE NUMBER TWO: I have to mention one strange bug in the game -- sometimes, if you smack into the rear end of another car, it will vault up in the air like a balloon!  Needless to say, this weightless effect detracts from the versimilitude of the game, but in truth it doesn't bother me, as I am usually more than happy to knock another racer out of my way, however it is depicted onscreen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

The graphics are pretty good and run perfeclty on Medium and slightly laggy on High, but still are very stunning on my prefered setting, medium texures with all the other settings at high. The level disign is fanstastic, every level has some stupendous, exciting part of it, from Running up a hill in a line with your 5 squad menmbers in the Algiers level, to looking out at the never-ending horizon of the ocean in a Nazi U2 harbor, with an ever moving and dynamic factory behind you, or storming up the long and hard beaches of omahah beach in normandy with constant explosions, men running up the shoreline, men hiding behind dragons teeth (the tank traps) and frequent reinforcements coming from boats back at the shoreline, that D-Day level is great, beef up the sound quality to high, put you two speakers on your left and right sides, turn them up as high as they go, and you will be completly immersed in the virtual normandy, and constanly lost in all the exlosions and gunfire of fake war. My second favorite level in in Brittany, France, which looks just like the sniper and child scene in saving private ryan, with houses blown in half with blackened, powdery furniturte inside, snipers hiding in church towers, and a rumbling thunder storm overhead with an occasional bolt of lighting to scare you in a few places. After defeating all the eagle eyed and Inhumanly accurate Nazi Snipers in the area, it can be very good for you to walk around and appreacitate the scenery. So the level design and scenery is fanstastic, and it runs pretty well on slightly below-average computers, so what about the gameplay. Well, this game, i'll tell you now, Is definatly now for Rainbow Six fans, it is definatly a shoot-em-up where you shoot anything that moves with infuriating rage and ignoring all aspects of stealth whatsoever. But the people who like those games will definatly love this one, with its realistic weapon sounds, satisfying death animations, and a great grenade throwing method (you dont have to waste time holding the mouse button, just press it once and there goes the grenade). But people who like the realistic game will slightly like this one too, the sound is so realistic, the AI is pretty good (watching nazis run from and incoming granade and then seeing a couragues one kick it back at you is too cool), and realistic squad commands can make this game a favorite for both types of gamers. Lastly, the multiplayer experience is great, I've been playing it on a dial up modem, and you can move and doge bullets at lag-less speeds, but after you press fire, you have to wait about 1/2 a second before the gun actually fires. Its still great though, Imagine this, two allied players stand on the side of a door, another comes in between them and opends it, all of a sudden all hell is let lose and the door-opening player is blown back by sudden machine gun fire, the other two player both lean out to avenge their freind's death, but fail to escape the explosions of the two grenades that suddenly come lobing from the door, about four nazis player spring from the door feeding many machine gun bullets at the remaing allied troops, and after about a half minute full of gunfighting, the four nazi players are finnaly eliminated in one titanic instant from two lucky allied machine-gunners. The objective mode, which was just described, is pretty team based, although there are many people who refuse to work. This mode has a certain objective to each level, such as Nazi team blow up a bridge, allied team defend it, Nazi team protect you rocket, Allied team blow it up, and the same thing with a flak cannon. This is definaly the preffered mode over the average FFA, team FFA's, and No Respawn FFA. The objective mode is pretty much a No Respown Team FFA, with the addition of the objectives and the relating teamwork. As in the single player mode, level design is great, with many sniping spots in French villages, close-combat in the V2 Rocket facilty, and a combantion of both in The Bridge level, plus theres a multiplayer objective map that is omahah beach itself, only with re-spawns for the allies. After beating the single player mode, I have been completly obssed with multiplayer, and even thoughe that part is not nearly as good as Battle Feild 1942, is a very, very big loud blast.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005QSLC","description":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3lets players once again ride as the legendary Tony Hawk or one of 12 other top pros. Building on the franchise's intuitive control scheme, the game lets players perform hundreds of tricks and combos in some of the world's most popular skate locations, including Los Angeles, Canada, and Tokyo. Players navigate through eight obstacle-filled levels that include intelligent traffic and pedestrians. The game's all-new goals and rewards system offer hours of challenges. In addition to riding as one of the greatest pro skaters ever, players can also create their own custom characters with the game's robust Create-a-Skater feature. Choosing from hundreds of options, players can customize the look of each character by choosing height, weight, skin tones, accessories, and tattoos.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Super addictive","reviewText":"I haven't really touched the Tony Hawk franchise until now, because A)I'm not a fan of extreme skateboarding in real life and B)there have been so many iterations that I didn't know what version to start with. But I grabbed Tony Hawk 1 for the N64, and was instantly hooked. Tony Hawk 3 continues that fun experience.When you get down to it, the differences between the first three versions at least are minimal. You have a large arena to skate in, and must complete certain objectives (nabbing a high score, helping people collect items, finding a secret tape, etc). The thing is the controls are so well-realized and the levels so varied that you'll always want to come back for another round, until you've spent hours trying to rack up that last high score. Each level has easy and hard objectives, and completing them in ascending order of difficulty really gives the player a sense of accomplishment.The graphics are average with some good skater animations. This isn't a huge leap from N64 to Gamecube, but its a noticible one that the later versions continued to build from. Tony Hawk 3 also comes with another selection of songs for your pleasure, and as usual theres something for everyone. If you haven't played any of the Tony Hawk series, start from the N64/PSX games and work your way up. If you're wondering what versions to get, they're all so well-executed and cheap now that it might be worth your money to try them all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2005"}

Some bosses can be frustrating, especially when they have allies atacking you at the same time. The Bruce Banner missions required some patience but the soldiers sometimes seemed very dumb and you could sneak way to easy in some other points the camera angles didn't allow you to see the all of the guards and you got detected on those stealth missions. The cell shade looked cool. I also liked the fact you could destroy columns, vehicles, walls and use them to attack the enemies. I liked the mission where as Bruce Banner you disguise as one of the soldiers to sneak in the lab.Another thing is that this game was more than I expected due to the fact it was a licensed game and they usually aren't good except for the Lord of the Rings the EA Games, although the one by Vivendi Universal was good, but not as good as the others.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00007LVJD","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Yes, it's nothing new, but...","reviewText":"I have read endless complaints about how Command & Conquer Generals is exactly like every other C&C;/Dune game. Really, now, what do you expect? Perhaps Generals is a victim of some serious hype, and it certainly isn't a revolutionary RTS in any way except for graphics, but it still is fun.Though it has some improvements in terms of interface, commands, and most notably upgrades, Generals plays a lot like most of the older games in the series. One notable difference is that you can build anywhere on the map, in a manner similar to the Blizzard RTS style. Like its most recent predecessor, Red Alert 2, you want to play offensive in this game. It's not as impossible to fight defensively as some reviewers have said, but it's always better to be the one calling the shots.In terms of the game balance and strategies, the three sides are definitely unique and very well balanced out. For example, the Chinese prefer to outnumber their enemies, and have slow but powerful units. The GLA is king of maneuverability and the covert strike, but has all around weaker units. The United States has the most powerful forces, but everything is expensive. In a manner of speaking, this balance is similar to that of the three major houses in the Dune games.The really interesting thing comes with the general abilities. These are received when you've destroyed a certain number of enemies, and can seriously tip the balance in your favor. Some abilities allow you to build special units, while others do more mundane but still important things like repairing a group of vehicles or giving new units instant veterancy. Units gain experience and rank as they kill enemies, and can get very powerful if you keep them alive. Some factions can upgrade units by paying or, in the GLA's case, by scavenging junk from the battlefield (a very cool touch!). There isn't a doubt that Generals grants more tactical options than any other C&C; title. Unlike say, Red Alert, the objective isn't just to build as many tanks as you can (although this might still work).Generals has cutting-edge 3D graphics, which explains the high system requirements. I found that it ran quite well at the lowest detail settings on my PIII 733 with an old GeForce 256, but to really bring out the beauty of the game you need something better than this. All the units explode in random and often spectacular fashion, and the superweapons are a MUST see. Almost everything you find can be destroyed in one way or another, and some things really light off when they go (toxin tanks, towers, or nuke power plants for example).The single player mode of the game is the weakest point of Generals. It lacks any of the ridiculous full motion video sequences that made Red Alert really fun. The missions range from simple to moderately difficult, but there aren't very many in all. The plot looks like it was taken right off CNN, ... In skirmish mode, the AI is quite predictable and only becomes a pain when it starts using superweapons on you. Due to the unit and general promotion system, I've had little trouble mowing down the maximum of 7 computer opponents by myself. This game was clearly created as a primarily multiplay title, and it is definitely a good deal of fun for that. The game engine is also superior, and has enormous potential for future development. Perhaps in a forthcoming expansion the single player deficiencies will be addressed.The final word is that Generals isn't the groundbreaking game everyone expected, but it is worth the price tag and a great deal of fun anyway. Especially in a time when the RTS genre seems to be on temporary hold, this game makes a great filler.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"From Bad to S*storm","reviewText":"Issac escaped the Ishimura, the ship infested with an alien virus that took control and mutated the occupants. Surely things can't get any worse, can they?StoryWithout giving much away, Dead Space 2 takes place 3 years after the first, with Isaac on a mysterious ship called the Sprawl (you know it's gonna be bad already). He has no memory of the last 3 years, due to allegedly being in a coma and suffering from dementia. The game opens with him being released as the player hears screams and sees blood splattered in the background and is soon forced to flee for his life while in a straight jacket (also note, this is one of the most expensive opening scenes in recent gaming). Once he is freed, a women named Diana contacts him and says that he will die from his illnesses unless he comes to her, left with little choice, Isaac makes his way to Diana, surviving encounters with Necromorphs, insane survivors and Earth Government troops ordered to kill him.GraphicsThe graphics are excellent, when they can be seen. The game, true to its nature, is mostly littered with dark halls with very little lighting (typically coming from from candles, broken/tipped over lights, etc). When one can see the environment, it's very well designed and feels like if a outbreak like this were to occur, this is the place for it to happen. The characters are also very well done, expressions and emotions can be seen and are well crafted.ControlsThe controls, for the most part, stay the same from the first Dead Space, and are therefore, easy to master for players who've played the first. If you haven't played the first, go play it, it's like $20 if even.VoiceOne thing players will notice is that Isaac has a voice this time around, and speaks often. Both Isaac and other characters are very well done. The acting is top notch, to me anyways, and not overly dramatic or forced.OtherDead Space 2 does have Multiplayer in it. Not campaign wise, but for Vs. If you bought the game new, you received a code to access the online parts of the game. If you bought used, you'll need to buy a one-time pass for $10. Online consists of the Security Team trying to survive and neutralize the Necromorphs in various manners while the other team trys to kill them using one of 4 different Necros. You also level up and unlock different weapons and skills as you play.Once the player has finished the game, they can play New Game+ which will allow them to replay the game with current weapons and upgrades, you also unlock Hardcore mode after completion. However, you can't carry data over to Hardcore mode, Hardcore will force you to start a completely new game. In Hardcore, you are given only 3 saves, and if you die, you must restart from your last save, this mode is for skilled players.OverallDead Space 2 is a excellent horror game that, if you get into it, can scare the crap out of you at many points in the game.8.0/10.0Pros- Great story- Excellent execution- One of the better horror titles out there right nowCons- Story can be short (finished din 8hrs, could have beaten much faster)- Online is limited, meaning it's not as good as other games with MP","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BRQN2H4","description":"","reviewerName":"James Donnelly \"Ave Atque Vale\"","summary":"Meet the new boss; not quite the same as the old boss.","reviewText":"A lot of noise has been levied at SAINTS ROW IV as being more of an add-on adventure to SAINTS ROW THE THIRD, and while there may be some nuggets of truth to that, it's still a complete gaming experience. Also, a lot of noise has been levied at many video game sequels lately that they've done nothing to enhance the experience of the previous games, and in many cases are just using all the same things we've seen in the previous games, even graphics-wise. This is a criticism I've been seeing a lot on this game, and especially BATMAN: ARKHAM ORIGINS. And while the whole concept of the SAINTS ROW games aren't exactly new, I would rather play any of the SAINTS ROW games than any of the GTA games any day of the week and twice on Sunday.Why? It's simple: There's nothing about SAINTS ROW that takes itself seriously (that is particularly true of this game), and that's kind of beautiful as opposed to some of the gameplay in the GTA games. I would go further to say that the more recent SAINTS ROW games are satirizing the GTA games, but that's a discussion for another time. Let's take some time to focus on this game here.Basically, through a series of absurd scenarios, the leader of The Saints has become President of the United States. All of your Saints (Pierce, Shaundi, Kinzie, etc.) are with you, and you even have Keith David as your Vice-President. Not the video game voice acting of Keith David; it's really Keith David. But an alien race attacks Earth, and you are trapped inside... well, we don't want to call it The Matrix EXACTLY because that would be copyright infringement, but between you and me, it's The Matrix version of Steelport. So now, you're gaining superhuman abilities (super-speed, freezing powers, fire powers, extrasensory abilities, etc.), and you're bumping off aliens left and right until the time comes to fight the big boss. And along the way, you act like a complete and total psychopath.Despite that this feels kind of similar to the previous games, particularly THE THIRD, it's still a fresh and hilarious expansion of this universe. The new rides, the new missions, the NEW POWERS!!! The powerset you obtain as you go through the game is gleefully destructive; sometimes it's like PROTOTYPE but without the self-seriousness that goes with that game.I never felt that I was being cheated by lagtimes, or that the graphics were ever spotty, unless that's the intention (which does happen often in this computerized version of Steelport). There's even an eight-bit side-scroller you get to play alongside NyteBlayde!! The only thing that is a bit less for me (merely on a personal note) is that the music isn't quite as good. And there's a little too much dubstep for my tastes. But that is where my only real gripe is.SAINTS ROW IV might look and sound like THE THIRD, but it feels very different thanks to the superhero-on-crank inspired lunacy that Deep Silver created for this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

ITs an excellent game and credit Valve for making it happen. Eventually.THis sequel adds numerous elements to the game, all of them fun.  The gels are my favorite.  THe writing is also very well done. You actually discover a compelling  history behind Aperture Science.  All of the performances are excellent.  Wheatly steals the show and I expect more games to feature performances like this in the future.  The game is moderatly hard but nothing rage inducing imo.  The only knock on the game is once you solve all the puzzles you dont have much of a challenge left.  Its not the games fault its like this for all puzzle games.  But to counter that Valve has already announced they will be releasing FREE DLC in the future.  Cant beat that.  Hopefully they will release sum w/extreme difficulty chambers to give us a bigger challenge.  Another great idea would to have a community site set up where gamers could create & share their own puzzles similar to what Bungie does w/ Halo's Forge.

Tons of crazy, spin-controlled games are waiting for you!","reviewerName":"Fred \"From http://fredsite.blogspot.com/\"","summary":"Buy this game now and make me rich!","reviewText":"None of the other 3 WarioWare games displeased me, and I did not expect this game to do that to me either.  When Wario lost at a game, he got mad and threw his GBA at the wall only to find it in pieces.  He took it to Dr. Crygor to fix it only to find him throw the destroyed GBA into what looked like a washing machine.What came out was a GBA with no buttons but Wario could play it by tilting it.  Wario thought that he could make a new game to make him rich with this technology, so he assembled his microgame crew to make over 200 new games.  At first when you see the box that holds the game you'll think that it's way too big because the box is twice the regular box's size!  Well that's because the gyro-sensor on the game is kind of big.  If you thought the Yoshi Topsy Turvy(See my review) tilt-sensor was big, the gyro-sensor is twice as big as that.  Enough about the size, you want to hear about the game.  One thing about the game that I like is how the difficulty increased from the other WarioWare games.  But most of the difficulty comes from not how hard the game is but what to do and sometimes a lot is based on luck.  All the games are controlled by tilting the GBA(Or SP and DS) and sometimes pressing A.  All the games last about 5 seconds and to beat a character you have to beat a certain number of games and then beat the boss.  You can beat the story mode in about 3 days but that does not mean rent it, beat it, give it back.  In Spindex, you can play games you already played for that character in kind of a practice mode, where the difficulty changes after every game and the speed increases too.You can clear it if you get to a certain number and like all WarioWare games, if you clear all the games you'll get something special.  But I've never done that in any WarioWare game.  When you tilt the GBA, the game will rumble kind of like a Gamecube controller.  But this takes battery power so I just turned it off in options.  This game wouldn't be that great wiithout souvenirs, you can unlock them after you beat a character.  There are 140 souvenirs you can collect, souvenirs are things that you can mess around with like piano lessons, certain high score games like air hockey and jumping over the fence with sheep, and other things like toys.I've only had this game about 4 days, and I'm still going to try and unlock everything.

{"product_name":"B0085L2T0A","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Certainly better than what we've getting for quite some time","reviewText":"WWE 13 is at the core much like its predecessor WWE 12 but it improves in that it kept the basic controls and other aspects and game modes/options but adds the entertaining attitude era factor and mode which elevates it. It's nice to be able to relieve one of the greatest era of the WWE with several memorable superstars. I know that some fans who have shied away from past titles will pick this one up specifically due to the strong emphasis on the attitude era. I can't blame them, the attitude era is perhaps my favorite and it has many of my favorite matches and moments in WWE history so of course I was looking forward to see what THQ would bring to the table this year. For the past few years these WWE video games have been little more than yearly roster updates with added or removed contents as the years went by, 13 offers something else and is worth taking a look at.I found the addition of the attitude mode rather challenging and welcomed the challenge. Certainly more difficult than previous titles'storylines. This time around you play historic matches from the era and there's a list of accomplishments you have to achieve during a match in order to continue and unlock wrestlers and arenas. You think it'd be easy but it can be particularly tricky if you want to do all the achievements (the tag team fight against the Road Warriors is tricky but its part of the fun... or frustration I suppose). It's all continuous as you go from one storyline to another and there's animated sequences as well complete with vintage footage and introductions. Fans of wrestling from the mid 90's to early 00's are in for a treat and a great experience. As for other modes it's what we're used to: you have your exhibitions will all the matches types, the WWE Universe where you schedule matches and foresee the WWE as you please (for me it's what adds replayability, and this time around you have those great attitude superstars which makes it even better), online mode of course and Create a wrestler.The roster just about includes who you'd expect to be there in terms of the attitude era, Stone Cold, The Rock, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, even the different Mick Foleys, but there are surprises and it's great to be able to play as those legends and make those iconic matches come alive yourself. I was surprised at some of the wrestlers you could unlock. There's also the current roster superstars and the divas more or less all of whom you'd expect is there which makes for a better roster than WWE 12 or any WWE title in quite some time at least.In terms of controls, THQ kept most of it from last year and there is only one really noticeable change. The reversals are now harder to execute so the player has to be more precise (and luck might play a part as well) if not you get a \"too early\" or \"too late\" script and you know you're getting whooped. Otherwise the controls worked fine last year and there seemed to be no reason to adjust much.The graphics seem a little more cartoonish this year compared to the realism of last year, slightly but it's noticeable I thought they were better in previous titles (and it's obvious if you compare with last year's) and I don't know what happened here. They're good but much more cartoony. The wrestlers appearance, the entrances, the rings, the old logos etc. have all been replicatedvery faithfully and beautifully I may add. In fact it's hilarious, because during one the animated sequences they talk about the WWE when it was the WWF and they say \"WWF\" but due those legal issues it's censored. At first I thought this was some odd in game bug. As for bugs, unfortunately I can say that they do happen. They happened in '12 and they're in '13. So far they seem less present in this year's title and usually they're not big issues, just annoyances really. They happen but it's not really often but usually it occurs during special matches like a Hell In A Cell or Elimination Chamber. It's annoying but it doesn't happen as often as some would have you believe and so far they've never had any impact on a match's outcome in my experience. I just thought that issue should be addressed. It's really too bad that at this point and time THQ still has those bugs and glitches in their games, when you buy a game at full 60$ price it doesn't feel professional for a video game company.Is WWE 13 a perfect wrestling game? Of course not. However it's an improvement over the past few years and it's my personal favorite and the one I found most enjoyable since Smackdown Vs. Raw 2006 more than six years ago now and even further, some of the earlier PS2 titles like Here Comes the Pain. The attitude era focused gameplay is at the core of the experience. If you're a fan of the attitude years I honestly think you'll get a lot of enjoyment from this, if not well you still have the current superstars and the WWE manager mode so you can do as you please. With THQ it's sometimes hard to like what they do but this year they delivered a very solid WWE title that I will be playing for some time (not that I hated '12), it'll be interesting to see if they can top it. 4/5 stars I'd recommend this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

I also have the Logitech G11 gaming keyboard which I was using prior to this one. First of all, if you don't need a gaming keyboard, don't buy one. I noticed a few reviews that actually seemed to view this keyboard negatively for having lots of keys they won't use. Doesn't make sense, does it? If you are not a gamer or the idea of macro recording and extra keys doesn't entice you, this is a rather expensive keyboard. You would be much better off getting a wireless Logitech desktop for your non-gaming needs.Now, if you ARE a gamer, welcome to heaven!! I absolutely love the softness of the keys on this keyboard. They are quiet and very responsive. The keys are silky smooth and it's just a joy to use. It has taken a bit to get used to the extra keys along the left side as they are so close to the rest of the keys and when not looking, it can be slightly annoying to find where you are on the keyboard. I'm sure this will disappear in a few more days of use though. All of the features on this keyboard are absolutely wonderful and I'm so glad they chose to go with the minimum features needed to enhance your game play and not clutter up the keyboard with a bunch of stuff you do not need.The macro keys are awesome. Very easy to use and making new macros on the fly is quick and simple. The windows lock key is invaluable. Why has no one thought of this before?! I can't tell you how many times I've been in a heated PvP battle and accidentally hit my windows key. You know the rest. The headset and microphone mute buttons are also ingenious. Not everyone has a quality headset or microphone with a built in mute button, so this is priceless for those people and also more convenient for me to push one of these buttons rather than reach up to my head to mute the mic there. The back light turns on and off with a simple tap on the button. No need to open up a configuration program to turn it on and off. Nice. The back light is just the right intensity and the ability to change the colors (pink!) is very cool. The media player buttons are pretty standard on keyboards today, but I do love how they confined them to a small space on the right side of the keyboard so they aren't dominating my play area on the keyboard like others I have had. The volume wheel is also the best I have ever seen on a keyboard of any kind. I don't particularly like the volume dials that \"click\" with every movement because volume control can lack a lot of precision at times. One click can take you from too loud to so quiet you can barely hear it. This volume wheel is very smooth with no clicking and works like a dream. The mute button is also right beside it so you can quickly push it if you are like me and have to keep an ear out for a baby monitor in the evenings. Last but certainly not least, the USB 2.0 and headphone/microphone jacks are absolutely wonderful! I could never go back to a keyboard without at least one USB 2.0 port having so many gaming peripherals and electronic gadgets. My only gripe is that I wish they had kept the two USB 2.0 ports of the G11. All our headsets are USB anyway but we do have one headset that can be either.I have to take the time to refute a few of the claims here on the other reviews as I don't believe this keyboard deserves the 3.5 stars it currently has here on Amazon. Some of the negative reviews are what made me skip over the G110 and try the G11 first. I honestly wish I had waited for this keyboard because it is superior in many ways. One reviewer states this keyboard feels cheap because it's lightweight. This keyboard absolutely does NOT feel cheap. Everything about it boasts quality. Just because it is lightweight does not mean it is garbage. I appreciate the fact that it's lightweight, as I'm sure many others do as well. It was also stated that this keyboard is unattractive. I can only assume this person was comparing photos and not actual products side by side because there is nothing unattractive about this keyboard, but it is a matter of opinion I suppose. Another reviewer compared it to the \"beautiful SideWinder X6\" which to me looks almost identical but with extra bulky buttons along the top side. And how much does it really matter when you don't usually look down at your hands while gaming, typing or anything else. I did at first think my G11 was more attractive than that G110 until I had them both in my lap. The layout of the G11 is meant to be pleasing to the eye with the mix of silver and black and the fancy handles?? on the top. But when you have them side by side and you see how enormous the G11 is beside this little beauty, it's easy to see why I favor the G110. The G11 has extra macro keys, true, but between the normal in game hot keys and my Razer Naga mouse with 12-key thumb pad, I don't need 54 potential macro keys. 36 suits me just fine.It was also stated in a previous review that the back light is uneven or that you have to be looking straight down at the keyboard to even see it. This is just flat out untrue. Unless this person received a defective product, there is no way this is true. The lighting on my keyboard is just right. Bright enough to be clearly visible during daylight (which another reviewer stated was impossible) and dim enough that it isn't harsh on your eyes in the dark. The lighting is also perfectly even across all keys.Another issue pointed out by other reviewers is the supposed lack of height from the feet on the back of the keyboard. The height on this keyboard is exactly the same as my other two Logitech keyboards AND my husband's Microsoft keyboard. The perfect height for comfort and the removable wrist support is actually very functional on this keyboard. Normally I remove them because they are simply too low and do nothing to actually support my wrists. This keyboard sports the first wrist support that actually comes straight out from the keyboard and actually *gasp* supports my wrists. It's very comfortable and wonderful during long gaming sessions.Overall, if you are looking for a quality gaming keyboard with lots of customizable keys and you aren't swayed by the largely unnecessary LCD screen of the G19 series, you really can't go wrong with the G110. Ignore the naysayers, you will absolutely love it. A great buy for the serious gamer who wants functionality and not flash.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2009"}

Melvin","summary":"Elder Scroll DNA crossbred with MMO aspects","reviewText":"Note: my review is not based on the final release version, which became available on 4/4/14, but on the hours spent over numerous phases of the beta period.First, allow me to say I am biased to any game with the Elder Scrolls moniker. Since my first game (Daggerfall or Elder Scrolls 2), this series by Bethesda has kept me coming back for more - so much so that I just purchased the Anthology and can't wait for that to arrive.That being said, when I received an invite to participate in the beta for this game, I was stoked. First, I enjoy testing software and I love this game world - so win, win. I won't go into bugs, game aspects that were removed between beta phases, or anything along that line - as it isn't fair to Bethesda or the game. My review will focus instead on my experience in the world, as the developers envisioned it should be.My first question was - is this like the other Elder Scrolls games? Yes and no. The overall game world is there: races, monsters, gear, language, etc. This is, however, a game that has been subjected to MMO radiation and has mutated a bit. Do not go into this game thinking you'll be able to venture out and never come across another player after the same quest as you are - this is, after all, an online game designed to bring in the masses (hence the &#34;Online&#34; part of the game title).My second question was - is this like all the other MMOs out there that have tried to capture my attention, but have failed to develop a story and instead rely on repetitive actions (kill, deliver, travel, repeat) and promises of better loot to keep players paying and playing (long question, I know)? No. Thankfully, it is not like the other MMOs I have tried and left. Are there familiar aspects? Yep, monthly fees, loads of people, silly comments in chat, guilds, quests, PVE and PVP, etc. But, I have to give credit to the developers at Bethesda for developing the story - apparently first - and then building the world around it. Quests, while like other MMOs, have you running around the map, but they never feel repetitive. Also, the quest actually advance your character and the storyline, changing the world and interactions with NPCs along the way. Bravo Bethesda! Also, nothing seems to be too linear in this game - don't want to pursue a certain quest? No problem - skip it. Don't want to join a certain guild? Your choice.Then comes the overall game mechanics. Fighting is a bit twitch based. You will not simply be hitting keys (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, etc) to defeat enemies like in old MMOs. You will need to move, block, dodge, and use skills efficiently if you want to survive. And, unlike linear MMOs with set classes, there is none of that in this game. Sure, you pick a starting class, but that only sets your &#34;class skill tree&#34; - which is only a small subset of all the skills you can choose from. Crafting, guild, weapon, and armor skills abound. Your only headache will come from picking which skill to pick with your limited skill points. You can't be an expert in it all (unless you play forever), but you can be really good at almost anything you set your sights on. Fast travel requires unlocking certain &#34;shrines&#34;, but once unlocked, you can travel fast and easily almost anywhere on the map. Also, while dying has some negative effects, unlike some past MMOs that punished players for playing, this game avoids that - except for small damage to your armor, etc.Graphics are very pleasing to the eye, but not nearly as amazing as their stand alone games. That is likely to avoid taxing the servers and the game clients too much. I did play this on an older system, so my settings were not at max, but I've seen it on higher end systems and while still beautiful, it is no Skyrim. The voice acting and storyline also add to the overall play of the game. Yes, there is a monthly fee currently (~$15 per month), but that goes towards maintaining the servers and hopefully patches and future releases (yet to be seen).As for the server - I have to say I was rather impressed with the PVP region of the game. The size and scope of the game and number of players able to storm a castle and defend their territory at one time is impressive. I'm not a big PVP player, but tested it for the beta and liked how it was implemented. It was fast paced and easy to get involved, regardless of your players level (minimum lvl 10 to get into PVP, but goes up to level 50). PVE is also very flushed out and while the entire world wasn't available during the beta, enough was tested to know that the story can only get more interesting. I never felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again - as each story developed along an arc - within each quest. An unique aspect in a game this large.Overall, I was not sold on Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) for the long term, but I look forward to seeing how it develops. I am not a huge fan of MMOs to begin with, but this one was far, far better than any other MMO I have tested - short of EVE Online, which I still consider my favorite MMO to date. If, however, you love MMOs and have played an Elder Scrolls game - give this one a shot. You'll be glad you did. Play solo, in a group of friends, or in a guild of hundreds of strangers all pursuing glory.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2014"}

Unless there's some major changes, I could never recommend anyone buy this and it's centered around two MAJOR issues that still haven't been addressed: cost and game library.The PSP's expensive ... really ... really ... expensive.1. You'll need between two-hundred (the core pack) to two hundred fifty dollars (the value pack) for the PSP itself. I'd recommend the core system. The only substantial difference between the two bundles is the value pack comes with a 32 MB memory card. Anyone who downloads mp3's will already know, a 32 MB card is small to the point of being virtually worthless.2. A decent capacity memory card is a must-have. Don't make the mistake of cheaping out and buying a small one, do it once and do it right. All those mp3's, pictures and game-saves add up fast and having them all saved across several smaller cards is a pain (not to mention easy to lose). Give yourself about a hundred bucks and get a big one. I'm thinking 1 Gig kinda big.3. To pick up a newer game and a movie you're going to have to punk-down another seventy to a hundred dollars.This is the point where I just talked myself out of the sale. I'm pushing about three hundred seventy dollars, and that's on the conservative side! I can get an X-Box 360 for that kind of money. I can get an awesome iPod for a hundred dollars less and have (potentially) 60 Gigs of space.It's a year later and the game selection, outside of MAYBE a half-dozen really great games, is awfully average. The UMD movie feature is nice, but the movies seem to average about TEN DOLLARS more in cost then their DVD counterparts, with half of the content (it's usually just the feature, no extras).As powerful as the system is, and as cool as it could be, it's just too expensive. Knock the price down a hundred bucks, and it immediately becomes a much better buy. At three-hundred fifty dollars, minimum, though, it's just too much to ask ...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2006"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Finally on the PS3","reviewText":"Being addicted to the PS2 installments of the Katamari franchise, saying it's good to see the series make its debut on the PS3 is a wonderful thing indeed.  With Katamari Forever, we are treated to the best looking game in the franchise thus far, and it packs in all the insane fun, catchy music, and trippy comedic moments that one would come to expect by now.  With that being said, let it be known that what is also featured in Katamari Forever is pretty much almost all recycled content that should be more than familiar to you as well.  The same problems that were feeatured in previous installments are also here as well, ranging from the occasionally problematic camera to limited multiplayer options, including no online play.  Still though, Katamari Forever is still loads upon loads of fun to play.  There's a good amount of unlockables, trophy support, and some spectacularly quirky humor thanks to the King and Roboking.  All in all, those who have played previous Katamari games know what to expect with Katamari Forever, and if you own a PS3 and have been yearning to do some rolling around, go right ahead and pick up Katamari Forever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"R. Nicholson","summary":"Doom 3... ties for runner up for FPS of the year","reviewText":"Having played and finished all three of the most system demanding FPSs of this year, that being Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Far Cry, I have to give FAR CRY my unequivocal vote for the best of the best award.Why this game over the rest you ask? Fair question, let me explain...There is one thing they all have in common and that's outstanding graphics: on that point there is no question. Where Far Cry has a slight advantage is in its enemy AI that makes it a challenge to play against and to defeat (maybe a little too hard towards the end, even on easy). However the one thing Far Cry has over the other two notable candidates is its nonlinear game play. You can, in this game get directly from point \"A\" to point \"B\" if you want to, but you may be able to accomplish the same task easier and at less risk by getting to point \"B\" by going to point \"C\" or point \"D\" first. There is just so much more choice and in turn just so much more fun. It simply has a replay value that the other don't have.That is not to say that Doom 3 and Half Life 2 aren't great games; they are and then some.The other thing besides the linear game play that took some of the edge off Doom 3 for me, was the relentless darkness and gloom. True, this initially added to the super scary atmosphere, but I found that this effect started to wear off about 1/3 of the way through.To some extent the same held true with Half Life 2. The facial features and lip sync were fabulously done. The air-propeller driven water buggy and the dune buggy episodes were really fun, but I found the long segments through bombed out apartment buildings and parking garages somewhat repetitive and tedious after a while.All in all a great year for the FPSs if you have the hardware and the system to play any of these three games as they should be seen. Far Cry just has that little bit extra that makes it my choice for game of the year..","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2004"}

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the  exploratory greatness that isSpyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks,  unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more  colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay  variety.Don't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals  and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and  a veneer of understated humor,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis highly addictive. The  playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly  levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming,  and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.Determined explorers are always rewarded--sometimes with an ice hockey match or other  sub-game, sometimes with riches enough to learn a new move or uncover a new area.  Simply put,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis one of the best action/adventure games for the  system. Despite the fact that this game is a sequel, it manages to bring a fresh new look  and feel to PlayStation gaming.--Jeff YoungPros:Massive, fun levels are completely navigableCute and quirky sense of humor will appeal to all agesResponsive controls are an extension of Spyro's upbeat and exacting personalityCons:Camera angles can be problematic, but are completely adjustable","reviewerName":"Mitch","summary":"A Great Classic","reviewText":"The original Spyro trilogy is by far the gaming mark on my childhood, and will always stay there.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Jean","summary":"Cool","reviewText":"This game is very cool.It has good graphics and you can play as alot of cool characters.Tip:Roy is very strong but not too fast if you are battling the Master Hand Showdown you can use Marth as a good option.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2005"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"One of the best games in years.","reviewText":"After playing the last of us and finishing it today its been on my mind for hours now. It had an emotional impact on me throughout the game which is a rare case for me in games. Although I did get all weepy eyed both times I played Journey. At times I was sad, others I felt tense, other times happy and other times were definitely \"Awwww s***!\" moments.The gameplay itself is fun. If you have ever played an Uncharted game then you will feel right at home although there is less combat and not jumping/swinging around. The stealth element is satisfying and needed since supplies are hard to come by which leads to a need to get up close and personal quietly in order to save on ammo. It also adds to the feel of trying to survive by scavenging since weapons and supplies aren't allover the place. Sometimes you'll be lucky to find one bullet in a 10 minute period and be grateful a guy you had to kill actually dropped a couple bullets. Having to create items and use them mid game forces you to constantly check your limited inventory and always trying to be prepared as well. You have to be careful in combat since taking time to bandage yourself while enemies are closing in because you went in guns blazing is not a good idea.The story is fairly clich&eacute; but not bad by any means. It has its own unique style and look and feel. It also has quite a few very unique moments as well. But clich&eacute; aside it is definitely more than capable of standing on its own two feet.But what really makes the game is the characters. The characters all feel like they are their individual personalities that seem lifelike. They also seem to convey real emotion at times.The sense of less is more really resonates in this game. From the often quiet and seldom used music in the game, lack of supplies, the way you can play for 20 minutes without seeing anyone or getting in combat, the emptiness of cities, and so on lend themselves to this great line they walked in making the game where there isn't much of what you would expect but all that does is add to the game.The ending (no spoilers) is one of the best I have seen in years. It didn't feel cheap, it didn't feel like they were done and just slapped an ending on it, it wasn't clich&eacute;d, or anything else. I felt satisfied with the ending, you could tell they put a lot of thought into it. And to me the ending of a game is the most important part, well unless youre just doing a shooter or arcade style game where its all about just playing the game. But games like this that have a real story and real characters rarely ever get a worth ending, and like I said that's the most important part of a character piece because the ending is the last thing you leave your audience with.I paid full price for this to get the survival edition and I did not feel cheated one single bit, it was worth every penny. This is a rare case of me encouraging people to buy this brand new because Naughty Dog deserves the money while most developers do not. I want to encourage them to create more great games like this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2013"}

The first Myst suffered from slideshow-like pacing, and the sequel (Riven) went overboard on the obscure puzzles. The developers definitely listened to feedback before going on to Exile, and it shows in just about any way you can imagine.The graphics are jaw-dropping. I have a GEforce 3 in my system, and the full 360-around-plus-up-and-down is quick, smooth, and stunning. The stained glass windows shine, the plants glisten, the water ripples with both reflections and submerged items visible. I had people watching over my shoulder in awe as I played, eager to see what else they managed to do with this game.Video is seamlessly integrated. I'm not just talking &quot;little-person-talking-in-box&quot;. I'm talking about being able to look around while a woman is talking to you, and having her visible out of the corner of your eye, merrily bouncing her baby. Things that seem part of the environment suddenly zoom up into the air. Just WAIT until you get to ride the sphere-roller-coaster. I replayed that one many times just to marvel at it.The music is stellar. The puzzles are much better balanced than in the previous versions - and there are enough hints and 'training' objects lying around that most of them should be pretty straightforward. In a few it's hard to figure out what the puzzle IS, so it takes some trial and error to figure out just what you're looking at before you can even start to figure out what you need to do. That's a gripe with just about every puzzle game on the market, though, so Myst does the best it can here.Is there a downside? Well, the game isn't entirely stable. I have a pretty good system here, fast and used often, and I did have the game crash on me. Save early, save often. The 360-view isn't exactly 'real world' - it's more like being inside a sphere that has something painted on it. Everything is always exactly in the same relationship to each other no matter how you turn. The graphics are so gorgeous, though, that it doesn't really seem to matter.Other than that, the game lets you work at your own pace, gives you challenges, gives you clues to those challenges, and provides incredible gameplay for people of all ages and abilities.

The Russians seize control of the colony with an army of Red Ruskie Robot Rascals and it is your job as Sam Gideon, a defense researcher, to gun them all down and 'vanquish' the enemy. Some plot twists come and go, but they are arbitrary. The game was designed by the team responsible for Resident Evil 4, and while you might recognize some similarities it is actually A HELLUVA LOT more like a cross between Space Marine and Turrican.The production design is gorgeous, if repetitive.

If you can find a new 80 at a decent price I would say that would be a good buy at the right price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

I just received & played it last night for 1 hour. (I had only intended to play for 15 min. but got involved in the game).  This morning & all day today, I've been pleasantly surprised at feeling like I actually worked out with weights for my arms. I didn't - I only did various boxing moves with 2 wii motion control remotes.  So far, I noticed there's jump roping(which I didn't do yet) & a lot of boxing.  I would consider this a low-impact workout for upper body & it's very good.  I love how fast-paced the exercises, training & games are: kept me from getting bored. I'm not really into boxing but this game has several short selections so I didn't have to commit to doing it long.  I just decided to since the incentive for doing so much last night was to \"earn gold\" to \"buy\" & change my virtual person's wardrobe. I also unlocked a couple games & another virtual trainer. There are a few non-vocal music selections & 3 backgrounds to choose from while working out, which is nice.  The graphics reminded me of Wii Fit Plus & the menus were easy to navigate (I haven't even read the little instruction booklet enclosed).  I will definitely exercise with this game once a week in my rotational stock of Wii exercise game routines that I do daily.  I do have to be careful with my lower back: achy from twisting & punching.  I've adjusted to punching facing the tv.  I still feel the effects in my arms the next day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Beautiful, engaging, but sometimes repetitive","reviewText":"The developers did a great job on this game.  The levels are beautiful, the level of detail is amazing, and there's plenty to look at without ever getting bored.  Nothing is overdone, and everything fits perfectly into the environment. The sounds are perfect, and the music, when it's there, almost fades into the background, it's so perfectly-selected for the environment.  Voice acting is superb.Game play is easy, there are no annoying controls and nothing complicated to remember.  Ultimately this is a RPG/shooter.  For the most part, you'll do more RPG than shooting.  The developers provided a wide variety of different ways to destroy enemies, and you're really left up to your creativity.  There are on-screen prompts that help guide you, but more experienced users can turn those prompts off.  The game is just challenging enough that you'll never get frustrated and you'll never seem stuck.  The maps can be a little confusing at times, but fortunately maps are provided -- I cannot imagine completing this game without them!The game suffers from a few flaws which appear in the level called \"Fort Frolic\". There are some frame-rate issues and jumpiness here, which seems to clear about 2 levels later.  Consult official forums for discussions, although there appears to be no solution for any problems.  Just be prepared for possible jerkiness mid-game and you'll be fine.The Xbox 360 achievements seem to be well-designed and thought-out.  If you blast through the game, you'll miss them.  If you take your time and see everything there is to see in the city of Rapture, you'll get most of the achievements on your first play, although it will take quite some time to complete.  However, this game is not meant to be played quickly.Replay value for me is mixed.  There is an \"evil\" track and a \"good\" track, which only determines which ending you will see.  You can experiment with different \"weapons\" and \"abilities\" (called plasmids and tonics), and make the game much harder for yourself depending upon what you do.  But I believe if you play the game thoroughly once, there is very little reason to play more than twice.  Online play is not valuable for me, and the lack of online play does not bother me.I judge a game by how deeply I am pulled into the game's world.  Bioshock has some scary moments -- when you least expect something to happen, something happens!  If you are playing this game and somebody walks into the room, you will probably jump, as I have.  For me, it means I'm totally engrossed in the environment, and that the developers have done an excellent job at creating an alternate world.  The visuals, characters, controls, sounds, and story are fantastic.  If it weren't for some glitchiness in the middle of the game, this would garner 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2007"}

This is NOT anything like the demo version packaged with the DVD SW Collection. That version seems to have been an old version going back several revisions; even the controls and weapons are different. It takes you into the battles featured in the films and you can play any character except Jedi Knight or Sith. You can pilot X-wing, Y-wing or drive AT-AT or scout walker. You can also ride a Tantam but you can't shoot while mounted. The game starts with the battle with about 200 per side. You can come back to the battle after you're killed as long as there is a Command Post and you still have troops. The problems are few but noticeable. The dogfights are clumsy at best and the controls for the aircraft are inverted and takes getting use too. The troops can be ordered to follow you or hold a postion but they may not do so even when they acknowledge your orders. I found myself assaulting an enemy position alone after telling a group of soldiers to follow me. I've been in battles down to just me On Cloud City with only 4 or 5 enemy left and the game ends not letting me as a sniper to pick off the remaining troops and win the game. Very annoying. The Endor scene features speeder bikes if you can find one. Some of the weapons are limited in destructive power and on occasion will overheat or run out of ammo. A head shot should kill an enemy but it must be the very top of the head between the eyes. Very realistic though and enjoyable. I finished the campaign mode and now just play the conquest mode. Still not a game for Star Wars fans to ignore and a lot of fun. Update: After playing for about a 100 hours this game plays unfairly and even \"cheats\" by slowly converting a captured flag to your colors; enemys appear out of nowhere after clearing a small room; tanks on one side and nothing to counter it on the other; effectiveness of weapons, ie. 6-8 rockets to destroy a tank or 6 shots to kill an enemy; limited weapons to counter shielded droids; troops on your side don't give cover for you during assaults and shows no difference in winning the battle letting captured flags fall in to enemy hands. I found a group of AI just standing there doing nothing in a full fire fight. If I leave the circle of influence even for a second, the flag completely resets back to the enemy colors, leaving me to start over. The circle can be very small in some areas especially in the Rebel Fortress on Yarvin. I had to stand on top of the flag to convert it. And finally, when you \"Respawn\", you always have your back towards the enemy. I got killed quite a few times just trying to turn around to face the enemy. Still a game to check out when the price goes down.To add to updates 6/12/05: Jedi can only be killed by pushing him into The Pit of Sarlec with you in a vehicle (Tatooine) or grenading him off a cliff or ledge in Bespin Rhen Var battle scenes. The Jedi will respawn. There are minor bugs in the game eg: Droideka spawning inside a mountain and firing at will in Geonosis with no way to get to him creating an infinite loop.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2004"}

Fallout 3 is a perfect mix of dystopian science fiction, role playing, and strategic pause and play combat.  You never have to pause, of course.  But if you are feeling lucky--or gruesome--and you just NEED to blow someone's leg off, take the shot.  Want to turn someone's head into blue cheese dressing?  Take the shot.  This game gives you the option to make combat as strategic or rushed as you want.  Targeting body parts is so much fun, it really makes game-play novel and FUN.  And . . . ADDICTIVE.The world is creepy and filled to the brim with capable enemies and monsters.  There are a lot of quests and characters and story-lines to enjoy.  Most importantly, your choices matter.  If you feel like genocide tonight, try to annihilate an entire town.  Feeling like a superhero?  Play by the rules and help everyone.  But if you kill too many innocents, watch out.  Bounty hunters and the law will want you.The weaponry is fantastic.  The customization and advancement is fantastically varied.  You never feel overburdened with choices or confused by options, but you will have a LOT of options to enjoy.  This way you build the character YOU want to play.Nothing in this game is restrictive or too linear.  No leading by the hand.  Just locate quests and follow your inclinations and have fun killing bad guys.  Or good ones.  :)Perfect game.  Perfect price.

I played this game for about an hour hating absolutely everything about it. This is not the Sonic of past, nor like the Sonic of newer games. This game has no real free play. You can't explore anything. All you do in this game is flip your wii remote aroud and Sonic moves forward. I mean this game reminded me of those God awful Sega CD games. Matter of fact it plays exactly like them almost. Games like this shouldn't even be allowed to be produced in this day in age. Pretty much that's it, all you do is go forward with very little say so in how the game is played. Almost reminds me of Sewer Shark for Sega CD. I was so furious after I purchased this game. After spending $50 dollars I hated it within the first hour. Eventually I sold it for maybe 30% of that. Probably the only game I've sold after I brought it.

The lighting, shadows, and the textures look fantastic. Obviously this is dependent on how powerful of a computer you have. I have read that this games is pretty demanding as far as the PC version is concerned. I was able to run the game on ultra, everything fully maxed with no less that 60fps. The story was actually pretty good, it was unique in some areas which to be honest, can be difficult to find in games. The gameplay was fun too, its a little bit different from many first person shooters because the game is focused primarily on stealth. You cant just run through your opponents blowing them away, you have to be cautious and stealthy for 90% of the game which is fun but can be tedious at times. I didn't run into hardly any problems. One that did give me a hard time was a helicopter that you HAVE to shoot down to continue on. It is a pretty common glitch on a mission after you blow up a battleship. The stupid helicopter just flies around way up where you can barely see it, literally in the stratosphere of the game. So if anyone runs into this, you can just shoot it down with a rocket launcher, its a little bit difficult but was a better option in my opinion than restarting that entire mission. That didn't ruin the game or anything, just a minor glitch.

A team of US scientists makes a frightening discovery on an island in the South China Sea. All contact with the team is lost when the North Korean Government quickly seals off the area. The United States responds by dispatching an elite team of Delta Force Operators to recon the situation. As tension rises between the two nations, a massive alien ship reveals itself in the middle of the island. The ship generates an immense force sphere that freezes a vast portion of the island and drastically alters the global weather system. Now the US and North Korea must join forces to battle the alien menace. With hope rapidly fading, you must fight epic battles through tropical jungle, frozen landscapes, and finally into the heart of the alien ship itself for the ultimate Zero G showdown.FEATURESA unique three-act structure forces the player to use real-time armor and weapons customization to adapt constantly to an ever-changing world.Encounter a frightening and totally original alien species&#151;they use their senses intelligently and work together to present the most challenging enemy yet in an FPS.Control of a variety of land, sea, and air vehicles including trucks, tanks, boats, and helicopters.Explore a living, dynamic world where earthquakes, breaking ice, landslides, and tornados pose an ever-present threat.32-player multiplayer with real-time armor and weapons customization, plus an all-new multiplayer mode that combines player modification and tactical objectives.Emergent gameplay means that in-game actions affect future outcomes and give each player a unique experience.Highly robust and easy-to-use mod toolset allows players to create their own expansive levels for both multiplayer and single-player modes.The CryENGINE 2 engine delivers the most realistic environments, spectacular special effects, physics game engine, lighting system, and enemy Al.","reviewerName":"Dagger One Bravo","summary":"Probably The Best Example....","reviewText":"of the fundamental difference between PC and console games/gaming. At least it used to be but now most PC games seem to be not much, if any better than the junk they shovel out for consoles.I had this a while back and had forgotten how good it was barring a few cheap shots by the developers. It downloaded fine and works fine on my Windows 7 64bit. Not sure why so many people are having problems with that but it starts and plays just fine for me. One thing I did notice and have read about in the forums before is that for some reason the fan on my graphics card doesn't turn up when it starts getting hot. Not sure why this is and I'm not alone with it either but turning it up manually before starting the game works okay.I actually like the alien twist to the story that shows up later. Don't mind the swarms too much either which is something that usually turns me completely off of any video game that uses them. I think it's an extremely cheap and overused method of adding content to a video game. I'll tell you one thing I absolutely hate in this game and that's the VTOL aircraft. The very first time you ever fly this thing you're immediately faced with a swarm of alien ships that you have to shoot down... as they are shooting at you. To me, this is pure stupidity but it's about the only significant shortcoming, in my opinion,  that the game has.There are some bugs but not many. Probably the worst is the occasional failure to load the next objective pointer or acknowledge on the list that you have completed the last one. It'll give you the objective and it's location on the map (usually) but no directional indicator and it won't fade out the objective you've just completed, making you think there is something left to do. Kinda confusing to explain it and it doesn't happen often, usually only after you've rescued the first hostage early in the game and then it'll quit. If it happens to you, you'll see what I mean but just ignore it and head sort of east southeast to a waterfall and continue on with the game. Once you reach the next objective area it'll go ahead and fix itself.So, the game is very good and eventhough it's a few years old now the graphics quality is probably the best available in any PC game to date and the overall quality - voice acting, physics, AI, etc. is all top shelf programming. You're going to need a fairly good system to run it though. You definitely don't need a custom gaming rig (haven't seen a game yet that made owning one worth the cost) but you can forget using a low end card and weak processor for anything but the worst, probably unplayable performance.Just don't forget about that GPU fan issue.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2012"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Justin &#34;Violent&#34; Lee","summary":"A true \"Mature\" game","reviewText":"Usually, the best games are those that meld gameplay and plot together. Catherine does not do that at all, yet strangely it's still a high-quality experience.The story segments tackle relationships and temptation in a way that no game I've ever played has. It's mature in that these are adult themes - and I'm not talking just nudity or swearing. The characters are really fleshed out, and the dialog is natural - especially if you're familiar with Japanese culture.Then the gameplay is a race to climb crumbling towers. It gets progressively harder with curveballs and obstacles thrown at you. Honestly, it was a little tough to wrap my mind around at times, and I did get frustrated. But the story elements kept me going, and it was never the controller-flinging kind of frustration.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2013"}

Granted, it's a port. I can't recommend this game for everyone; it's probably a hit-or-miss for most people. For example, while this game boasts the most amusing negotiation system of the other SMT games, demon collection and fusion and magnetite collection feels dissatisfying. I still haven't finished the game, being around 25 hours in, but it's a decent RPG upon which to spend your time, if you're looking for a retro, bizarre-ish adventure. As always, I would definitely check out gameplay videos on Youtube for this one, as there are several more fun titles on the 3DS to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2013"}

If you use the keyboard you will be frustrated to no end. I thought the graphics were above average,except for the cut scenes.  For some reason they were grainy. I've seen reviews where people complained about the visual quality of the game,but it's probably because they weren't able to run at a high resolution. The only thing I didn't really like was the aim and shoot method of firing a weapon.  You have to press a button to aim,then another button to shoot.  This is awkward and hard to do sometimes when you're fighting multiple enemies that are running toward you.  Other than that this is a game worth playing if you enjoy third person shooters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Great Star Wars game....","reviewText":"I was very excited about this game upon its release. It was the first Star Wars game of the new generation, and it was about time. This game had something over most of its predecessors. It had the goal of bridging the gap from Star Wars III to IV. This was exciting because as you were playing the game you had no idea what was going to happen. Unlike in other Star Wars games that followed the movies, they are more predictable. The main character is new and exciting, as he learns how to use his force powers. No game has ever given you the power of the Force like this title. There are a couple of problems with targeting enemies but that happens in every game. There are problems like having to load certain menus is annoying. The use of different costumes that you can change at any time along with upgrading your force powers and collecting different crystals for your light sabers is ingenious.  The game overall if you're a Star Wars fan is pretty awesome. There are great little details fans will love, like Jar Jar in carbonite. I've only played one of the add-ons in this edition. The temple was decent nothing to cheer about, but Tatoine and Hoth look epic.Presentation- The game looks pretty good. The music is of course awesome, and the sound effects also remain true to the saga. The loading problem of menus does provide some anger; just changing your color of light saber takes a while. 4/5Graphics- The graphics are pretty good. The environments are lush and lifelike, and the cut scenes are also well done. The enemies could be a little better but that's a small complaint. 4.5/5Game Play- The use of the Force is amazing. Electrocuting jawas has never been so satisfying. There are some issues with the targeting system, and some of the boss battles tend to get tedious. The different costumes and light saber crystals along with force upgrades is nice. The health system uses a bar, but every enemy you kill gives you health.  Overall a fun game to play, it plays pretty smooth. 4.3/5Story- The story of the game is pretty in depth for a Star Wars title. There are two endings so you have to play through the game twice. One follows Star Wars cannon the other ignores it completely. Overall this is a great story that really makes you invest in this character and his journey. Which ever side he chooses? 4.5/5Lasting Appeal- You have to beat it twice to see both endings. Also there are special costumes, and light saber crystals to find. Overall a 14 hour campaign if you beat it twice. The add-ons may add another three hours. I don't see myself picking it up any time soon.  3.5/5Overall 4.2/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

Angry at her fate, Hel has raised an army of resurrected Viking warriors to wipe out all of humanity in the mortal realm of Midgard, as she seeks to bring about Ragnarok -- the apocalyptic battle that that will destroy Asgard and the Gods themselves. The task of stopping Hel and defending the future of mankind falls to Skarin, a promising but deeply flawed young warrior, ignorant of the true reason for his favor with the Gods...","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Wonderful time killer, average story","reviewText":"Viking follows the warrior Skarinn, a Viking with epileptic seizures who has been selected as the champion of Freya against the forces of Hel, Lokis daughter, who has raised an undead army to conquer Midgard.Viking is as straightforward a beat-em-up as you can find. The game plays like a drawn out guerilla campaign. Raise your forces, find them supplies and reinforcements, and assualt various positions held by the unded Legion. These missions are fairly straightforward and have little in the way of variety, thoguh finding the proper path forward can be a trial at times.The graphics give this game its best punch. The combat plays in slow motion at times, during fatalities and other gruesome swordplay, which'll slake any devotee of the Blood-and-guts god. The enemies and other Vikings are rather cookie cutter, but the action is fast paced enough you'll barely notice. The atmosphere is also well handled, and though there are some nasty glare moments, the effect serves to highlight the difference in sides. Hels controlled areas are dark and foreboding, with rolling stormclouds and dreary, depressing showers, whereas Freyas land is bright and cheery, with butterflies and birdsong.Gameplay is simple and straightforward. You buy higher level abilities, but otherwise the game follows a rather predictable pattern: get overwhelmed and you're hosed. Magic makes a useful appearance, and is a significant boon during the assualts that periodically happen throughout the game. In addition to setting your sword afire with a flame spell, you'll also grant the same effect to every Viking within reach, making it a very worthwhile strategic spell.The story is passable, but nearly glossed over in gameplay. While the story and dialouge between Hel and Freya is a nice counterpoint, you'll want to get to the next fight so badly you won't really care what they're saying. The visions that Skarin has throughout the game are a better story element, as well as the beautiful cel shaded storybook scenes between levels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2008"}

All the hardcore fans were so (angry) about the story and ending of Soul Reaver, CD apparently over compensated and put nothing but plot in the sequel. Tons and tons of elegant cutscenes and story elements are brought out through amazing voice talent, and each one reveals something cool about the series history. Everything in between, however, just felt like filler made of essentially the same (bad) combat as the first game. I thought we weren't going to be able to just jump over bad guys anymore. Seemed to work 80 percent of the time for me... You've got no incentive to fight unless you're severely wounded and need to regain energy by feeding, so why bother? Instead, you will spend countless hour's just running from place to place trying to spot the one ledge or cavern that will allow you access to the next area. The only thing that will motivate you to send Raziel loping across Nosgoth is seeing this epic tale come to some kind of conclusion. The first game's tedious block puzzles have been mercifully replaced by more creative mind benders, which helps to offset the uninspired combat. The final battle is the only one that could even be consiedered a boss fight. Though, and Raziel is invincible throughout the whole thing, which would be cool if i was a dangerously uncoordinated 4 year old.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}
