{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"Eric L. Willard","summary":"Not as bad as I thought","reviewText":"I actually give it 3-4 stars overall. I can't change the stars in edit mode.I bought this based off the reviews on Amazon. The reviews seem to be fluffed up and I don't know why.At first, it defaulted to a diablo/neverwinter style point-and-click to move and attack style game. This is why I originally wrote a bad review.  I found that this game has 3 view modes that you can use to play. Far away, mid-range and over the shoulder. (there are technical names but lets keep it simple) I highly recommend OTS mode. It's practically firstperson and there's far less lag and buggy movement. You'll still have some frustration with having to run exactly through the door or you sort of collide with the door frame or going up steps should be way smoother but it slows you down if you come near an edge. Even though you can't fall, it stops your character like you got caught on something or walked into a phantom wall.In OTS mode, I hoped for better hair on our hero but it's a little too stiff for my taste. Although the detail in your characters gear and weapons are pretty good, it's obvious they had to make cuts somewhere.Combat - not that bad. You have chain attacks that allow you fair time to click when your sword icon is on fire. It doesn't flash on and off so fast that you can't possibly make a chain like the arrows in Jericho or the quick keys in RE4. If you click at the right time, you chain your attacks for more damage. You are forced to evade and time your strikes because if the enemy strikes first, it stops your attack. It makes you plan your attack and this is good.Minigames are pretty simple. Not too elaborate and quick. Dice, drinking games and one more that slips my mind.The voice acting is bland but not enough to lower my score. There isn't much emotion in the characters voices. (please learn from NOLF and NOLF2) haMagic is a simple right click and hotkeyed to your 1-5 keys. I liked that as well. hotpick a magic and fry one guy then change to force/wind and knock another off his feet. And there are final strikes too if you time it right to include decapitation. Bonus points!Items can be stacked such as potions that are shown on your crest in the top left of the screen so if a potion wears off, you can tell. Food seemed pointless since it only allowed you to gain a sliver of health.I'm not sure if it's worth $50 but maybe $40.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"al","summary":"genuine system","reviewText":"this is really the last system that Nintendo made great after that the systems went down hill.  the wii is terrible not the best graphics and the games are just so stupid.  the game cube also the same thing as the wii.  the 64 is the last true Nintendo system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Swilli \"Swilli\"","summary":"have to agree","reviewText":"i played the demo. i have to agree. it is a very fun game. it is no halo 3 its why i gave it 4 stars but it is fun","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"B.

LOTR fans and casual gamers will love this gamer. I especially liked the heroes in the game - they are powerful, but not absurdly so, and are varied, both between and within factions (Mordor notwithstanding, but it makes up for that with flying heroes in the Nazgul).For those of us who like strategy games, however, BFME is a bit lacking. My single biggest complaint is the default population limit - it's minuscule, made only worse when you remember the grand scheme of the battles in the LOTR movies. Forget having a 50,000-strong army march on Minas Tirith - good luck with your 200, if you can get it up that high by the end of the game. For most of the game you'll be fighting with between 40 and 80 men divvied up among 4-8 units, not counting heroes, the number of which depend on your faction.Another big complaint of mine is that you can only build on designated spots on the map, and even then you can only build designated buildings on those spots. So forget placing a tower or a wall in that narrow path that leads behind your base - if you really want to watch it put one of your units there. Too bad you are already short on units anyway.While the battles that simulate what happened in the movies are pretty fun, the others are lacking, invariably being a \"destroy the opposing team\" primary objective with a secondary objective that is something laughable like \"place an (x) unit in (y) formation\" (which requires one click of the mouse) or \"level up (x number of) (insert type here) units\" (the latter is especially frustrating if you don't have enough of the required unit because, surprise, you reached the population limit. The ones that DO have actual secondary objectives are usually next to impossible, mostly because they involve finding something  before the enemy does and, thanks to your population cap, the bad guys can attack you off the bat, defend their base AND scout the map while you're throwing everything you have into a quick defense of their onslaught.Speaking of campaign mode, I found the strategy map severely lacking in challenge. Once you conquer a territory it's yours forever. Inexplicably, some sections of the map are off-limits until you conquer a territory between the section where you are and where you want to be, but in other instances you can send an army across the map, crossing a dozen enemy-held territories, to attack a territory on, literally, the other end of the world.My last complaint is the AI. It's decent, but I've lost count how many times a unit was being attacked and just stood there. Usually, this has to do with a melee unit being attacked by an archer, but even archers won't return fire if it requires them to move so much as an inch. Just to see what would happen, I sat 80 crossbowmen and waited for a group of 5 longbowmen to come along. Sure enough, without my command to attack all 80 just sat there as the 5 level one archers killed every one of them over the course of more than 5 minutes.BFME is fun, don't get me wrong. I've played it through quite a few times. But I would have loved to see it get a little more depth to it in the hard difficulty. The frustrations, however, are not major but are many, and keep this from being the great game it very easily could have been.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Going Above the Call of Duty?","reviewText":"Call of Duty: World at War is a first-person shooter taking place in the WWII setting once more. I've written many long game reviews in the past few weeks, many great games are sprouting their heads. Long awaited and overall great titles have not only sprinkled the holiday season, but draped it. With power house titles left and right, one must really conserve and pick the best. So I'll keep the details simple, and hopefully you can decide by this.Fan of \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\"? If so you'll be in for a warm welcome, this game uses the same interface and multiplayer setup.  Expect a pretty good frame rate, and a devastatingly hard campaign mode (for players on the 'Veteran' setting that is). In this title you'll fight as both the Americans and the Russians. Take on admirable Japanese soldiers, or destructive German Nazi troops.Campaign features two fronts, and a few interesting non-typical levels (a rail based flying level, and a tank powerhouse level). From islands soaked in sun, to rainy city streets you'll be fighting in a all out war. Additional features included are the ability to use bayonets on rifles, and the all new powerful scorching flame thrower. Bayonets play out basically the same as your standard melee (knife), and the flame thrower can burn up terrain with a decent range. You'll become acquainted with the staple World War 2 guns once more (M1 Garand, Thompson, PPSH, MP40, Nimbu, Type 100, MG42, BAR, Browning).Online seekers will find some perks added and some changes in names. Rest assure it's still the same frantic multiplayer combat, but with some more open ended maps. For players not familiar with 'perks', these are implementations to ones character that give additional abilities (and are allowed up to three, ranging in different classes). Dropping grenades upon death, carrying two primary weapons, and having more health, just to name a few. One can pit themselves against a myriad of players and game types to achieve higher ranking, and more weaponry at their disposal. Maps are based off the campaign, and are pretty open ended, but maybe a bit too confusing at times. Tanks have now returned, similar to CoD 3's tank, except it is a little bit harder to defeat. If you've maxed out your rank and feel their is nothing left to do, enter 'Prestige Mode'. Removing all weapons gained along with perks, and beginning a new with a higher rank symbol. Challenges will be depleted too. Multiplayer has now added dogs in place of helicopters at the seven kill mark. Players can obtain special help after benching the three, five, and seven kill mark without dying. One may find the rigors of battling pros to be frustrating, hop into 'Boot Camp' to readily play other beginners. Keep in mind vet players, some perks (cough Juggernaut cough) are just as annoying as ever.Also available to the multiplayer experience is co-op campaign, and the addicting zombie mode. Co-op campaign is great fun, but be warned achievement junkies, some achieves are nullified in this mode. Zombie mode brings you into less a horror and more a adrenaline rushing doomsday. Up to four players can join and unite themselves in defeating zombies in a worn down base. A currency is used to buy weaponry, and enable usage of other locations in the base. More opened up areas though more zombie accessibility. These staggering zombified Nazis strike in waves. Making things even more difficult and tense is their ability to break in to your base! After each wave players can book it to the nearest entrance/window and board them up for currency and brief security. Once all players have died the game ends and tallies up scores, players can revive fallen team mates though before calling it quits. To say the least, this is one of the funnest options any Call of Duty or game has ever included. It's also one of the reasons you have to complete the campaign, as it's only available after completion (oh boy!).So really World at War doesn't break any new territory like the previous title had done. Yet it glazes the plateau over with a few new features, and another reason to continue playing multiplayer day after day. You may of noticed a longer description dedicated to multiplayer segments. Essentially this game plays out well in solo go a bouts, but is destined to remain a multiplayer investment. If you are a single player person, hopefully a rental will suffice. In the mean time, thousands of players have made the move to this games online and are definitely enjoying it. So maybe it didn't go above the call of duty again, but it sure is a fun worthy purchase.EDIT: I just wanted to add that there are actually four perks available in multiplayer. The additional perk not available in Cod4 is a vehicular perk slot. Also now having logged in a hefty figure of hours, multiplayer overall still seems to be standing as enjoyable. Some glitches have been located, and people are exploiting them. Mainly a glitch that enables a player the ability to get underneath certain maps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

Not the best, but not the worst. Its a fun romp and at times makes you want to bang your head against a wall, for example:I'm in a boss battle right now, the walls I guess are glitching and not protecting me from attacks like they should. So I keep dying. This is actually the first time in the game I encountered this issue. Is what it is.Positives:The shotgun works really wellThe monster truck driving experience is spot on. (I had a blast during this part of the game, they nailed the experience so well as far as sound and controls...I'm blown away quite frankly.)They did fairly well with the adult themed content in the game, like making the female characters fairly attractiveYou actually have to think on how to solve some of the puzzlesThe forklift driving was funNegative:Hit detection, seemed like enemies just were not registering being shot. Another words, I'd shoot them in the head with a turret.. and it somehow didn't kill them.GraphicsControls seemed clunky sometimeLevel layout, I got lost and was wondering what to do a lot of the time when on footAmmo amount, ammo was lacking, I literally ran out in some key moments and this shouldn't happen...Characters are pretty shallow that you deal with for a game that took 10+ years. You'd think, that the story would have had so much more. But then again, I guess all the trouble the game went through from what I understand it sorta makes sense. Probably a lot of the reason it took so long was just legal crap.Mini games are lacking as in they don't work as smooth as they should.( Freaking air hockey almost made me fling my controller through my tv screen I got so frustrated from the controls being clunky.)Honestly the game doesn't really grow on you until a ways in. You'll start to have moments where you think to yourself \"Hey that was really fun\" They'll probably only be brief moments, but you will feel that way none the less for a little while.So rent it.. buy it, whatever. Its decent.P.s. If you hyped this game up reading all the details and looking at all the pictures, you'll probably have to mentally zero yourself before going into this game.

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Enjoy it as it is without the urge for comparison","reviewText":"So when a game does something \"original\" lightning rarely strikes twice. The sequel will not be able to be quite as awe inspiring as its' forebear on account our minds have been conditioned to know what to expect.Frankly Bio Shock 2 is \"more of the same\" in most regards though it does mix it up nicely. To me the story here is more personal. As the first Big Daddy \"Delta\" your little sister Eleanor is stolen to be made into an altruistic martyr by Sophia Lamb who was a person constantly in conflict with Andrew Ryan. Aka instead of seeing the evils of selfishness and capitalism you're having to deal with a mind bending psychologist and her cult of splicers called \"The Family\" who want to change the world by creating an ultimate saint with godly powers. Of course Eleanor is being forced into all this against her own will which is why she awakens you to help her.Later you bump into Sinclair, a greedy opportunist swindling his way into an unlikely partnership with you. However there is more to him than that and honestly it surprised me how much he changes throughout the game. For me this had the same impact as \"would you kindly\" though it was delivered from an entirely different angle. Aka Sinclair is not simply another Atlas so don't fret over it!Improvements are you have the awesome Big Daddy Drill and you can dual wield your weapons with your plasmids. In case this is your first deep sea dive into Rapture \"plasmids\" are genetic alterations that give you super powers. The essence of plasmids were harvested from sea slugs. Rapture's citizens indulged in these upgrades to make themselves \"perfect\" within their own delusional Utopia. However an addiction to \"Adam\" the very essence that allows people to use an ever increasing array of supernatural abilities caused fights to break out everywhere. In addition plasmid users became increasingly less human until they were nothing more than the violent splicers which you're forced to contend with throughout your journey.As if plasmids did not make you formable enough you can also upgrade fire arms, improve your drill, and hack both bots and gun turrets. Bioshock 2 is as simplistic or as strategic as you want it to be thus continues the spirit of its' predecessor.Personally I'm happy the \"hacking\" segments are easier this time around. There is no more making an elaborate pipe from point A to point B. Now all you have to do is tap a button when the giger needle going back and forth passes over the right colors.In the tradition of action and consequences you can save or murder the little sisters. The best addition is having a little sister on your shoulder sniff out Adam for you. As she kneels over a cadaver to gather the good stuff you must set up a protective parameter and defend her from impeding enemies. This added yet another tactical wrinkle to the game which I was appreciative of!To elaborate on the above you will of course get a different ending fringing upon whether or not you play through the game as a benign savior or a blood thirsty tyrant. More complexity comes into play on account choices made with a few other residents you meet along the way are taken into consideration. At least one encounter presents a difficult decision not so easily categorized as being right or wrong. I commend BS2 for making us contemplate our actions. Most FPSES do not bother to make their audience \"think\" which is a bar Bio Shock as a series has raised in a positive fashion.Plasmid variety is still decent. You can electrocute foes in water, freeze them, hypnotize them to open fire on each other, set them aflame, or toss grenades back at the baddies with telekinesis.  In addition my favorite new power is the \"cyclone trap\". When splicers run atop these marked areas they are thrown into the air and take damage when they fall. Only complaint I have is the \"Bee swarm plasmid\" from the previous BS is either absent or very hard to find. C'mon guys! That ability was priceless!Bottom lineBio Shock 2 does a lot right. It is a serviceable sequel and retains having a strong emotional story line. While it may not be better than Bioshock 1 in every way it does add a few new nuances to the gameplay. It is another under-water pulse pumping adventure you cannot put down until the credits roll!Overall for every fault Bioshock stumbled with it presented more improvements to overcompensate thus it still gets a perfect score out of me.Pros+ Ability to finally use the Big Daddy Drill.+ You can dual wield plasmids with other weapons.+Great plot so long as you don't try to instantly over analyze it with the expectation it should be exactly like the previous story line.+Some people have already complained BS 2 doesn't make you feel as if you're a Big Daddy. However even by the synopsis given you are the first one off the assembly line so of course you're not going to be quite as versatile as later models. Rest assured after you've spent time upgrading yourself accordingly you WILL achieve the satisfaction of being a mauling death machine!+ Good voice acting, ambient sounds, and nice music. The audio atmosphere is top notch as always.+New tactical element of defending the little sisters as they harvest Adam.+Big sisters are rightfully terrifying the first time you're forced to contend with them.+Nostalgic tributes to the first Bio shock including an animatronic Andrew Ryan in the Rapture museum.+Stakes seem more personal in BS 2 because you're trying to rescue someone you deeply care about whom communicates with you via telepathic visions through the whole game.+The good ending I got pleased me in every way.+Death match multi-player if you want it. (I'm not big on it though.)Cons-Remember those promised under water segments? Yeah, they're here but are little more than a linear path leading from one part of Rapture to the next.-The train doesn't allow you to go back to previous areas.-Not as many splicer boss encounters. Show downs such as the one with the homicidal plastic surgeon Dr. Steinmen and the nut job art appreciator gave the first Bio Shock a lot more personality._Graphics have not upped the ante but what was there was great eye candy to begin with anyway.-As with the first BS if you play this non stop you can beat it in a relatively short peroid of time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006FWTW","description":"Oh no! It looks like your granddad was right--things really were better in the old days. At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"slightly flawed, but still a great game","reviewText":"Count me as another person who grew up with the Super NES version back in the mid 90's.  I still consider Yoshi's Island one of the best games EVER made.  Not just by Nintendo either- I mean the greatest game ever made.  It's seriously in the top 3.  It was magical the first time I played Yoshi's Island, and it's never lost its magic since.  Truly a classic game in every sense (except maybe in the music department- that one doo wop or old fashioned stageshow theme that plays in the outside platform-dominated areas is quite annoying in my opinion).Why is Yoshi's Island so incredible you ask?  Because the gameplay involves shooting eggs using a target that moves up and down in order to get through the abundance of tough obstacles and tricky enemies.  Shooting eggs is both simple and rewarding.  It takes time to master some tricky ricochet shots that are required later on.  It's ridiculously fun.More importantly however, the challenge involved when attempting to collect 20 red coins, 5 white flowers and 30 stars per level is a LOT of fun.  I will never understand people who play this game simply to complete the levels and disregard collecting the coins, flowers and stars.  It goes against what the game encourages you to do, so if you play the game with the purpose of collecting those items and 100%-ing the stages, it makes Yoshi's Island significantly more fun than most platform games.  Collecting items actually serves an important purpose here.  You WANT to collect everything so you can get a perfect score on each and every level.Anyway, nobody has taken the time to detail what each of the six exclusive bonus levels are like, so I'll take the time right now to do that.Exercise In the Skies- The first half of this level is pretty much like Hit That Switch with the fast moving platforms and jumps but less strenuous (significantly less strenuous in fact) but the other two portions of the level prove to be quite the challenge.  The second part of the stage is quite tedious.  You have to use one of those blue round platforms and collect coins and flowers while it's spinning not just forward, but sometimes backwards and down.  This definitely adds more frustration to the overall trickiness of the level.  The third half of the stage is comparable to the first level in World 2 with the giant falling gray blocks that serve as temporary platforms for you to jump across.  Perhaps a better comparison is the final portion of a stage in World 5 (5-7) with the same kind of falling gray blocks.  This is MUCH harder though.  Fluttering constantly and treading carefully is your only way of suvival.  It's a decent level, but nothing earth-shattering or anything.  Plus it's way too short.  I think the challenge could have been toned down a tad.Mystery of the Castle- If this were a regular castle stage, I'd consider it above average.  It has that incomplete feeling to it, but that could be because everything you explore here has already been done in the Super NES version.  The first half is loaded with bats, jumping over spikes, baseball boys/spiked platform swapping (both green and red ones).  The second half of the castle produces mixed feelings since it's dominated with those wooden-type platforms with arrow signs on them.  I believe they appeared in at least one cave section in the normal stages (including Super NES version) but they're used more creatively here. This basically means throughout the second half of the castle you'll be spending most of your time shooting eggs at the arrows on these particular platforms in order to change the direction they travel, and avoiding floor/ceiling spikes as you ride on top of them.  Not a bad level and by the way this stage has a slight maze quality in a few sections, but not a bonus-quality level either.  Certainly not enough to consider buying for those that already own the Super NES version.  Also ugh- they put a tricky red coin, the LAST red coin of the stage in fact, right at the very end by way of a shy guy holding it for a few seconds before flying away.  Absolutely the dirtiness trick Nintendo could have pulled there!  It's definitely tricky getting obtaining the red coin.Items Are Fun-  Actually this level is not particularly fun.  It basically consists of two parts- an underground pipe maze section, and having to utilize doors a certain way to alter the appearance of the snow/ice environment above.  You'll constantly be returning to the same room in the beginning of the level hitting P switches, going through pipes, and figuring out a pretty boring maze.  The object (besides figuring out the maze) is a variety of issues.  Freezing enemies to advance to higher areas, and using flame watermelons in another area to melt the ice and reach higher, newer areas.  Dusty, breakable gray floors are occupied everywhere, and basically Items Are Fun is entirely puzzle-based without encountering many enemies or tricky obstacles.  Still, I like the stage but many people overrate it.  The snowball you push around in order to make bigger was done more creatively in the regular game along with the ski lift portion which feels underwhelming here.  I don't get the name of the level either- exactly WHAT items are supposed to be fun?  Flame and ice watermelons?  A level that obviously feels incomplete in both the excitement category and the way the maze is laid out.  It's not enough.Go! Go! Morphing- Look, I admit I love this game to pieces, but every game has a couple mistakes along the way.  This level is *awful* the entire way through.  Absolutely dreadful.  First of all the mole and the train transformations are without a doubt the worst ones in the game, but for some reason Nintendo included them in the most generic way (the train) or the most tedious way (*cough couch* mole *cough cough*) imaginable.  This is one very disappointing level.  I was expecting this to be the most exciting level in the game with each of the morph vehicles leading way to an even more exciting one.  That's not the case at all.  It simply recyles what we've already accomplished in other stages.  First of all, the level misses the mark because there's hardly any enemies whatsoever so it lacks excitement and replay value, but an even bigger problem is that none of the morphs are actually interesting.  It starts off with the submarine and a small maze, but you don't need the torpedoes for anything.  My least favorite morph while playing the regular levels has always been the train, and that one is unfortunately next.  It's boring.  Up and down the tracks speeding along collecting coins.  Terrible.  The mole is another morph I'm not particularly fond of (because it's somewhat hard to control- resulting in some unintentionally deaths off the side of the cliff in a couple instances) and it takes up WAY too much of the level.  My two favorite morphs are the helicopter and the car, but they aren't used in any creative way either.  The car is especially disappointing.  Instead of speeding along, you have to jump on rotating platforms.  Bad idea.  Easily my least favorite level of the 6 bonus levels.Fight Toadies With Toadies is by FAR my favorite of the bonus levels.  It features green bullet bills that you must bounce on top of in order to reach higher areas, shy guys on stilts and creatively using them to bypass rows of spikes, dizzy fuzzies and careful planning pertaining to platform jumps, and at the very end comes the most delightfully challenging part, a fast-moving auto scrolling section that forces you to move forward avoiding even more green bullet bills.  VERY hard final portion of the level.  I love this stage quite a bit.  It's exciting and challenging as well as charmingly atmospheric (especially in the cave section)- just how I like it.Endless World of Yoshis- Probably the second best of the exclusive levels featured in this version because of its lengthy exploration aspect for one thing, and the diversity is staggering.  Castles, fireballs, bullet bills, shy guys of many varities, lava pits, flower seeds creating vines, underground caves, boulder pushing, running around as tiny starman Mario, baseball boys with egg and watermelon seed puzzles, etc.  A LOT of creativity.  I really enjoy this one.  However it's very very disappointing that I'm only playing as ONE Yoshi the entire time.  I was under the assumption that I'd be playing as numerous different colored Yoshi's the entire level, but I'm only playing as the standard green one.  I don't get how the level got its name.  It's definitely an endless world of excitement and that's the important thing!  Also, this level features red biting bullet bills that sort of veer in Mario's direction when he gets close, and I don't remember seeing them in the regular game so that's worth seeing.Anyway, these bonus levels aren't really worth investigating an additional copy for even though Fight Toadies with Toadies and Endless World of Yoshi's are both incredibly awesome stages, unless you wanna play the game on the road.  I'd rather stick with the Super NES version myself.  That version doesn't have any filler levels like this one.Oh, and one more complaint with this game- why in the WORLD does Yoshi sound like a howling bloodhound whenever you hover in the air?  At least Mario's crying outburst sounds muffled and tame in comparison to the Super NES edition. That's probably the biggest bonus of all!  Actually he sounds crankier like he has a dirty diaper, but to a less annoying extent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Now THAT'S a Violent Video Game!","reviewText":"Seriously, someone call Hilary Clinton, we need to get this thing on lockdown!!Prototype (excuse me, [PROTOTYPE]) is a bit of a mixed bag that, for all its faults and foibles, works far more than it doesn't.  The end result is something that feels a bit unfinished, a bit unpolished, and more of a dry run (in the same way thatthe first Assassin's Creedturned out to be); almost as if the developers stopped and said \"That's all well and good, but... let's make sure it works before we spend TOO much time and money on it.\"  Which is an approach that's bound to create at least a few flaws: an open city that feels a bit sparse, flat, and untextured, enemies that feel repetitive, lightly varied side quests, unimaginative story and uninspired voice acting... you know, a small grocery list of things that just all feel unfinished or rough around the edges.Oh, and thank goodness someone finally had the guts to stand up, take a risk, and make a video game protagonist who's a twenty to thirty something thin, handsome, white, American male who's super smart and/or strong!  ...Look, I don't want to dwell on this and I know that's your target audience, but come on, seriously?  Would it have been a worse game about someone who can run up buildings and change their hands into blades if they'd messed with that formula even in the slightest?  Sigh...Anyway.It's strange I should be complaining about your main character since he is by far what works best in the game.  Alex Mercer IS the [PROTOTYPE] (a man with super powers from a super virus and super plot-convenient amnesia out for REVENGE... or something!) and his super human running, jumping, gliding, smashing, killing, throwing, and maiming is a blast.  It happens intuitively and with surprising ease.  I was nervous at first when I saw just how many different things Alex could do (mostly violent things) but the wheel that switches between powers, the hot keys, even the (touchy) targeting system were all pretty easy to grasp making for some smooth, effective slaughter. With a little practice you can become an extremely efficient fighter, able to dismantle some soldiers and tanks, cause some mayhem, escape around a few buildings and shapeshift to go back into hiding in a really fluid and enjoyable way.  There's enough variety in fighting styles and enough stealth options to keep things interesting for longer than if this were a simple button masher and the destruction you bring is incredibly satisfying.  There's also a really clever sort of \"bullet-time\" effect that happens when targeting or switching powers or charging attacks that slows things down enough to give you (the player) a few precious seconds to plan your next move.  It's incredibly clever and effective, if you can get the hang of it.I half-mentioned the under-budgeted feeling; the plus side of it is that the game feels very lean, trimmed of fat, and designed to JUST KEEP MOVING!  The mission objectives are simplistic and straight-forward, the events are chaotic and colorful and the enemies JUST KEEP COMING.  Alex is fluid, he's living mercury, can recover from just about anything and is at his best when on the go.  Hit and run, hit and run, run and run, just RUN!  The game world has been stripped of the unnecessary (it's almost entirely glitch-free) and left room for lots and lots of chaos to ensue.  And that chaos quickly becomes your best friend: pitting the army against the infected while the civilians get mashed in the middle gives you time to complete your objectives and then run and hide before getting overrun by your surprisingly determined and effective enemies.Oh, and about those civilians...I've gone on at length already, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the poor humans trapped in the middle.  The prototype world is an incredibly amoral world and your hero, Alex Mercer, is not a hero at all.  He's not even an anti-hero.  He's... just sort of a jerk.  And it's not just him: every character we meet is at least a little tainted and out for their own ends.  There are no 'morality' choices involved and no punishment at all for picking up a hapless civilian just walking down the street and ripping them to pieces.  Even Grand Theft Auto has police and the army to come around and make a token effort of trying to stop you.  Most games at least acknowledge that you're being bad when you're being bad.  Not so in Prototype - it's never even menteioned.  The city is little more than Alex's playground and the people in it are his toys.  And you WILL slaughter them, you can't avoid it; believe me, I tried.  You'll need to absorb them for energy, you can't always pick them out from the infected they're being attacked by, and they have a strange habit of running right in front of your tank while you're racing the clock.  The game makes it very clear that 'normal' people are of no concern to you, not even in the slightest. It's a really... interesting feeling and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying it.  Like, a lot.  But it's something to be mentioned.Like lambs to the slaughter, as they say...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime.

And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"I've bought this game...Twice","reviewText":"I'm a racing nut. I go back to Pole Position and Rad Racer, 100% completes on all 5 iterations of Gran Turismo, newer racers like Midnight Club, Need for Speed, Test Drive. GTA is not a racer. Grid was my pick in 2008 for racing games, and so far in 2009, there is nothing that has been even close to great.I bought Burnout for the Xbox 360 on release date and played it like crazy. The game is fast, hyperactive, online is seemless and it looks really good for the incredible sense of speed portrayed. The only knock I had was that it was 100% pure arcade. Like any arcade game, there is little to no depth. Add that to the racing genre where depth and is already sorely lacking and eventually it looses its shine. Without \"real world cars\" and no tuning or tweaking to speak of, \"Paradise\" got old and eventually got shelved.Fast forward almost two years. GT5 Prolouge is boring, I finished Grid a long time ago, the newest Need for Speed is garbage. There is NOTHING out for PS3 and really, nothing in the pipeline. So I grabbed an $18.00 copy of \"Paradise\" and paid another $13.00 for all of the available DLC. To my surprise, everyhting I loved about the game came flooding back. It is still an absolute blast to play. There is a strong online community, so jumping into races is simple and they are edge of your seat exciting.I looked at some of the newer reviews with pretty harsh critisicms. Keep in mind, it's a couple years old. At $18.00, Burnout is a great value.  the graphics are not as good GT5 or PGR or even Forza 2. The only thing you will be unlocking are fictional cars and that's about it. This was also a $60.00 game that was absolutely worth it when it was orginally released. If you are a fan of racing games and haven't played Burnout, at this value, it's a must buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2009"}

Very simple, combat is pretty bad , weapons generally act the same, extremely repetitive. Compared to demons souls or dark souls not only is combat not even close to as good, nor graphics or complexity nor replayability. Why am i giving this really repetitive old feeling game a decent rating of a 3. Well, it is nice to get away from games that are complex and take forethought. You pretty much just hack and slash.

Where do I even start the bashing on this polished turd. Lets start by saying most people loved the fist fable. Growing up in the academy, getting to choose a wife, finding cool new loot, becoming a hero!You can play this pile blindfolded. Everything about this game is broken or looking to squeeze as many dollars out if you as possible.Lets get the nice things out of the way because there's only a few.The game looks great and the areas like bowerstone market and lake to name just a few look awesome. They paid so much attention to detail in the look of the game which only enrages me more at how crappy the game really is. Next would be the story and how you become king. I'm not going to get into details but the story is the only thing that kept me from throwing the game at my Xbox.Onto the cons of this rancid toilet game. Combat, navigation, interface, npc interaction,  mini games, family bugs, multiplayer, dlc, no health bar, useless currency, 0 loot, painful side quests grrraaaahhhgg! My brain!Combat in this game is so broken. Not broken as in unplayable, but it just isn't balanced. Guns and magic work well....to well that if you want to use melee you're making the game hard for yourself. The melee system is so botched they you won't want to use it, then you whip out your gun or magic spell and destroy everyone with ease . Not like it matters anyway, it's easy to max out your level in everything just like in fable 2, that just hurts the replay value of the game.Navigation in the game is a pain, unless your on an active quest. You have a map for each area you can check.....or do you?  No!  It's some crappy generic map of the area made to resemble the area you're in! Why?! I'd rather they not have a map at all!  It's pointless!  At least when when get a quest you get that stupid \"bread crumb \" trail, but half the time it just glitches out.The interface......oh boy the interface.  Fable 3 has the worst interface menu system I've EVER seen....ever.  Instead of getting an inventory menu or statistics menu, you get teleported to your \"sanctuary\", where you have to inconveniently go into rooms such as armory, treasury, multiplayer etc. Sounds cool at first, but believe me it's a drag. The smallest tasks like giving a gift, changing clothes, dying a jacket is a major pain. I hate the sanctuary with every beat if my heart.The npc interaction are just stupid. Clucking like a chicken, farting on someone's face, and puppet shows??  It gets real old and pointless. I realize these we're in the first game but......come on!  At Least in those titles you could choose which stupid interaction you wanted, in fable 3, it's random! Wtf?!The mini games or side jobs are just timing games like guitar hero that you can level up in, but they're nothing but a stupid distraction from a horrible game in the first place.The bugs in game are kicks to the groan. Spend time finding a wife and a having a kid just to find out they glitch out and just stand around. You can't  play or interact with them. All you can do to fix this glitch is murder your wife and neglect the kid. Sounds fun ,right ?The multiplayer was a bit of an improvement over fable 2 only because you use your actual character and not some generic lackey. However the only point of having another player with you is to help in combat. I played for a while with my wife on her game and all I did was watch her fart on people's heads and help in combat and when she interacted with me, her character becomes gigantic!! My character looked dwarfed compared to her lol. It looked ridiculous. Why they made the host of the games character so huge baffles me. There's no point in multiplayer, they just don't have a place for another character in the game.The dlc might be the worst offender of all the cons. To get any good character customization you have to pay for dyes or clothes and there's still not much intresting customization options. Even weapons have to be bought, and there's hardly any weapons in the game at all. Oh, by the way, if you do want to play the multiplayer you better make sure both players have the exact same dlc down to a \"t\" or you can't play with each other. Why?!Why isn't there a health bar ? Moving alongMoney is useless. The only thing you use money for is buying up property (which is a boring chore , but you must buy everything if you want the best ending psshhhh)  there no armor shops or cool merchants I'm serious, it's a sad excuse for an rpg.One thing that really bugged me about some of the side quest are the ones where you have to apprehend a bandit. Once you find the bandit and arrest him....well....you think you'd slap hand kuffs on him , or tie him up and haul him back to jail, throw him in a carriage with bars. No! None of that cool stuff. Instead you hold his hand and run back to the quest giver......HOLD THE CONVICTS HAND?! what were they thinking??This game is a travesty. I can't believe big magazines gave it good reviews*cough!

Unless you are single player fan, I would pass on this.So what makes the SWB and the Battlefield series so special. They both have lots of features that the other FPS don't have. They both allow you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. In SWB, You can jump into AT-ST, AT-AT, X-wings, Tie fighters, speeder bikes, just to name a few. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in these games is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, and special troops (wookies, dark troopers, etc). In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger. SWB also has a pilot type which repairs vehicles over time while you pilot them instead of the engineer type in BF1942. However, in SWB you are unable to switch types during combat like you can in BF1942. I guess it would not have made sense  that you could go from a rebel soldier to a wookie. I don't know, I think they should at least allow you to take their weapons. Instead when a unit goes down now a package of ammo or health is dropped that you can pick up. This might be more useful, but I liked BF1942 system better. I would note that you can't play as Jedi Knights in this game; however, sometimes they will fight for you or against you. While this seems cool, it does unbalance gameplay.The graphics in SWB are decent, on par with BF1942 andStar Wars Republic Commando(SWRC). The forest of Endor had foliage similar to Battlefield Vietnam, but SWB had the Ewok tree platforms.  The weapons mostly seemed to be the same from army to army. However there were special units like the Droideka (Destroyer Droid) and Dark Troopers (have jet pack) that changes it up. I found flying in SWB immensely easier than BF1942. I didn't even bother with flying in BF1942, but in SWB jumped in the X-wing and Tie fighter mostly as close air support. The maps are small for aerial units so you'll find yourself doing lots of turns to stay in bounds.I felt the single player experience on SWB was better than BF1942. While the individual mission still are simply capture the base missions they don't have a storyline, there was actually effort put into making single player more interesting. SWB has two types of single player campaigns. The first type allows you to play through the Clone Wars (episodes 1-3) or the Galactic Civil War (episodes 4-6). These campaigns do not allow you to play both sides in each mission, however, they mix it up so you get to play some missions with each side. Basically you get to lead the forces that were victorious in the movies (no changing history here). There are some cut scenes from the movies between missions that put you in the mood to take on the enemy. In the Clone Wars (7 total missions), the first mission allows you to take it to the Gungans with the Trade Federation Droid Army. I'm not sure why it feels good to drop those long eared goofs, but it does. You then get to beat up the Naboo forces at Theed.  What I found interesting is that they developed the Gungan and Naboo forces just so you could fight them in the single player campaign. In later missions, you get to fight as the Republic Clone troopers. The Galactic Civil War Campaign (9 total missions) is a little more straight forward. At first you get to play as the Empire using your stormtrooper to eradicate the Rebel forces. But as fortunes swing, you then play as the Rebels, pushing back the Empire with the final victory at Endor. I'm sure it is debatable, but I thought the AI was better on SWB. Taking bases was a hard fight. You couldn't just sneak out capture a base. Also the friendly AI would not just leave bases undefended.The other single player type is Galactic Conquest where you go head to head with an opposing force in order to take over the galaxy. Basically you fight over control of planets and the planets provide special bonus during battles. The winner of each battle gets to decide which planet to attack. In this way, you can play most of the missions from either side with various armies. I liked the campaigns better because in Galactic Conquest you tend to play several of the battles over and over again. But it is still nice to try some missions from the other side.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Gorgeous 3D, but lacking in other areas ~","reviewText":"First of all, this game is fun.  Don't get me wrong!  But I can point exactly to a couple of major problems with the game that reduce the appeal in my estimation.  Mainly the lack of RPG elements gets in the way of an otherwise enjoyable experience.  Here is why:There are battle encounters.  But since the only real benefit to battles is acquiring coins, you really don't need to fight the baddies.  Add to this the fact that coins are mostly used to buy stickers to use in battle... see where this is going?  You might be thinking you need some stickers for the boss battles, but really you can find these stickers scattered around.  So really, one could spend the entire game avoiding battles for the most part.  I feel that if there was some sort of RPG style growth (as in the other Mario RPG / Paper Mario games) then this would have been more complete.  Perhaps some way to grow or power up stickers or attack.  Or add more pages that way?  I'm sure something could have been figured out.But regardless, the exploration factor is great.  Granted, there are some issues with the exploration, such as very easy puzzles that really don't add anything to replay.  But the environments are gorgeous in the very 'Mario' genre style.  Getting around is fun, and I actually found myself looking forward to seeing the next areas.  The world is divided into 1-1, 1-2, 2-1 and so on, but within these 'stages' there is free exploration.To sum it up, this is a mild puzzle / exploration game with a few light RPG elements.  You find or buy stickers which you use to attack enemies.  The battles can be interesting thanks to some clever designs (example - the pointy goombas cannot be stomped, so use hammer or fire flower or shell - or battles when one koopa troopa is in front of several goombas then you can stomp the troopa and kick its shell into the goombas).Really a fun game.  It lacks replay because once you figure it all out, playing through again becomes a chore of just completing the same puzzles over again.  But great for at least one play through.  Not a great successor to the Mario RPG franchise (Mario RPG -> Paper Mario).  But an interesting game nonetheless.Pros:+ Great 3D, gorgeous graphics+ Good soundtrack, catchy Mario style tunes+ Humor - it's as funny as the rest of the Mario RPG / Paper Mario games+ Lots of exploration and hidden areas+ Some fun classic Mario elements and designsCons:- Lacks RPG elements- Lacks depth and replay- Collecting stickers to use in battle becomes dull- Easy to avoid the majority of enemies with no penalty","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2013"}

THe enemies spawn in diffrent places every time... and sometimes pop in on top of you... or some stupid stuff like that. But the enemies are diverse and the combat is intense.The weapons are...

I assumed that this would work like an Expansion pack, sort of how Mass Effect 2 continues off of Mass Effect 1, but it doesn't. Sure, you can download a map for money and play as the old characters on one map, but that's not nearly what I expected.As of this review (December 4th 2011) the COld Stream DLC that was announced in 2010 has yet to come out, and there is no sign that it will. It promised the original maps and one new campaign. Well... I'm not waiting anymore. If I want the old maps then I will put in the old game.The old game is worth more to me, honestly. IT is more balanced, better planned, and completely fun. THis one is unbalanced, feels antiquated, and looks ugly. It's still fun, but only in a \"Well, that's neat\" Sort of fun.I'm playing Dead Island right now for my Zombie Kicks, and it's worth more to me because the zombies themselves are more substancial.

I am a PC person, and believe that the best play for an FPS, was on the PC.  Duel analog sticks are just clunky to control for the consoles.  Upon cracking this thing open, I found the controls to be way over sensitive.  I couldn't hold the crosshairs still.  In my mind I'm thinking, \"I knew this was gonna suck!\"  I finally thought of trying to turn down the sensitivity on the controllers.  After adjusting the Horz. and Vert. sensitivity in the COD3 options, I was on my way.  It was really alot of fun.  Moving around with the Nunchuck, and aiming with the remote was really easy to pick up.  The screenshots really don't do this game justice.  You just have to see it to appreciate it.  I kept hearing about how the Wii was inferior to the PS3 and 360.  I really don't see that much difference.  The smoke effects, and the lighting are probably better on the other consoles, but the core graphics are pretty close.  It certainly doesn't detract from your enjoyment of the game.

Platformers have always captured my imagination more than any other genre, and it's not as if the series' trademark funky guns/double jumping formula doesn't work. But with the first two Future games - Tools of Destruction and Quest for Booty - something felt off. They were well-made and came close to the idealized Pixar visual standard, but the action itself hadn't evolved much since the PS2 days. You can only strafe around so many aliens before you begin to long for something more. And with A Crack in Time, we finally got just enough new content to justify picking up the OmniWrench once again.However, this isn't immediately apparent when the game starts up. Despite amassing a half-dozen incredible arsenals over the years, Ratchet begins with yet another pea-shooter and bomb glove, while Clank has his own segments that seem far-removed from the rest of the adventure. The latter sections hint at some time-bending puzzles to come, but the extent of this new style doesn't become apparent until a few hours of play.The Future trilogy started out exploring Ratchet's lombax roots before separating the titular heroes in the second downloadable installment. A Crack in Time picks up with Clank defending a clock tied to the heart of the universe and Ratchet hot on his trail. Ratchet is aided by a fallen lombax hero, General Azimuth, who believes he can use this \"Great Clock\" to right the wrongs of the past. Once you get past some early tedium, this clock reveals itself to be one of the game's biggest innovations.Like indie gem Braid and the upcoming The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom, A Crack in Time allows Clank to record copies of himself. Early puzzles are pretty obvious; an early example might have Clank using a recording to hold down a switch so that he can pass through a door. But these segments later require a reliable thinking cap, as the number of switches and obstacles between Clank and the door increase dramatically. Though all of these rooms can be solved with a little patience and keen observation, it's impressive that Insomniac was able to integrate such intricate puzzles into a series known for shooting first and thinking about it never.Ratchet's segments, which make up the bulk of the game, have also been upgraded. While the planetside stuff is familiar - move from point A to point B while buying an upgrading weapons - the spaceship rides in between are no longer so linear. There are four or five different sectors to which you can warp, and each one has its own sidequests, hidden items and mini-levels that you can explore whenever you want. This galaxy isn't exactly a sandbox, but it's more open than any other R&C; games.And while the guns are pretty ordinary - even the belching monster gun, by series' standards - the new rocket boots allow you to speed through battles with newfound agility. Many planets have been designed as jet boot obstacle courses, and you have a level of control not seen during lame rail-grinds.By the end of the game, most of the minor blights associated with the series are erased. Even the storytelling improves. While I've recently said that Ratchet is to Dreamworks as Sly Cooper is to the more heartfelt Pixar, I found the lombax's loyalty to Clank to be endearing. Ditto for Azimuth; you see his arc coming a mile away, but his final sacrifice is still well-executed. Hell, series' ne'er-do-well Qwark even helps out for a change.Without spoiling anything, I can say that Future concludes on a high note, and I'm eager to see where Insomniac goes from here. This universe is far more colorful than the one established in Resistance, and the time-related tomfoolery could probably be expanded into its own game. With infinite stretches of space for a canvas, Insomniac could take Ratchet & Clank into any direction from here.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2010"}

Set in what appears to be an alternate reality of the 1860's/1890's, this is a world similar to that of Captain Nemo.  A world where great minds have run amok, whalers are using whale oil to power this new fangled thing called electricity, and poor are helpless to the rich.  Starting to sound familiar?The rich acting like mind numbed fools is something we see all too often in media today, and it's tiresome.  Instead of an intelligent comment on wealth, or poverty, you get a wildly unbelievable caricature of rich and poor people, that ultimately takes away from this world and greatly lessens the experience.That said, we play games because we can interact with a world, created.  The interaction with this imperfect world is fantastic.  The stealth mechanics are fundamentally sound, and make sneaking around the most fun, and best way, to play this game.  On the flip side, the systems in place to enhance your abilities are mostly geared towards combat.  In a game that seems to want to reward you for stealth and not killing, and punish you for killing, the upgrade system is strangely focused on combat/killing upgrades.  I really wanted to try out the combat upgrades, but I also felt compelled to play the game the \"right\" way.  This is a shame, and it's the main reason I can't give this game five stars.Positives:Best stealth game play this generation (that I've played)On the surface an interesting time period, and interesting environments to play with abilitiesInteresting upgrade abilities both in stealth and combatInteresting plot (somewhat ruined by the over the top caricatures of rich vs poor)Negatives:Same old boring, stupid caricature of rich and poor people (ie rich super evil and oblivious to their opulence, poor stupid and angry)Game punishes you for killing, but has AWESOME sounding upgrades for killing and much of the upgrade path is dominated by the killing treesTries to out Bioshock, Bioshock and doesn't get it rightOverall, if you have ANY interest in stealth games, you should play this game.

The goal is to come full circle, going from cellular life that erupted from a space meteor, to sentient beings returning to space in their own ships.  Although your opening view is of a galaxy, you then choose a planet to play with, and gameplay focuses on the planet's surface.  Your \"Galaxy\" lets you make many, many planets and play any one of them at any time.  It's also part of a larger \"universe\" online, as you and other players can share each other's creations and try them out on your own worlds.Life on your world goes through the following stages:  Cellular, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, and finally Space.  Along the way through each stage, you can choose how to upgrade your creature by \"calling a mate\":  the offspring are customized by you in the Creature Creator, and they become the creature you play.  As a very clever way of teaching you new features you may have acquired, you play games using your offspring and its mother as she shows you how to use your newfound skills.All of this is a tremendous amount of fun because a great deal of thought went into making Spore an open system:  your creature has some ingrained behavioral needs (feed, hunt, mate, explore), and other creatures have their own ideas as to what they need to be doing.  Just like you, they can choose whether to be aggressive or friendly, make friends or drive other species to extinction.  The cellular stage plays like an arcade-style game with RPG elements (you can uncover features that you then add to your creature).  Creature stage plays like a platformer, with you wandering the world exploring.  Tribal starts to resemble a Real-Time Strategy, and so on.That doesn't mean you need to be a veteran gamer to understand Spore:  as you go through the game, Spore is very good about teaching you what you need to know, and never gets so complicated that a child couldn't figure it out.  If you look online, you'll find a lot of fascinating information about how Spore was made, as well as players' videos of gameplay--Spore has integrated into the game the ability to upload your experiences straight to YouTube.Unfortunately, Spore has been hampered by some bad business decisions.  There's a lot of truth to the stories you're hearing about the copy protection making the game impossible to activate.  I went through many hours of grief and many generic, \"reinstall and write back\" e-mails from tech support before giving in, dialing phone support, and spending half an hour on hold.  It was worth it because the person on the other end was friendly, smart, and extremely helpful.  My EA account was perfectly valid, but there's a problem with EA's many sub-systems:  they simply don't keep themselves in sync, which I've noticed before with other EA titles.  They had to fix the account from their end.There is also truth to the fact that you are not actually buying this game:  you are buying the right to install and use it on one machine, a certain number of times, provided you properly activate it (using the aforementioned nightmare).  You are also agreeing that you can only reinstall it a small number of times (I think right now EA says it is 3) before it becomes useless.  Which explains why I didn't re-install the game like I was asked to.  After you go over the number of installs, you will have to convince EA to allow you to use the game again--provided they will still honor their agreement or have a way to activate it for you (or the original install is still compatible despite needing to be updated, which is a bigger problem than it may seem).  You should also know that the software may decide you just \"used an install\" if you make changes to your machine, such as upgrading a video card or adding some RAM.  You could easily install this game once and have EA expire your \"install limit\" in the background.You should also know that the game will not allow you to update it unless you install the EA Download Manager.  The Download Manager will run on your computer in the background unless you disable it, and it will re-enable itself whenever you run Spore.  I don't know what it does, given that most of the time I have to manually instruct it to update my games, but I do know that the updates will be concealed from you and you have to use an interface to run the update:  either in-game or via the download manager, depending on the title.Overall, Spore has a lot of clever programming, a great openness to it, and an enjoyable interface that makes the game fun for all ages.  Unfortunately, it is a throw of the dice as to whether or not getting it to work will be easy for you.  Plan ahead, and keep EA's phone number handy:  it's (866) 543-5435","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2009"}

What those people left out is that the game they're playing is fun, which makes them want to play it for 100 hours. Donkey Kong 64 has its moments, but I don't think it's fun enough to really finish 100%.. or at all. I played and loved all three Donkey Kong Country games back in the day, and I was pretty surprised that there was an N64 Donkey Kong title of which I'd never heard. But this isn't a Donkey Kong platformer: it's a mini-game marathon. It's like Mario Party, except not half as fun.Let's start with the monkeys, which are arguably the title's greatest fault. You never, or at least I never, really felt like you're in control of an agile primate. These Kongs move far too slowly. You \"run\" in much the same manner that N64 Link does (rolling). But Link moves way faster than these monkeys, and and you might find yourself screaming, \"Oh would you just get to the warp point already!\" Furthermore, the jumping ability of Kongs in 3D space seems to be less than polished. They won't get you killed, as this game is ridiculously easy (in terms of staying alive). However, they will annoy you as big Kremlins knock you off ledges because your monkeys can't move like monkeys. Now imagine bad controls coupled knocking you off ledges with being forced to barrel roll back at 50% OoT Link's rolling speed.All too often, Rare's solution to hiding 200 Golden Bananas throughout the game seems to be 'toss in a mini-game'. Some of them are fun, but these mini-games bring the term 'Wii Play' to mind, and that's a phrase I'm sure Cranky Kong wouldn't want to be associated with.They want you to play with each character once in every level. This wouldn't be a bad idea if the platforming controls were better and there were a decent number of enemies to fight (outside of those two or three bonus levels). But if you want to get everything, you need to barrel roll through each level five times, killing the one or two enemies that oppose you, and exploring for the spots where Rare wants to launch a mini-game. Two of the mini-games were the original 8-bit Donkey Kong and Jetpac. They're easily the best parts of this game.I got bored with it going through the water level with 80 or so Bananas. It's too long and it's not really that fun, but there is a lot of sort of ok content along the way. So, three stars, I guess.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}

But I must say, the story is quite inferior to the first one.  There is no great Revan scene that was such a great plot device. The bad guys are absurdly easy if you know how to upgrade your central character, only the last two fights come even close to being a challenge.The most annoying thing however is that you never find out much of the mystery build up into the game.  While the first one was ready to stand alone this one begs a sequel. I don't want to give away the VERY little you discover in this game (besides I think Amazon would censor it), but the vast majority of the questions are VERY lightly addressed.  Even worse is how after the final battle there is a dialog between you and the final enemy where you are TOLD what happens in the future.  They had to put that in because frankly the story amounted to nearly nothing, so adding a bit o future predictions in a dialog MAYBE there would be some closure.  Fact is that this is an add on to the previous one.  They use TWO worlds of the first one (and not Manaan, the most impressive one), the basic plotline is the same (find X in several planets then move to climax).The combats are just not challenging as long as your main character tags along, but there are times when you have to play alone with one character who is not a jedi and it just drives me nuts.  The bounty-hunter female NPC that joins your party drove me NUTS by being so weak and alone so often.  The characters also don't talk nearly as much among themselves, so you lack that party interaction.It could have worked, if only they had actually sat down and written a story before they started.

Nate doesn't look like he pumps iron, he won't win any sexiest man alive awards, and his unassuming ways make him enjoyable.  Of course you may recognize the name Drake for the famous explorer Sir Francis Drake.  Yes Nate is related to the famous explorer and now he is off to find the mysterious El Dorado(City of Gold).  To say the least the journey will be unforgettable to most.The story starts off more like a movie.  On this quest you are accompanied by an attractive documentarian Elena and of course your comrade Sullie.  What sets Uncharted apart from some many games is the cinematic approach is so seemless it makes it hard to seperate gameplay from movie watching.  As your journey progresses you begin to realize you have many enemies.  It seems Sullie doesn't live the cleanest life and borrowing money from a bad guy doesn't help.  So now the bad guys are out to collect the debt by finding El Dorado.  Although it becomes apparent that El Dorado is not a city of gold but a man of gold.Without getting too much into the story it will definately leave you filling your aderaline need.  The gameplay is incredible in this game.  The enemy A.I. starts off slow and quickly progresses as you get further into this game.  Enemies will actually out manuever you.  If you don't plan out your attacks well you will find yourself dead.  Although the battles are not the only thing you face in this game there are a number of puzzles that are not overlly difficult.  What I do enjoy about this game is that it has a hint option.  You can use it to help you in confusing spots.  Although if you are more hardcore you will probably leave this option off.  There are four difficulty levels and the toughest option is locked until you beat the game on hard.  What is a first for a PS3 game is the reward system that is being used.  There are 60 treasures that can be found througout your journey.  On top of that there are objectives that you can try to complete.  Some are simple like killing a certain amount of enemies with one of your weapons and others are more complex like getting a certain amount of stealth kills.The visuals in this game are stunning and some of the best I have ever seen.  What is good to watch is the incredible amount of detail put into everything.  The jungle environments are lush and beautiful and the water effects are some of the best ever.  Sometimes it is enjoyable just to stand and enjoy the beauty of the environment.  Tree branches sway, clouds move, and leaves fly all over the place.  This is as close to reality as I have seen.If you own a PS3 this game is a must buy.  To say the least it is one of the best games available on any console.  The storyline is enjoyable and reminiscent of many great adventure movies.  Uncharted sets a new bar on next gen games and hopefully others will follow with this excellent quality.  If you like action and adventure and don't mind being the star of a playable movie then Uncharted should be on your list.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}

Meanwhile, the reviewer is typically running  a three year old computer with parts that weren't very top-of-the line at the time (a Vodoo card? Give me a break. Spend the cash and buy a GeForce) I liken these reviewers to people who are complaining that their BetaMax player won't take DVD's.I have a laptop (a NEW laptop, just to repeat my point) with an 8mb video card, and this game plays fine.I like the lack of hotkeys and all that nonsense. If there's nothing else I hate more in a game, it's getting my butt kicked while I'm looking up stupid hotkeys.The creature AI is pretty much cause/effect, but if you think about it, that's the same way the real animals work. (After all, how smart do you expect a giant cow to be?) However, through cause/effect, the creature will eventually learn to/not do something.The graphics are very good, although not the best I've ever seen.

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"David Cage still doesn't know how to write","reviewText":"Beyond Two Souls is an interesting piece of software. It&#8217;s not really a game, and not really a movie, but attempts to use qualities of both mediums to tell an interesting, albeit flawed, story. It&#8217;s about a girl named Jodie who for mysterious reasons has been attached to an other-worldly entity since birth, and the people throughout her life who help her, use her, or guide her on her journey through life.Beyond&#8217;s greatest strength is its superb graphics. The level of detail and realism achieved in Beyond surpasses what I thought possible on the PlayStation 3, and is unquestionably the best looking game for the system. Animation (all motion-captured in a similar way to the movie &#8220;Avatar&#8221;) is top notch, and facial expressions invoke real emotion. Not since &#8220;L.A. Noire&#8221; has acting in a video game rivaled a live action motion picture. Lighting also plays an important part in setting the mood and atmosphere in the game, and the interplay of light and shadow are rendered so smoothly, you&#8217;ll swear this is a next-gen game. Even hair and clothes are physics-based and move in a (mostly) believable way. Character&#8217;s appearances change throughout the game, most notably Jodie&#8217;s. Everything from her height, her face, her clothes, her hair cut, and even her skin change from level to level. If she&#8217;s homeless, she&#8217;ll look dirty and pale, if she&#8217;s in the desert, her lips will be chapped, if she&#8217;s sleep deprived, she&#8217;ll have bags under her eyes. These little details go a long way to immersing you in the game world. What QuanticDream has achieved technically in Beyond is truly astonishing, and they must be commended for their outstanding work.Also of note are the great performances by the cast. Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe are riveting and believable, although the script sometimes asks them to say things so out of character it was jarring, but more on that later. The other actors also did well, and I found myself feeling real emotion toward the characters they played; some I loved and some I hated, but that was intentional. Whether a character was mean to me or nice, it had an emotional impact, and I found myself forming opinions about them and treated them in the game accordingly. &#8220;The Last of Us&#8221; is the only other game I can recall that had that sort of effect, and I genuinely cared about the characters.The audio is another strong facet of Beyond. The actors didn't just voice act in a sound booth, they acted with their full bodies like they would for a film, and that physicality comes through in the vocal performances, lending a consistency between audio and visuals that goes beyond just proper lip-sync. The sound effects also sound great, fitting well into the world of Beyond. Real life sounds like footsteps and glass shattering sound real, where fictional sounds like traveling through another dimension sound appropriate and don't feel out of place. It keeps the game grounded in reality, even when it stray far from it. The score is fantastic as well, and plays up the emotion of a scene in the same way a movie soundtrack would. The music was never absent or too low key when the scene called for it, but it never became overpowering and intrusive either.One memorable level where everything came together beautifully was a scene where Jodie has to search a laboratory that&#8217;s been put into a deep freeze. The combination of frost covered walls and hollow footsteps and shivering Jodie with pale lips and steam emanating from her breath all gave me a very real sense of what it&#8217;s like to be locked in a freezing room, and I could practically feel the cold as I played. I genuinely feared that Jodie would freeze to death, and it made me panic. That said, with state of the art visuals, outstanding audio, and emotional acting, it&#8217;s really a shame the gameplay and story don&#8217;t hold up to the same caliber.The story starts off strong, and for the first 4 hours I played, I was completely engaged. The character of Jodie is multi-layered and fascinating, and by allowing the player to make decisions at key moments in her life, it allowed me to add a personal layer to her character, imagining how Jodie would react to her situation based on how I saw her growing in my mind. The game slowly reveals more secrets about Jodie, who she is, where she came from, what she can do, and what her ambitions are. For those first 4 hours, everything made sense, everything fit together, and the pacing was excellent. The story doesn't move linearly, but rather jumps back and forth to key moments in Jodie&#8217;s life from child to teen to adult, and a visual timeline is notated on the loading screen to make following the sequence of events easier. I was able to follow the story just fine even though it is told out of sequence, in big part because Jodie&#8217;s appearance is different in literally every new scene. Unfortunately, about half way through the game, the story starts to fall apart, not because I couldn&#8217;t follow it, but because of inconsistencies in events, character personalities, the rules of the world, and plot holes.As an example (minor spoiler), a teenage Jodie goes to a party and has the option to use her spirit entity to harass some teenagers. I chose not to. Later in the game, Nathan (a researcher for the Department of Paranormal Activity who acts as a father figure for Jodie) tells Jodie she can&#8217;t go out, and when Jodie protests, he reminds her of the destruction and injury inflicted on the teens at the party. Um, what? I never did anything of the sort, but the story runs on the assumption I took the path they hoped I would. This happened multiple times throughout the game, where characters would recall events that I had previously played, but recalled the path I chose not to take, making for some seriously weird moments. At other times, the game would give me choices, just to tell me my choice was wrong. Another example (minor spoiler), when Jodie is homeless and desperate, a man on the street will proposition her in exchange for some much needed cash. You can choose yes or no, but clearly the developers want you to pick no, because even if you say yes, Jodie will change her mind for you and say no anyway. Why even bother giving me the choice in the first place?One thing that really bothered me was toward the end of the game (minor spoiler), when Jodie has run from a government agency and sworn to never work for them again. She was manipulated by the government to kill innocent people, and yet after putting in so much time and effort to get away from them, she happily agrees to kill more innocent people for the same evil government. For a game filled with choices, at no point are you given a choice in this, Jodie just breaks character and decides that working for the people who lied to, used and manipulated her is a good idea. It was infuriating to have such a crucial choice wrenched from my hands and be forced to use my powers to kill more people when Jodie so clearly regretted her earlier actions.The pacing, which in the first half is quick and engaging, grinds to a halt as you&#8217;re forced to do mundane things like clean up an apartment or cook a dinner. Even action sequences, which early in the game are brisk, become tedious and drag on for eternity. There are moments later in the game where characters just look at each other or stare off into the distance for uncomfortably long periods. All in all, the game took me about 10 hours to complete, but had the fat been trimmed down, it could have easily fit it all into about 6.I took issue with QuanticDream&#8217;s previous game, &#8220;Heavy Rain&#8221; for having a poorly written story filled with inconsistency and plot holes, and for the first half of Beyond I was hopeful that it wouldn't fall into the same trappings. Disappointingly, the strong start doesn't keep up steam, and the complicated story trips over itself in the end, leading to an unsatisfactory conclusion.Easily the weakest part of Beyond is the gameplay. Consisting almost entirely of Quick Time Events (QTE), the game is more like a movie that pauses until you play Simon and press the correct button. Not once during my playthrough did I fail or die, and I&#8217;m not even sure you can. If you don&#8217;t press the correct button, the character will simply go back to the start and wait for you to try again until you get it right. There&#8217;s no consistency in the button prompts, either. Sometimes climbing a ladder will require you to press L1, R1, then L2, other times it will require you to press up on the Left Stick, and other times pressing X will initiate the animation automatically, requiring no further button presses. It&#8217;s a confusing mechanic, and really requires patience. In most instances a graphic will appear on screen indicating what button or motion is required to continue, but in some instances, nothing will appear. One notable moment is when Jodie is crossing some monkey bars. No button prompt appears, and pressing the Left Stick, Right Stick, Left Trigger, Right Trigger, the face buttons, all of it did nothing. I just hung from the monkey bars like an idiot until I just got frustrated and pressed all the buttons and triggers and sticks until she slowly crossed to the other side. It is literally the only time in the game Jodie needs to cross monkey bars, so why is there no button prompt, and what was the point of making me do it?Some rare sections of the game will give you freedom to control Jodie around a very small space, and her movement is designated to the Left Stick, just like every third-person action game out there. But camera movement is limited, and it can be difficult to navigate when the camera isn't pointing the way you want to go. Also, Jodie can get easily stuck on walls and doorways, and some areas with open doors can&#8217;t be accessed due to an invisible wall. Jodie&#8217;s movement speed can&#8217;t be controlled, either, and if she&#8217;s meant to walk (which most times she is), she&#8217;s going to walk slowly to wherever you&#8217;re going, and there&#8217;s no way to speed her up. Also, figuring out where to go can be confusing. Sometimes the camera will deliberately point to where you need to go, other times it will seemingly point deliberately only to find out after a long, slow walk that it was pointing at nothing. Because controlling Jodie can be a game of trial and error, it looks like she&#8217;s drunk some of the time, having difficulty navigating a bathroom or climbing a small rock. Even more confusing is how some actions, like drinking, just happen automatically until one moment when the game decides that now you have to press 3 buttons to pick up a glass, pour it, then drink from it. Why make me press buttons for mundane everyday actions sometimes but not others?My last issue with Beyond is the lack of real choice. Throughout the game you&#8217;re given dialogue choices and action choices, but never with any consistency, and almost none have any real effect on the story. I get to choose what music to play at a party, but I don&#8217;t get to choose how many people I kill in a foreign country? Dialogue choices appear randomly throughout the game, but for major life-changing decisions Jodie just says whatever the writers want her to say and I don&#8217;t get to mold the outcome.Beyond is an amazing technical achievement and is a testament to the incredible power of the PS3. As a game, however, it is frustrating. Bad writing, poorly implemented QTE and a thinly veiled illusion of choice mar an experience that should have been exceptional. If you can get past these issues, you may enjoy Beyond Two Souls, but you may want to wait until it&#8217;s in the bargain bin.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

This full-roaming action-adventure game allows players to jump into the suit of a fledgling Marvel superhero and learn how to battle the forces of evil. Players crawl, leap, and swing from the dizzying heights of skyscrapers to catch criminals and supervillains, and, ultimately, come face-to-face with the Green Goblin in a death-defying display of aerial combat. During the course of the game, players must use Spider-Man's spider-sense, agility, quick wits, and strength to evade the pursuit of the bad guys and overcome obstacles.","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Swinging a fine line","reviewText":"Spider man for the Playstation 2 is a game that walks a very fine line between being fun, and being frustrating.  As you probably know, this game is based on the first spider man movie.  You step into the role of Peter Parker as he swings through Manhattan in his quest to avenge the death of one of his loved ones.  Oh yea, and he also has to contend with the lunatic Green Goblin who wants to kill him.At it's heart, Spider man is founded almost exactly like it's PS1 cousin (that was a great game).  You swing through the city of New York using the R2 button, attack foes with your fists and feet, spin webs and fight crime.  But unlike the PS1 games, the PS2 spider man is graphically amazing.  The skyscrapers of New York really come to life like never before, looking entirely realistic.  Planes fly through the air, cars go through the streets far below.  New York has never looked so good before.  Likewise for the charachters, who all look great.  Peter Parker in the game looks exactly like the Peter Parker in the movie.  Overall, the graphics here are amazing.  People talk about how poor the graphics are on PS2 compared to X-Box, but I have yet to see any proof of this.Unfortunitly, the gameplay of Spider man is at best, mediocre. And at its worst, it's hair tearinginly frustrating.  When I started playing the first level, I was a bit stunned at how bad the camera is.  Of course this is to be expected, being that this is a spider man game, but this has got to be the worst Spider-Man camera yet.  It drifts as if it was on a swivel, and it takes a long time to get used to it.  The Camera lock feature is a nice touch though.The fighting of Spider man is very frustrating.  Any spider man fan knows that Spidey can lift a semi truck over his head easily.  If that's true, then how come Spider man is such a wimp when it comes to taking out certain bad guys.  Here's a helpful hint when playing the game.  If you see a thug with a gun, RUN!!!  The thugs with guns are withought a doubt the most frustrating enemies in the game.  They fire guns very fast at you, and they can block your attacks simply by putting thier arms up.  And worst of all, they can take upwards of ten of your most powerful combos before they die.  This is beyond frustrating.  This is beyond infuriating.  This is so frustrating that words cannot describe it.  In the third level, after I died the sixtenth time after fighting three thugs with guns who kept saying, \"Mess with the skulls, you pay da price\".  I wanted to shout, \"OH YEAH?!  YOU CAN CRAM THAT C*** UP YOUR...\"  Well, you can probably guess where that went.  I got so mad after my thirtieth try, that I almost broke my controler by slamming it on the ground in frustration.  You read that right.  The game made me almost broke my controler.  In ten years of playing video games, Spider Man is the first game that made me damage my controler out of frustration.  That's not a good sign...But I dont want to paint an excessivly poor picture of this game.  Some of the levels are a lot of fun to play, such as \"Air duel with the vulture\", and \"Face off at the bridge.\"  There are also nifty cheats that allow you to play as various charachters, such as a policeman, a thug, even shocker!  There's a code that lets you shrink your charachter down to about ten inches tall.  There's even a alternate story line where you play as Harry Osborn in the Green Goblin outfit.  And Bruce Cambells narration is hilarious!  \"When you hide in the shadows, the bad guys wont see you.  Muhawwwwwhhaaa!\"  Likewise, the actors who played the Green Goblin and Peter Parker lent thier voice talents to the game, and both do a superb job at it.In the end, Spider man is enjoyable, but it comes within a hair of being bad.  I recommend renting before you buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2004"}

It is a truly open game, you can do what ever you want to.

If you find a user level too difficult you can re-tool it for your own liking. Your destiny is all in your hands.Every thing is physics based. Your jump depends on the momentum you carry forward. So it is very easy to judge and work with. There is no annoying button combo for triple jump. Every thing works as in real world.In beta some one created mirrors edge level... it was amazing. The actual game servers just went online, iam waiting for all the amazing creations to come up alive.The sack boy is so well animated, he is like my pet now. I don't want him to fall on fire or get frozen in Ice. Me and friends were just playing slap contest for a few min before playing the actual level. Some of hidden goodies are easy to find when you play in co-op.The original levels included with the game are very creative. Every thing encourages exploration. To find hidden goodies for your own creation. You can do as complex of level design as you want. Or just put a few wood ledges of fire and have a sprint race with your buddies. All the levels can be played with others co-op online. We were able to play without any lag. I would like to see more DLC from MM with ranked maps.Technically it is a juggernaut of a game. Every texture is in super high resolution. Every dam object, ledge, ice all look amazing. You can even choose camera angles, lighting for your levels. Iam still learning to do a lot of stuff.

Seemed a little basic and formulated, which usually leaves for a lackluster game.  With Wolverine, I can say I certainly had a lot of fun and looked forward to playing the game more.The huge plus is the huge amount of carnage that you get to partake in.  I mean you are dismembering men left and right with a whole bunch of different combinations.  This is fun and never seems to get old considering how many ways you can destroy the enemy.  The story is linear and follows the movie almost exactly, so nothing special there.  Game play is standard and the graphics are great in some spots and mediocre in others, leaving you with an overall pleasing experience.The game moves awfully slow, though, as you move back and forth in time 3 years as the story unfolds itself.  And then, all of a sudden, you are thrown into a whole bunch of boss encounters and the game speeds up so fast that before you know it you are fighting the final boss.  Kind of strange how uneven the game is and how action packed the ending is.The game is just a joy to play, if you like mass destruction with claws.

Not Awful","reviewText":"I picked this up for literally a couple of bucks, so wasn't expecting a lot.  I'd heard it was kind of a let down.  A friend of mine who had it said it was wide open so you could &#34;just run away from guys&#34; and &#34;the bosses kicked my ass&#34;.  So I waited until just this weekend to ever play it.  After finally playing it, I don't quite know what game he was talking about.The areas are a bit more open and sometimes you can run away, but you still have the scenarios where you have to beat all the guys to clear a door seal.  There doesn't seem to be nearly enough enemy activity or orbs to go around.  My suggestion, with Dante just upgrade the uzi style guns as much as possible and the rocket launcher is handy too.  You'll find it in this obnoxious level where you have to go track down 4 glowing balls in order to open a portal inside a giant starfish.  The launcher isn't too far from one of the balls and it's in a corner.  Of anything you could miss, that's probably the most critical to find.You also find orb/crystal things that give you demon powers when you max your bar.  Like one for flight.  Then inexplicably you can't fly in most later levels.  Wtf?!?  A lot of weird little stuff like that.  Lucia, I'd say just upgrade her knives.  She's a lot weaker than Dante so they don't even send her against at least one of the nastier bosses and she has one fewer levels since she doesn't fight one of the fights vs. the big boss guy.  The worst thing about most any of the fights is the fixed camera, which is almost categorically awful and the targeting system which can make fights way harder than they should be.Stuff doesn't make sense in the &#34;plot&#34;, what there is of one.  I'll sum it up, demon fighting tribe asks for help from Dante and he apparently knows them, or just acts like he does, or whatever, then stuff happens and he brings random items A through D to the big boss guy for...I give up, not a clue.  Then stuff gets shot and you win.The game is relatively short.  The game is relatively easy.  Lucia's has two of the most annoying fights I've seen in a while.  One is against a giant fish where you just sort of move and you win and then the final end boss one is not difficult, just long and tedious while you run him down...then a minor twist, but as long as you have most of your health soon, which you should, you're fine.  The bonus content includes a costume for Lucia that puts more clothing on her than the other and an arena fighting level.  All in all, not awful by any means, but just sort of is there.

Not to mention other movie based games. As good as the first movie tie-in for Spider-Man was, this one outclasses it in pretty much every way possible. Spider-Man 2 is the first of the free-roaming Spidey games that actually lets you swing through all of New York City from the tallest of buildings to the city streets below, where you can interact with all the pedestrians, lousy drivers, and criminals that frequent them. The way the game operates is that you'll get a number of objectives to complete that will move you forward through the main story as you complete them, but there are many other side missions to complete like taking pictures for the Daily Bugle, racing to reach specific destination points, delivering pizzas, and collecting hidden tokens (most of these missions are timed). Random crimes will also pop up here and there for you to tackle or you can approach citizens who call out for you to inform you of other crimes in progress. Crimes range from muggings, robberies, car jackings, people falling from buildings, mechs blowing up the streets, and even (gulp)... little children losing their balloons. Completing main missions and side missions will grant you hero points, which you use to upgrade Spider-Man's abilities in combat and web swinging, which you will need to defeat Spider-Man's many foes. The game follows the story of the second movie, but as is common in most movie tie-ins, the game adds extra characters, villains, and storylines that make the game that much more fun. You'll battle the villains Rhino, Mysterio, Shocker (again), and of course Dr. Octopus.However, most of the time you'll be battling large groups of regular thugs and plenty of them are packing heat. The combat in this game takes a little getting used to, but it works very well and makes you feel like the web-slinger by having you dodge your enemies' attacks and then counter-attacking at the right moment, instead of just going toe-to-toe with all of them and simply mashing the attack buttons. The combat system in this game is actually very similar to the one that would eventually be used for the universally loved game Batman: Arkham Asylum. The four face buttons all do their own things: one lets you attack, one lets you dodge enemy attacks when Spidey's Spider Sense flashes, one lets you jump, and the last one lets you shoot webbing. Spider-Man also has access to a special move called Spider Reflexes, where the game slows down greatly with markings popping up on enemies who are about to attack and Spider-Man's combat moves do more damage. This move only lasts as long as the corresponding meter has juice in it, which will slowly fill up as you beat up enemies and swing around the city. Using the right combinations of moves on your enemies is key to surviving, and while the combat actually starts out a bit slow, it really picks up once you start acquiring some of the more useful and powerful fighting moves. However, the final fight with Dr. Octopus is definitely one of the more infuriating battles in the game, but with enough practice he can be beaten. That being said, the only cons for this game are the somewhat repetitive lines of dialogue from Spider-Man and the pedestrians he continually swings over. Also the graphics are not initially that great to look at, they're actually inferior (but still similar) to the ones from the first game. Many of the pedestrians appear blocky and fidgety, and Spider-Man's arms are a little too long... like an orangutan's. The CGI cutscenes however are quite different... they're INCREDIBLE! They're so lifelike and convincing that a couple of scenes actually look like they were lifted from the movie. Despite the previously mentioned cons, the addicting and fast paced gameplay distracts you from these blemishes. Even after the main quest is completed, one could easily spend hours at a time just stopping random crimes and enjoying the fun and flowing combat as you beat the snot out of a bunch of thugs. Finally the web swinging: you have more direct control over the actual swinging this time. You press the appropriate button and Spider-Man will automatically attach a webline to the nearest building, water tank, train track, whatever (Spidey's web no longer attaches to the sky) and then you'll actually feel a sort of swinging sensation when you really start moving through the city. It takes practice to swing like a pro and not constantly swing into buildings, but luckily it's the fun kind of practice. This game is a must buy for Spider-Man fans and anyone who likes free-roam sandbox games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"Witcher 2 vs. Witcher 2 (Spoiler - In this battle, only PS3 gamers lose)","reviewText":"After receiving a copy of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition for the Xbox 360, I decided to play the PC version of the game (my 3rd time through) simultaneously with the Xbox 360 version. I played 3 hours per sitting - 90 minutes on the PC version, 90 minutes on the 360. At least that's how I started. 18 hours into this grand experiment (and/or geeky lunacy) and 9 hours into each version of the game, I set the PC version aside and began playing the 360 version exclusively.Is this to say that the 360 version is better? The 360 version is close enough to make it the better option for those who prefer gaming with a controller over a keyboard and mouse. The PC version of the game and the 360 version use the same 360 controller, but developer CD Projekt Red has done such an excellent job at revamping and streamlining the controller layout for the 360 that going back to the PC version started feeling painful, despite those pretty, pretty PC graphics.Graphically, the PC version is superior, but the 360 version is more impressive. How? The 360 version somehow took the graphics of the PC version -- which wouldn't even play on \"high\" settings until I upgraded my PC with a $390 graphics card, last year -- and made them comparable.Yes, we see more pop-up. No, we don't get as much depth of field. Yes, there are more jaggies. No, the texture quality isn't as detailed. Yes, there is screen-tear (this was the hardest for my eyes to get used to, but my girlfriend couldn't see it, even as I was frantically pointing at the screen screaming, \"Right there! Look! It just happened again!\"). But the console this is playing on is seven years old and was half the price of the year old video card that is used in my PC.How did they pull this off?!?After a beautiful CG intro. created for this version (and, thanks to CD Projekt Red actually rewarding paying customers, instead of punishing them for their loyalty, now available as free DLC for those owning the game on the PC), the graphics may initially underwhelm -- especially if you're coming off the PC version. But just wait.Wait until you're running from a fire-breathing dragon. Wait until you see the sun begin shining through the trees at dawn in the forest outside of Flotsam (the lighting effects in this game are beautiful -- noticeably better than those in the PC version). The further into the game you get, the better the game looks. By the time you finish, you'll look at your 360 and wonder if someone quietly replaced it with an Xbox 720 while you were away. The Witcher 2 is the best looking game on the console.The Witcher 2 is no slouch in the gameplay department, either. If you can imagine a Western style RPG (Fallout, Elder Scrolls) merged with a JRPG (Final Fantasy, Persona 3) by way of George R.R. Martin (Game of Thrones) -- you can get a sense of what The Witcher 2 has in store for you. The game is dark, gritty, absurd in the best possible way, and adult. It is not like any other RPG you've ever played.There's a choice system in The Witcher 2, but most choices aren't presented as \"good,\" \"in-between,\" or \"bad.\" They're just choices. Like in real life, you can't even be sure if you're making good choices (or \"bad\" ones, if that's your style) until the choices have been made. Like in real life, you'll kick yourself a few times, knowing you chose poorly a number of times, despite trying to do the right thing. Many times the consequences of your choices won't be revealed until hours later.No matter the choices you make, the game will send you on a bevy of quests the likes of which you have never seen in a game. In the first 5 hours alone, you can try to help an alcoholic troll get off the sauce, you can seek out the embryo of Endrega (don't ask) to help a witch cast a spell that may take the curse off of a medallion you got from a dead boy who was killed because you gave the boy bad advice at the start of the game (again, choices matter and you don't always know if you've made the right ones), or you can collect some mucous from a gigantic sea monster who has been randomly picking fishermen off the docks and devouring them.With mucous, embryos and vodka soaked trolls, you may start getting the impression the game is in the slapstick vein of the Fable titles. Get rid of that impression immediately. Despite the unique nature of the quests, this game takes itself seriously. It tells a grown-up story in a grown-up way. If you have any doubt about how serious this game can get, wait until you hit the haunted hospital early on. The quest is like something spit up from Hell -- and it's nerve-racking enough to have you feeling shaken up by the time it's over, if you can make it that long without taking a breather.The Witcher 2 is an all-around amazing game. I never hooked up my 360 to the Internet while playing, so never downloaded any patches, and the game had but one glitch. And that glitch was funny enough I wondered if it was kept in on purpose. When climbing up a ladder at the very beginning of the game, our \"hero,\" Geralt, literally has his head up the king's butt. It was clearly a collision detection issue, but my girlfriend thought it made for grand humor. After coming off of Skyrim -- which was glitchy to the point where I started wondering if Bethesda Game Studios had a vendetta against its loyal fans -- a gigantic RPG that ran virtually glitch-free without half a dozen patches felt miraculous.Are there problems with the game? Yes. But what it gets wrong is hardly worth mentioning. Forcing gamers to set up and take potions before -- and making potions off limits during -- a fight is a little sadistic (these are also the only times in the game where you can't save). Despite the tweaks made to the menu for the 360 release, it is still a bear to navigate. An immediate fix I'd recommend is to make sure that after upgrading a sword or armor, the sword or armor you just upgraded remains selected. For some reason, after you upgrade a weapon or a piece of armor, the game sends you back to the top of the item list. If you want to add more than one upgrade, you have to scroll all the way back down to the item you had just scrolled down to a minute earlier. But these are minor nits to pick at in a nearly perfect game.The Witcher 2 is the whole package. What CD Projekt Red pulled off, in their first console game, is something many developers are still striving for in their fifth or sixth console entry. The music, the graphics, the gameplay, the quests, the story, the voice-acting, the environments, and the art-design are all top-notch. How a company developing for a console could hit it this far out of the park on their very first try is something of a welcome mystery.In a \"battle\" between the PC and the 360 version of the game, only PS3 gamers lose (hopefully CD Projekt Red makes that right, soon -- everyone should get a chance at playing this game). The downgraded graphics are a little hard to get used to if you've spent dozens of hours on the PC version of the game, but going back to the less-than-perfect control scheme on the PC version, after playing the 360 version, is even harder. Would I recommend this to those who have already finished it on the PC? Probably not (although it is fun to compare the two). Would I recommend this to those with a 360 who have never played it? Unconditionally.The Witcher 2 is the best RPG of this console generation, and one of the best games to grace a seventh-generation console. I don't know how they did it, but I'm sure glad they did. Those of you waiting for something better can stop your waiting! The Witcher 2 is likely \"Game of the Year 2012\" for the 360 (or any console, for that matter). What are you still reading this for, when you could be playing? Go now, Witcher ... there are monsters that need slaying and worlds that need saving!Specs (both versions played on a 50-inch Panasonic Plasma 1080p HDTV, for comparison purposes):Settings on the PC version of the game used for this review:Anisotropic Filtering - 10xAnti-aliasing - 4xLighting Quality - HighTexture Quality - HighShadow Quality - HighGrass Quality - HighDecals Fade - MediumDepth of Field - EnabledVisibility Range - AverageSmall Animals Number - AverageSettings on the 360 version of the game used for this review:Power Button - OnA few gameplay tips I learned throughout my many adventures with The Witcher:- Avoid playing on \"easy,\" if at all possible. When they say \"easy,\" they mean it. It turns the game into a button-masher, where you can just press \"A\" and/or \"X\" from beginning to end. \"Normal\" is a little more difficult than most games at \"Normal\" settings, but stick with it.- Many battles have a \"safe spot.\" This is probably the most important thing to remember when feeling overwhelmed. When you're facing what seems like insurmountable odds, find this safe spot and let your health regenerate. Then go fight some more. Wash, rinse, repeat.- Don't skip the cutscenes and -- if you have the time -- read the journals. There is a heckuva great story being told in this game. The more you put in, the more you get out.- If the sword with the silver wolf head on the handle is at your back, the sword you're using is steel (for humans). If the sword with the silver wolf head on the handle is in your hand, the sword you're using is silver (for monsters). If you're using the wrong sword, you're in for a world of hurt.- The magic sign \"Quen\" can be your best friend in a difficult battle. When all seems lost, give it a try.- To level up press the back button. Once there, you'll see your item list. Hit the left or right trigger until you're at the leveling up tree. If you play the tutorial, you know this already.- Play the tutorial.- When done, there's an amazing prequel just waiting to be played. Despite being 5 years old, the original Witcher is still a great game. No, you don't need to play that one first. But if you loved the second, there's a lot more waiting for you, should you choose to delve even further into this wonderful gaming universe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2012"}

All atmosphere, very little pay off.  However, SH: Origins was a nice surprise given the lack of good survival horror games available right now on PS2.  The graphics are grainy like the Blair Witch, the monsters creepy, and the settings even creepier.  Great soundtrack.  I had trouble with the controls at times: there seems to be a delay somewhere in there.  The puzzles are not that hard but I appreciate a game that makes you think a little.  The best part for me was the changeover from the REAL world to the OTHER world (nightmare) which added a dimension to this game the others lack.

I love the horror-shooter style game play.When I first started playing F.3.A.R. I was disappointed with the graphics and the basic map layout. It seemed so plain and boring. I was almost ready to sell it back just to get it off my shelf. So needless to say I did not feel that F.3.A.R. had a strong start. Then there was a cut scene and a helicopter crashed into a bulk shopping store warehouse type building. This is where I really started to enjoy the game. From that point on, the game is awesome. It is dark, spooky and very atmospheric. The music is perfect for the game and greatly complements what actions are taking place. Controls are great and fast. This is an action game first and foremost, yet there are a few parts which make you jump. For example, there were times where people jumped out of nowhere and surprised me. However the most frightening times where in dark areas when you hear a slight something, then next thing you know someone is looking you in the face. They really took advantage of the darkness, however it could have been much more freighting. I loved the demolished buildings and grungy dirty gritty locations. It did remind me of the Condemned games at times.I would say my only real complaint would be some of the map layouts. In the beginning you're running around this little town on a mountain and it just feels like they were trying to pull a Modern Warfare or Medal of Honor. It just didn't look good and was not fun for me. The fun times are when they stick with the roots of F.E.A.R. and hide monsters in the shadows and surround you with darkness. Being in an unknown dark area with only a flickering flashlight to guide you can be quite scary.There is a psychological aspect of the game, not only in the storyline but also throughout the game play. Seeing things, flashbacks and things that are there then not there adds to the creepiness of the game. However there were other times where I felt like I was playing some military shooter reject. For me my fun meter with this game fluctuated as I played through. It started off low, then went up when things got creepy, then when down when soldiers started popping up again. Yes the storyline does follow and direct the game well, however they should have focused more on the monsters and less on the soldiers. Shooting some soldiers in a horror game is just like every other war shooter game out there. Fear is different due to the horror genre. They should have used the fear aspect more than your basic shooter.PRO's+ Solid controls+ Amazing Soundtrack, great sound+ Intriguing storyline+ Creepy atmosphere, however at the graphics expense+ Split-Screen co-op is great and a lot of fun+ Good AICON's- Graphics are not the best, however they were shooting for more of an atmosphere- Frustrating Map's at times. Quite easy to get lost or loose your bearings- New cover feature is nice, however it gets frustrating when you stick to walls- Lack of real horror, yet still spooky at timesIf you are a fan of the F.E.A.R games then this is a must play. It is just as good as the first two games, but not as scary. First person shooter fans will also enjoy this game, however do not expect anything close to Modern Warfare in terms of graphics, maps and over all game play. It is a classic F.E.A.R. game, however it does have some little things thrown in as something new to offer.Will I play this game again? Maybe the split screen co-op with a friend, but doubtful full campaign replay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000U34SYQ","reviewerName":"researcher","summary":"A Well Made Strategy Game","reviewText":"I will be objective and critical in my reviews.This game is a true sequel to Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance.-An example of the game. Imagine: your forces (about 18) and your computer ally (about 20) vs. enemy (about 60). you have to defend the castle entrance (you have long range attackers) and the only way for the enemy to go there is through the stairs. You block off both sets of stairs with your strong melee guy with an archer/mage behind for long range support. The enemy is approaching, then both of you are at a stand still, but they attack the one blocking. Your HP is slowly draining from the close and long range attacks by melee, arrows, and/or magic. You need to heal him/her now (or you'll lose that character in the game). If you use a Vulernary (HP potion), you could get attacked by an enemy with 1 hp (which you could have defeated if you attacked instead of healed). If you have a priest heal you, an archer could shoot over your character and hit your priest (who has very low max hp and defense stats). If you attack, you may defeat one more, but what will take it's place? What would happen if I did this, or that, or... What would you do?PROS:-Customize the strength, material, weight, and other stats of weapons-Objectives are interesting and challenging: DEFEND THE CASTLE, ROUT THE ENEMY, DEFEAT THE BOSS, SURVIVE FOR X TURNS, DEFEND \"PERSON\", AND MORE.-Story, although not always presented well, is very engaging-Even just reading the scrolling story is very interesting-This game is really fun, it's gonna eat up your free time.-Challenging strategy game. Really makes you think-If you wanna keep all your characters, you will appreciate the challenge-About 45 hours of gameplay, not counting the unlockables and how many times you will reset the game because you realize you made a wrong move. (this is a good thing by all means). So this means about 100 hours in real life. Great length and depth.-Difficulty is appropriate, definitely not too easy and there are MUCH harder levels-Gameplay is just as it was in FE:POR, it's simple, yet complex and very effective-The cutscene movies are very well done-Music is orchestrated, sounds great.-Gamecube controller compatibleCONS:-Like I said, about 75% of the cutscenes are scroll and read types-Not enough movie cutscenes, which make the game seem more sub-par-I'm NO graphics-nut, I'm a GAMEPLAY-nut, but the developers could have stepped up the graphics to have more detail There's more graphics potential in the Wii than the Gamecube, and they didn't improve other than progressive scan and 16:9 support. I think the developers were just lazy in the graphics area.-I have to reset the game to go to the main menu from the battlefield, come on, this is just poor development. Disappointing.FINAL THOUGHTS:PERSONALLY, I REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS GAME.Those reviewers and critics giving this game a bad rating most likely aren't strategy-fans. Not everyone likes strategy games, but those who do should give this game high marks.-If you like strategy games, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.-If you are new to the strategy genre, get the prequel to this game FIRE EMBLEM: PATH OF RADIANCE (ALSO WELL DONE) first.-If you do not like RPG strategy games, I don't recommend this game because this is a true RPG strategy game.-If you are a graphics-nut, this game will disappoint you.-If you are a gameplay-nut, you will really enjoy this game. I did.-If you liked FIRE EMBLEM: PATH OF RADIANCE, don't hesitate because of the other negative \"CRITIC\" reviews, it is really, really worth it.-TO RESPOND TO THE CRASHING INCIDENT IN THE THREE STAR REVIEW: I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY A PROBLEM WITH THAT PARTICULAR PERSON'S WII OR MEMORY CARD BECAUSE MY CLEAR DATA FROM FE:POR TRANSFERED FINE WITH NO CRASHES.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2007"}

Your character wakes up in an underground \"ark\" where he survived a cataclysmic event that changed the shape of the world.  As he heads outside for the first time in a century, he is promptly attacked by deformed mutants, and then immediately saved by a guy named Dan Hagar.  From this moment on, you are suddenly doing favors for not only Dan, but members of his family, as well as other complete strangers that you encounter in the Wasteland formerly known as Earth.  These missions take the shape of assassinations, fetch quests, repairs, package delivery, and various other odd jobs.  And right away, I began to ask myself, \"why?\"Rage's core problem is that the game gives you very few, if any, reasons to continue to press forward with anything.  You are thrust into a whirlwind of tasks and assignments, but due to the very lack of a meaningful narrative or characters, you have no real motivation to do anything other than advance the game forward.  In this day in age, with a big, expansive game like this, there is no excuse for this.  Every element of the world, from your surroundings, to the mission structure, to the characters, seems hollow.  Like it was cut and pasted from other games you've probably played in the last few years.  The characters in the towns seem like cardboard cutouts, and after a while, it becomes very difficult to WANT to do anything more for these people.  And in a game that consists of doing favors for people, this is a very critical flaw.  It's too hard to get involved in why you're doing what you're doing, and ultimately leads to a very unsatisfying experience, and never gets any better.  Even the plot itself is predictable and clich&eacute;d, and never manages to drum up any interest whatsoever.  When it comes to delivering an engaging experience, the game fails on pretty much every level.The worst thing is that Rage had potential, particularly in the beautiful new engine that is used here, the id Tech 5, as well as with the game's often savage and satisfying combat.  Rage looks great.  Even though it lacks substance and personality, it's a very shimmery, clean-looking game that continues the tradition of incredible tech savvy that id Software has always been known for.  The combat sections are enjoyable too...certainly not as great as a game like Crysis or Bioshock, but certainly more enjoyable than other games we've seen in this FPS-saturated console cycle.  Some clever new weapons are gradually introduced to your arsenal as you advance.  Enemy AI, whether you're fighting bandits, mutants, or government agents, is clever and behaves in a more realistic way.  Even the sections where you're forced to drive a buggy around can be amusing.  But in the end, the game takes its few strengths, and buries them deep within a huge game world that lacks soul, meaning, and any sense of fascination.  If the game had been a straight up corridor shooter and avoided forcing its cut-and-paste world upon the gamer, it would have been a greater success, as the combat in the game is solid.  But this is a disappointment from id Software, and hopefully was just a way of testing their game engine, so that the real effort can go into the upcoming Doom 4.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2012"}

Bad Ideas.","reviewText":"I must say,  I do like this game for bringing a lot of new ideas to the platforming table, but I would have given it higher if not for the insane difficulty level.  First, I have all four platforming games from Insomniac and Naughty Dog for the Plastation 2.  This game is my least favorite, because as one gaming magazine succinctly put it, \"the game doesn't like me.\"  For the casual gamer, this game 's difficulty would be ranked as high as Contra: Shattered Soldier or Shinobi in some of the missions.  Don't get me wrong though as my perception of the game.  The graphics and the controls are fantastic.  They are responsive...Even the story is fairly deep and involving.  In fact, it may be argued that it is better than Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.  I have other complaints regarding this game is that the city is too dark and the streets are way too crowded with cars.  Overall, this game does deserve a higher rating, but this game is simply too difficult for those who want to have fun and not have a chore of a game.  Second, the camera is usually fixed and does not move with the action (like Ratchet and Clank).  In many, many instances, Jak will get shot off the screen by enemies, who shoot particularly well.  Lastly, the autolock by Jak is a joke compared to the enemies' autolock.  You have to literally move Jak into the proper angle to fire, and it only exposes himself more.  It would be great if they had strafing, via Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando and an actual lock-on system.  One last wish, in the next installment, please let Jak improve health-wise like his compatriot Ratchet.  Maybe after boss battles or  something.  Anything.  Overall, this game is heavily recommended for Jak and Daxter die-hard fans and \"hardcore gamers.\"  For the casual gamer (most of us, I think), it is particularly difficult in some missions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00CRL9TU2","description":"","reviewerName":"Nasahr","summary":"The more you play it the more you love it!","reviewText":"Update 12/25/13:If you are currently a Forza fan and have never had a gran turismo game or had one since PS2 you should definetively buy GT6. BUT only if you're all about having the most realistic driving experience possible. If you just want to jump in and have fun and win every race very esily then you'll find it hard to enjoy this game. I have both GT6 and Forza 4 and i can tell you i have officially became a GT fan. Those guys at microsoft boast about how realistic Forza is but after playing Gran turismo 6 i can tell that Forza games (including 5) are very unrealistic. The cars are just TO easy to drive!You'll find your self playing gran turismo and be amazed at how real it is. You can feel every bump in the track, even on an oval track like Daytona the surface is very bumpy just like the real thing, it's really incredible once you experience it for your self. You can littereally learn to drive with this game. The details on the cars is incredible as well. I found my self amazed at how real the Srt Viper looks, in the showroom and in the replays after races (i love Vipers).One major flaw though is the sound of the cars. Going from forza to Gran turismo is a shock at first because the cars sound so bad.. But once you get past that GT6 is really a very enjoyable game for any car obsessed enthusiast. If your not a big car person though then i suggest you go somewhere else, maybe grand theft auto or...or maybe you could go play with your self for entertainment. The more you play this game the more you get used to the flaws and accept them. Then and ONLY then will you grow to love this game like i have.(FIRST IMPRESSIONS 12/10/13):Gran Turismo 6 could'v been a 5/5 game, but a few things have spoiled the experience. Number 1: The sound of the cars. To look at a dodge viper, buy it, then test drive it only to find out that it sounds like some robotic, computerized 4 cylinder is downright disgusting. That's something you just don't do in any racing game especially a simulation. It's unforgivable. Why can't they just record the sounds of the cars like Forza? How hard can that be. They're so obsessed with offering a realistic driving experience and making the cars look amazing but they sound like crap.Number 2: Half of the cars have no cockpit view.Also they released the BMW M4 a few days ago so i buy it then drive it to find out that the cockpit is completely pitch black. You can't see the dash, can't see anything..again unforgivable. Plus driving some of the really fast cars (Pagani, Ferrari) is no where near as fun or exciting as it should be. If those major problems could be fixed in updates then this game has huge potential. Untill then though it's awesome at times but really disappointing other times. My sister loves the game though which is a huge plus (considering she has NO interest in cars)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}

I was looking for a decent campaign mode but definitely didn't get that. Single-player is very limited as it is broken down into 10 separate missions. Unlike Unit 13 which gives you multiple missions to choose from at any given time depending on which ones you have completed, in Declassified you CANNOT progress further without finishing each mission, which means if you get stuck on one, you are out of luck. This was a poor design decision which was quite disappointing.One the other hand, online multi-player was surprisingly enjoyable which saved the day for this game. Although modes are somewhat limited and matches consist of small number of players (up to 8 which means 4 vs. 4), this works out ok but does make the experience a bit watered down. The maps are relatively small as compared to BO/BO2, which is actually a positive in my mind since it's simpler to jump in and be competitive right away.All in all, buy this for multiplayer only and expect nothing from single-player. If you can find this for $40 or less, I think it's worth a try.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"smullins","summary":"Fantastic RPG","reviewText":"I can finally write a review of this game, just having finished it in just under 70 hours. I would gladly have kept playing had then been more quests to complete. This is an amazing rpg that really excels at a rich story, voice acting, quests, and difficulty; making this game one wonderful experience.What this game gets right:The story, culture, and voice acting in this game are truly superior. I was completely engrossed in the story and found the conversations with other characters completely believable. The characters came alive during this game thanks to the writing and voice acting. This is extremely rare in video games.The difficulty of this game is great. Its a hard game. You will die plenty of times. But its not frustrating, its challenging. The game is extremely well balanced, and gives you a variety of ways to win battles (unlike other games where there is only one magically way to win a particular battle).Customization. This game presents itself with many ways for you to play. You get to pick your style for characters, combat, team structure, everything; the game tailors to your style. You can pick all kinds of different styles for your main character (like many games). But you can choose your party structure - do you want to go more strength with warriors, or long range with rogues with bows, or go mage heavy relying on damage spells. I generally went 2 warriors, 1 rouge, and 1 mage. Once you have your main character and your party, you can still approach battles differently. You have spell combinations, traps, poison coating, bombs, and lures to name most of them. You can set ambushes or run in charging. You can use potions to restore health and stamina, or use healing spells and wear lighter armor to give you more stamina for special abilities.Actions and approvals. This game doesn't used some boiled down morality system. There is no good or bad. There is only actions and approvals or disapprovals to those actions. Different party members have different agendas and senses of right and wrong. As you decide to take on quests (or how to complete them) your party members will either approve or disapprove of your actions. Party members that highly approve of you will fight better.There is a ton of dialogue, everyone has something to say. Thankfully, hitting escape will skip one sentence. So you can control how much dialogue you are interesting in listening to.The culture in this game is amazing. There is a ton of written information about characters, areas, history, religion, enemies and controls. But you don't have to read it if you don't want to. It populates in a codex book and you can read it at your leisure.Quests. These quests are interesting and non-repetitive. Its not a lot of hey go kill 10 wolves and return. Its the full range of gathering items, killing enemies, scavenging various locations, etc. What I really love is most of the main story line quests give you different options for completing them. For example - without spoiling anything - one quest involves elves versus werewolves. You get to decide which party is in the right and who you should side with. It adds complexity to the story, making it feel like you are writing history as you go.What this game could improve on:the graphics are pretty good but by no means great. I saw lots of image clipping issues during conversation sequences - a dwarf's beard would \"dip\" into his armor. But this is minor, and with the richness of everything else in the game I quit caring about the graphics quickly.the camera gets stuck sometimes and just doesn't want to give you the correct view of the battle field. I wish I could roam with the camera during battles instead of being restricted to only where my party members are.As you can see, this game provides a lot of rich content and features that make it an excellent and rewarding RPG campaign. The negatives are minor and will not detract from the overall enjoyment of playing this title. There is so much to do in this fantasy world that you will well get your money's worth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Anthony Peak","summary":"A big letdown","reviewText":"Rogue Leader was the first game I played for the Nintendo Gamecube. Sadly, it was a poor choice. I own the original Rogue Squadron and I really enjoy the game, so I figured this would be a great first rental. Right from the start though, I was disappointed.The game starts with corny dancing Stormtroopers to some old time music holding up yellow squares to form the Lucas logo or something. Whaa? That kinda breaks the mood... but forgivable. Then I got to the menu screen... scenes from the movies played randomly in the background serving no apparent purpose, except maybe to give the developers less original work to do.When I finally got in game, being new to the Gamecube, I hit the training mission. I figured I'd learn about all the cool abilities of the various crafts and how to best fight the Empire. Instead, I'm \"treated\" to a empty field with random training icons floating. Most are completely useless, such as \"press A to fire... Good Job!!\" A few are truly retarted... \"You found a Jabba's Palace... GOOD JOB!!\". If I had that computer tell me 'good job' just one more time... I would have thrown my controller down right then and there. So, annoyed, I quit and headed for the first mission...Without any good explanation or reason, I'm suddenly fighting above the Death Star. Lasers are shooting everywhere, tie's are flying in every possible direction, and my wingmen are screaming at me for leadership. I liked it. I quickly pull up the targeting computer and take down a few ties. Then I order my wingmen to do the same, and set upon the mission's goals. It was a great mission, but random.Next mission, I'm in an asteroid field. How on earth did I get here? No... never mind... it looks gorgeous, who cares. I'm blasting stuff, having a unconvinced but good time. Sadly, this doesn't last until mission 3. By mission 3 I'm bored, the gorgeous graphics die down to just standard locations, and the missions are very tedious. By the later levels, it was so easy to mess up a small detail and have to start over I said forget it, no more.This game starts off with a major blast (if you avoid the training) and dies quickly from there. It doesn't get better, it just keeps going instead. If you can find it cheap, rent it for the first few levels alone. It'll be fun for a few days. That's only if you can find it cheap or borrow it from a friend. Don't buy this thing unless you're sure.- Rirath_com","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"Jeffrey S. Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Great fun but quality comes into question","reviewText":"Okay, I have had my 360 since last November. I have bought and enjoyed many games. I do not have HD TV but I still appreciate the next gen graphics over the current consoles. I have played my 360 on a 62\" DLP HDTV and it looked great. The only problem I have had with my 360 (currently on my third one right now) is a failure of the console. My first console last from November up until June. It would start to lock up and I would get a E65 error message. This indicates a hardware failure. I fortunately had purchased mine from EB Games and had the one year warranty so I just swapped it out for a new one. I did have to repurchase the warranty for another 40 bucks but I was glad I did it with the first console. I never buy the warranties. Luck was with me when I bought my first one. Anyways, the second console lasted from 6/18 until 7/2. I started to get the same E65 error message and then the console would lock up right after turning it on. Fortunately EB Games worked with me to cover it under their instore warranty. The disk drive would not even open up on the second console. I have had the third one now just for a couple of days but it is playing fine so far. I would highly recommend that if available, to purchase some kind of warranty for the console. I was told the first time I took mine back in that I was in the 5-10% range of people who had purchased a 360 and had failures, and I wonder now after having two failures with one not even making it two weeks, what kind of range I fall into now.An extended warranty should be purchased. I cannot stress this enough. I have my original PS2 from 2000, two Xboxes that are several years old and a PSP. The 360 is the only console system I have ever had any problems with.Aside from that, the games are awesome and we are now getting into the 2nd generation of games that are available. I was anxious to get the PS3 but with a $600 dollar price tag, I will be waiting for a major price drop before purchasing a PS3. The whole HD DVD vs BluRay is enough to make me hesitant. Current DVD format is good enough for me right now.Also, the wireless controller for the 360 is one of the best wireless controllers I have ever used. I have the Logitech for my PS2 and Xbox and this 360 controller is better. You can plug the headset into the controller so you aren't limited to a distance when you are playing over live.Another recommendation I have is to buy the quick charge set. This allows you to charge two batteries at the same time in 4 hours, 2 hours for one battery alone. You can simply take a battery and plug the other one in and it matches the look of the 360 console so it doesn't look out of place. I had the plug and play set and used it one time before I got tired of having to stand next to the console since the cord is only around 8 foot or so. I am a little gun shy of the 360 right now but hopefully this console will last. Gears of War is coming out and there are many other great titles that will be available this year, many of them only on the 360. FEAR will be out and that looks downright awesome. Hope you all enjoy your gaming. This is a great time to be a gamer.Well, I just thought I would edit my previous review. I have now had to exchange several moer 360's after they failed on me. I am currently on my 5th 360. My third console failed after only about 4 months with the 3 red lights on the ring of lights. I decided to use my warranty and pick up another 360. This 360, upon plugging it up at home, I discovered the plastic slot that the hard drive uses was broken and wouldn't hold the hard drive. This was straight out of the box. I swapped it out for another and have had it for about a week now and will wait to see how it goes. This current unit runs much cooler than any of the others I have had. I still hear that Microsoft has a 5% failure rate on the 360's but I believe it is much higher than that. I have gone through 5 myself and now others who have had multiple units. I love the games but the quality of the console itself is leaves a lot to be desired. I have really been disappointed with a console I spent several hundred dollars on keeps failing on me. It is well ventilated and all that so I believe it is all hardware related. Buy this with caution. It is a great system but the quality is lacking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2006"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Consider me K-O'ed","reviewText":"EA Sports' next-generation launch was as steady as the legs of a worn-out boxer. They ran a decent game with Madden NFL 2006, but missed a few tackles. They completely air-balled NBA Live 2006. FIFA 2006: Road to the FIFA World Cup was a decent game, but like soccer in real life, didn't reflect a lot of excitement. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006 was also a decent game, but wasn't the 300-yard blast that Xbox 360 golfing gamers expected. Now, with Fight Night Round 3, they've proven something-even a worn-out boxer can come back and make a big hit to get right back into the game. Fight Night Round 3 is easily above and beyond everything that EA Sports has done so far in the next generation, and it stands as one of the premier Xbox 360 titles right now.Featuring two headline gameplay modes, ESPN Classics and Career, Fight Night Round 3 is chock-full of stuff for boxing fans. ESPN Classics puts you into the trunks of boxing greats and throws you into the ring against the star's biggest rival. For example, there is an Ali vs. Frazier match, a B-Hop and Jones Jr. match, and more. For boxing fans and those of you out there that know your boxing history, this is a real treat. Re-creating big match-ups is something that's always enjoyable.Career Mode is where the rest of the gameplay is found, and it lets you create your own avatar and make a name for yourself as a boxing legend. This mode forces you to train your boxer, earn money and hire trainers, buy boxing gear, and sign contracts to fight in upcoming matches. By the end of your boxer's career, you'll have fought in all sorts of events, like ESPN Wednesday and Friday Night matches. I enjoyed the Career Mode the most, as it allowed me to have full control of my boxer and his stats. For example, if I needed a power boost before an upcoming match, all I had to do was participate in the Weightlifting training game and my boxer would be a little beefier. Eventually throughout your career you'll form rivalries that are reflected by the action on the mat, where a rival might start throwing illegal hits and taunting your avatar.The on-mat gameplay is phenomenal, to say the least. Boxing is a test of stamina in real life, and this has been held up very well in the game itself. The punching controls are mapped to the right analog stick by default, and throwing punches is as easy as moving the stick into a certain direction. For example, quickly slashing the stick in an upwards-diagonal motion will result in your avatar throwing a mean jab. Swiveling the stick from down to up will execute an uppercut. There are even haymakers that are done by moving the stick in different motions. Though these punches are much harder to successfully execute, when they are landed on an opponent, the effect is dramatic. Once you wear down an opponent, he'll start to throw sluggish punches, he'll swagger, and he'll eat the floor when you land a clean hit. Of course, punching wildly and getting hit by your opponent will have the same devastating result on your boxer, and the finesse, knowledge, and stamina required in boxing is also required in the videogame in order to win matches. On harder difficulty settings, this game is truly punishing to any and all mistakes you make.The gameplay is actually enhanced by the visuals; something that I feel the Xbox 360 hasn't really accomplished yet. Playing Fight Night Round 3 in high-definition glory is an experience that truly has to be seen. From the sweat beads dripping down a boxer's chest to the skin ripples in his face when he's hit, Fight Night Round 3 delivers detail in every way. The bright lights make sweat glisten and will actually blind you from time to time, putting you right into the head of your boxer. The default camera angle is extremely close to the combatants, making the action up-close and personal. Sometimes, especially after a big hit, the camera will swivel or shak, representing the unnerving feeling of uncontrollability and pain that a real-life boxer would feel. Like I said, with Fight Night Round 3, the visuals actually enhance the gameplay. Getting hit with a big punch not only feels brutal, but looks brutal thanks to these visuals.The menu music is fitting, but I usually ended up listening to my Xbox 360 Custom Soundtrack anyway. Fortunately, the in-game commentary is actually worth listening to, even though some of the sound clips are played in a strange order. For instance, after each match, the commentator usually commends one of the boxers but sometimes won't specify whom he's talking about until he's finished complimenting. It's almost as if the sound team put in the different audio clips backwards. If there's anything worth bragging about in terms of sound, it's the sound effects, which do a fantastic job of signaling when your boxer's bones are crunching and when he's gasping for breath. And when the crowd gets into a fight, and starts chanting, you'll really feel it.In almost every way, Fight Night Round 3 is a sensational game that sports, fighting, or boxing fans will enjoy. In fact, I really can't find anything to complain about. If you own an Xbox 360, I highly recommend giving EA Sports' knockout title a chance. Of course, the game on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PSP share the exact same gameplay features, but they don't have the visual enhancements that the 360 version delivers so perfectly. If EA Sports can continue to hit this hard with their next-gen games, sports fans won't have much left in their wallet when Madden NFL 2007 and NBA Live 2007 release.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2006"}

I loved their work on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, preferring it to Bioware's original, I enjoyed Neverwinter Knights II much more than the bland original (also done by Bioware) and I enjoyed their expansion packs to the original NWN as well.  I also was a huge fan of Black Isle up until they closed their doors several years ago.  So it is no surprise that Obsidian, where many former Black Isle employees sought refuge, was pumping out some quality RPGs.  The strongest element to any Black Isle/Obsidian RPG was always writing, character development and consequence of your actions.  The weakest elements of their games normally involved stability, glitches and combat mechanics.  Alpha Protocol is a mixed bag of strenghts and weaknesses which, unlike past Obsidian games, never quite coems together in the end to allow you to forgive the mistakes.  This is easily their weakest effort out of all their work.I went into this game fully expecting a stat based RPG with action elements.  Yes, I enjoyed the first two Mass Effect games and couldn't help but think of this game as Obsidian's answer to Bioware's spectacular space operas, but I have been around long enough to know that AP would be much less of a shooter than either ME game.  AP actually reminds me more of Deus Ex in many respects in how stats dictate the outcome of everything in the game, from combat to hacking to stealth maneuvers.  There are a number of ways to approach a level and conquer it, though nowhere near as diverse as what the original Deus Ex offered a decade ago.The biggest complaint I have read about AP seems to be the shooting mechanics.  People complain that they miss headshots when perfectly lined up.  This is why understanding that this is an RPG is fundamental to the experience, if you don't put skill points into your weapon, be it a pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, or sub machine gun, then you won't be very effective at hitting targets.  It won't matter if your shot is lined up, your chances of success rely on a roll of the dice dictated by your stats.  The game does give you an idea of whether you will hit your mark or not by allowing you to wait a couple seconds for a red reticle to close in on your target.  When this red reticle zeros in within your aiming cursor, it means you are lined up for a critical shot and your chances of hitting have improved dramtically.  The more you level up your weapon, the less wait time you have for this critical hit to zero in.  Some weapons, such as the assault rifle, even have a temporary lock on ability which you gain after leveling up that weapon to a particular point and which you activate from your abilities list by pressing left on the d-pad.  This is pretty basic RPG customization of your character where you put the experience points you gain while playing the game into different abilities and unlock new ones.  You start off the game weak and end it strong, yet it seems so many reviewers fail to grasp this simple concept that has been around for such a long time.  In short, the gun play in this game is just fine, just remember this is an RPG and not a twitch shooter.  The combat is on par with the first Mass Effect, minus the Mass Effect powers.  Guns, Stealth, special skills and gadgets are pretty fun to use, as are the various mini games to pick a lock, hack a computer and bypass a keypad.The other main complaint that I hear from many reviewers is that the game is glitchy and even broken.  First off, this game is not \"broken\" by any means.  Not only is it stable, mine didn't crash once, but there aren't any more exploits in this game than any other.  As for glitches, aside from some graphical issues such as flickering and clipping, I didn't notice that many to distract from my gameplay experience.  The boss battles in the game do have occasional blind spots in some areas and there are other parts of the game that feel incomplete or rushed, but I didn't really have a problem with glitches in this game.  The problem I did have was a complete lack of polish in not just the graphics, but the presentation, the A.I. and the overall storytelling.The graphics are bland looking, something I would have expected to see in a 2006 360 game, not 2010.  Even back then, it would have been blown away by Lost Planet, Oblivion and Gears of War.  There is no interaction with the environment, no destructable terrain, no hiding in shadows or any lighting effects worth mentioning that could have been used for stealth, boring character designs, stiff animations and just an overall washed out look to the game.  The visuals aren't terrible, just dated.The presentation is where the game really suffers, especially compared to a game like Mass Effect or even Fallout 3.  There aren't any real cool cut scenes in the game, the voice acting sounds tired and unconvincing, no cinematic moments which really get your adrenaline going and a complete lack of personality for a game which claims to be modeled after Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne and James Bond.  Those movies are highly stylized, Alpha Protocol is just plain.  Coincidentally, the game uses the old throwback Sega logo from the 90s (which is pretty cool) and the title screen looks like it is from the 90s with the title music sounding like something I would have heard on my Genesis.  I kind of liked the old retro look and sound for the introductions, but it's distracting during the actual gameplay.  I'm supposed to be a spy, travelling around an exotic world to foil an elaborate conspiracy yet everything is presented with such a lack of inspiration.The A.I. is where the game really falters.  I can deal with dated visuals, old school RPG gameplay and a bland presentation, but at least give me some smart A.I. to shoot it out with, sneak up on or trick with my gadgets.  The enemies in this game are so stupid at times that it can make the game feel broken in certain areas.  Reading your dossier on different enemies makes it sound like you have to change up your strategy for different missions depending on the type of foe you face, but unofrtunately this is not the case.  There really isn't much difference in enemy tactics, especially when it comes down to them running down a hallway where you can just pick them off one by one.  I mean seriously, can't they see all of their dead friends piling up in front of them?  Maybe it's not a good idea to just follow them?  My favorite moment (sarcasm, ofcourse) is when they decide to lower their gun and just rush at you from 30 feet away, so they can punch you, and then back up and start shooting.  I played on hard and started off as a recruit, I chose the most difficult path for my first playthrough and really didn't have much of a challenge thanks to the lackluster A.I.One other issue I had with the game is the layout.  It just didn't feel as free or open as other Black Isle/Obsidian games.  It all felt very linear to be honest.  You have a few different \"safehouses\" you can go to and set up base in places like Taiwan, Rome and Moscow.  Ok, it sounds like you get to do some serious world travel which should be exciting, but once you are at each destination, you can't leave your safehouse unless it is to complete a mission, which you are automatically transported to.  I really would have liked to have been able to explore Rome or Moscow a bit by walking outside of my safe house, but all you can do is access your emails and a black market ebay known as the clearinghouse through your computer and then choose which mission you wish to do.  You do have the choice of which safe hosue you wish to go to first and which order you want to do the missions but that is about it.  You go to a safe house and you complete a mission, then another, then another, until you finish everything you need to do in that area and move to another safe house where you do more missions.  Pretty much every mission involves infiltrating a base or headquarters, where is my unconventional spy stuff?  I would have loved to have had to follow a person of interest through a crowd, having to duck into alleys or sit down on a park bench everytime they looked over their shoulder.  I would have much preferred exploring the town on my own and finding my own contacts instead of just getting tipped off by my handler or receiveing emails or running into them through a contrived cutscene.  At one point, the term \"yellowbrick roading\" is explained in a piece of intellegence you find (look for these throughout the game) explaining that agents of the highly secretive Alpha Protocol are expected to create their own funds so money couldn't be traced back to the agency.  OK, how about letting me do some of this yellow brick roading myself by performing sideqeusts and extracurricular work to bring in the money?Obsidian makes a big deal about the high level of reactivity to it's conversation system, but I can't comment on this too much considering I only played through it once and don't really have the urge to do so again.  There are plenty of options you can choose in a conversation, and I know of one character in particular I never got to meet because of the options I chose but the main story is just so absurd that I don't feel like going back and trying to find alternate endings or paths (many of the alternate endings I can achieve just by replaying the last mission different ways, some are pretty neat to watch).Now it sounds like I have been pretty hard on this game, and I have, but I did enjoy msyelf in many areas.  The one thing that could have made a real difference in this game would have been the writing, which Obsidian normally excels at.  The bland presentation, stupid A.I., and flat voice acting could have been overlooked had the storytelling been something special, but it just fell flat on its face imo.  For one, the characters are just so shallow and uninteresting.  There is little depth to them, little personality and they are just plain boring.  Now there are some great secondary characters in here, I particularly enjoyed a certain Russian mob boss who had a fascination with '80s American pop culture, I also enjoyed an unhinged American agent in Taiwan I met up with as well as a mysterious older gentleman who lead his own secret society of sorts, but otherwise the characters had little to keep me interested or form a connection with of any kind.  The main plot throughout most of the game relied on the tired old cliche of an evil multinational corporation as the main antagonist, obviously modeled after Haliburton and then the conspiracy at the end is so far out there it is either insulting to my intelligence or offensive, perhaps both.  I was expecting something much more clever from Obsidian at the end but instead I just got a rehash of the same old crackpot conspiracy theory crap that you hear shouted on college campuses or late night talk radio.  It's like a mixture of X-Files-esque Black Helicopter paranoia mixed in with Bush derangement syndrome and topped off with 9/11 truther hysteria.  Remember the first X-files movie where the conspiracy revolved around a plot to use FEMA during a crisis to take over the country?  Yeah, well, that is much more plausible than what the writers of AP have cooked up.  Is Chris Avellone a 9/11 truther?  I love his past work but maybe he should stick to the realm of Fantasy because apparently that is where his politics come from.  I swear, I was half expecting one final twist at the end where I had to expose a birth certificiate cover up by the President, or that we never landed on the moon, that's how nutty the story got.  Had the game been much more grounded in terms of plot and storytelling, it would have been much more enjoyable.  Or maybe if the game didn't take itself so seriously, I could have stomached the story the same way I was able to get through the tongue in cheek Roger Moore Bond films.If you're a fan of Obsidian and RPGs, particularly those with old school RPG gameplay like Deus Ex (though Deus Ex is leagues better), then check this out.  I had a lot of criticism for this game but that's mostly because I did have fun, I was just frustrated by the many missed opportunities and wasted potential.  I paid [...] bucks and felt I got my moneys worth, but I would recommend others pick it up for 40 or less.As a letter grade I give Alpha Protocol a C.  Obsidian can, has and will do better than this.  I look forward to Fallout: New Vegas.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000R0PLK2","description":"Electronic Arts Inc. The Orange Box 9849 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Lots of gaming for your buck","reviewText":"Color me crazy but I just don't \"get\" Half-Life 2. The original that is, I just was never a big fan of it yet everyone who talks about great single-player experiences always references the game and yet for me personally I could just never really get into it. So why am I checking out the Orange Box, which collects that, plus its episodes as well as Portal and Team Fortress 2? Well, can't beat that price since I've seen fully brand-new copies at 20$ plus it has 5 games in it so based on that, you'd think the Orange Box is one of the best things ever to get and it is, since a lot of people enjoy Half-Life 2 and its episodes, many LOVE Portal as well as the goofiness and zany qualities of Team Fortress 2 so I'd definately recommend the Orange Box since it's got Portal on it. Sure it's short but I don't care.Half-Life 2: The game centers on the important-yet-mute Gordon Freeman, a scientist last seen in the mishaps at Black Mesa (the first Half-Life) and is now entering City 17 which is being overrun by the Combine. With Alyx Vance, her dad Eli, Alyx's pet robot DOG as well as your trusty Gravity Gun, \"The Freeman\" (as called by the vortigaunts) must escape the Combine and hopefully figure out what the Combine are up to.For starters, Half-Life 2's design is just plain odd to me. Many times I'll be on the run, being chased yet I gotta spend a few minutes putting bricks on a seesaw or getting out of my buggy every 3 minutes to turn off a force field. At least Bungie makes vehicle sections short but awesome, Valve seem to make their vehicle sections long for the sake of being long and it's my one gripe about the game. But the best part is using the Gravity Gun since it can become a formidable weapon as well as a puzzle solver. Grabbing saw blades to cut zombies in two? Awesome. Grabbing energy balls and vaporizing the Combine? Sweet. And unlike other FPS games, all items you find you keep and sure it doesn't make sense how Gordon has the pockets for a shotgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher, 2 handguns, a bowgun, a crowbar, a pulse rifle AND the gravity gun, being able to switch on the fly helps keeps combat fresh. I'd say of the 5 games here, this one's my least favorite.Half-Life 2: Episode One and Two: After the end of the last game, Gordon and Alyx are on the run from the Combine after they've stolen something of incredible worth. There's not much to Episode One other than sewers, puzzles and helping to evacuate City 17 but it's short and sweet so it's not too bad. Episode Two however is awesome with 2 major events happening to Alyx, another glimpse and slightly more insight into the \"G-Man\" as well as epic encounters between DOG and a Strider and a 13 Strider attack (the achievement for this is a *****!\") It looks the best though it's got its share of dull sections but the better of it as a whole.Portal: You play as Chell, a test subject at Aperture Science where you go through 19 testchambers involving puzzles and physics, your portal gun, your Weighted Companion Cube and gLaDoS, the Computer AI overseeing your tests. This game is short and I can probably knock it off in about an hour now but there's no funnier or awesome experience than Portal. The lines, the Cube, that SONG! The puzzles are braintesting (at first) but its still one of the top games I've played and definately my favorite from Valve.Team Fortress 2: Like Killzone 2, TF2 relies on various classes for this multiplayer-only game. Unlike Gears of War or Halo 3 where weapons have to be found or Call of Duty where you can have a specific weapon loudout, you instead choose classes that will act differently on the battlefield. Some can set up defensive turrets, some heal others with their medic gun while you got the heavy, a mini-gun toting big dude (the guy on the right on the box). Then you got favorites like the flamethrower Pyro or the Spy who like to cloak themselves and disguise themselves as enemy players. It's a frantic and fun multiplayer however since this is the Xbox 360 version, it doesn't have the frequent updates, patches and whatnot that the PC version gets and this game still has exploits and cheats so if you want the achievements, I'd say boost this one but for the definitive Team Fortress 2 experience, get the PC version.The Orange Box is a strange game collection to be sure. The best game on it as it at best 2-3 hours long, the multiplayer-only one is better on the PC but if you don't own a quality gaming PC rig, there's not a lot better than the Orange Box....aside from TF2 updates. Come on Valve!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"I'm disappointed","reviewText":"After all the fanfare and publicity, I am sorry to say I was very let down by this game. Rather than a whole new adventure it is more like an add-on. Or something along the lines of a clips show with guest stars. Playing it made me re-assess how good FF13 actually was - despite it having flaws, it was a good solid game with a plot and an awesome battle system. This one...well, sorry to say it, but it's a bit of a mess.This time around you play as Serah (Lightning's sister, a character with a miniscule role in the preceding game). Serah has been saved from crystal and now wishes to start her new life, but Lightning is nowhere to be found. Instead, Serah meets a feisty teenager with a big sword and spiky hair called Noel, who tells her he has come from the future, where he met Lightning in alarming circumstances. Together the pair decide to travel across time and try and find Lightning.Now as plots go, that's hardly earth shattering. Not much to do with an evil menace trying to wipe out the planet, just a girl looking for her sister. It already screams \"expansion pack\" instead of a whole new game. And as the duo start to travel through time they come across (yes you've guessed it), stars of FF13 such as Hope and Snow, who pop up in their own little chapters. I found this very lacklustre. Especially when Serah meets Snow - their chapter sees them run around a forest fighting, and when the chapter boss is dead Serah says something like \"Thanks for the help, I am off through a portal to the next time rift now\" and yet Snow is supposed to be her fiance who had beaten insurmountable odds to rescue her!! The appearance of Vanille and Fang is even worse, they are like celebrity guest stars appearing via satellite to offer encouragement and wave for the camera. A lot of the cut scenes are like this... nothing but schmaltz.Anyway down to the battle system. Happily, it uses the same Paradigm system as the last game which is great. But here's a shocker - you only have a team of two (Noel and Serah) for the entire game! What happened to the team of 6 to choose from? In this game you never change members, so all your levelling up is exclusively for this pair. As a result I found their rise through levels and experience very speedy as obviously there was no worries about how to distribute Chrystarium points, so both of them rapidly maxed out all their man role abilities. And maybe it was just me, but this game is darned EASY. After I had reached the middle portion of the game I found that I could auto-battle my way through every random encounter by just repeatedly hitting the X button without even looking at the screen. Something's wrong if you can play like that. Even boss battles lasted about 30 seconds, which was quite different from those found in FF13 - remember the battles against Barthandelus? There's nothing like that here.However despite the problems, i did like one new feature - Noel and Serah have a \"monster team\"! After random battles there is a random chance that you may \"win\" a defeated monster as a battle drop, and they can be used as a third team member. The monsters all have set roles Medic, Commando, Ravager, etc, and a set of skills that grow as they level up, including a unique \"limit break\" skill for each one, too. Monsters are levelled up by using ingredients that can be bought or dropped after battles - and this was actually where the lifespan of the game is extended greatly, as some of the high level ingredients cannot be bought - you just have to fight continually in the hope of earning a few after each fight. The range of monsters you can keep is very large - and it's quite a tough choice deciding which ones to feed up with the rare materials. Of course all gamers will have favourites, and you can have Chocobos, Big Flans, Mini Flans, Cactaurs or Goblins, or whatever takes your fancy, and its fun to see them in action. My personal favourite for a large portion of the game was the Feral Behemoth - gotta love the power!Still even that became boring after a while - all that grinding just to earn rare drops to build the monsters abilities really outstayed it's welcome, however there are some rare monsters that players might enjoy trying to find.Finally then, it's back to the plot - For me, this was the weakest part of the game. Anything that involves time travel and it's anomalies is dicing with disaster, and this is no exception. A very ambitious set up makes the plot extremely hard to understand. Changing the future changes the past and vice-versa...characters appear and disappear due to anomalies...I got lost all the time. Later on in the game, you are able to revisit areas and replay them to make different decisions. The game makes out that this is a big deal but it actually isn't, all that happens is you can view a special cut-scene that shows a short clip of an \"alternative ending\", but the real flow of the game only ever goes in the same direction.To summarise then, this is a short, easy and un-involving game. Easy yet confusing. Easy because of the battles, confusing because you don't know what you are doing or why. Some side quests ca only be unlocked by meeting a set of incredibly obscure conditions that you would never work out unaided - such as finding hidden artefacts that open time gates, or knowing which weather settings reveal hidden Cactuar statues and where ...you'll know which bit I mean if you tried to do that quest! With two characters who you don't develop any real feelings for. The game is marketing around Lightning, but she's not a playable character apart from in the prologue, yet she's far more interesting that Serah or Noel.As far as I am concerned, selling this at the same premium price as FF13 is a bit cheeky. It looks fantastic of course - I'd expect nothing less than this superior level of realism, so that goes without saying - but I finished it (reached last boss I mean, not 100% completion) in a couple of weeks and that's short for me playing a FF title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"Superior to the original in almost every way","reviewText":"In my original review of this game, I was still caught in nostalgia for the original game and considered this one inferior. Now, having had the chance to play them both side by side, I have to honestly wonder why more people didn't give this game a chance. It is, without a doubt, a far superior product.FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 is the sequel to FINAL FANTASY XIII and begins proper three years after the end of the first game. Lightning has gone missing and is thought to be either dead or encased in the crystal pillar supporting Cocoon. Only her sister Serah remembers her ever being in the events of the first game's ending. Together with a mysterious boy from the future named Noel, she sets out to travel up and down the timeline to solve paradoxes, fix the timeline, and bring her sister back from Valhalla, an alien land at the end of time.Without a doubt, the gameplay is far superior to the original. The battle system has been streamlined. Actions trigger much more quickly. Remember when getting a preemptive strike meant waiting for the leader to hit each individual enemy, even if there were a dozen of them? Not anymore: Noel and Serah leap forward together and blitz the enemies, also beginning the battle with Haste (which, as far as I know, cannot be otherwise obtained as a buff). Swapping Paradigms while a Sentinel is guarding cancels their stance directly into their new role, instead of having to wait for that bar to finish emptying. Paradigms, on top of being able to be customized around an hour into the game, can also now be \"tuned\": the three-Commando \"Cerberus\" Paradigm can be \"tuned\" to \"cross\", for example, meaning all three attack the same enemy at once - no more targeting three different enemies if you don't want them to. Roles can be learned only an hour or two into the game for both Serah and Noel.The Crystarium system is significantly less linear this time around. Stats can be customized to boost health or another stat depending on the role being upgraded and whether you're upgrading a large node or a small node. Capturing monsters and adding them to your Paradigm Pack gives you the aforementioned third member of the party. Monsters can fit into one role each and generally have more abilities than Noel and Serah. Special stat-boosting items are used to upgrade monsters through several ranks. You can have up to three different monsters in your party at once, which swap out as you change Paradigms.FINAL FANTASY XIII took many hours to really open up, making the player wait until chapter eleven to even be allowed to choose which characters are in your party. FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 opens up immediately, allowing you to customize your party and gain roles, as well as role boosts, within the first area. Tutorials are kept to a minimum. In the second area, you even have the choice of three Time Gates - portals to other times and areas in the Historia Crux - leading to three different paths immediately. Side quests are available immediately. There's items to hunt down and special treasure chests to uncover. Some quests even send you into several areas just hunting down items or people.FINAL FANTASY XIII was and remains one of the most beautiful games ever made. This is where FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 stumbles, as the visual quality is subpar even compared to other games of this generation. Character models are of lower resolution this time around, meaning shadowing looks strange at times and textures look pixelated or blurred quite often on character models, though it isn't as noticeable on environments. However, the animation has greatly improved, from the way the hair looks to the animations during battle to the absolutely stunning opening CG movie. Lip movements have been localized for English and look very convincing (except when the in-game really-low-resolution models are used). Weather looks lovely and water is well done. Particle effects are nicely animated. Cloth simulation is very nice as well.FINAL FANTASY XIII had a beautiful soundtrack with some of the best motifs in the series and with enough variation to sound both futuristic and traditional. FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 has a very eclectic soundtrack, ranging from Euro-techno to rap (on the soundtrack and in the Japanese version) to old standbys like sweeping orchestral tunes and, of course, the obligatory epic boss music with the Latin lyrics. I personally count it among the best in the series, fitting better with cutscenes this time (with some pieces being composed to fit only with the single scene it appears in, like the hauntingly beautiful \"An Arrow Through Time\" at the beginning of the game).The game also opens with you playing, briefly, as Lightning in Valhalla as you engage in an epic clash with her rival, Caius Ballad, which acts as a tutorial for both the streamlined battle system and the new Cinematic Actions, which give you a measure of control over some of the cutscenes. I enjoy the addition of these Actions, as they add more interactivity to the game instead of passively sitting and watching as much of FINAL FANTASY XIII was spent doing. These Actions also occur during battle, such as to trigger your monsters' Feral Links (special actions that do such things as attack the enemy or buff your party).Notice I didn't mention anything about the story. The story isn't as good as in the first game, although enough things are explained this time around that they're easier to understand. However, the story sometimes meanders, and it takes a bit of scrutiny, study of the Datalog (the entries in which are more concise this time around), and paying attention to understand. Still, it's not the worst that could be offered, and in the end, all things considered, the fantastical elements merge together well, better than the Sci-Fantasy mix of the first game.All in all, my guess is that the disappointment of the first game colored the expectations for this game. If you liked the first one at all, try this one - it's so much better. If you didn't like the first one, this might not change your mind, but is still a really fun game in its own right. Regardless of your opinion, give this game a chance. Definitely at least worth renting, and I plan on keeping my copy for a long time yet.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}

With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit in the beginning. \n\nIn the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console (for that time) and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming.

My NESbrought back so many fond memories. Jump back in time to the middle of 1985. My Parents offered to buy myyounger brother and I an NES from Target. We politely declined their offer, however I would regret not wantingthem to purchase it for the 2 of us. At the time I was attending GWC in H.B. CA. There was a store right next toGWC. That store was Home Express, they sold home furnishings and of course NES and Genesis consoles aswell as numerous games and acessories. One day after all my classes ended, my friend and I went to the HE storeand found the Video Game section. The sales person in charge of the video game section let my friend and Iplay some NES games on a TV screen that was mounted on the wall. The Tv&#34;s were mounted so high that afterawhile your neck would get sore. Well, I bought the NES and had it ever since.After all that time has passed, I've experieced no problems with my NES. There are people who had problemswith their NES consoles like games not loading, flashing red light, etc. I believe some of these problems were due toabuse and poor handling of their console. People, you have to clean your console contacts and game contacts aswell as the outside. I've never spilled any liquid on it, dropped it, hit it, or anything. If you treat your console right,it'll last a lifetime. The NES controllers were pretty good for most games, although I recently bought a used NESAdvantage from Amazon that works great and guess what? It was the exact same NES Advantage I had over 20 yrsago! Talk about a great coincidence, this joystick controller was the best and still is for playing games on the NES.Now back then, Nintendo had a huge selection of games in every genre imaginable. Man, I must have had over50 games at one point. There were some awesome games as well as crappy ones.The first I bought was Solomon'sKey made by Tecmo, it's a highly addictive but hard puzzle game. The second game I bought was The Legend ofZelda by Nintendo. The games I bought were from Toy'sRUS, Games 4 Less, and Discount Video Games.The graphics and music of some of these games are incredible for an 8-bit system of it;s time. SMB 2, SMB 3,Ninja Gaiden 1-3, Final Fantasy, and others as well. To me, gameplay was more important than graphics.If a game wasn't fun, I wouldn't buy it. I can say that most of these NES are fun to play, have good graphics andmusic. The NES is easy to set up, just plug the av cord into your TV and plug the ac adapter in and you're good togo. These days I've experienced a demand for old NES consoles and games, people want to relive their childhoodand share it with their kids and family. The NES is a great console to have if you want to experience the old daysof 8-bit gaming history.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2014"}

The graphics are great, the story is nifty, the combos look great, the use of the Sixaxis controller is innovative and makes sense.  Length of this game is not so short that I would complain about it.  Strangely enough, even though this game shines graphically, it still plays at 720p, not 1080p.This game is very similar to Dynasty Warriors, except the bad guys don't die as easily (luckily, there are fewer of them), and there are fewer power-ups dropped.  Unfortunately, there is no dual-player mode like Dyanasty Warriors.One big issue I had was that there are portions of this game, some outside of a fight, and some within a fight, that a specific combination of timed button pressing and joystick moving is needed to succeed.  This doesn't appear to be affected by the difficulty level, so even at the easiest level, my younger kids (and myself) have a problem completing the first few tries.  It would be great if there was a \"kiddie mode\" that makes these events either auto succeed or are much more forgiving.Overall, this game is definitely recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2008"}

There have been some failed system launches with either very few games or just poor ones. The PS3 was not such a console especially with Heavenly Sword backing it and wowing gamers across the world. Heavenly Sword puts the characters Nariko and Kai in your hands as you battle an evil warlord trying to take over your clans' land.Right from the start of the game you get introduced to sweeping epic landscapes, amazing graphics, beautiful sounds, and a great, albeit simple, combat system. For being a launch title the game has excellent production values and they really shine for the PS3.The most important part of Heavenly Sword is the combat system and it never falters. You don't receive the Heavenly Sword until a bit into the game, but once you do you are welcomed to three different fighting styles on the fly. Instead of having to stop the game and switch styles you can use them with just holding down a button. You are always in \"speed\" mode which breaks the sword into two swords while L1 puts you in \"range\" mode that is kind of like Kratos' chain swords in God of War (which Heavenly Sword receives its nick name \"Goddess of War\"), and lastly holding down R1 puts you in \"power\" mode. There are a good amount of combos that let you switch in and out of these styles with amazing animations, and a cinematic sweeping camera. Another element to the game play is the counter system. The enemy will glow the color of the style you need to be in to counter. Standing still is automatic block so hitting an attack button at the right time will perform a killer counter attack.On top of this you play as Kai who has a deadly semi-automatic crossbow that can be controlled with \"aftertouch\" which is controlled with the SixAxis motion controls. This was one of the first game to really utilize the SixAxis with bone crunching and nasty kills from guided bows or anything else you can hurl at the enemy.Puzzles in the game aren't really a challenge since there aren't many of them, but the bosses are. Each boss has multiple health bar, and once you get one knocked down you initiate a button pressing sequence by hitting circle (sounds just like God of War). Some bosses are just downright hard and seem impossible to beat, but remembering their attacks is the key.Not only does the game look and sound amazing, but the story is riveting ad so is the acting. With full motion capture sequences this game has some of the most realistic facial animations I have ever seen. With Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings, Ink Heart) as a director and actor on board you are treated with amazing work.If the combat isn't satisfying enough for you there are epic battles where you fight thousands of soldiers on-screen at once. Shooting a cannon and using after touch is just so satisfying especially towards the end of the game. If you are also curious about collecting items you can unlock stuff by doing certain tasks or meeting certain goals in each section of the game. With such a beautiful game you would want to see how it was made.If I had to see a flaw in Heavenly Sword it would be that the game is extremely short clocking in at 4-6 hours depending on your play style. You could literally beat this in one or two long play sessions. The game also has some technical issues with some slow down, and occasional choppy animation. The combat is also a bit shallow and a tad to button mashy. Other than that I can't wait for the sequel to be announced, but it has been over 3 years and no word, so I feel this great new IP has been abandoned.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0014ET6EM","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A charming sequel to a great series","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous presentation with an engaging story, lots more to do, your dog is a great companion, you can't die!The Bad: Even though there's more to do it's very tedious, story is still too short, light on the RPG elementsFable II is another Western RPG that really tries to use a lot of action mixed with RPG elements and tagging a good story in it. Fable was a big deal when it came out because it was one of the few games that let you choose to be good or evil with every single task they threw out at you. Everything you did affected how the game turned out and these included things from terrorizing towns with crude expressions to giving money to a church. Fable II continues this is tons of things for you to do and tons of way to go about doing so. When you start the game out your introduced to the story and you get to choose your main character; whether it be a boy or a girl is your choice. As a child you go about performing small tasks to get used to the idea of how to play the game. These range from finding things for people to helping children fend off bullies. This is also a crucial point in the game for heading down your good or evil path. You can choose to give arrest warrants that you find to the sheriff or give them to the criminals for a reward.The whole game evolves like this and it really makes an impact later on. Once you get the hang of the game you can equip better weapons, buy food, potions etc. One great thing about Fable II is that you get a dog by your side and he helps you hunt out treasure chests and places to dig. You can upgrade him by finding or buying books that will upgrade his treasuring hunting abilities. Your dog also helps you in battle and if he gets to hurt you can heal him; also, mind you, that he can play a part in expressions (more on those later). Surprisingly the AI for the dog is done very well and he looks, sounds, and acts like a real dog. Rarely did he get in the way or couldn't find his way around an obstacle, and same goes for enemies as well. While you can buy more powerful weapons (blunt, slashing, stabbing you know the type) to kill enemies there is no armor for you to buy.All you can do is buy clothes and these just add to your looks which effects other things in the game (more on socializing later). The game consists of three different elements to upgrade with and that's skill (ranged weapons), will (magic), and strength (melee). You upgrade yourself by absorbing the appropriate orbs after defeating an enemy or using the appropriate potion. It takes awhile to start getting the higher level stuff, but once you get further into the game you earn experience more quickly. You can customize your character a lot by buying tattoos, getting makeup done etc. You can also even dye your clothes now which is cool.Combat in the game is pretty simple yet satisfying: You use X to attack, Y for ranged, B for magic. Melee attacks can be charged while ranged weapons have other abilities like a TPS (third person shooter) mode, lock on etc. Magic is a bit different this time around since you have a \"Magic Tree\" that you access by holding down the RT and this brings up a series of bubbles. Each bubble is a higher level and you just equip which spell you want in each bubble. For example if you have a level 1 shock, level 2 blades, and level 3 wind you hold down the B button and let go when you get to the spell you want. This is really easy to use and I found this very useful. While combat is a large portion of the game socializing has always been a huge part of Fable and Fable II expands on this quite a bit. You can now get jobs and these range from blacksmithing to bartending. While these jobs are tedious they are almost required to earn a lot of gold to buy better items. These jobs are timing mini-games and can be pretty difficult to master. Each job has five different levels and you have to earn a certain amount of gold on that level before moving on. One important thing to note is you can never die! When you \"die\" you just lose all the experience that's lying around on the ground...this can either be great or bad for you depending on your playing style.Now Fable II has a whole marriage, child, sex thing and it's very useful if you want it. You have expressions you learn in the game by becoming more renowned in the world by completing tasks. certain expressions can be used to flirt, be rude, make people laugh etc. When you do these expressions you'll attract people and eventually someone might start liking you so much they'll offer gifts and even fall in love with you. When they do you offer them a wedding ring and set your home (more on buying property later) as the marital home and you're married. You have to go back sometimes and visit your spouse or they start hating you eventually will divorce you. You can have sex (yes it's blacked out you pervs!) either protected or unprotected and this can lead to child birth. Sometimes having unprotected sex with prostitutes can lead to STDs...and well you don't want to get those. Often you must come back and give your child a gift and use good expressions on them to keep them happy.Expressions are really a good way to also scare people during combat or to get your way in towns. You can also buy property and houses and even buy furniture and furnish them to your liking. If you don't want to move into one you can rent it out even. The same goes with stores and you just accumulate income as time goes on. If you want you can set a budget limit for your family to keep them happy so you can visit them less. This is great once you start buying a lot of property in the world. While the world is huge with lots of areas to visit they are all broken up with fairly long load times (even when the game is ripped to the HDD). There is a lot to do in the world of Albion such as solve Demon Door quests, hunt for treasure, finish jobs and side quests etc.You really never run out of things to do it's just when you decide the game is over; that's all up to you. The game looks absolutely amazing and you often stop and look at the scenery and take it all in. Fable II is one of the best looking games right now and the sound is even marvelous too. Fable II is just such a charming game (the pub games are confusing though!) with a few minor flaws that can be overlooked though. Often does combat feel tedious after a while and the main story is still pretty short. While there is a lot more to do it's all repetitive quests and other things to do. If you get to bored you can join in the co-op play, but even then you'll get bored after about 20 hours or so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Deus Ex, however, adds an unprecedented level of intelligence to a genre previously devoid of any thought other than \"if it moves, kill it\".Deus Ex follows Agent JC Denton on his first assignment for UNATCO - an anti-terrorist group with wide-reaching jurisdiction.  JC is a special nanotech-augmented cyborg with a wide range of superhuman abilities.  You are able to customize your character throughout the game in an RPG-esque style.  Want to go in with guns blazing?  Increase training in heavy arms and pistols.  Want to take out the bad guys from a distance?  Focus on Rifle training.  Want to hack into the security system and have it eliminate the bad guys for you?  Train heavily on electronics and computers.  Want to be able to heal yourself instantly?  Train up on Medicine.  Depending on how you train your character, the gameplay changes significantly.  This not only adds tremendous amounts of depth, but also increases the replay value.  As if that wasn't enough, the storyline is very intricate and boasts some superb twists.  You will end up not knowing who to trust as the game goes on.

I selected it because my 13 year-old son likes music and always wanted to try \"scratching\" the records on our old phonograph!  I thought this game would give him the opportunity to try it and it did.  Because the demo version is so limited (only three mixes of songs), he quickly became tired of it and I found it back on my desk.  Knowing that I had to provide a more thorough and accurate review than his \"you just push buttons,\" I sat down for about an hour and went through the tutorial and all three mixes on \"Easy\" and \"Medium.\"I found the turntable controller fun to play with but with so many possible movements I did find my right hand, which controls the tapping keys and scratching technique, twisted around in some uncomfortable positions.  The variety of different techniques (tapping, scratching, and moving the cross-fader) sure does add variety to the game.  After a while I found myself thinking of this as a hand/eye coordination challenge more than a music challenge. Which actually made the game more entertaining for me since I'm not a fan of the few songs included on the demo disk.I like the fact that there is no FAIL mode.  It was nice not to get kicked off as I was learning how to do the techniques.  And, I would have to agree with earlier postings about the limited scope of multi-play since it is limited to one other player with either a guitar or another turntable controller.

I've played it for the last few days and have loved every moment.This disc brings together a huge collection of almost all of Sega's best games from the Genesis era. All the expected titles are here -- the Sonic the Hedgehog games, the Golden Axe series, Space Harrier, Shinobi and much more -- plus some awesome stuff you might not expect. (Presumably we'll see games like Afterburner and the lock-on version of Sonic 3 + S&Knuckles; in a second installment.)Two of the biggest reasons to be wowed by this set are:Phantasy Star series -- With the four games included here (1-4), you get some of the best RPGs of the era and dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay. The ahead-of-its-time Phantasy Star, the stunning Phantasy Star II (which influenced the direction of Final Fantasy in a big way), the amazing epic Phantasy Star IV. Just these four games alone are worth the $30. Heck, DOUBLE that. No fan of JRPG's should go without playing these.Shining series -- Two predecessors of the popular Final Fantasy Tactics series (Shining paved the way for this sort of game) as well as a first-person dungeon crawler, these are fan favorites for a reason. They're great. Ahead of their time and they hold up great.And SO many more. Shinobi. The difficult roguelike Fatal Labyrinth. Fun platformer Alex Kidd. Tetris clone Columns. Even coin-op classic Zaxxon! A HUGE collection!All games allow you to save at any time, in any game, anywhere. This is a GREAT feature. Plus it saves high scores, has full 16:9 support for widescreen TVs, and you can toggle on graphics smoothing to make the games look even better than they did upon release. It's a dynamite feature. (The \"museum\" and interview extras are a nice bonus, too.)All in all this is one of the best retro gaming bargains of the year. Got my copy a few days ago and already have loads of hours under my belt. The inclusion of not one but TWO fan favorite RPG series gives this disc an enormous amount of play value.If you have any interest at all in retro gaming, ESPECIALLY if you were a fan of the Genesis era or if you missed out on the Genesis because you had a SNES, you owe it to yourself to grab this collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Pohle","summary":"The best FPS I've played in years","reviewText":"This is one amazing piece of software.  Seldom have I seen a game where mostly every aspect is done so competently.  Whether it be shooting, driving vehicles, hunting, stealth, A.I. or presentation, it excels at pretty much everything it sets out to do and combines all of these elements so seamlessly together that it leads to an incredibly immersive, tense experience and a game that's an outright blast to play from start to finish.Farcry 3 places you in the shoes of Jason Brody, who has been kidnapped alongside his friends while on vacation on Rook Island to be sold into slavery by pirates.  Jason escapes, his friends do not, and he sets out on a quest of self-discovery and vengeance to be able to get them back.  That's pretty much all you need to know about the story and what the game's about and to say anymore would spoil a slightly above average narrative that's nevertheless well told with interesting, well-fleshed out characters (Vaas is awesome....Kefka has some competition).  It's nothing extraordinary but it does the job and while it's not even close to the best cinema and literature have to offer, it does constitute one of the better efforts that gaming gives these days.Gameplay consists of three main components: shooting/stealth, looting/selling, and hunting/crafting.  It's very S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-ish in this respect and gives it more of an RPG flavor.  Jason starts out very limited in what he can carry (barely any weapons, ammo, mines, c4, etc.) and it's required to venture out into the wilderness to gather animal skins and plants to create bigger pouches and also ingredients to formulate potions for syringes that hold a variety of effects.  The early stages of the game really necessitate doing this as running into enemies and even the less dangerous animals can lead to an early demise very easily.  Many may find this an annoyance but I find it enforces consideration of action while also allowing the player become familiar with game mechanics and world.  This is made easier as the game world is HUGE and there is plenty of space to move around in to hide and experiment.  This game is simply massive, and it's all open for the exploring from the get go with a few exceptions.  The main objective (aside from story missions) are to deactivate towers a la Assassin's Creed which will reveal more of the map. From there you can clean up pirate camps, take on side missions, or do whatever you want to do.And the game makes sure to supply you with a large selection of destructive toys at your disposal to be able to do so.  From pistols to assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, mines, molotovs, or my favorite...the bow, choose your poison.  They each have their unique purpose and are all different enough to warrant experimentation and mostly all can have attachments such as silencers, scopes, or extended magazines, to name a few.  Killing of all types gains experience.  Experience affords skill points which allow new abilities to becoming unlocked, abilities such as multiple take-downs, swimming faster or deeper, reloading while viewing through the scope, healing quicker, etc.  Jason evolves in capability throughout and you pick these abilities based on your preferred playstyle (the heron, the shark, and the spider-stealth, aggressive, and another I can't remember).  Farcry 3 also gives a large assortment of vehicles to get around in such as hang gliders, jeeps, buggies, jet-skis, assault boats, and a particular item of fast travel obtained later on that is just AWESOME.  Don't want to bother trekking long distances?  Fast travel clear across the map to and from any enemy outpost you've cleared.But you'll more than likely want to drive or hump it because everything is so enjoyable and there's something happening over the next corner or a new place to explore.  The combat is intense and visceral, not only because the weapons modelling is well done but also because the enemy A.I., for the most part, knows what it's doing.  I find it astonishing that A.I. could be so good in such a vast environment but it is.  Enemies run from cover to cover and hide, flank, and will jump away from grenades.  They use grenades and molotovs and will pursue you relentlessly.  And their reactions are believable as well.  For example, if they witness a friend being taken down by an obvious sniper, they'll all immediately scatter in different directions and yell \"Sniper!!\", running to find cover based on the direction they thought the shot came from.  If they find a body they'll go investigate it and then spread out to search.  It certainly has its moments of stupidity like pirates driving into rivers and drowning, but all in all it does the job.  And I find the vehicles to be a blast to drive.  They feel just right to control and unlike many other games feel like they're actually on the road instead of just skimming above it.As I said in the first paragraph, one of the main things Farcry 3 does so well is immerse you in its world.  Everything feels alive, and this is due to a variety of factors.  Firstly, I've always found first person shooters never to be truly first person.  Mostly all FPSes I've played in the past have had a \"head camera on a stick\" feel to them.  Ubisoft has done an excellent job of making the player feel like they're in a virtual body that exists in the world and I find it lends a enormous sense of connection to playing the character and being in the environment.  This is all accomplished through first person animations of his actions.  When he jumps over a fence, you see his legs vault over.  When you climb a ledge, you see his arms pull him up.  Getting into a car has him move as if in a body instead of a simple camera moving there.  Healing shows him actually doing physical actions on his body (wrapping wounds with bandages, digging out bullets with a knife).  When animals attack they grip onto Brody's virtual limbs.  You get the idea.  THIS is true first person gaming if I've ever seen it.  Crysis and Mirror's Edge did it as well but IMO not as good as here.Secondly, the world is 100% dynamic.  Reason being is that it has its own ecologic system at play with many different animals that have their own behavior and present different threats.  There's also two opposing factions (pirates and rebels) that frequently get into engagements.  Animals will attack pirates and each other and oftentimes throw themselves into the middle of a firefight.  Refreshingly, it does not at all feel like Jason is the center of the world.  You can hear things such as gunfight going on from far away (often with panicked screams giving an indication of to the situation....\"It's a tiger!!! S***, shoot it!!\"), or animals fighting.  Entire camps can be cleared from a bear all of a sudden coming out of the wilderness to attack the enemy, just as you're ready to execute your plan.  It's a perfect recipe for emergent game-play and it's constantly happening....nothing is predictable on Rook Island.  Everything is so random it never becomes boring and it's quite easy to be pulled off the main quest to see what that sound is over the hill, which may lead you to doing a side mission that'll last for 15 minutes.All of this would be lessened if the presentation wasn't there to hold it up, but it is.  I upgraded my rig just for this and am running it on a 3.4 Ghz, 8 gigs, GTX 670 4 gigs running Windows 7.  It's on ultra and it is beautiful.  I still think modded Crysis looks better, but Farcry 3 is surely no slouch in the visual department.  There are a few bland textures here and there and pop-in when using the hang glider but that's to be expected with a game of this size.  While the visuals are decent, it's the sound that I find truly impressive.  Guns sound hefty and powerful.  Sniper shots crack and reverberate a few seconds in the air and vehicles sound like the squeaky old clunkers they are.  Jason grunts with exertion while climbing and huffs and puffs while sprinting.  The voice acting is superb as is the pirate chatter in and out of combat (pretty humorous as well).  The overall sound design only compliments the feeling of the world being alive and the feeling of you really being in it.As much praise I can lay at Farcry 3's feet, there are some negatives I can think of.  I'm editing this part, (12/27/12), as at this point patches have come out that have remedied a few of these issues when this review was initially written, and also to add some general observations after more extensive time with the game.On the technical side:-quests sometimes restart if something is not done in the proper order that the game is expecting, and oftentimes scripted events fail to trigger.-you can't save anywhere, it's all checkpoint based though the saving is very smartly done and almost never becomes a problem.-selling looted items has to be done one at a time instead of in groups which becomes tedious and cumbersome.-when reassigning buttons in the controls, the game carries these specific assignments to other saves.  So if two people have different keyboard configs in two separate game files, they have to change them back from the other's save file in the config menu each time they load their own game.-I've had some texture problems and it has crashed once.-A.I. is inconsistent, though I still maintain for how big the game is it's more than adequate.And some general gameplay gripes:-it all looks the same.  I know it's in the tropics, but I live on Maui and I can attest to you that it's not all palm trees and grass everywhere.  There's large expanses of desert drylands.  Deep dark rain forests with enormous ceilings.  Huge lava fields.  I must say, as big as Farcry 3's scope is, it's a disappointment that there's not more variety in its environments.-the early game is better than the late.  Reason being is that hunting and looting becomes pointless once everything is upgraded and all the weapons are unlocked.  Once that happens, all the incentive to explore is largely diminished.  They should have found a way to keep both just as important near the end as they were in the beginning.  Perhaps loot that didn't just translate into money but increased Brody's skill set or weapon capabilities.Despite the above, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  I have to admit, I don't like Ubisoft.  I find many of their business practices detestable and think they've fallen far from their heyday, but I'd be lying if I said that Farcry 3 hasn't restored some faith in them and in my eyes has proven they still have some serious talent under their belt.  It is an very well done open world FPS, to me the best in years that encompasses and executes everything that makes such games so enjoyable almost flawlessly.  If you're a fan of open world games in any way, then you owe it to yourself to play this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"Nice game for beginners (and lefties!)","reviewText":"Gotta say I was skeptical about Rocksmith from the get-go.  Given the somewhat disappointing attempt by Rock Band to incorporate a pro guitar feature with the (lackluster) Mustang controller, I was wondering how a real guitar would translate into the video game world.  I am glad this game proved me wrong.  Plugging in a real guitar is a snap (just plug the cable into the guitar, hook the cable up to your xbox via USB, turn on the game and you're ready to rock), and the game is pretty much self-explanatory.I won't rehash what all the other reviewers said.  I'll just share my personal experience with this game.  As a drummer in real-life who has cursory experience with the guitar via right-handed guitar lessons way back in the day - I wanted to relearn the instrument with my natural left hand.  Coupled with my love for the xbox, I figured I'd give this game a try.  Overall, I really felt it was fun and I liked how the game is forgiving and really adapts (on the go even in mid song) based on your skill level.  It's a wonderful feature that I think makes this a great game for beginners.  I do agree with others that this game might be too easy for intermediate players, but all in all it's a fun learning tool and the fact it works for lefties is GREAT!  I only docked a star because I wish this game had the option of teaching you how to read TAB or sheet music, but hopefully that will be addressed in Rocksmith 2 (if it ever comes out).  Otherwise, this is a great game/learning tool for folks looking to start from scratch.Note I do notice a slight delay on my TV (I'm using HDMI connection to a Sony LCD), but it's not that terrible.  I did adjust the lag to help compensate.Pros:Easy to pick up, plug in and playNice that the game keeps reminding you to tune your guitarFun mini-games help with practiceUseful lessons for techniques such as hammer-ons, pull-offs etcWorks for left and right handed guitarsAdapts to your skill level as you playDecent songs and DLC support (for now)Cons:Cumbersome interface with long load timesNo option to learn tab/read musicThere is the prospect of lag with HDMI only connection","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}

The new gameplay features better decision-making abilities, new paths to victory, and greatly enhanced combat and diplomacy for new ways to win. With a new interface and reporting screens,Civilization IIIwill accommodate seasoned and first-time players.","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"A much more challenging \"Civilization\"","reviewText":"There are only a few games I have stuck with to completion and Sid Meier is the only developer that has produced two of them - Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri.  This is not a reflection on the quality of other fine titles such as Half-Life, Quake 2, Diablo 2, Red Alert or others (I did finish the original Quake and C&C; though), it's just that I suffer from \"Adult Deficiency Disorder\" - there are so many new titles coming out that it's easy for me to put down what I'm currently playing.  The failure of others to copy his formula stands as a testament to how addictive his games are. I, like many of you, was highly anticipating this new offering.The graphics are up-to-date, and the game runs smooth.  Unfortunately, it suffers from the now-common annoyance of dumping the entire game on your hard drive (well, technically it's \"minimal\" install will put 500MB on the drive but it's good enough to deserve 700MB of space.)  I've only been playing this game a short while, but I'm writing this review to counter those who say this game is simply a cleaned-up version of Civ2.  They couldn't be further from the mark.One major difference in this new Civilization is the removal of the so-called \"unit block\", the tactic of placing units at various places on the map to block other units from passing by.  I used to exploit this weakness frequently to keep other civilizations from entering my territory or other lands I was planning on settling in.  Now units pass side by side without problem and even trespass on other lands quite frequently.The AI has significantly improved in this game as well.  I used to collect information and trade skills with every nation I had diplomatic relations with.  Now it's much more difficult to trade freely.  It's apparent I can no longer wheel and deal my way to greatness.  Instead the computer opponents are much more demanding and I usually can't trade skills without getting the short end of the bargain.  This will make winning the game thru economic domination much more difficult.I was able to beat both Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri the first time around.  Of course I made mistakes along the way and did things I would do differently had I played again, but for the most part I found the games challenging, but not difficult to beat.  Already in two plays of this game at monarch level (second from easiest), I have had to retire early as I am getting my (...) whooped!  The dynamics of this game have changed dramatically compared to the other two.  My initial impression is success in this game is more dependent on a \"land-grab\" strategy.  At least that's what the computer opponents seem to be doing.I'll put up a more comprehensive review once I get further along in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2001"}

The game gives a nice mix of adventure, action, romance, and a nice touch of comedic wisecracks that work wonders for the gameplay and the added bonus was the voice cast for the two main characters Nolan North who voices the Prince who is an incredible actor who many I think know well from the most recent PS3 game Uncharted and Uncharted 2 as well as many other video game and t.v. shows and Kari Wahlgren as the voice of Elika who has been a great voice actress for many cartoons and anime.  The animation for the characters is cell shaded which I feel brings a nice touch and the effect throughout the game are incredible as well as the acrobatics the characters do throughout the game.  This is a mostly acrobatic fighting game with a lot of jumping, sliding, climbing and etc etc so if you're not into that or dislike having to do those things in the levels of the game than this game might not be for you be before you become discouraged I do recommend at least trying it out by playing the demo you might just be surprised at how much fun you have.  The extras such as the bonus features an such are pretty decent and the soundtrack for the game fit it perfectly as well as the beautiful background that they made for each level of the game as you explore.  Also a little notice spoiler for people while some gamers found it a little annoying for me it was very helpful as the character Elika will save you from nasty falls if you make a mistake with a jump or wall run or the like by using her magic and putting you back on solid ground instead of your character dying and having to start over at a save point or at the beginning of the chapter level..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2010"}

Having played through Pokemon Platinum and SoulSilver, I had high hopes for White and was not disappointed.Although much of the premise is the same as previous Pokemon DS games, there are some new 3D-style graphics for the cities/locations and the Pokemon are animated during the combat sequences. The biggest change that I noticed was that TM's are re-usable now. So instead of buying/storing large quantities of TM's, they can be re-used as many times as necessary.My complaints about previous Pokemon games still applies to White, and that is the repetitive leveling process and the need to catch the correct type of Pokemon to successfully combat the bosses/opponents.Overall: 4/5 stars, TM's are now re-usable and the 3D-style graphics are nice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00008KTNW","reviewerName":"S. Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"Best action game since the 2D era","reviewText":"I actually give this game 4.5 stars, it isn't perfect but 4 stars don't do it justice.Remember playing Ninja Gaiden or Contra or something from the NES back in the day.  The games made you want to break the controller and you usually had to face a boss a few times before you had him mastered enough to squeak by. And sometimes there was this piece you just couldn't pass.  It was frustration, yet rewarding.  You experienced some of the most memorable and epic moments in gaming that way.  This game is like that.Sure it's not the late 1980s anymore but this new Ninja Gaiden is a worthy installment and does a good job of adapting the classic feeling to the series. It's full of fast paced action, yet you still feel in control.  You could slice by enemies with little effort if you perform well but you can also get careless and die at any moment.  Despite being a game full of fast action, it also has some defense moves, blocking, jumping, and above all rolling that really becomes key to pacing the action in your favor and getting out of harms way. You can upgrade your blade and other weapons you pick up along the way including different kinds of nunchucks.  This never gets tedious it's not like an RPG, it's just a simple 2 or 3 level upgrade that makes your weapon a bit stronger.Graphics, sound, and all production elements are up to scale with all the other great games.  You get a lot of different levels including army camps, caves, cities, airships most which are actually connected to each other.  Only early in the game when you start in your home town which looks like a basic ancient Japanese town and then board an Airship, will you jump to the level without actually getting there during gameplay or showing a cut scene of how you got there. All in all the graphics and action all flow very smoothly.The game isn't perfect, some people complain it's too hard, and the camera is a problem.  People said the same thing when the original Devil May Cry came out. And yeah, the camera sometimes puts you in a vulnerable position because you can't see, but I wouldn't even of thought of complaining about that if I hadn't heard other people talking about the camera problems.  I think that's just the genre, you got to deal with it.  It's not a first person shooter.The only real flaw I can think of is that the main attack button is the same as the button used to interact with the environment to solve light puzzles.  And sometimes during the middle of the action you'll suddenly interact with something, whether it's a downed Ninja that's holding something, a box with arrows or a door.  You'll be in the middle of the intense action and suddenly get near a door without even knowing and you'll be transferred to the other side of the door which is a different section all because the button to interact with doors is the same as the main attack button.  This could have easily of been avoided by the developers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2004"}

However, this is my first purchase of a basketball game by them since NBA 2K2 or so.  I am not the biggest basketball fan but I was a HUGE fan of their NFL series and hope that it comes back.  Anyway, I gave this one a try due to the huge popularity of the series and the interesting MyPlayer mode.  In fact, MyPlayer is the only reason I gave this game a try.  The Role-Playing aspect of playing as one person and living his career intrigued me.  The gameplay is smooth and fluid, and as usual for 2k sports, the commentary is amazing.  It's really like watching a real NBA game while playing.  However, I do feel that I should have jumped in with 2k12.  That was when they had the legends mode going on.  Or even 2k11 when they introduced the Jordan moments.  This year, they added the Dream Team but those other modes are gone.  I am also not a big fan of the Jay-Z presentation.  His taste in music is very different from mine.  I expected a lot of east-coast hip hop and I am from the dirty south...lol.  I find myself muting most of the tracks.  I feel adding him was unnecessary and do not agree with that decision.  More effort could have been put into making the dream team mode more interesting.  Anyway, the game is great overall and there's no reason you shouldn't try it if you love basketball games.  This game will probably hold my NBA needs for a loooong time.  I will not be a yearly buyer only because i like the NFL more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2012"}

All together about 5 discs taking about a total of 1.5 GB of harddrive space for not full installation meaning only game and not cinematics, expansion disk require for play. Note: Diablo 1 isn't required for Diablo 2 installation so 1.5 GB is from Diablo 2 alone. Diablo 1 only takes a couple of MB. The main reason anyone should get this is to play it on multiplayer mode with other players through 3 or so different relms-USWest, USEast, and Europe. Different relms just mean different time zones and people supposedly.Players that should play it nowadays would come upon the option of playing 7 different characters with the expansion set installed. Characters such as: The Necromancer(Summoner/Caster), Sorceress(Spell Caster, taken from D1), Amazon(Melee Bow or Spear related, taken from D1), Barbarian(Pure Melee hand to hand combat), Paladin(Part Caster/Part hand to hand combat, taken from D1), and the two new expansion characters the Assassin(Melee/Caster) and Druid(Summoner/Morpher/Caster). Each one has their own different spells, item functions and looks when equiped, different advantages and disadvantages when it comes to enemies and when versing other player character types and gameplay overall, etc.Playing this online now would give you the option of either choosing to put your character on normal mode, ladder mode, or hardcore mode. There are more, but I'm not familiar with them. Normal is just as it is, just playing simply for playing it. However, on ladder mode, you get a larger variety of items, the gameplay is different in some situations, things cost differently, and there are seasons in which after each season ends(about a year or so) and all ladder characters get resetted to NORMAL. So ladder is more based on time. Hardcore is hard to the fact that after you die, thats it, just serve for more of a challenge for the risk takers and probably more advance players. Currently ladder season during the making of this review is 2 and 3 is coming soon.Now, for an online review:Playing online requires you to be witty and to know your price in the market/trading area. Being witty includes not falling for cheap scams, knowing a good trade from a bad trade, taking advantage of a good situation when they come up, and so on. This is the thing about the game. To become decent you must play about 2 hours a day, to become good you must play about 3-4 hours daily, and the rest are for lifeless people. By the way, anyone here heard about the Korean boy that died from playing this game several days straight without sleep, bathroom breaks, food, etc? It was in the news. Thats another reason why this game becomes a bit shallow later, when the player realizes that no matter how much you play, its hard to get everything you want. Its like going on forever for not much at all. A good player can make about a few profitable trades a day. Gameplay online can also be very laggy at times, the pop error has been fixed. Rushing isn't as easy as you now need to get to level 25 to be rushed and leveled successfully. By the way, you can no longer go all the way to hell cows or nowadays Baal run and go from level 5 to 99.Expansion therefore has added Baal as the last boss, however, in my opinion, Diablo is still the hardest. Making it a total of 5 acts. Each act contains objectives. Boss goes as follow: Andariel(Melee/Poison), Tal Rasha(Melee/Ice/Poison), Mephisto(Fire/Melee/Ice), Diablo(Fire/Thunder), Baal(forgot, uses some sort of nova and blast). Any further information go to battle.net. This also excluding the secret cow level. Act one, in town, requirements:Warts leg at the town of tristrum, a scroll of town portal, and the cube from act 2.I remember when I was first introduced into this game around the time of version 1.09. Unfortunately I found out that I was slightly late for one of the most memorable version, version 1.08. 1.08 by the way, was the version of legendary items such as the constricting ring (100resist all, 100magic find ring), 1.08 Valor(over 249+ to vitality from what I remember at lvl 99 ), vampire gaze, shako, stormshield, etc. They make most of their later versions pale in comparison.I played for a few months in the beginning, got totally addicted to the game, but gave up after the pop error occured during a pvp (player vs player). Pop error is the error in the game during those later versions in which the character would be naked after losing, during the time when you go back out to get your body back, you end up picking up an item and being killed right after, resulting in your main body with all the items that your character was holding to explode and your item laying all over the ground for other people to grab. In this case, my most prized possession at that time, my windforce which took me weeks and 40 SOJS (stone of jordans ring) to get.Eventually going back to it, however, quitting several months later due to college and complaints from family and friends about my addiction. Sold account for $120.Just beware, this game can make you swing two ways, make you totally dismiss it or suck you in. Its hard to control yourself. If you have kids that need to do their school work, don't get them this game. Otherwise, get them it, its pretty good and should easily entertain you for months.

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"A wearing classic","reviewText":"Let's face it--Final Fantasy VII got the whole thing started again.  Back in the old days of 8-bit consoles and Commodore 64s, when Apple computers wasn't nerd-speak for \"I don't know how to run my machine,\" RPGs were a very narrowly targeted genre with little flavor or flash in them, and as the consoles outpaced the appeal of the text based, graphics poor style, they started to fall out of favor.  It was this game that opened the door for the whole next generation of RPGs and brought the genre into the mainstream, and this game did all those things for very good reasons.I'll start with the good, because I feel the need to stress that this is a game you'll probably enjoy.  There are a lot of flaws, but the fact of the matter is that you'll probably only notice them if you go looking for them.  What the game has going for it is a fairly intuitive gameplay interface, a cast of interesting characters, and a story that combines innovation with the same old epic qualities to make a nice, comforting blend.  Those are the most evident qualities this game has, and they outweigh the shortcomings by a long way.But there are shortcomings, they are significant, and they need to be admitted to.  First off, the graphics are just terrible by today's standards.  Forget history--I want to know if this thing's going to look good right now, and this is probably the worst game in the entire series in terms of current presentability.  The CG movies, while impressive, are exceeded with flagrant ease by every other subsequent Square release, the screens are drawn in a fuzzy fashion that gave me a headache if I tried to play for more than two hours in a row, and the game suffers from severe graphical design schizophrenia.  While I have enough imagination to reconcile the blocky, superdeformed character models used through most of the game with the slick, properly proportioned CG figures, that will definitely cause some people trouble.  While this game was certainly visually impressive when it came out, these days it just doesn't cut muster, and you need to keep that in mind when you pick it up (even it's next closest sequel in the series was infinitely better--you WILL notice the graphics problems).This game also can have race issues if you want it to.  If you're overly sensitive about the issue, I'd avoid this title.  Barrett is the only black man in the entire universe, and he's not that complimentary a character.  I don't particularly care--he was supposed to be Mr. T, and he turned out well in that regard, but if you intend to read some kind of general statement on the merit of people of a particular shade, you may as well just let this one pass by.The story is also a problem, contrary to the high praise that die-hard fans often give it.  This story is confusing for no particular reason, and the writers are totally lost in terms of how they want to tell their tale.  I like the characters--tell me what happens to them.  No?  Okay--then I'm saving the world.  So why do I care about this schmo's childhood trauma?  The total effect was that when I got to the end of the game, I felt incredibly shortchanged in terms of story fulfillment, since the characters' significance pretty much takes a nose dive on the third disk.  The story is needlessly complex at points and the major inconsistencies aren't dealt with particularly well (I do not consider a tube of goo an effective address to a plot hole).  While the plot is innovative and epic, it is also confused and meandering, and you may have to play through it twice to figure out what's going on.Again, though, I should stress that these problems aren't going to be too big if you don't want them to be.  These are things that you can ignore very easily while you play through the game.  The gameplay itself ranks among the best balanced ever, with random monster encounters (a BAD idea, but one that every game without Grandia or Chrono in the title seems to stick with) well tailored to the characters' levels and the game remaining appealing and challenging throughout.  This one will appeal to just about anybody, and it should be in any RPG fan's library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2002"}

Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"DMC 4 Beat, But Player Feeling More Beaten Down By Repetitiveness","reviewText":"I must admit it has taken me awhile to complete DMC4 (mainly due to GTAIV coming out and me being held hostage by it), but I finally completed it last night. After the largest (4GB, 30 minutes) install I had witnessed, I easily got into the action and controls of the game through its Stage 1 tutorial-style level. I wasn't blown away with the graphics at first (as the other DMC's were all great looking on the PS2), but once outside of the church, it was breathtaking. Even the textures in the real-time cutscenes were rendered so wonderfully (pay attention to the detail in the clothing).The game features 20 stages, with a majority played as Nero and some played as Dante. (I don't believe this is a spoiler as anyone reading articles up to the release would know that.) The stages are varied from castle interiors, to snowscapes, to jungles, etc. Each of these locales pushes the PS3's graphics and audio.Nero's controls are simpler than Dante's but just as easy and/or hard, depending on timing, and unique in some regards. His devil empowered hand and its attacks are perhaps the most unique, as he can grab enemies close or from afar and throw them to the ground. (I found it a quick and easy way to dispose of many enemies. Very useful with fighting some boss characters as well.) For the most part though, Nero and Dante have many similar moves, except for Dante's four styles of fighting, which greatly double or triple his move set. (Ironically, I still found myself using only one of his styles--Swordmaster.)The variety of enemies is very good and many are introduced as if they are mini-bosses who are very tough until you learn their attacks, how to avoid them, and their weak spots. (There is one made of electricity which is very difficult at first.)The boss characters are all very unique and different and some require multiple attempts to defeat, though if it takes more than 2-3 times, I'd be surprised. However, herein lies the only problem with DMC4--the boss characters and the last 40% of the game.POSSIBLE SPOILERS (though I doubt it).Once you start playing as Dante, Stage 11 or 12, I believe, the repetition begins. You literally play the game backwards from where you left off with Nero, encountering all of the same levels and bosses. (New cutscenes are the saving grace.) Ironically enough, some boss battles were more difficult with Dante than with Nero. I felt the lack of creativity and the repetition of having to fight the same bosses (and the bosses don't even attack differently) a second time as Dante was very weak. (Not to mention, when you play as Nero again in the last few stages, Nero has to fight ALL of the bosses AGAIN--come on, this isn't the 80's or 90's with \"fight the same boss charactes over and over.\" It may not seem like a substantial gripe, but when you pay $59 for a game, you want 20 stages of original material, not 12-14 stages of original, before you have to go back through all of it. (Going back through is what repeated playthroughs and difficulty levels are for.)All in all, DMC4 is a great addition to the series and looks beautiful on the PS3 (and being the first cross-platform game I have played where PS3 owners didn't have to settle for a subpar version with framerate issues).This is definately a game to add to your collection, IF you don't mind a game where they kind of took the easy way out for creating about 30% of the stages by using serious repetition.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2008"}

Some of the moves are just totally over the top. The storyline is cheesy in a great way, however ends up really not making much sense towards the end and just  kind of randomly ends without even encountering other key storyline guys you could of swore you would have to fight / take down.Once finished however Wet gives really no reason to revisit it. You gain nothing more than trophies for acquiring collectibles and doing mini-games so unless you are a one to complete games to get that beautiful platinum (or max gamer score for 360 users) I found no reason to return to the game.**Overall Wet is a good game, a great game definitely not and does fall into the over-hyped category.  Because of this the game gets 4 stars (****) for fun, but only 3 stars(***) for overall value**Currently the price is $19.99 which is a very fair asking price for this game.  At the time I paid $59.99 for this game and it was definitely not a $60 title.  Best example I can give is Wet comes across as being more of a $29.99 budget title.  Is it worth playing, YES YES YES  but make sure you don't over-pay for what you get.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}

It's a great first person shooter with an excellent storyline akin to \"War of the Worlds\".The game is divided up into 30 levels of non-stop, alien-mutilating action with cutscenes at the completion of each level.  The A.I. in this game is truly amazing.  The Chimera are somewhat difficult to target, and they sneak right up on you!  You really need to actually focus your shots every time.  The theme song to this game is also great to listen to.  Armin Shimerman is one of the voice actors in this game.  I'm sure you remember him if you're a Trekkie.  He played Quark in Star Trek DS9.Now I took off one star from the game because I felt that there weren't enough checkpoints adequately placed within the levels.  There's nothing more frustrating than dying in a level and then have to go alllll the way back to the beginning because there wasn't a checkpoint where it should be.  Also, I was disappointed that this game doesn't have a trophy system.  There are \"skill points\" to accumulate, but I don't see how they would benefit unless you're into the multiplayer portion of this game (which I didn't bother to play).  Those skill points could have easily been translated into trophies, and that's what Sony should have done.Other than that, this is a solid 4-star game at the very least, and it should be a staple in your PS3 library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2011"}

This game (might) be better suited for much younger players,novice  players , or players who like a very simple & easy game experience.

My biggest complaint is the old school side-scrolling gameplay ,its outdated technology.A true 3-d style game is much more immersive & exciting. In this game you spend too much time wondering whats in front,to the side,or behind you ,because your sight is limited in side scrolling.

AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

In TWiNE, you play Bond, James Bond, as he goes through the various stages of the movie. Each mission represents one section of the plot, starting from the banking building in Spain and moving onward. The missions tend to be longer and more drawn out then the movie showed, making the game last far longer than the movie did!The graphics are stellar on this version, a big enhancement from the last two games. Bond is very realistic looking, as are the various people he meets and talks to. You interact with people in a variety of ways, from watching civilians huddle in fear to exchanging witty comments with the bad guys. And, yes, there are times that you have to pull out your P2K and start plugging holes in those who will not listen to reason.While the game does have its shoot-it-out aspects, it is much more than a first-person shooter. It's much more like Thief, where you can find sneaky, non-violent ways around many situations. Want to get into a room? You can run in with guns blazing, taking out anyone who crosses your path. Favor a more thoughtful approach? Try running when the camera is pointing the other way, and ducking into nooks.The tools of the trade are wonderfully done and quite useful. A fingerprint scanner lets you steal fingerprints off a coffee thermos, getting you into restricted areas. Block the metal detector with a spinning gizmo straight out of a sci-fi movie. Don't the guards notice you walking around with this thing? Sometimes it's better not to ask questions.The cut scenes between missions are straight out of the movie, and hints help nudge you through the mission if you choose to use them. There are choices of difficulty, so you can play through on the easier level and then go back for a harder challenge. Playing well also unlocks cheats, so do your best!In all, a great game for any action fan, available on both Nintendo-64 and Playstation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2000"}

This game tells the story behind Vincent Valentine and how he came to be and delves deeper into his relationship with Lucrecia, the FF7 team, Hojo, and a few other characters. Honestly the story is very confusing unless you have played FF7 already, in fact, all the FF7 projects make no sense unless you have played the PS1 classic. I never played it as a kid so the story made no sense. Even if I had, it's pretty dry and dull and uninteresting until the very end. Vincent doesn't really say too much and the story is poorly edited and feels chopped up and mixed around.The action is at least half-way decent and pretty fun. You get three different guns in the whole game, a pistol, machine gun, and sniper rifle. You can customize these weapons with different barrels, materia for magic, and various other effects. It's nice to see this in an FF game, but the customization feels very limited due to the limited gun types. Like a Final Fantasy game you can use various potions, limit breakers, and phoenix downs which revive you when you die. The game has the Final Fantasy vibe all around it, but the action part is lacking greatly. It feels fast paced and snappy, but the game is linear to a fault and offers almost no challenge. I blew through boss after boss without even dying or losing much health. Once you level your weapon parts up enough you are unstoppable early on. You chew through enemies like candy and there is just a huge lack of challenge. There are a few turret sections, a couple of cinematic on-rails segments, and that's about it. 90% is running around the same bland environments shooting the same bland enemies for 6 hours.There is some melee combat thrown in, but it's very weak. Just a quick 3-hit combo, but when you are in beast form you are more powerful using melee attacks. There's items scattered all over the place and hidden items for extra endings and whatnot. It's the same dated shooter stuff with keycards to open gates, button pressing, and other dated shooting mechanics. The game is only fun because the environments change up a lot, but they are still bland no matter what. The enemies repeat often and this really weakens the game. The hallways can be so small that they are the width of Vincent himself which just feels restricting. On top of all that, the game is just poorly balanced. I stuck with the pistol through the whole game because switching up weapons isn't really necessary because the game is so easy. The final level is really awesome because Vincent is in Chaos form and you are mega powerful, but it's all a ruse to JRPG players who aren't veterans in shooters. You can tell this game was geared toward casual players and really just FF fans. The confusing story is evidence to that.Overall, Dirge of Cerberus is a fun weekend rental but nothing more. Non Final Fantasy fans won't really care for this because there are much better shooters on the PS2 that offer more depth and better stories. Final Fantasy players won't really like it because it's too action heavy and gives a false sense as to how shooters really play out. It tries to run a middle ground and veers off constantly with no real direction. A few months months of polish would have done this game some good. It's a nice departure from the series and an interesting side project. It doesn't really fail, but rides on the borderline of being a bad shooter.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

This new Wolfenstein game is as much fun (and I would say even better in some respects) as Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  Graphics, gameplay, weapons, and storyline are all there and are done very, very well.  The complaint about this game as a console port is really a \"non-issue\" ... the controlls are perfect for keyboard and mouse FPS gameplay and are completely re-bindable for each player's preference.I bought this game primarily for the single-play FPS action, and the multi-play aspect as only a secondary concern.  I would have to agree with other reviewers that the multi-play is just OK ... nothing to scream about.  On the other hand ... the single-player experience is amazingly fun ... and for that reason alone, I would recommend this game.  Enjoy!FYI .. I am playing this game on an older Pentium 4 XP system with an Nividia 9600GT card and 3GB of RAM, and it runs pretty smooth, with only a hic-up once in a while.  A good place to check and see if this game, or any game for that matter, will run on your computer, is to go to the web site called \"Can you RUN it\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2009"}

I am 24 years old so with work and other responsibilities I really don't have the time to sit and play extensive RPG's that require my full attention, however, I absolutely loved RPGs when I actually had time.  Needless to say that this game (along with its original) have fulfilled my desire for an RPG that is easy to follow, and a lot of fun to progress in due to its Third Person nature.  The graphics are stunning and the story is very interesting so far.  In theory you don't need to have played the first one all the way through to pick this one up, however it is recommended as some references are made to the main character's past.  I havn't finished the game yet, but trust me that I am highly addicted to it that even as I write this review I want to quickly run and turn on the Xbox on and play.

I remember playing Yoshi's Story quite a bit. The Yoshi Touch and Go is a great little game for quick playing - but it really is too short.There are two basic modes. In the first mode, Baby Mario is floating downwards through the sky. He floats down in the top screen - and you see what is beneath him in the lower screen. You use the stylus to build a cloud stairway in essence for him to float down - aiming him at the coins, keeping him away from the enemies. You can draw cloud-circles around enemies to turn them into coins. It's a fairly short fall - only a few minutes - but it's fun to balance the enemy-circling and the slide-creating.Once Mario is on the ground, he's in on essence a \"runaway Yoshi\" - a Yoshi that plows right, no matter what is in his way. If there's a ditch, he'll simply jump in! Yoshi isn't very bright :) Your job as the Fairy Guardian is to draw cloud bridges, cloud stairs, cloud ramps, etc. to make sure that Yoshi's path is safe. Again, you draw circles around the enemies, and now you also can point at items in the sky to shoot them down with eggs.The game is a great deal of fun, and nicely non-violent for kids. You can replay the levels to work on your point count and try to get the highest score. But the problem is that this is literally all there is to the game. I'd love to have FAR more levels ... to have secret levels ... to have worlds you move between. Surely, for the price of the game, they could have given us far more to do! I feel like I'm playing the demo version of a real game, but that really is all there is TO the game.So while I am thrilled with what I got, I really think they should have given us more. Once they got this cool engine designed, how hard could it have been to crank out 10 or 20 different worlds for us to go through, with different colors, themes, etc?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2005"}

I've never ridden one and don't have that much of an interest too.  I also don't enjoy racing games likeNeed For Speed 3: Hot Pursuitor Gran Turismo.  That aside, Pure is a pretty fun and entertaining game.  The main premise of the game is to do tricks.  This is another area of games that I really despise, because usually the best tricks involve ridiculously complicated control combinations that my 30-year old hands are not possible of executing.  Pure's trick combinations are very easy to pull off though, and don't require memorizing difficult button combinations.  In the simplest form, it involves pushing a button and a control pad direction.  I was able to pull off some really cool-looking tricks without reading any instructions, and spent a good 4 hours doing so before deciding to learn some more difficult maneuvers.Some of the main things to do in Pure:1. World Tour - This is the standard racing tour that all of these games have.  For the most fun, I would suggest newcomers start here and complete it before moving on to the other two events below.  One of the fun parts of this is that you start out with weak ATVs, and get more options and better parts as you progress, allowing you to fully customize your ATV.2. Racing - This is where I spent most of my time with the game.  Races are a combination of speed and tricks.  You'll need to accomplish a lot of tricks to gain speed, and you need a lot of speed to get access to the best tricks.3. Sprints - As the name implies, these are short races on a track. These are a little too fast-paced for me and I had difficulty pulling off tricks and still finishing the race in a respectable time.4. Trial Mode - Even though the tricks can be fun, the landscapes gave me the most enjoyment in the game. I really like exploring in games, and the landscape detail in Pure is gorgeous.  I actually spent most of my time in this game just checking out the detail in my environment rather than focusing on the race.  This is why Trial Mode is so great in the game.  A lot of racing games look like they have enormous backgrounds, they restrict you to a specific track through the use of fences, bales, etc.  or even more annoying, you can only explore the course during a race, which gives you about 2 minutes to look around.  In Trial Mode, you can do whatever you want and spend as much time as you want on a course.  This is a great feature.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

Nintendo did not invent these games.  They have been around for a long time.  All Nintendo did was put them all together in one large collection and presented them in a format that is playable on a video game console.  Just about everyone will find a game that they know how to play.  And due to the DS' touch screen interface, the learning curve to play them on the console will be very short.I will echo the comments that have already been made and state that this might be the best collection of casual (pickup-and-play) games available.  This is the perfect game for those random gaming time that we sometimes get in the middle of our busy day.  Most of the games can be started and stopped in a very short amount of time.  And, there is very little need to read a long manual in order to learn how to play them.Highly recommended for people of all ages.  You don't need to have had any experience playing video games in order to enjoy this title.  There is no need for any kind of fancy button mashing or acrobatic control manipulations.  As a matter of fact, you really don't need to be a video gamer in order to play this game.  This title,together with the DS Lite console, would make an ideal gift for that person whom you would like to gently introduce to the wonderful world of video games.The game will also give you the rules for the game that you want to play.  This is a helpful feature for those who may have forgotten the rules to a particular game.  For example, if you want to play Blackjack, you can tap on the \"rules\" button and you will be given the rules for that game.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"\"matrixman1\"","summary":"Pikmin is the most original game on the planet!","reviewText":"Pikmin was created from Zelda's daddy, Shigeru Miyameto. Pikmin is about a guy from Earth who accidently crash-landed on a very strange and unusual planet filled with alien creatures that view the guy nothing less than breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, dessert, or a midnight snack. But later on when you look around, you find the \"Pikmin\", little alien creatures that are attracted to anything that pulls them out from the ground. The Pikmin are as loyal as dogs and will do whatever you order them to do. For example, if you tell them to kill a huge mushroom monster, they'll do it without complaining even if killing it means to get eaten themselves. You must repair your spaceship because the atmosphore is toxic to your little character. The game is intruging and innoventive from the start. People may say it's too kiddy but the game is meant to be played by all generations. (...) So in conclusion, Pikmin proves that Shigeru Miyameto is a mastermind at making video games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2001"}

To be honest, the first 5-6 hours of the game was fun, but after that it gets reallllyyyy boring and repetitive. There is no combo like God Of War, there is no detailed character customization ( just a simple face & hair ), the game is not open world as you might think specially toward the end in the Ice mountains which you basically run in a linear pathway.There is crafting and leveling in the game and by the end of the game I was around lvl 27. Therefore, I don't know what the lvl cap is.Graphics are just right. Nothing eye candy nor something ugly. Music & sounds are perfect. Lip sync is terrible, and so as the voice acting are very fake.I finished the game in 7 hours by simply doing the missions and no side mission, and loot whatever was around me. However, I got to say the game is hard even on easy setting. You get attacked by archers from one side, and the crazy looking monster from another, and at the same time 2 more skeletons show up. You end up fighting like 5 enemies at the same time, but all you go to do is attack then block immediately after. Repeat this all the way to the end of the game, and throw some flames around just to keep things less boring.I recommend this game if you have nothing to play & have lots of patience.

My ears are sooo much more comfortable in the 50mm cushions so I can play longer and my ears do not get hot. The sound is somewhat better. Both the sound is better, it is more comfortable, and the price is better. There are quite a few wires but it is manageable.For those of you thinking which one to get, PICK X12's. The X12's are wonderful for the price they are sold, but if you save your money for a few months, get the X41's or get a DDS for the X12 to make the sound the best possible. It works for both the Xbox and the PC so that is also very good about the X12.Pros:Big ear cushions give you more playing time and comfortableness.Sound is very good compared to most of the turtle beach headsets.Little sounds heard from T.V. are amplified so you hear them best.I have been getting twice as many kills in search and destroy(getting like 15 a game).

Back in the day I had Diablo II but other than that, I've mainly been on consoles but after getting a pretty sweet laptop, I figured \"eh, what the hell, see what the craze is about.\"Now I've never played an MMO before, mainly because I hate subscription fees but also because of the lackluster PC I had so I can't compare this to Warhammer Online, EVE Online, Lord of the Rings Online...or really any of the \"Online\" ones. But other than that, I'll say that this is quite a worthwhile game to play...just watch your relationships deteriorate at the same rate your character's level raises...just kidding, or am I?So after buying the game plus a game card for 2 months of play, in comes the incredibly lengthy install which literally took me from 6 in the afternoon to 4 in the morning and that's with a 100 MB/S connection speed. Then turns out that most of the names I was picking were not available and I'd rather have a \"real\" sounding name, not something like \"XxXkilla\" or something like that so after finally finding one, it was off to the races. Based on the kind of character you pick, you'll end up in a different area of the world than others. My first character was a night elf warrior so I was put in the tree of Teldrassil, a massive tree with purple foliage and visually I have to say it really looks impressive. Sure graphically the art style is \"cartoony\" but it's very pleasant to the eye, especially those with high-end PC's/Laptops with minimal framerate hitches or lag. It's also a nicely varied world with snow valleys, countryside having an almost pastoral feel to tranquil forests to ominous bogs.As far as gameplay is concerned, at first you're a little \"now...how do you sell stuff?\", but eventually you will get the hang of it and it's incredibly accessible and the more you play the more things get added for you to use in the game such as additional skill slots, abilities for other weapons and skills that you can use from cooking, enchanting and the like. And with the ability to have multiple characters as \"alts\" or alternates, it'll be fresh and new from visually to gameplay since different classes get different skills and specialties. As far as PvP and PvE, I generally avoided PvP playing since I prefer co-op type games like Left 4 Dead and whatnot and I'd rather help out fellow players during tough spots than trying to kick someone's face in (which I have Street Fighter for, or at the very least, shoot their face with Call of Duty).Now since this is an MMO, you have to get used to one thing, and this was the surprising part since it didn't bother me but this is heavily geared towards grinding. You know, \"kill 20 x to get 5 y for person Z\" and thankfully the drops are not that rare unlike some RPG's where it's like \"oh come on, should've had one by now\". Grinding is a big thing and too often you'll run into quest givers with many leading to other quests that'll yield bigger rewards once you reach the end. My one complaint about this is that some quests make you give a certain item or talk to an NPC you haven't met yet however your map/mini-map sometimes doesn't tell you till they're actually near and when you're told \"they're in the city\" my first thought was \"um...where?\"This isn't one of those kind of end paragraphs where I say this is the best MMO on the market and all the others don't have anything of World of Warcraft since, as I said, I haven't played them...plus one subscription based game's enough but I will say that Warcraft is quite a fun experience and certainly different than the console games I normally play but your addiction level may vary but there's enough content here to satisfy new players and plenty of depth and quests for the frequent players.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2009"}

For one, Ironforge is basically unraidable, because the lag is unbearable. Noone wants to raid Ironforge because you can't even move without waiting. Another thing, killing lowbies doesn't give dishonorable kill points. Quite a few times I have seen level 60 alliance players kill a bunch of level 20's at the Morshan Rampart(a place where people can PvP in a specific zone, but as soon as you leave that zone there might be some level 60's waiting to murder you). Blizzard still hasn't fixed the guards yet, so many players stand the chance of being murdered upon exiting the Warsong Gulch.Even worse, there aren't that many items. After playing so long, you soon start to see the same models in the same armor every day. Everyone looks the same practically, and most higher level players have practically the same armor sets now. I have seen so many people with the Dreadmist Rainment that it is laughable. If you use two-handed swords, I bet you probably have a Destiny.Worse yet, the community is filled with younger kids who still don't know how to play at level 60. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a level 60 warrior pull 50 monsters and yell at the group when he dies. There are so many little kids. The new thing seems to be farming kills in the Warsong Gulch. What many of these kids don't realize is the fact that after you kill someone a few times in one day, you don't get any more honor from them. So in essence, they are wasting their own time trying to farm kills.This game is not worth 15 dollars a month. People bash Everquest, but if you pay 10 dollars a month you get EQ and any other SOE game that is online for that same 10 dollars. This game's flaws could be overlooked, but the pricing is just too steep.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Michael Corona \"Nemesis Legion\"","summary":"The return of Samanosuke","reviewText":"Onimusha 3: Demon Siege - Circa 2004GOOD:- A nicely styled samurai horror/fantasy, with some modern day France stuff- An original story, with some time travel elements- Cool swordsman type combat, newer refined combat (since last game)- Some nice unlockable mini-games- Play as two (sometimes three) different characters at certain points of the game- Lot's more varity in environmentsBAD:- Some might say this game plays and looks dated, but that's really up to opinion- Not for those who don't like survival horror games (but this ones is closer to an adventure game then survival horror)- The story sort of goes out the window and is more unbelievable then the past two games, the entire magic meets samurai meets time travel meets modern day mercenary thing is not for every oneIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Samurai game that plays like a action survival horror- Magic and fantasy are a pretty big part of the story- Don't really need to play pervious games to enjoy this one, pervious games have very little to do with this game- Switch back and forth between the two main charactersGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Onimusha: Warlords- Onimusha 2: Samurai Destiny- Resident Evil: Code Veronica XADDITIONAL NOTES:- Yes the other playable character is modeled after the actor Jean Reno","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2005"}

I think the two other star wars games that I have, (Jedi Outcast & Jedi Academy) are better in terms of gameplay.

I'm not gonna complain so much about the game so much though, since it only cost me $10 bucks brand new anyway.  But I still wish Lucasart's people would put more effort into developing their games.  With star wars being the successful franchise that it is, the name \"star wars\" alone is not enough to get the job done.

{"product_name":"B002F9005O","description":"","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Decent Puzzle Game with a Great Challenge Mode","reviewText":"The fact is I'm not a huge fan of these kinds of puzzle games. I find that most of them are nothing more than a derivation of Tetris and they generally bore me after a handful of playings. On the other hand I'm a sucker for DS games that utilize the system well by using only the stylus. This is the kind of game that probably only works with either a mouse of a stylus so the DS is a good home. Bejeweled Twist is definitely inspired by Tetris and perhaps a little Dr. Mario which involves matching colors together. The screen is a grid of various colored gems that can be rotated clockwise by touching the stylus in the center of the square. Just by revolving these 2 by 2 squares you can move a gem to any location on the grid. If you get three of the same color in a row they are destroyed and the gap is filled in by gems that drop from above keeping the play area filled. The goal is to explode enough gems to fill up the \"Tube\" on the left hand side of the screen at which point you get a pointless animation of a spaceship flying around and move on to the next level.There are four game modes. In my mind the worst is Zen. I assume Zen is so named because there is no pressure. Players are allowed to twist jewels at their leisure until the Tube is completely full and that take a long long time. Without any tension (besides the tension of loosing precious moments of your life) it's just tiresome. Classic mode brings in tension by adding in explosive jewels that blow up when their timer reaches zero. Players can play at ease until a bomb appears on the screen and then you have to scramble to get rid of it. Blitz mode is just a 5 minute sprint and not a mode I spent much time playing.Challenge mode is by far my favorite. Without this mode Bejeweled Twist would get at best 3 stars. In challenge mode you need to perform a variety of tasks such as get 25 gems of one color on the screen or create three fire gems in one move or destroy 35 gems in 1 move. This one will really test your thinking and planning. Many of the challenges seemed ridiculously difficult at first but as you get into it most are not that hard. I really enjoyed this portion of the game and it's the only part that kept me coming back. I found it very satisfying to set up an elaborate cascade in order to achieve a challenges.The fundamentals of Bejeweled Twist are solid. The controls work well, the graphics are adequate (although the spaceship animations are lame) and the music is pleasant. The clacking sound when new gems drop into the board is very well done. I think the main problem for me is that there are a lot of things that can be done in the game, for instances launching cascades and creating higher powered gems like fire, lightening and the elusive supernova but there is little reason to do it outside of challenge mode. In classic once a timed bomb makes an appearance the player needs to drop everything else and get rid of it fast. Between bombs you could just take a nap. You can get bonus points by joining gems in a certain order but the reward seems too small for the effort involved. To summarize I would say that Challenge Mode is by far the crown jewel in this game and at a price tag under $20 I don't think that Bejeweled Twist is a bad pickup if you're a fan of brain teasers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2010"}

And it doesn't disappoint","reviewText":"I will start this review by prefacing it with the following: It has been a very long time since I have played the first Alice game. I remember very little about it. This review is basing it on those that, like me, don't remember the first one or have never played the first one.There is a lot I can say about this game, so I am going to break it up so as to try to organize my thoughts as best as I can.Graphics: 8/10To be blunt, the graphics in this game are impressive. That's not to say they are perfect, they are far from the most amazing graphics to date and they aren't really doing much to push the envelope in the way of the graphical power of the system. However, they are amazing for what the game is offering. The locations are vastly different and colorful in their own way. From mechanical towers to houses of cards, the locations are dazzling and really do a lot to bring Alice's Wonderland to life.The graphical scales are equally impressive. For as small and generally linear as Wonderland is, you feel that it is an incredibly large place. You can often see your destination off in the distance and you really feel as though you are making this long trek towards some of these buildings. This is especially true as you're running around the Mad Hatter's mechanical factory. The only real drawback is that Wonderland is so colorful and interesting that the stark and drab streets of London feel almost out of place. And yes, I realize that is the point of the contrast between the two, but it still feels out of place going from this colorful and interesting world to London. Luckily, these are short stints in London.There are a lot of little things that really stand out to me. The way Alice's hair floats in the wind and her dress moves as the vents support her in mid air. Also, Alice's dress changes based on her location. And each dress is more than just a color swap. Each is designed to fit with the theme of the current area. And each dress is varied and amazing.Really, the only issue with the graphics comes in that some of the character models in game almost seem dated. Not that they are hard to look at, they just don't always seem to have the care and brilliance that the landscapes and Alice have. Also, the lip syncing, while not bad, definitely seems off especially after playing games such as L.A. Noire. While the mouths try their best to match what the characters are saying, they don't always match up. Really, more of a minor gripe than anything. It still really doesn't detract from the overall brilliance.Controls/Gameplay: 7/10The controls for the game pretty basic. But that's not a bad thing at all. Each weapon is assigned to a different button and switching between them is pretty easy. Combos generally flow well enough, though switching between weapons definitely could be more fluid.The weapon combos don't really change, though, which can be a disappointment for those that enjoy various different combos and unlocking new ones. It also doesn't leave much in the way of variety. In the end, you have a few options of combos and it boils down to mashing buttons until the enemies are dead. Though, I would like to see more combos, I can't fault the game for sticking to a simple formula. It just works. There haven't been many points where I found myself getting bored with the game even without much variety in the way of attacks.The game kind of tosses a lot of different elements into it all at once. The fighting system revolves around a hack and slash system with X generally being your light and quick attacks and the Y button being a more heavy handed and powerful attack used for guard breaking. The right trigger is your long range weapon. In the end, though, a majority of the fighting comes down to slashing at the enemies until they are dead. Though, the amount of enemies can sometimes overwhelm you, the game never really feels cheap.The controls are fairly responsive and fluid, though sometimes during platforming sequences they can feel a little loose and sometimes that can lead to unwarranted deaths. Though, luckily falling into the abyss doesn't set you back too much.Story: 8/10Honestly, I like the story. And even without knowing all the details of the first game, you don't ever really feel lost. It is a unique twist on the story of Alice and her Wonderland. As you explore Wonderland, Alice makes mention when she comes in contact with certain characters about how much they have changed. And that Wonderland has changed. You feel like her actions from the previous games had some hand in shaping the current Wonderland.The main story is focused on Alice trying to figure out the tragic events from the first game surrounding the mysterious circumstances that lead to her families death as she tries to piece together her fragmented mind. The story is solid and interesting and will keep you entertained enough to play through to the end. It is told well through various cutscenes, in game dialogue, and through the use of memories found in the world itself. You rarely feel lost as the game's story starts to tie into itself.I suppose the only real thing that could have made the story better was a little more backstory to fill in certain events from the first one. You do get a short recap at the start of the story and it does a decent job of filling you in enough so you aren't completely lost as to the events of this one.Overall and Final Thoughts:Overall Alice: Madness Returns is a solid title. The story is solid, the game is fun to play, and the graphics are decent to look at. And, should you buy the game new, it comes complete with a code to download the original title. So, in the end, you get two games for the price of one.The game gets a solid 8 out of 10. What it does, it does well. The game can use some fine tuning in the platforming areas, but once you've gotten the hang of the controls, it becomes less and less of an issue. The story is paced well and the game isn't so long that it overstays its welcome. The combat can get repetitive, but that argument can extend to any game. I suppose one of the biggest draw backs to this one is the lack of any sort of true boss fight until the end of the game. There are plenty of challenging enemies and situations that should make anyone sweat on Nightmare difficulty, but the lack of any real boss fight is somewhat disappointing.Alice: Madness Returns is a gem for any collection, especially with the inclusion of the download for the first game. I look forward to seeing if Spicy Horse will support it with DLC in the near future. The replay value will vary from person to person. There is a new game + option which is great and I think every game should have. But it is mostly collecting things you missed in the original playthrough. Regardless, it is still one of my favorite games of this year and highly worth buying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}

There is some slight differences of course and veterans of the last games will be able to spot them. Touch screen controls seem to be a little forced but do not detract from the game at all... just can get a little annoying having to take the fingers off from those beloved buttons. The story? Awesome. Humor, great voice acting, and all around good gun play welcomes this new chapter in Nathan Drake's treasure hunting expedition with open arms. The new characters (even the villains) are likable, and yup.. Victor \"Goddamn\" Sullivan is here also in all his glory, so fear not fans. Interesting banter and witty remarks during gameplay that seems to be a trademark of all uncharted games is still in this game and I often would catch myself smiling away at my Vita's screen like a moron. If you are a fan of the Uncharted series, I strongly recommend picking this up folks. An all around GREAT game on the go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004UDB9SA","description":"","reviewerName":"Trell","summary":"An operation you shouldn't sleep on.","reviewText":"Ok, i'm going to try to make this review as short as possible. I've heard about this game before it's release date and when it finally released, i kind of held back on purchasing it until the price came down. Once the price went down to like 15 dollars, i took a chance on it. I've waited so long because so many people were saying how bad it was but as the updates presume, the bugs almost become non-existent and the reviews got alot better. The first level of this game is somewhat boring to me. You really see how bad the aiming is and it's like they just throw you in a level full of gunfire without really guiding you much as far as the story line goes. After that level, you and your team hit the streets. This is where the game shines. You actually get to shoot your first zombie on this level and the levels after that. I had a blast because it at least tried to represent the title. Not many zombies have much differences. You start to see the same ones repeatedly but you might tend to look pass that if you don't get your hopes too high. I like the 4 player mode but no one is really playing this online. At least not on the PS3 version. I would love to play with a live team because it would remind me of Left 4 Dead somewhat. I hate that they cant run. They can only walk and jog but at times when i want to get away from monsters that run faster than me, i can't because of how slow the characters move. That's a major gripe for me. It sometimes makes the gameplay sluggish and almost feels like the makers are just trying to stretch the completion of the game out. Another thing i don't like is the fact that u cant carry a decent amount of guns. What they allow you to carry is ok but i like to carry at least 4 weapons when playing a shooter like this one. The environments are ok. Nothing mind blowing but mediocre for current gen consoles. Another gripe is the A.I. The reviews are right. They do suck. Useless at times. They almost never have your back when you are getting shot at and when they are shooting, it's like they are using pellet guns or something because it never phases the enemy. It's just a bunch of people running around showing little team work and at times, they follow your character as if you are supposed to know where to go. Luckily, the map comes in handy. You can never get lost with it. There's alot of action in this though and it does have some replay value if you have friends online to play with. Ok, i'm gonna end this review right here since i'm only about 25% finished with the game. For a title that has gotten so many bad reviews, i did find myself playing at least an hour straight at a time so it isn't too bad of a game. Just look at it for what it is and not what you're used to seeing. I gave it 4 stars due to the minor gripes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}

In many ways the PS3 is a superior system to the 360 (which I also own), but in the case of the controller, it's no contest.

{"product_name":"B000HE9LL8","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"Agents are... Groovy!  (by Laura)","reviewText":"Elite Beat Agents is easily one of the best games I have played... and I have played many games.  Let me share the pros and cons with you.Cons:1.  The game is really hard.  I played a demo in the store last year and it really frustrated me, so I didn't get it then.  I only got this game recently, because it seemed to haunt me...  Plus, I only barely got past the breezin' level (that's the easiest level out of four).  In crusin' (the second level) I'm stuck on the \"Let's Dance\" plot.Pros:1.  I can only think of one con to this game.  Which speaks a lot for it, because I normally tear even my favorite games apart.2.  Funny and entertaining storylines.  Basically you play as dancing agents in a problematic world.  The way I see it, your job is to encourage people to do well in their difficult missions by dancing the best you can.  The storyline continues depending on the Elite O' Meter.  If your dancing is good enough to be in the \"yes\" section, you get the best case scenarios for each scene; but if your dance is going haywire and you end up in the \"no\" section, you get the worst case scenarios, where things go terribly wrong.  Should the bar fall down to zero, it's game over.  How many good and bad scenes you get also control the ending.  That's all there is to it.  Plots include helping a babysitter control kids, helping a pair of celebrity twins survive a deserted island, helping a dog get home, helping a taxi driver get a pregnant woman in labor to the hospital without losing his liscense, helping a girl meet the spirit of her father for Christmas (a uniquely sentimental, tearjerking storyline), and many other plots, even to a point of saving the entire world at once.3.  Groovy music.  Out of 19 songs I guarantee there is at least a few you will like.  My favorite tunes are \"Material Girl\", \"Sk8ter Boi\", \"Highway Star\", \"Anthem\", \"Without a Fight\", \"Y.M.C.A.\", \"Makes no Difference\"...  Well, I love all of the tunes; I don't have a specific favorites list.  Most of these songs are 80's tunes, and, to me, the 70's through the 80's was the golden age of music.  You will have fun with these songs, as EBA levels have you tapping with the tune; not just random tapping.  Paying attention to the songs is the key to doing well.4.  The game is thorough and well-balanced.  I don't have to tell you how to play because Commander Kahn (leader of the agents) has a training run at the start of the game, to teach you what to do.  In addition, if there is something you don't understand, you can always repeat the training drill.  Another cool feature is the ability to save your dances with replay save (one dance per stage).  It also saves the scenes and pictures, so you can see them whenever you want!  Great tools like this, can make a game enjoyable to the max!I hope this review helps.  Overall, this is a perfect game, save for it's extreme difficulty; but as my mom says, \"No game would be fun if it didn't challenge you.\" (don't let that fool you; she isn't much of a gamer.)  A cool game that I think any skilled gamer could enjoy, I highly recommend; and this game is one of those games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Melvin","summary":"Salvatore's world come to life","reviewText":"For those not familiar with R.A. Salvatore - he is a very popular author of fantasy novels, stretching from some of his most famous works in the Wizard of the Coast property - Forgotten Realms and his famous character, Drizzt, to now his own gaming world creation - Amalur.  This author, world creator, and fantasy visionary has the ability to paint a picture like no other with his words.  He doesn't just tell you about a character, he makes you see that character.  I cannot say he is my absolute favorite author, but he certainly ranks in the top 1% of my fantasy author list.That being said - the game Kingdoms of Amalur is modeled after his world idea and brought to life by the good people at 38 Studios, Big Huge Games and released by EA.  And may I say - what a fun and addictive game. The graphics (I have the PS3 version) are superb and while the controls were a little weird at first - it quickly becomes second nature to fight, block, duck, dive, dodge, and like all RPGs - loot.  I haven't played this game all the way through yet, so my review is based off approximately 15hrs of game time.  From what I've seen and done thus far - this is certainly a first-rate title and definitely worth checking out.The basic storyline that I've gone through thus far: the world is made up of mortals and immortals.  The immortals (Summer and Winter Court) have been keepers of the world for a long time - until the Winter side went on a killing spree, threatening the very existence of the mortal world.  That was until a very enterprising gnome came up with a way to bring the soul of the dead back to life - bringing immortality to the mortals.  You are his only and likely last success in that vein.  Somehow you came back and for some reason, you have unraveled your own fate and have gained the ability to change fate as you see fit.  The whole world is turned upside down by this discovery.  The goodly people want to protect you and the Winter Court wants you dead (again).  Your task is to figure out your role in this new world your \"rebirth\" has brought about - and you'll meet plenty of people and do plenty of quests along the way.Some of the key features of this game that I enjoy include the superb voice-acting of all the characters you engage with. Never does it feel like it was phoned in - someone took the time to record all the dialog and to answer all the \"possible\" questions you may have for each character.  Additionally, unlike so many RPGs, this game has thus far avoided any delivery runs.  One of my least favorite parts of MMOs or RPGs is that the developers feels that making me run from one end of the map to the other with a package is actually fun.  Who in their right mind grows up thinking - man, I hope one day to just run packages from one side of the world to the other...wouldn't that be fun?  This game - 15hrs in - no deliveries.  Some \"go kill X, get the item and bring is back to me\" which at least is a kind of delivery with bloodshed.  Which works.  Keeps it fun.  There is crafting (weapons, armor, potions, and gems) that is fairly intuitive.  Pick an item, add some \"bonuses\" to it and craft.  Get better at crafting with skill points - and you can add more items.  Simple.  There are 3 classes, but unlike traditional RPGs where you pick what you want to be from the beginning and have to \"test\" it out - in this game, you have no fate, which means you can be whatever you want.  There are warriors, thieves and mages - but perhaps you want to mix and match.  This game covers that - no problem.  Perhaps halfway through you decide you don't want to be a warrior any longer - no problem, you can simply unweave your fate and start fresh.  And don't worry - you can always craft a new set of weapons, armor, etc for whatever class you decide to be.  The freedom is very liberating.  There are also factions, which will allow you to join the immortals or the hired swords, if you so choose.  Of course, you can skip all that and do the main quest only - advancing as you see fit.Overall, my impression of this game thus far is amazing.  They took all the best aspects of RPGing and made it flexible.  They added in some of the most desired and asked for features from gamers (houses, fast travel, freedom to reset, etc) and wrapped in a beautifully designed and wonderfully scripted game.  I'm not sure how well this game rated when it came out - but I am glad that I picked up the PS3 version - as the ability to lose yourself in the moment has come more than once during my short play and I hope it continues until the end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}

Even despite being an older game by today's standards with simple text/music and no voices, it didn't disappoint and I was fully immersed in this strange world.I'm only partially into Nocturne so far and I have to say it's strengths are the story, art design, battle system if you like turn-based, and demon collecting/fusions which are interesting. It's a pretty long game so you're going to get your money's worth. The downside is that it's not going to be a good choice for someone limited on free time. While the story is interesting, only bits and pieces of it are slowly revealed in-between gameplay. It is also very easy to get lost or overwhelmed without a guide, so I can see someone getting discouraged enough to give up playing if they don't have the time or patience to stick with it. Save points are very scarce unless you want to walk back to a terminal you've seen before, meaning you can't really play in short bursts of free time.One thing that irritated me was the random battle every few steps. Sometimes I was just trying to figure out where I was or get from point A to point B, and ugh...another battle... And once you finish, the camera spins you around in a certain direction. It's too easy to become confused and not recognize which way you were walking previously since the environments are usually identical. (There is a compass on-screen but eh, I never watch it, probably should lol.) I also died after clearing a boss and a bunch of random battles, but I hadn't saved for a long time. I thought there would be a re-spawn or retry option, but nope, game over. So save often!I'm hunting for a lot of old RPGs lately since current-gen games are lacking in that department.

{"product_name":"B0094MYU4M","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Fantastic sound and mic","reviewText":"Ever since I got into PC gaming, I have been a headset junkie. When you spent most of your PC gaming time playing co-operative games that require Ventrilo or a different VOIP program, it just seemed to work better for me than to rely on speakers and a standalone mic. As such, I've gone through more headsets than I could probably describe. Some have been awesome, others not so much. Since I've used and reviews plenty headsets in my time, I've kind of come up with a guideline for reviewing. When I use a headset, I grade it by four things: comfort, sound quality, mic quality and durability. I have been using the Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Wrath, a wireless headset that was probably my favorite headset.  With the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP SEVEN Surround Sound Console Headset, I've gone back to the realm of wired headsets.In terms of comfort, the Ear Force XP falls somewhere in the middle of comfort. It's definitely nowhere near as comfortable as the Plantronics headset I've used in the past. Whereas that one felt like air on my head, this one tends to grip the side of my head. Early on, during my first week or so, it took a bit to get it to be comfortable. The way the earphones engulfed my ear tended to cut into it and be uncomfortable; however, as the time went by, it seemed to adjust better to my head and now it doesn't hurt. It still isn't as airy as the most comfortable headset I've used, but even after slogging through some long raids, it fits comfortably and usually isn't noticeable.The sound quality is fantastic and better than the Tactic 3D Wrath I've been using.  It's a very rich sound, full of depth and handles multiple sound inputs (game, music and Ventrilo) at the same time, giving a good definition between them. It does a great job of engulfing you in sound and provides a very crisp sound.  Normally, when I game I have Ventrilo running, the game client and some music going in the background. Each one is very clear and works perfectly with this headset. VOIP sounds perfect. Music has great depth and the bass is actually booming, but never with bursts of static as it gets low. Likewise, sound effects and voices in games are fantastic. There's a depth of sound from both the treble sounds and the bass that I don't normally hear out of headsets. Also, everything is consistent. It comes with a ton of options to tinker with as you find fit.  I personally have kept to the standard options, but audiophiles, eat your heart out with the options.  Very nice addition.Mic quality is also very important to me because I use it to communicate constantly with my friends who are spread out across the nation. Mic quality is also something very hard to review. When I switched to this headset, middle of playing with some friends, they immediately noticed a difference in Mic quality.  Whereas I thought the Wrath 3D was fantastic for sound, everyone has complemented the quality of the mic with this new headset.Durability is another area that's important, especially when you're spending so much on a headset. The Ear Force XP is very durable. It's made of hard plastic and the ear pieces tilt back and forth if pressure is applied. With mic, as mentioned above, is detachable in case you're traveling. I've used a couple Turtle Beach headsets in the past and this one definitely feels the most expensive and durable.Ultimately, this headset is a keeper. I love pretty much everything about it. I do wish it were a little more comfortable, but I'm sure that will change overtime. But in terms of bang for your buck, this headset offers terrific sound quality for communicating, listening to music and playing games; it has a fantastic mic and the options and functions presented are vast and great. If any of my previous headsets broke, most of them I wouldn't go back to. This one is the exception. If this headset broke today, I would instantly order it again. I guess that's the best thing I can say about this headset.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2013"}

I was surprised that they were releasing it onto the GC so I checked it out.It is just like the second one by which I mean its just a port.  Buy this if you can only buy it on this console or if you're an impatient person.  The real difference between this game and the PS1 game is that the loading times are way faster.The storyline is self-explanatory, your trying to escape town while a giant monster stalks you with heavy weaponry.I loved the Nemesis, he was a great idea for this series.  I remember when I first saw him and was terrified so I chose the option to run into the Police Station.  While inside, he attacked again.  I ran into the next room, thinking it would be safe when, BAM! he kicks the door down and starting firing a rocket launcher at me and those in my path, namely the undead.There are many moments like this involved in this game, which make it all the more frightning and entertaining.  The other feature I like in this game is the command system where what you say determines the outcome of the game.  It reminds me of those adventure books where it was like \"If you want to follow the villian, turn to page 117; If you want to go to the Library, turn to page 50.\"Anyway, only pick up this game if you can't find it for any other console.Pros- One of the best games in the series, a must-have- Faster loading times- The ability to choose your pathCons- Graphics could be redone, instead we get a port of the PS1 game- There's nothing different from this game or the PS1 game","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2005"}

Randall","summary":"Mario soars in a 3D world","reviewText":"&quot;Super Mario&quot; is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history.  It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island&quot;, stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, &quot;Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?&quot;  The answer, in the form of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, proved to be a quite emphatic &quot;YES!&quot;&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;) and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls.One other aspect of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.  It delivered magnificently then and, with its continual replay value, still delivers today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2002"}

Nintendo 3DS system not included.","reviewerName":"eau","summary":"Best screen protector just getting easier to apply","reviewText":"Let's me state that I have been using Hori screen protective filters on my DS Lite and PSP and they are great. The only problem with them is that they are not easy to apply perfectly on the devices without misalignment, dust or bubbles. Now that Hori has produced a screen protective filter for 3DS, I naturally have to get one for my 3DS.The 3DS screen protective filter seem to be of the same high quality that I've come to love. What's new is a much easier method of applying the filter. It has two broad sticky tabs on two sides that you can use to affix it to the device after you've aligned the filter to the screen perfectly. Then you just pull the tab on the inner side of the filter to remove the protective film. Since filter has already been aligned and fixed to the device properly, you can easily attach it to the screen and smooth out any bubbles while the position and the alignment is maintained. After that, you just have to remove the outer film to finish off the installation. Repeat the same process to the other screen and you're done.Although the new application method is much easier, you would still have to follow the instructions carefully. You have to affix the filter carefully around the edge of the device so that the filter can actually lay flat and touch the screen after you remove the protective film. Otherwise, there can be enough wiggling room for the filter to shift out of alignment. A wiping cloth is provided to remove any dusts on the surface of the screen before application.Overall, I'm very happy with the Hori screen protective filter. It attaches to screen with leaving residues. It's crystal clear without any rainbow effect. It's tough yet does not affect too much the response of the touchscreen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Terrorists operate openly, killing thousands; drugs, disease, and pollution kill even more. The world's economics are close to collapse, and the gap between the insanely wealthy and the desperately poor has grown to the size of the Grand Canyon. Worst of all, an ages-old conspiracy bent on world domination has decided that the time is right to emerge from the shadows and take control. No one believes the conspiracy exists--no one but you.In this thrilling role-playing adventure, you play the part of J.C. Denton, a powerful, nanotechnologically augmented antiterrorist agent. It's up to you to stop the conspirators from achieving their goals. But this world is full of lies and betrayal, a world where nothing is as it seems and entire nations can seemingly be turned against you at the push of a button. To succeed, you must travel the globe in a quest for knowledge, develop your character's nanotech augmentations and strengths as you see fit, build a network of allies to assist you, and determine when stealth and strategy are more important than action. And each time you think you've got the mystery solved, the game figured out, there's another, deeper mystery to be unraveled. You will never know whom to trust, who your friends are, who's in the conspiracy, and who's innocent. Maybe no one is.","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"Conspiracies Everywhere! Beautiful Game...","reviewText":"This game is just fun to play. If you've played System Shock 2, then you have a good idea what Deus Ex is.  This game is hard core RPG with FPS  thrown in. Let's start the review:Graphics: Graphics uses the Unreal  Engine therefore it doesnt have good D3D support. The game will run on D3D  but expect some slow FPS when polygons start accumulating. A beta patch to  fix D3D performance did help a bit. If you're using a GeForce card, dload  this beta patch. Voodoo owners shouldnt have any problems.Interface:  There's a lot of control keys to memorize but with a little practice,  you'll be able to memorize each function. Prepare to use a lot of the USE  ITEM key since there's a ton of items you can pick up in this game. Like  System Shock 2 and Thief, Deus Ex gives you the action to lean left and  right however I didnt find any option to lean forward (very helpful though  when sniping from an elevated position).Gameplay: This is where the game  shines. The story is based on several conspiracy theories eg. secret  governments, roswell, etc. Your mission is to investigate the relationship  of each conspiracy and discover that all of these conspiracies are part of  a worldwide organization to control and subjugate people. Game runs via  mission objectives. You are given primary and secondary goals and you can  accomplish them in any order you want. There are some primary goals that  you can skip too as long as you've accomplished the most important goal.  Lots of skills building is involved (it's RPG). You get skill points for  every goal you accomplish; goals from as simple as talking to someone in  your HQ to arresting a terrorist. Most missions involve stealth,  infiltration. You dont have to go into a mission with guns blazing. You can  move in as quietly as possible and still achieve success.AI: Very  inconsistent. In a way this is a good thing because it makes the game very  unpredictable. AI here are smart. They can hear you if you make too much  noise or expose yourself too much. They run away if critically wounded, and  they'll gang up on you when you're cornered. Also, the AI remembers things  you've done whether they were good or bad. For example, i tried to hack the  ATM machine in the game. When I spoke to my boss, he warned not to try  hacking into any facilities in the area. And I did my hacking almost like  30 minutes ago. That scene made me smile.  Inconsistent AI can be a bad  thing too. Sometimes they wont react when they see their dead buddy in  front of them, and sometimes they'll sound the alarm. Must suggestion:  dispose of the bodies properly.Story and Overall: The game has a lot to  offer. The story is multi-varied because it runs on several conspiracy  theories. And we know how much we love to listen to conspiracies. This game  involves a lot of mind thinking and not senseless shooting. It requires  resource management, analysis of tons of information, and a lot of stealth  moves. This game is a must buy. Pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2000"}

He has raised up an army of vampires lead by his first &quot;born&quot; Lt. Raziel and lashed out at the humanity that had attempted to erradicate the vampires under the leadership of Mobieus.Every so often a vampire enters a state of change and evolves. Raziel sprouted bat like wings, and in what seemed like a jealous rage Kain tore the wings from his back and ordered Raziel to be executed. But that is only beginning. Centuries later, Raziel awakens, battered, torn, and not even a shadow of his former glory. A mysterious entity calls to him and orders him to exact his revenge on Kain. The story is pretty straight forward compared to Blood Omen, and Soul Reavor 2, it's still a story of epic proportions but not as good as it's prequel and sequel. Still it's integral to the over all story. If you haven't played it yet shame on you, but get the Dreamcast or PC version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2001"}

Let me shed a bit more light on the new game.First, (as the original) this game features online-gameplay, the graphics are a bit better, analog controls are a bit more responsive, gameplay more fluid/lifelike, cool movies &amp; storyline, cooler weaponry, and the voice command features (to me) seem a bit better, as well.The &quot;challenge factor&quot; is also better than the first SOCOM. You really have to be extra-stealthy in this one, on almost every level! No &quot;Jumping in like gangbusters&quot; here. Patience is really needed for SOCOM II.Some really cool things about this game are features like:You don't only work with the same 3 teammates, sometimes you're fighting alongside other teammates (on certain levels). It breaks up the monotony. (British &amp; Russian teammates)Newer weapon upgrades include RPG's, and even THERMAL rifle scopes! Both add a new level of gameplay.Anyway, if you already love SOCOM, go out and get SOCOM II as soon as possible!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2003"}

The powerful backlight brings your DSgames to life like never before.In addition to the brighter screens, Nintendo DS Lite is two-thirds the size of the original Nintendo DS and more than 20 percent lighter. It's sleek and powerful. Although the DS has undergone some major changes with the Nintendo DS Lite, you'll appreciate the minor changes as well. The built-in microphone resides in the middle of DS Lite and not at the bottom. We've moved the Power button away from the Control Pad and placed it on the side of the machine. Also, we've added a larger stylus to give you a better grip on gameplay.If that isn't enough, Nintendo DS Lite sports a longer battery life, up to 19 hours depending on the brightness settingyou choose. Of course, the new handheld still plays all the Game Boy Advance titles available in addition to games made specifically for Nintendo DS.And the built-in Wi-Fi lets you play wirelessly against nearby friends, or you can play online against gamers from around the world with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.Awesome games, great enhancements and an incredible price makes Nintendo DS Lite will be your best acquisition of the year.","reviewerName":"Marshall David WahlstromHelgren","summary":"The Nintendo DS lite","reviewText":"What I must say is I am even more impressed with the DS Lite than the original. The battery life is much longer the screen brightness is better, I hardly have to charge my DS lite. I try to play in moderation, besides I know that its important to take a break. Also I think its important that hard core gamers need to have a set amount of time to play and a time to stop playing at, but I am not going to get into that. Let me just talk about the system, I do agree with one reviewer on Amazon the buttons are a little small for guys and gals with big hands. I do wish the buttons weren't so close together I wish they were more evenly spaced, of course thats not my biggest concern my concern is more with the size of the D-pad. Its a little small and it can be difficult to play specific games that require the use of the D-pad, is especially a game that requires you to go in circles the D-pad is hard on my hands, but I am getting use to it. When I bought the Nintendo DS lite, I got it for a great deal of $16.00 in the box and it was used but it was in near perfect condition, the manual was with it, and it was just beautiful. The box itself was pristine/mint so instead of recycling the box like I normally would've. I kept it. Besides the color of the DS lite was Metallic Rose it wasn't onyx Black like I wanted. I had bought a Onyx Black Nintendo DS lite used with no box, instruction booklet and it need to be fixed because for some reason it wouldn't recognize a Gameboy Advance or Nintendo DS cartridge, so I traded it back in after using it when it was fixed in to the store I buy from O-Nett Gaming Company and got Metallic Rose which was mint as I mentioned above already. I overall like the system it works great, I take good care of it and I get a lot of use out of it. Its much lighter than the Original and not as bulky, the only things I don't like is if I put a Gameboy Advance game cartridge in it sticks out, compared to the original it went completely in. Otherwise I recommend this game system to families with kids, or for any hardcore Nintendo or Handheld game player.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2013"}

Le","summary":"\"Embrace Eternity\" (at EAbioware's Discretion)","reviewText":"Having survived the terrible experience of Mass Effect 3's horrible ending - which, BTW, has been improved from horrible to underwhelming with the Extended Cut DLC - I decided to play ME1 again just to immerse in the fantastic Mass Effect phenomenon at least once more. Moreover, I want to prove to myself that ME3's ending, as disappointing as it is, cannot mar the eternal beauty of ME1 (and to a lesser effect, also ME2) - And I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.To begin with, it is crucial to establish that ME1 is unique in the series because it is a RPG with shooter element, whereas ME2 and ME3 are shooters with RPG elements. The most important and simple distinction is this: In ME1, regardless of how well your aiming skill is, your weapons' accuracy is, by and large, dependent on the XP you invested in a particular weapon. On the other hand, in ME2 and 3, your aiming skill (along with reaction speed) determines your accuracy. In this regard, to me, ME1 is the best in the series as a RPG; with ME3 being the best as a shooter(in spite of its disappointing ending; and ME2 somewhere in between (for the overall games in disregard of the genres, I'd rate ME1 being the best game overall, followed by ME2, then ME3).Also, ME1 leans heavily toward exploration. Granted, this is the least developed aspects of the game, especially in regard to driving around the planets in the M35 Mako infantry assault vehicle or running around the Citadel doing side quests, which can be uneventful for the most part - if not downright boring. On the other hand, running or driving around afford you some spectacular views such as the Earth rise from the moon or awe-inspiring vista from the Citadel docking bay.In addition to the reasons above, the primary reason that ME1 is special to me is its story elements. As a former fan of the 80s science fiction mini-series like Battlestar Galactica (the one and the only original one, of course) or Buck Roger, I have to say that ME1 captured the atmosphere and the mood of these mini-series perfectly - and even better in many cases. As is, obviously having drawn many experiences from their excellent previous work in the Knight of the Old Republic, the EAbioware writing team, headed by Drew Kapyshyn, did a stellar job in creating their own science fiction universe and its own saga.The music in ME1, composed by Jack Wall and Sam Hulick, may not be perfect - but it is a perfect fit for the game. Surely, it is not as melodramatic as the music in ME3; nor is it as inspiring as ME2's. However, when framed within of the aforementioned science fiction genre, it is simply perfect. As is, I also have the soundtrack of ME1 and highly recommend it fellow ME fans.Another remarkable achievement for ME1 - at least for me - is that up until ME1, I never really give a damn about voice acting in games. In fact, I strongly dislike the idea of merging video games and movies together - and I still do. However, ME1 is an exception due the outstanding performances by virtually all the actors involved - especially Jennifer Hale, who voiced the female Commander Sheppard.In conclusion, and also in retrospection, in spite of all the little things that ME1 did not get right, in addition to the overreaching but worthless limited activation DRM scheme that wrecked the overall product (a serious offense in my book which results in an unfortunate deduction of 2 stars for the product), the game itself is beautifully executed and its story is a substantial work of well-implemented science fiction. Therefore, whether you are newcomer to the ME series or a veteran - and if you think the DRM scheme is worth the trouble - taking into considering the game's dirt cheap current pricing - it's worth it to embrace the eternity of Mass Effect 1.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}

You are some nameless person dropped into a new place with no opinions, friends or skills of your own.  It is then up to you as a player to figure all of this yourself.In all, it does it well.  I recall in Oblivion, I must have restarted my character about a dozen times to find that \"perfect\" look and class/race build.  This game throws all of that away and leaves you with a complete blank as far as class and race goes as well as only one look.  You pretty much look like Cole from Infamous or like the main guy from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.  Shaved heads are gaining popularity in the gaming industry.From the start you are forced to make choices that will change the course of the game completely.  Will you join the rebel bandits and work on your fighting/archery skills?  Or join the monastery and work on your staff/magic skills?  Or will you put off the choice by putzing around town for a while.I have a feeling that most of the 5 star reviewers got about this far and called the game great.  Sadly, I played the game for the necessary 5 hours to get to my requisite number of bugs that dropped the score a few notches.At first, I was confused as to how a game gets released to PC before XBox, and now I know.  PC games can be patched out of beta states, but XBox games, due to some not having hard drives, have to be of a higher functioning caliber than this.  Most of my issues are small and map or journal related.  But, I have now hit a complete game stopping, have to restart bug that is just plain bad planning.Most bugs are possible to get around.  Some guy not being where he is supposed to be.  Multiple quests requiring you to turn in the same item that a major, game progressing quest needs.  These can be fixed by working your way through a broken dialog sequence, or using the console cheat menu to create another item that the game took from you.Others, not so nice.  My current issue has to do with a combination of doing quests out of order and talking to the wrong people in the wrong order.  Honestly, if the game must progress by linear means, then it shouldn't give you the opportunity to ruin yourself like this.On the plus side, the game does look good.  It has more flexibility and entertainment than I got out of Oblivion and even with the game stopping bug, I will likely start a new game and try to avoid that pitfall.A patch to make the journal more useful would be nice.  Currently the thing has quest names, but many times objectives are obscure or non-existent.  Several times I opened it to find help, and only found a transcript of a completely unrelated conversation.  Not being able to walk around with the map open is a bad note as well.  You can open a general (no quest pointer) as you walk, but the moment you click it closes.  Being forced to open and close your window to see where you are going is painful.  Having some map labels wouldn't be asking too much either.My apologies for the rant on the faults of this game, I honestly think there is good content in here somewhere it just needs some more polishing to bring it out.  Conversations sound good and are written well (so much better than Two Worlds or Oblivion).  Combat, difficulty and simple immersion is also better here than I have experienced in many releases as of late.If you are feeling brave, grab this game for some good hack and level entertainment.  I would suggest waiting for a patch though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2009"}

Having played Indigo Prophecy, this developer's first endeavor with adventure games to my knowledge, I can thankfully say this game has much deeper characters, a richer plot, and way more branching consequences than its predecessor. Heavy Rain will quickly pull you in to a captivating story surrounding a serial killer. It brings together four characters, each playable, each with their own twist on the plot, and each fighting for their lives at one point or another. Unlike Indigo Prophecy, this game truly has no game overs. Instead, your actions have dire consequences on the story itself. Even the smallest detail can change the story drastically. Failing one action sequence can literally mean the difference between life and death for one of your characters. Regardless of the outcome the story will play on to its grand finale. That being said, there are some very obvious glitches in the game which really should have been worked out before its release. Especially the audio. Also the story, as captivating as it is, still has some very serious holes in the plot which I won't get into because I don't want to spoil the game. It's also pretty short, which is expected when a story can go as many different ways as this one does. Nonetheless, Heavy Rain is a solid game through and through and an extremely welcome breath of fresh air for a stale game market of FPS and action games.

The game combines elements from Hollywood action thrillers with the latest in video game technology to deliver a highly original gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"Big Daniel McFoot","summary":"Could you give this anything other than five stars?","reviewText":"The answer is no, you could not. These are some of the reasons why this game is so addictive, so fun, and so brilliant:Payneful Wait Pays OffFinnish game development company Remedy Entertainment has been working on their Max-FX game engine and the Max Payne game title since late 1996, following the success of their Apogee published 2D Racer, Death Rally. From fall 1996 to fall 2001 is a long road to take from concept to finished product, and despite a seemingly endless development cycle, Max Payne has weathered the long winters and burst onto the PC gaming scene with both guns blazing.Noir to the MaxOne thing you don't find much of in today's action games is story. Usually the developers just give you a gentle push toward the enemy and substitute state-of-the-art graphics and level designs for things like plot and characters. In Max Payne you play Max Payne, a New York City cop whose life is torn asunder when his wife and baby are killed by psychos drugged out on a new designer drug called Valkyr. Max joins the DEA and goes undercover with the Mob hoping to discover the source of this new killer drug. Just when all the clues are starting to fall into place, Max is betrayed -- framed for killing his contact at the DEA. Now both the police and the Mob are after Max. With no place left to go and nothing left to lose, Max wages a personal war on crime, along the way uncovering a tangled web of street thugs, Mafia crime bosses, and secret government cover ups in the dank underworld of a city clutched in the grip of the century's worst blizzard.At first glance the story may seem a little trite, even clich&eacute; -- framed cop seeks vengeance on the Mafia underworld only to uncover secret government conspiracy -- however, Remedy Entertainment brings it to life using comic book style story boards for the bulk of the tale. These detailed Photoshop-modified images give the story in Max Payne a gritty stylistic feel that matches the dark mood and stark realism of the game's levels. Blending these story boards more seamlessly into the game, these sequences are often triggered by a television broadcast, a clutter of loose paperwork found on a desk, or even a radio left playing in an empty office cubicle. They help bring the game's environments to life while moving the plot along at the same time. The voice acting in these sequences is top-notch, matching the noir mood of the game perfectly.Payneful DreamsSatan was here.Moving the storyline along with comic book style cut-scenes is one thing, but Max Payne takes storytelling to a new level weaving together scripted events and storyline themed levels. First you play out the opening sequence where Max's wife and baby are murdered by Valkyr-addicted drug fiends, and later in the game Max experiences two hallucinatory dream sequences. These dreams bring Max's torment to life and let the player \"live\" the painful memories and horrific moments that have driven him to the edge. While a few players may be put off by the mazelike quality to these levels (and that fact that you can still die -- even in a dream) they add recurring themes to the game and add depth to a character who would normally be nothing more than a gun-toting, one-liner spewing clich&eacute; -- like in most 3D action games.Maximum GraphicsMax Payne uses the 3rd person point-of-view perspective. This allowed the developers to pull off two shrewd special effects: the Matrix styled slow-mo \"Bullet Time,\" and the John Woo style jumping effect known as \"Shootdodge.\" These two effects can also be used together in one action-movie slow-motion acrobatic \"Bullet Dodge Combo.\" Max can run into a room full of thugs and deftly dodge incoming fire by flying through the air and shooting in slow motion. While Bullet Time slows the game down -- to the point where you can see individual bullets and shotgun pellets whizzing by -- it doesn't slow down your mouse pointer -- giving Max superhuman reflexes and pinpoint accuracy. These effects have to be seen to be appreciated as they take the game to a whole new level. It really is like a John Woo movie on your PC screen.Max Payne lacks nothing in the graphics department. Levels are highly detailed and full of interactive objects that can be shot or blown up. Toilets flush, bar taps spit beer, and you can even find running water in a [cheap] flophouse. With photo realistic textures the game looks run down and gritty -- like a seedy corner bar on the bad side of town. Adding to the realism, guns have the proper bolt actions and spit out shell casings when fired. Enemy characters will react to the environment when killed, slumping over chairs or falling over tables without clipping through walls like in most games. Corpses, bullet holes, and shell casings stay in the environment for the duration of the level. No ghostlike fading away for enemies in Max Payne. The dead stay dead.Paynefully ShortMax Payne does fall short in a couple of spots. The game is almost criminally short and will take the average gamer only 10 hours to solve from beginning cut-scene to ending storyboards. At a retail price of [not too expensive] Max Payne might not offer enough gaming bang for your gaming buck. When you complete the game, the extra tough \"Hard Boiled\" mode and the time-limited \"New York Minute\" gameplay mods are unlocked. However, the game plays through the same levels again with the added frustrations of not being able to skip the in-game cut-scenes.Maximum ConclusionEven if Max Payne is a little short, it is still one of the best PC games released this year. When you stack up the excellent storyline, awesome visuals, stellar special effects, and pulse-pounding gunfights, Max Payne is simply one of the most fun action games on the market today. You owe it to yourself to enter the gritty noir world of Max Payne. Just be sure you take an extra clip![BIG DANIEL McFOOT]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2003"}

On the Playstation 1 that game was Ape Escape. Now the PS2 offers up Sly Cooper. And man this is one racoon with some serious style!!Even though this may look like your average platform game, it is anything but. Sly Cooper takes advantage of unique Cel Shading graphics to give the game a 1940's cartoon style that is very original. Sly Cooper's hi res-graphics offer up plenty of detail, so much that you'll be covering some of the same ground repeatedly because you want to make sure that you've seen the entire gamescape. The only criticism I have of the graphics is that occasionaly you'll experience some slow down. But in a game this good it's forgivable. The sounds is also top notch. Breaking glass, water dripping, and sneaky footsteps really bring a complete sensural experience.It's no exagerration to say that this is probably one of the deepest games in terms of variety of gameplay that you'll buy all year. Sucker Punch serves up healthy doses of cool moves including stealth, slow-mo jumps, invisibility and ninja spire jumps that you acquire as you gather different parts of the Cooper family book the Thieviuos Racoonus. All of these moves add new and compelling ways to play each level. The action is never dull or slow. And just when you think that you've done a level before, the crew of Sucker Punch throws in a mini-game to break up the level and provide a new challenge. The only thing that is frustrating is the master thief sprint. Sometimes the sprints border on impossibility simply because there doesn't seem to be enough time to complete them.My only real criticism aside the ones I've mentioned, is that the game is a bit short. You can complete it in about 10-12 hours of gameplay. But the game is compelling enough that you don't feel cheated by the ending. There are also some unlockable extras including some behind the scenes production videos and the Japanese intro.Overall this is one title you won't be sorry you plunked down your hard earned cash for. Sony and Sucker Punch have come up with a winner in Sly Cooper. Here's hoping that this Thievious Racoonus returns for a sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2003"}

I've only just now gotten around to playing this game (spent all my money on DS games!).  When I first heard the game's premise (that you are experiencing the fever dream of famed composer Frederic Chopin), I was really intrigued.  It's a very unique  premise for an RPG and has the potential to be deep, artistically meaningful experience.  After a string of crummy games I'd played prior, it was with some trepidation that I fired up my PS3 and placed the Eternal Sonata disc in the slot...Graphics (score 9/10): It doesn't really matter how many pixels the game engine will display or how fancy the lighting system is if the art design is boring and uninspired.  Eternal Sonata really proves this point with copious amounts of creative art design.  Everything is vibrant and eye-catching with a myriad blend of bright colors.  There is also fantastic detail in the environment designs (especially the towns), and I haven't seen environments this beautiful since Final Fantasy IX (remember what the town of Cleyra looked like?).  As for the character designs, they all have very distictive appearances and nicely detailed outfits, but characters' faces are not as detailed as they could be.  Also, the character acting in the cutscenes is kind of lacking - they frequently make really awkward gestures and motions (such as when characters are supposed to be touching something, but there's like a foot of space between their hands and the thing).  Really, though, they aren't that bad and I can hardly hold it against this game when everything else is so beautiful.Music (score 10/10):  Some of Frederic Chopin's actual music is played during certain scenes, but most of the music was created specifically for the game.  Either way, all the music is lovely.  I felt that each new piece of background music fit well with either the location or the event and that all of them are very pleasant to listen to.  Plus, many of the tracks are quite long and detailed so the \"20-second-repeating-loop\" problem isn't an issue here!  Now, the other half of the aural experience is voice acting.  This is not quite as awesome as the music.  It's certainly not the worst voice acting I've ever heard (that distinguished accomplishment belongs to the first Grandia), but it's not the best either.  The problem really is that there are several younger characters that have voices that either sound fake (like when an adult is obviously pretending to be a child) or are slightly annoying sounding (Salsa's voice irritates me slightly).  Overall, though, the voices are not bad, and the actors themselves do a pretty good job, so I'm not going to hold it against them.  Plus, Frederic's voice is pure awesomeness.Characters (score 9/10):  Oddly, Frederic's in-game character model does bear some resemblance to the real-world Chopin; you know, if he were a beautiful anime character who looked not at all like the age he was supposed to be.  The other characters are 100% fictional.  Frederic spends his time interacting with these characters in his \"dream world\".  Well, Frederic himself is awesome; just the sort of refined, elegant personality that I imagined he may have really had (okay, so I have no idea what the real Chopin's personality was like).  Realistic or not, he IS cool.  Now, there are a handful of other characters (Allegretto, Polka, Beat, Viola, Crescendo, etc. - note that they are all named after musical terms) who also have good characterizations and well-developed personalities.  The only one who really annoyed me was Salsa.  She's just got one of those bratty personalities that make you want to slap her upside her head.  Despite Salsa, by the end of the game, I was really attached to these characters.Story (score 8/10):  The basic premise of this game is that you are experiencing a rather detailed fever dream that is being experienced by famous composer Frederic Chopin.  First, let me get a little confession out of the way...  Sadly, I'm woefully ignorant about Chopin's life (which I remedied somewhat by reading some Wikipedia) and about classical music in general (I really don't understand what a ritardando is, even when I do read the definition).  This game is chock full of music-related references (there's even a character named Allegretto!).  I imagine these would mean more to me if I had some kind of background in music at all...  Oh well.  Anyway, the premise itself is a really interesting basis for an RPG.  Most RPGs have your standard  \"kid from small village saves the world from random evil guy plot\" but Eternal Sonata breaks out of this mold.  In fact, the premise is just refreshingly different among a sea of generic RPG stories.  I think this is the game that really proves that RPG storylines can be truly innovative and different.  Okay, so the premise is good, but is the rest of the actual story executed well?  Well, yes.  I found it gripping all the way throughout.  Even though the ending is kind of confusing at first, it's just the sort of ending that forces one to think, and the story is at least interesting all the way through.Battle System (score 7/10): The combat system is sort of a weird hybrid between turn-based and active.  Basically, each character/enemy has turns, but each turn is on a timer and you move freely about the field during your turn.  Actions are performed by pressing certain buttons which are visible in an onscreen menu.  At the beginning of the game, if you stop moving, your time gauge stops.  However, as the game goes on, they constantly change the battle system so that it doesn't stop anymore and it gives you less and less time (until it eventually stops altogether) to plan your attack at the very beginning of battle (at early stages the time gauges don't start until you move).  This irked me quite a bit because just as you are getting use to how battle works, they change it!  Plus, I just prefer turn-based in general and would've liked it kept that way.  Perhaps they should've just made turn-based or active an option that could be turned on or off from the Options menu.  That would've been best.  Related to this problem is using items.  By the end of the game, you'll be able to carry around up to 40 items (depending on the type of item) and the game does not stop the active time gauge to let you scroll through items.  This got frustrating, believe me.  There are other issues with battle too.  there is a guard system that is notoriously difficult to get to work correctly.  I don't know why, but I had terrible difficulty making it work even though I hit that guard button as soon as the icon came up.  In normal games, blocking attacks is a bonus that helps you avoid damage.  If you miss, the enemy does a normal amount of damage.  In this game, though, failing to guard hurts you quite a lot.  The game is still manageable if you level properly, though, and the rest of the battle system is technically decent.  There is one other thing about the battle system that is kind of cool - the light/dark system.  Basically, shadows and light on the battlefield effect enemies strengths, and characters abilities to use certain skills.  In other words, some enemies morph into stronger beasts in the light/dark, and you can only use certain skills when standing in light/dark areas.  This was a pretty innovative feature.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The first thing I want to mention here may seem random, but it's something that's been irking me for a long time.  PS3 game developers seem to think that because you are probably using an HDTV, it's okay to shrink on-screen text to a size where no one can see it.  Thankfully, Eternal Sonata doesn't do this.  So, I salute you for your nice text size, Eternal Sonata, by pointing it out in this review!  I do have other complaints though...  First off, this game can be mean about the the lack of places to heal.  Places to heal (some people let you rest in their house) are few and far between.  Even worse, sometimes I was stuck before a boss with no way to level raise.  Literally, it wouldn't let me go anywhere except to the boss.  That means that if you happened to accidentally be too low-leveled, you're absolutely screwed.  That's just crummy game design, but it's part of a larger problem.  The game won't let you backtrack much at all, and thus it feels much too restrictive.  I don't mind linearity in the sense that your movements are strongly influenced by the narrative, but this is just ridiculous.  I actually took to keeping three different save files at a time just in case I got stuck somewhere.  Utterly frustrating.  Plus, there is never any point in the game where you have the option to move around the world wherever you want (and no sidequests at the end outside of an optional dungeon).  I've heard that if you replay using the new game+ feature, you can use the warp pad in Baroque city to go to other places, but this doesn't happen on the first playthrough.  Either way, the game feels too cripplingly locked down.  This game's also mean about arbitrarily removing people from your party at certain points, and then not unequipping their accessories so that you literally have no access to them until the next time that character rejoins.  The game is also very arbitrary and unpredictable sometimes about who will be available for a boss fight.  There were several times where the story would shove an unwanted character into a boss fight with no prior foreshadowing or warning.  Other than those issues (which are admittedly pretty big issues), there isn't much else to complain about.Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I've played a ton of video games, some good, some terrible, some that were just okay, but it's been a long time since I've played a video game that was  so hard to judge.  On the one hand, the graphics, story, characters, and music are a clear artistic experience, but the gameplay is not up to par.  I desperately wanted to give this game a perfect score because the premise is so fascinating, but the somewhat painful gameplay holds it back from perfection.  It's not perfect, but it's still a very good game.  I've become very fond of Frederic and crew despite some of this game's shortcomings, so I suppose it's a success in that regard.  In the end, I think my final score is a fair one given my experience with this game.  If you are curious about this game, or are an RPG enthusiast like I am, then you'll want to get a copy of Eternal Sonata; despite it's flaws, it's still worth adding to your collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2011"}

This is my third rechargeable battery for an XBox 360 system.  The first two were white, to match my 20G premium console.  I have recently upgraded to an Elite console (for the reasons mentioned in a separate review of that system) and sold the last of my 20G models.  I sold the two white rechargeable batteries with the white console to make the package more attractive to the buyer.  My original intention was to simply buy a pair of regular AA rechargeable batteries and a charger.I decided to go ahead and purchase this system because I wanted to have a battery system dedicated just for the Xbox.  Like most people, I have a lot of electronic items that use size AA batteries.  And they almost always use up their batteries at the most inconvenient of times.  I have been known to take a set of batteries from one device and use it in another device just to avoid having to run to the store.  I have taken batteries from my console's controller in the past and move them to a portable audio player, for example.  And then end up with no batteries for my controller when I really want to play a game.How much charge will this battery pack hold?  Not as much as a pair of regular alkaline AAs.  But more than a pair of rechargeable NiMH AAs.  If you factor in the cost of the Quick Charger (which is still white, by the way), along with the price of this pack, you can see that it is more than the price of a pair of rechargeable AAs and a charger.  Basically, with this product, you are paying for convenience.  This product will only work for your Xbox, so you are assured of always having a fresh pack available.  I suggest that you purchase two.  If you have children and they use your console, I definitely suggest having a spare battery charged at all times.  The last thing you want is for your child to pester you to drive to the store for some fresh, disposable batteries.

My reason for getting this collection is the fact that it includes the early SF2 versions (and to a lesser extent, Final Fight). The rest of the games (with a handful of exceptions) are probably too old to be included on the same disc (they date from early 1980's), but having them here probably doesn't matter much, one way or another.First, the good: the graphics for most of the games (read on for the exceptions) are  intact, and look as good as they did on the arcade. Unlike their early console predecessors (Genesis, SNES), images have not been scaled, and the games themselves play as they did on the original cabinets. If you have a wide-aspect ratio TV, you'll be playing the exact arcade versions of the games - if not, you can  modify the aspect ratio so that it looks correct on a regular TV. The music is also completely intact and sounds great - while the remixed soundtrack is a poor attempt at best, it's off by default, so it's not a big deal.The bad: the vertically-oriented games, which, on an arcade cabinet would be played on a 90-degree rotated screen, compensate for the lost girth by having some of the vertical space removed. This results in unfortunate placements of some of the HUD elements - for example, when playing 194x games, you'll find that the gauge partially obscures your plane.The biggest gripe I have with this game, however, is the imbecilic way in which the controls are handled - in SF2 games, specifically. This takes away 35% of the enjoyment of the game, since it makes some characters almost unplayable. Not only are fireballs and dragon punches excruciatingly difficult to pull off, but even diagonal jumps are often impossible. Obviously, the analog sticks aren't the ideal input device for SF2-style games, but if Hyper SF2 can do it, why can't this game? Unless you move the stick at a perfect 45 degree angle, the game completely ignores the diagonal movement, or chooses one of the two adjacent sides to move to. Mind you, I don't consider myself a beginner - I play both the Alpha Anthology and SF Anniversary edition well enough.If this is not bad enough, the folks porting the game also chose to use the Start button to bring up the master menu, which allows you to modify controller options, exit to main screen, etc... This would usually be OK, except the combination works _all_ the time - whether you're in the middle of the game, waiting to continue the game, etc... If you're used to mashing the start button in anticipation of the Continue? screen, curb your enthusiasm - or be subjected to the idiotic menu, every time you press Start - EXCEPT! when your bleeding face is on the screen and the counter is counting down. Perhaps to discourage hitting the Start button, you can also continue the game by hitting JAB. The idiocy behind such a decision is mind-boggling, especially when you consider that the Select button brings up the same menu,  and Start could've just as easily been left alone to function as intended.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2006"}

It's fairly rare that a game captivates me to the point that I can't put it down.  I have a short gaming attention span and I'm typically playing through multiple games at once.  It takes an excellent gaming experience to keep me hooked until the end.  Few games have accomplished this (Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, Gears of War series, and Red Dead Redemption to name a few).  The Last of Us is absolutely added to this list.The story alone is enough to keep your attention and wondering what will happen next.  The voice acting is superb and well written.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful.  The controls are very well mapped.  The sounds are perfectly done to establish atmosphere.  I kept waiting to find something wrong with this game, but I really found nothing but great fun.This game embodies the idea of survial horror.  Limited supplies and ammo and lots of enemies.  The game makes you think about how to approach every situation and gives you many options with which to do so.  You can try your luck with a head on approach, guns blazing (which I do not recommend if you want to last long).  You can try to sneak up on foes for stealth kills.  You can simply attempt to avoid all enemies by staying low and sneaking around them.  I found myself on the edge of my seat, heart racing, trying ever-so-carefully to tip-toe by a group of enemies that were blind, but had excellent sense of hearing.  One false step and I'm toast.  I loved it.I played the game on normal difficulty and it was very balanced.  Not crazy impossible and certainly not overly easy.  Also, the game allows for saving anywhere at anytime, which is a definite plus in my book.The game features character progression or \"leveling up\" by finding \"vitamins\" throughout the world.  It also features weapon upgrades and customization, which emphasizes exploration due to the fact that \"tools\" are needed and must be found throughout the game.  All of these are done very well.Melee is smooth.  When you're bashing a foe's head in with a steel pipe, it just feels very real.  Choking a person out takes a few seconds as it would in real life - and you have that feeling of vulnerability while you're waiting for his or her last gasp of breath - will you be seen or heard by other enemies in the vacinity?  It's just so well done.I am very hard pressed to find anything wrong with this game.  If I HAD to provide any sort of criticism, it MIGHT be that the shooting can be a little sloppy.  You may find that when confronted with a few charging infected enemies, squeezing a few rounds off with any sort of accuracy would prove pretty difficult.  Then again, I think that just adds to the realism of the game.Spending $60.00 on this game should be done without hesitation.  If you're a hardcore gamer or just a casual one, this title belongs in your game library.  After producing the Uncharted series and now The Last of Us, Naughty Dog is quickly becoming one of my favorites.PROS- EverythingCONS- NothingOverall: 5/5.

Not that there have ever been a really good year for the genre, Fantasy RPG games.  Good fantasy of the class of the Final Fantasy series is difficult and costly to produce, and somply doesn't have the market share that other types of games command.  Which is why Covenant is such a surprise.The original Shadow Hearts was a strong, gothic game featuring Yuri and Alice as their adventures sprawled across Asia and Europe.  A solid plot, interesting battle system and good art and animation made the game into a closet success.  It wasn't as great as the FFX 10's and lacked the addictive play of the .hack series.  But it was a game well worth playing.Covenant, which picks up the story of Yuri after the death of Alice is an order of magnitude better.  The plot, which fills two disks is full of intricate twists and turns as Yuri and a pretty German lieutenant (Karin) start a journey to find a new evil that is leading early 20th century Europe into war.  These to gradually accumulate a glittering cast that includes Geppetto, his doll Cornelia, Joachim the vampire wrestler, a Russian princess, a white wolf and even more. The go from France to England and Russia and then back to Japan as well.  In this huge geography the cast unearths layer after layer of evil.  Each time the apparent cause is defeated another is found to be pulling the strings.All of the characters come to life thanks to an excellent script and use of cut scene.  Each gets to star, but Joachim steals the show with a genuinely funny performance.  Pompous, perpetually showing of his muscles and still genuinely likeable, he has a knack for using things like frozen tuna and skyscrapers as weapons.  And each time he discovers one we get a new comical cut scenes.  But all of the characters have surprising wit and warmth, and each has their own panoply of accessories, special skills, and weapons.  Most of the subplots of the game involve character improvement.Art and animation are in keeping with the level of the plot.  Hours of cut scenes, many remarkable settings, and a huge cast of villains and monsters keep your eyes on the scene, often desperately looking for the next magical item needed to advance the plot and clues to the next puzzle.The fighting system uses a wheel with sensitive areas.  You have to strike the areas to initiate an attack.  It quickly becomes intuitive, and the player can tune the wheel to enable various feats and displays of skill.  Expect your right thumb to get a serious workout.This game comes in a very close second to the best of Final Fantasy.  Certainly, if you like the one, you will like the other as well.  I managed to get completely distracted by Covenant for something like 90 hours.  You can finish in less, but the subplots are an important part of the game - winning is less important to me than taking the grand tour.  If you've been waiting for something worth spending money on, this is it.  Be warned, the dialog is a bit bawdy - definitely teen and up.On replay -I was surprised how well the game held up the second time through.  this time I played through Shadow Hearts 1 and the through Covenant.  Be warned, while the Japanese version does know that a completed first game was on the card, the US version doesn't seem to.  In neither case does Covenant recognise that a player actually managed to get to the 'good' ending of SH1.  Neither of these are biggies, though.  On this time through I was in better control of the complex play system and managed to run a fairly logical game without a lot of backtracking.Again I was struck by the high level of story telling, and by the amount of innuendo (and worse).  This is a game that really is appealing to someone looking for a richer experience than other RPG's offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2004"}

Honestly, what seperates Tomb Raider from Uncharted, is it's pacing. There is a much greater emphasis on exploration and discovery. I love wandering into tombs, and solving the mini puzzles associated with them, then collecting my reward. As well as combing the island for relics and other items of interest. Also, i love how Lara is depicted in this reboot. Deeply layered personality, with genuine human characteristics. Yeah, she's still really hot, but you can tell she wasn't rendered by horny 20 year old men this time around. Her appearance is far more tasteful now. And i take her more seriously, as a result. Combat is fun, with stealth, hand to hand, and long range attacks as options. I prefer the bow, myself. This game has the best cover system i have ever seen. Not at all cumbersome, like in other games. The story is compelling, though character development and voice acting is hit or miss. Lara is perfect though. The island is beautiful, and the weather effects are so realistic. Buy this game. It's an awesome reboot.

Of course im not saying that this is a bad game, it's just that i expected more from this gameFirst of all, the game has a really deep story. At first i thought the entire game was going to take place in Crusader Jerusalem. Instead, the game has sort of a Matrix like story in which you switch between Desmond in the modern world, and Assassin Altair in 12th century Jerusalem (Desmond's ancestor). The entire plot of the game revolves around these two people. A team Scientist who kidnapped Desmond are trying to find something about Altair's past. So they invited this machine that allows them to look into his ancestor's memories. You really can't do much while playing Desmond, almost all of the games action takes place with Altair and Desmond is just for story purposes.The graphics are a huge selling point for this game. The detail of each city is great..as they all seem to have a separate personality and architecture. Climbing a tower for the first time gives you the impression of just how small you are in this massive world. The dream like feeling and glitches of the adamus machine also add to the games depthMusic and sound are also great. I love the prayers in the background. As well as the gasp of passersby as you push a dead body off of a roof. Just about every citizen you pass will react to you in some way. Some will beg for coins while others will threaten you.Gameplay is what ended up hurting this game. Fighting in this game is basically just button mashing. The AI will block just about every one of your blows, and only die after repeated button mashing. You later learn the ability to do counter attacks. These attacks allow for one hit kills. Although cool looking, it makes for an easy fight. Fighting large groups of enemies is somewhat frustrated, as each time Altair gets hit, he stumbles around like a drunk. It's probably better to run and hide then fight enemies in later stages. This can be accomplish by hiding in a hey stack (which for some reason seems to be conveniently stacked everywhere!) or by dodging into ally ways. Speaking of running, Altair never gets tired of running. You can spirit 100% of the time and except for tripping every once awhile never have to worry about guards catching up to you. It's extremely unbalanced in terms of AI vs player. You won't die much in early stages of the game.The missions themselves are also somewhat of a disappointment. Besides your standard assassin missions, their are side quest you can do to help win the support of local citizens. What i hate about this, is the fact that in every city it's the same quest with the same rewards. Every city has a viewpoint quest (in which you climb to towers and look around), and save citizen quest. Saving citizens will award you a group of scholars you can hide in or a group of vigilantes that will help distract guards who are chasing you. In every city this will be the same award, and in every city the only side quest will be \"Save Citizens\" or \"Climbing Towers\". Climbing towers is fun for the first 10 minutes then it gets really stale..same goes for saving citizensIn order to assassinate your target you got to dig up info on him. So you basically have to do repetitive missions to dig up enough info on your target. This includes interrogation, or informer, or pickpocketing, or eavesdropping. It will always be one of these four and never anything different. Given that every side quest and every assassin mission is somewhat the same. The game has no replay value whatsoeverSo whether your doing side missions or your assassin mission. You're going to be doing something repetitive.Other then that a pretty good game. I like the bold new step and risk that Ubisoft took, as i know that anything that isn't a FPS is hard to sell now and days. Though im not 100% impressed cause we already of stealth games out there, so it's not first of it's kind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001CMJAP6","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"A Great RPG, Even If It Is A Little Flawed...","reviewText":"The Last Remnant starts out with a man named Rush Sykes looking for his sister Irina. Unfortunately for Rush he happens to step right into a battle field. From here Rush meets David, David is the young king of Athlem who is unusually intent in helping Rush find his sister, he even goes as far as to lend the help of his generals. All in all though this is your typical JRPG story.Gameplay in the Last Remnant is something definitely unique, its a mix between a strategy RPG and a turn based RPG. You get whats called unions, leaders, and soldiers. You can have a max of 5 unions, a max of 6 leaders, and a max of 15 soldiers. In each union you are allowed up to 5 members, leaders are the main characters and soldiers are generics witch you have the option of recruiting (for free) by the end of the game you will find that having 4 unions (5 members in 2, and 4 members in 2 with 2 leaders in each union) works best. You can see all the enemies on the screen before you enter battle, so obviously there are no random battles. While you are in battle you can give general commands to your unions, ie: Attack with mystic arts (magic) or attack with combat arts (powerful attacks) or heal. What each character will do is almost completely random, you have very little control over what happens, sometimes it was just plain luck that I won some boss battles. The good thing about the battle system is that it is not an active one, meaning you don't have to worry about the enemy attacking you while you are thinking about what to do next.The graphics in the Last Remnant are a mixed bag while character models look great and most environments are not far behind, textures take a long time to load sometimes you see 3 different sets of textures load one at a time! Why oh why Square Enix used the Unreal 3 engine is beyond me, this is a classic case of the developers just not being able o properly use the unreal engine. Square should have stuck with in house engine for the Last Remnant (crystal tools would have been perfect for the Last Remnant). Needless to say installing this game to your 360 is a must. (as a side note, Lost Odyssey also used the U3 engine and mist walker didn't have much, if any, problems with it.)If I had one major gripe with the Last Remnant it would be that the main character isn't a very good leading man, I find his supporting cast members (particularly David) are the saving grace as this game would fall apart if it weren't for them.One minor complaint I do have with the Last Remnant is how the difficulty of the game goes from a 5 (out of 10) to a 9 at the last major boss battle of disc 1. This lead to a lot of grinding and actually was more frustrating than enjoyable for me. At the start of disc 2 the difficulty relaxes a little only to slap you in the face again at the final stages of the game (the final 8 or so battles of the game) with an even bigger difficulty boost than the last time.Overall the last remnant is a fairly good RPG, but is forgettable with very little memorable moments, unfortunately the technical issues combined with a few small problems that add up, stop The Last Remnant from becoming a classic 360 RPG.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

If you get them down, the game flows as naturally as a river.  But if you can't get them down there is no way to change them and it'll be an unpleasant experienceIt has been twenty-one years since Pit last had an outing.  The last time we got a Kid Icarus game was on the original Gameboy way back in 1991.  With over two decades and several consoles since then, can Kid Icarus even hope to survive in this day and age?  The Answer is yes.  It needed to be reinvented but that's to be expected after bypassing so much advancement in gaming.  If you can get a grip on the controlsThere isn't much of a story to Kid Icarus Uprising.  Medusa has come back after her last defeat and it's up to Pit, by order and assistance of Palutena to stop her.  Palutena guides Pit to various locations and dungeons to defeat the followers of Medusa.  It's a basic plot and story.  What really makes it come alive, however, are the characters.  Pit and Palutena go back and forth in such a natural way you understand their relationship.  Even more than that, the game is filled to the brim with jokes and some witty dialog.  The game's story doesn't take itself too seriously.  The characters dialog reminds us, constantly, that we've been through this song and dance before.  So they spend more time joking with one another and making comments.  Some of them going so far as to break the fourth wall.  In one dungeon, for instance, Pit remarks that when he sees a chest he HAS to open it while his partner during this moment remarks, \"We'll see how long you last with that strategy,\" right as they get ambushed.  It's fun stuff and it's entertaining to watch.  And you'll find some moments that'll genuinely make you laugh.  It's partially because of the cartoonlike feeling of it all, but a lot of it is also because Pit just happens to be likable.  It's enough to keep you entertained.Where Kid Icarus succeeds, and might confuse people slightly is the gameplay.  It's going to take some time to get adjusted to. The game is divided into chapters.  Each chapter begins with an on-rails shooter segment as Palutena guides you to your destination.  This is an on-rails shooter.  All your aiming is done by moving the stylus along the bottom screen as your reticle moves across the top screen and aims at enemies.  If you played Metroid Prime Hunters on the original DS, it's a similar experience.  It's actually rather simple to do.  You'll move Pit across the screen using the circle pad and you'll fire with L.  It's a lot simpler than it appears.  The on-rails shooters are simple to learn and surprisingly addictive and fun.  It's frantic and cluttered but never too much.  If you're playing with the 3D on, it looks absolutely astonishing at this moment.When you're actually in the dungeon crawling moments it gets to be a bit more complex.  You'll move the stylus on the bottom screen to not only aim, but to also turn Pit.  You'll use the circle pad to move forward, backward and strafe.  In the heat of combat this can be difficult to really do.  It's just as cluttered but with the added bonus of having to cover your back the learning curve during these moments can be steep.  As you go through each dungeon there are also chests to open and items to grab.  Each one also ends with a boss.  None of the levels are too terribly long, and they're not too difficult either (although you can always adjust the difficulty before each chapter).  The controls will take some time to get used to and they'll like screw you up.  The controls may also give you hand cramps from time to time.  The game, luckily comes with a stand to put your 3DS on and play like that.  It's not bad if you're sitting down at a table.  It's not necessary, but it helps.There are moments where the controls may not always be in your favor.  They can feel clunky at times.  When you really get them down, they click and the experience is enjoyable.  It might take some time, but they do come together.  There are ways in which Nintendo remedies this.  The first and most useful for newcomers is that there is an aim assistance and even an auto-fire option for players.  You can also adjust the sensitivity to anyway you want.  Likewise, there is also a practice mode to actually practice the controls.  It might've been nice to have different control options.  And even buying the Circle Pad Pro isn't going to allow for the familiar third person aiming you might expect.  Luckily, the game itself isn't hard on the default setting.  You can make it more challenging, and in most cases you might want to.  Increasing the difficulty can lead to new areas in a chapter to uncover more secrets.Throughout the experience you'll find lots of treasures, pick up lots of items and collect hearts.  Pit will begin with a basic weapon, but can collect more and change his weapon between chapters.  There is also the \"Treasure Hunt,\" which are designated challenges to uncover certain tiles on a grid that eventually reveal a picture.  These are challenges such as clearing a chapter in a certain amount of time or defeating certain enemies.  There are a lot of them and the rewards can be as miniscule as hearts... while others can be powers that you can use in combat.The overall experience of the game isn't bad.  It's frantic and fast paced.  It's going to keep you on your toes.  And when you finally get the controls down everything about begins to flow smoothly.  The game can also keep you busy for a bit.  Getting through the campaign itself is likely to only take you a dozen hours or so.  However, replaying to do all the challenges or discover all the hidden secrets can keep you coming back.  The replay value of many of the chapters is rather high.Production wise, Kid Icarus Uprising looks fantastic.  It is easily one of the 3DS's best looking games out there.  The 3D is amazing, especially in the levels in which you fly.  It's amazing stuff.  But like so many 3DS titles out there, there isn't really a reason to put the 3D on.  It enhances the visuals, sure, but it's not needed to enjoy the game, and after a while you'll likely turn it off anyway.  The cartoon like look of the game works rather well for the system.  In particular, some of your enemies are well detailed.  And for those who recall seeing Metroids in the original NES game... they make another cameo here.  It's definitely out of place, but it's a nice little easter egg nonetheless.  The audio also stands tall.  The voice acting is surprisingly competent and well delivered.  It makes for not only a good looking game, but a great sounding one at that.  The music is also incredible.  Most of it compliments the frantic nature of the levels.The only thing that keeps the game down are the controls.  When they come together they're great, but it's a wonder if they'll come together for all players.  And it can really make the difference in your enjoyment of the game.  It can even be a turn off for players overall. The fact that there is no way to change them compounds this.  Practice can make perfect, but it's certainly not a control scheme that could possibly appeal to everyone.Kid Icarus: Uprising is a pretty good experience.  The only thing that really keeps it from being as fantastic as it could be is that the learning curve takes some time.  Aside from that the game doesn't really have too much that holds it down.  Yes, it might take a moment to learn, but once you do everything flows really well.  It's not the same Kid Icarus it was over twenty years ago, but the return works rather well.  At this point, it's a curiosity just where the franchise can go from here.  It's a fine welcome back for Pit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

It's the realism. the car handling, the feel of actually driving a rally car. Rally games really haven't penetrated the US market. Only a handful of American enthusiasts cling to this very European sport. I'm one of those Americans. With the release of DiRT, it's pretty obvious that Codemasters toned down the realism of car handling and made it into a very arcadey type of racing. Codemasters went as far as changing the driver and co-driver's voice to an American. No more hard Scottish accents in this game. Now, all you hear is some guy saying American expressions like \"I'm stoked! \"Awesome all the way!\" This is so cool!\". I got this feeling this guy was more into surfing and skateboarding than rally driving.Handling: No realistic powerslides in this game. This is arcade driving all the way. Very easy to do drifting and pendulum turns along tight corners. Cars feel like they're floating on air, almost the car is skating on ice. Braking has been changed to arcade style braking. When you hit the brakes, the car stops like somebody threw a brick wall in front of you. Slight touches on the brakes will put the car to a complete halt. Very unrealistic. Very arcadey. You've been warned.Graphics: Excellent graphics. No slow downs. Have several driving views. I'm glad they have the dashboard view and bonnet view. I use these views to make everything realistic. Nobody drives behind the car in real life right?Gameplay: Tons of rally modes. This is a mish mash of different rallies. One minute you're driving a Lancer Evolution and then the next you're driving a MAN trailer truck (without the trailer). Brings some unique driving experiene. They even have the buggy rally. All in all, game can be beaten in a few days. AI not too smart. You can easily dominate them around the turns.Conclusion: If you're out for a quick rally fix without the real bells and whistles then this game is for you. If you're after realism, wait for the next release. This will disappoint rally loyalists.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2007"}

Bakehorn","summary":"This tale's been told before.","reviewText":"The PSP launched in March 2005 with only a few games that really took advantage of its hardware or unique features. One of the few that did was Sony Online Entertainment's Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade. It was a game that had potential, and that potential has been brought to another Sony launch, that of the PlayStation 3. How does SOE's Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom fare in the next-gen, non-handheld environment? To say it bluntly, fair. Very fair.The Dark Kingdom suffix refers to the storyline's location of Dureth, a land victimized by dark magic, a demented king, and his legions of soldiers attacking defenseless, innocent civilians. Luckily for Dureth a group of gifted soldiers known as the Dragon Shade are there to save the day. From here one picks from three different Dragon Shade combatants: the brutish warrior, the swift scout, or the mystical mage. This begins a 20-hour adventure, as one of those characters sets out to discover what's driven the dark king to his madness.Untold Legends feels a whole lot like every other 3D dungeon-crawling hack-and-slash. For the most part combat consists of mashing different combinations of the X and Square buttons to perform direct or sweeping attacks that absolutely devastate a pack of enemies. It's repetitive but that's to be expected from the genre and design. It's hard to grow tired of destroying a legion of skeleton swordsmen, to be entirely truthful. In fact, it's only when combat is taken away from the player that the game starts to become frustrating. Between hacking and slashing creatures the player will often perform jumping and platforming puzzles as well as some that will have one's head spinning for a moment before it is discovered what will allow one to move on. These puzzles go a long way towards making the game a little more than just a hack-and-slash, but at its core, that's all it really is anyway.Leveling up is always enjoyable in RPGs (or should be) and Untold Legends is no different. Defeating enemies earns the player experience points that allow the character to level up. When leveled up, the character's stats can be increased (health, mana, melee damage, defense, etc.) and new magic attacks can be learned or strengthened. It is all too generous that Untold Legends allows the player to power up one of the nine magic skills at every level up; at level 45 one will have every single skill maxed out. Still, it's quite fun to beef up the characters. The game allows one to customize a lot; for example, it is possible to focus on strengthening melee damage and health points to make an indestructible warrior or emphasize ranged magic attacks and mana points for mages.Throughout the game the player will also absorb essence from fallen enemies and destroyed objects (similar to Devil May Cry). Yellow essences act as currency and allow the player to purchase new item enhancements as well as red essences (heals the character) or blue essences (restores mana). Red and blue orbs are also found on fallen enemies. The only problem with the essence system is that the purpose of yellow orbs is defeated when one has to purchase pricey red and blue ones from save checkpoints if health or mana dips too low.It hasn't yet been said but Untold Legends plays and looks a lot like Peter Molyneux's Xbox blockbuster Fable. One could take that two different ways. The first is as a compliment, because Untold Legends plays like one of the best Xbox games ever created, and this reviewer's personal favorite hack-and-slash game. The second is as a big insult, because a next-generation video game is being compared to a last-generation one. The combat system, essence-collecting, level-up system, and general gameplay mechanics are all remarkably similar.Sadly, the visuals aren't much better. Untold Legends has pretty environments, lots of particle effects, and an interesting art design but the animation is just terrible. The Havok engine is put to use here but only sparingly. The camera is the bane of the entire game; it very often gets snagged on trees, boxes, or anything protruding from a wall. This results in it spinning wildly and the player taking extra time to figure out which direction to continue battling. At the very least, the music is pretty darn good and fits the environments and storyline quite well. It's just too bad that the sound effects don't compliment this for a great audio score, because they're very dull and powerless.Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is a fun game. It is quite fun to play alone for 20 hours or online with three other friends (it's even free, and one can use the experience earned here in the single-player game). Hacking and slashing might be mindless but it doesn't feel too boring or old in Dark Kingdom. Still, a few problems like ho-hum effects and a bad camera keep it from being a truly great game. Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is worthy of purchase for those PlayStation 3 owners looking for something to keep them busy until bigger titles come out next year, but that's all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2007"}

Gray","summary":"Must own FF Game!!!","reviewText":"I have to start off by saying this is the first FF game I played and didn't know quite what to expect.  In fact when I first put this game in I turned it off after about 30 minutes or so of not getting anywhere.  I didn't put it back in until several months later.  I had to force myself to play through the beginning and when Tidus first meets Rikku simply because it was so boring.  In fact, the game really didn't pick up until Tidus meets Wakka and then finally, the games gets good. No, not good, amazing.The graphics on this game were awsome, along with the voice work, except for Tidus, he was kinda a goof.  The game play is standard turn based which was new for me because this was only the second rpg game I played( first one being x-men legends)  Soon I understood how to play and it was not difficult at all.  In fact, it's almost boring choosing an attack and that person doing it(unlike the Shadow Hearts series where the judgement ring determines the outcome of an attack)The story is really interesting though.  It's about a summoner and her guardians on a quest to stop Sin, which that has a surprising twist to it.  I won't say too much, but Tidus is in for a suprise.The cut scenes are beautiful and the voice acting as well.  The only bad thing is you aren't able to skip a cut scene and some of them are rather lengthy.  So if you aren't interested in the cut scenes, the only thing I can suggest is getting up and getting a snack and hopefully they will have ended when you get back.There is this thing called the Sphere Grid and in order to move spaces and aquire new skills and what not, you have to participate in battle.  Each character had to make at least one move during the combat or else they don't get any moves on the grid. That's alright because you can instantly change out any party member with some one else and them put that person back in(unlike some other games where you can only change out party members at a save spot or by talking to a certain person)  You can also choose the path you want a certain character to go on the sphere grid, whether you want that person to use white magic, black magic, be a theif, whatever, you can decide.I don't recall there being many side quests in this game but the ones I do recall were quite involved.  Like Wakka and the Blitz Ball.  I personally could not stand the Blitz Ball and never played it unless I was forced to do so.  Then there was capturing the monsters you fought and the monster arena which was cool.  It gave you some great rewards.Each character was equipped with a certain weapon like a knife, a blitz ball, something unique to that character.  You were also able to customize that weapon with different things such as petrify or slow, so long as you had the required items to make that weapon.  My personal favorite was \"no encounters\" which allows you to go from point A to point B without engaging with the enemy.  Why would anyone want that?  Well, when you get further into the game and go back to one of the early spots for something, the monsters there aren't even worth the time to stop and fight, unless you're trying to capture them, they don't give you much experience points or gil.  Or, if you're simply trying to get to a save spot because your running low on health or magic, having the no encounters on your weapon is great.  And of course you can always switch weapons when ever you're ready to fight again.Each character is well defined and they have their own purpose for traveling and fighting against Sin.  Even the NPC are awsome.  Speak with all the NPC you can and you come to find out they are rather supportive of the Lady Summoner and often give her and her guardians nice surprises.I have to admit I was some what dissappointed with the ending. I won't reveal it, but I will say it was bitter sweet.Enough said, go play the game!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"C. Irish \"Read On!\"","summary":"Scary","reviewText":"I bought this game a few years ago for the PlayStation 2 and hated it. I resold it quickly. I thought I would try it again for the Wii and play it on the large screen TV with the Wii Zapper. This time I loved it. This is a fairly scary game though so beware, it's not for the faint of heart.What I do like about this game is that it is playable. You might have to try the battles over until you get them right, but the levels are fairly passable and even I can play it (trust me, that is saying a lot). Another good thing about it is that it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. This is an inexpensive game that you can play for hours and get your money's worth. The cost of games sometimes, on games that are not even fun or playable is crazy. With this game you can take a chance without making a big dent in your wallet. If it doesn't work for you, you haven't spend fifty dollars to find out. In this time of tightened budgets you can afford to try it and if you don't like it, you've not wasted fifty bucks of your hard earned money just to find out that it's too hard for you or that you just don't like it. Ten or twelve dollars is perfect for trying out a game and if you like it, it's like a bonus.Resident Evil 4 is gruesome at times but then again, it is a horror game so you get what that encompasses. For Halloween, it's a fun game to play.There is a good map feature that helps you follow the trails you need to go on and you can collect ammunition and weapons that can make it easier to do the battles that you come up on. Some of the bosses are pretty hard. There is a hard scorpion like guy that is really hard, but they are not all too hard that you can't eventually pass to move on in the story. There are tons of teenage boys that post videos of them defeating the bosses so you can look them up and watch them and then use their knowledge to try and pass the levels. With my limited game play ability, I was able to glean some good tips that helped me pass the levels. Using the Wii Zapper was fun with this game.There is a lot of ground to cover and there are lots of areas to explore to gather stuff you need like herbs for healing. There is a merchant that you can buy things from the money you collect from killing zombies and finding cash stashed around the farms and lands you explore.For casual gamers who might like to try a horror game to play, I would recommend this one. It's fun, you can kill the zombies, and you can pass the boss battles without becoming too frustrated where you just stop playing and bash the game against the wall and it's not expensive. This is a playable horror game if you'd like to give one a try I would recommend this one. It can get really gross and disturbing - I just want to warn you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2010"}

I never got into Halo or Zelda or Mario; for me, RE4 is what video game consoles are made for.I played the GC and PS2 version back in early 2006.  After getting my Wii I decided to replay this great game.  The adaptation for the Wii controler makes the game a little easier to play through than on the other cnosoles.  The same visuals remain -- and like the PS2 version, you get progressive scan which makes some of the darker scenes easier to navigate.  Unfortunately, no new content is added, but the price is not too bad, esp. if you buy it used.This is just an awesome \"total experience\" game that every game lover should play.  The wii version is worth at least a rental even for those who've already played it before on another console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2007"}

However at times the game can be a little frustrating do certain enemies just respawn back instantly, the controls could've been better with the aim & covering system, but most of all switching to different weapons can be annoying and i wish they could of done at least some type attachment system or upgrade for the weapons.The game is fun if you like just running through it and blast away. There's much strategy for it and it does take a lot of patience to play this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2013"}

You take on a character who relives scenes such as the Russian Roulette scene in Deer Hunter.It's fair to say that if you've watched any war movies, you've seen all the scenes involved here. You get the Dirty Dozen, Deer Hunter, Platoon, and more. The plots tend to be extremely scripted. You have one way to get through a scene and either you perfect it or you're stuck.The AI definitely doesn't win any awards. Many other games shine in AI, and this isn't it. Don't expect your friends to help out, and don't expect the enemy to think wisely either. You're mostly dealing with fairly simple robots who do what they think they were told to do.The infinite enemies is always something I get annoyed with. It means, if you're stealthy and careful, that you're penalized for being that way. Surely after the 800th enemy they have run out of backup!The voice acting is fairly good, and the video is good. If you're a fan of all those old war movies, which I admit I am, then there's a certain amount of fun being immersed in them. But there's one thing to enjoy being \"in the scene\" with Robert De Niro. It's another to be there and then annoyed by streams of never-ending enemies stalking at you like zombies.Speaking of which, there's a zombie mini-game in there. I do enjoy mini-games but this one was fairly silly. I suppose it doesn't cause any harm to have it added into the mix. But I wish they'd spent that development time on polishing the main game's gameplay.I'd recommend renting this game first, to see how much it appeals to you. Certainly there's an audience for every game. It could be that this is just what you're looking for. But you're sure to figure out after a day or two if this is tedious for you, or an exciting trip back in time.Rating: 7/10.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"azog","summary":"Pok&eacute;mon X","reviewText":"I've got six badges so far, so I feel like I've seen enough of the game to make a review based on actual game-play rather than preconceived notions. I've only been playing Pokemon since HG/SS, so I'm definitely not a genwunner. I'm also not into competitive battling, so I won't really be talking too much about that, or things like the new fairy type. Those are topics for discussion on forums, not a game review. Since most of the changes are the online features, I'll probably discuss those more than anything else.For starters, yes, it is the same as every other Pokemon so far. The same introduction, pick your starter, battle random trainers and gym leaders, collect badges, defeat the champ. The same limitations of having a party of six, with each having a max of four active moves. If you stop and think, everything else is gravy: story, graphics, music, etc. The fundamental mechanics are the same, and I think that is quite frankly the majority of the reason for the franchise's staying power. You can pick up any gen game, and knowing your basic types, weaknesses, etc, you'll know how to play.A lot of the changes in this generation are based mostly around the online features, some of which were only in their beginnings in BW/B2W2. But you no longer have to find a Pokemon Center to participate in the online functions, they're all right on the screen. You can turn the online functions on and off at will.Probably the most interesting is the PSS, the Player Search System. Like most native 3DS games, this game integrates with the 3DS friend codes, so you no longer have to manage separate friend codes. You just add their 3DS code to the 3DS friends app, and then you can see their status in-game. Now while you're in game, you can see their status: player profile, badges, and other things. You can battle, trade or chat with them. Pretty much like in the old Union Rooms, but not as limited as the Union Rooms were.Over time, you'll see people being added to the PSS, under the headings of acquaintances and passerbys. Acquaintances are added as you interact with other remote players via the global trade, battles, etc. I'm not exactly sure how passerby's work, but I think they just are random people who appear on your screen; again, you can interact with them in all the same manners. One thing I enjoy so far is the \"wonder trade\", which is a random trade matchup: you chose which Pokemon you want to trade, and it'll find someone in the world, and you get what you get. You might get trash Pokemon, or you might get something good.Beyond the online features are all the other changes to the game. Music is awesome, no longer grating to the ears (altho I'm a chiptune fan, you can only listen to the Pokecenter music for so long without wanting to stab your eyes out). The graphics are fantastic, altho I do not play in 3D mode. The avatars are nicely customizable. After a long-winded review, I'll just close with that I think this is a great addition to the franchise.Post-game edit: I beat the champ in about 5 days, less than 25 logged playing. This is by far the easiest version I've played. Each gym, elite and champ, I was able beat in one attempt. I never felt it necessary to rethink my team, go back and grind up, or anything of that nature. I also played straight thru with my starter, Fennekin, in slot one. She was KO'ed a few times, but I never considered retiring her. With Exp Share, even my HM slaves become viable.I'm still exploring post-game play, and since I have tried to refrain from strat guides, I don't know how extensive post-game is yet. So far, I've found a side-arc of working in a detective agency, and found daily jobs at a hotel. I found two stationary legendaries to catch, and ran into one roaming legendary but do not know how to catch it yet. I did not find anything similar to BW2's Join Ave, or the little and big stadiums, with their daily battles, but I'm probably not searching hard enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2013"}
