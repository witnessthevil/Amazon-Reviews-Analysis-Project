S.","summary":"Horrific AI and awful combat spoil this decent RPG","reviewText":"The combat was just too imbalanced.  Most battles are a breeze; you easily win every battle by doing simple combos and timing your defense well.  However, when it comes to bosses the game becomes unnecessarily difficult and frustrating.  Boss fights are overly hard for absolutely no reason.  The bosses are so powerful that you can't approach them head on like 99% OF THE REST OF THE GAME, forcing you to use the frustrating other parts of the combat system such as \"free run.\"  Free run allows you to walk anywhere on the battle field, not just forward and backward.  On Xbox360 you have to hold Left Trigger to use Free Run.  This allows you to dodge attacks but it is so annoying to have to press another button just to move freely.  And you MUST use free run on bosses because they are too overpowered so you can't use defense.  This forces you to play a certain way, and that's no fun.The AI will cause you to lose boss battles numerous times.  I was fighting one of the first bosses in the game where there are plants that are on the battlefield that stun an area around them when you attack them.  They don't actually attack or are considered enemies (because you don't have to defeat them to win).  However, the RETARDED AI spent the entire battle ATTACKING THEM, STUNNING HIMSELF and then we died.  Not to mention all AI characters will just stand in the line of fire until they die, including magic casters.  This makes some boss battles almost impossible for me to beat.I'm very upset because the story seemed kind of fun, although a little shallow.  The characters felt natural and the dialogue was good.  I want to continue the story, but I can't stand the gameplay...  Unfortunately I think I'll have to quit without finishing.EDIT:  I forgot to mention how this game is an obvious clone of Eternal Sonata.  In fact, the overworld music in this game is the EXACT same music from Eternal Sonata in the area where you collect the papers for the goats.  Rip off?  I think so.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPC","description":"The year is 2027. The machines of Skynet have risen, reaping a bloody harvest of human flesh across the globe. You are a soldier of Tech Com, a ragged team of human resistance fighters intent upon stopping the overwhelming onslaught of cybernetic assassins in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Your ultimate goal is to reach a time travel device in time to send Kyle Reese back to 1984, with the hope of preventing a relentless Terminator model T-800 from murdering Sarah Connor, mother of resistance leader John Connor.This game is set before the events of the firstTerminatorfilm. There are three playable characters, each with specialized skills and abilities, including Kyle Reese, hero of the film. The 11 massive missions take the player through diverse, richly detailed, highly interactive environments. The dynamic camera system allows the player to target cyborgs with speed and accuracy, using never-before-seen weapons of wanton destruction.Terminator: Dawn of Fateincludes both missile and melee combat in third- and first-person play modes.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A gritty little shooter that wants to be so much more","reviewText":"Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a straight forward action/shooter with the storyline serving as a prequel to the first Terminator film.  During the course of the game's 10 missions, you'll play as three different characters (including Kyle Reese, Michael Biehn's character from the original film), and even though the characters look different, the gameplay stays the same.  To move the game along are some nicely rendered CG cinema sequences and in-game cut scenes, plus a comlink to pick up more objectives in the middle of a mission; all of which are nice little additions, but what hurts Terminator: Dawn of Fate are the overly clunky controls and annoying camera.  Especially the fact that depending on which way your character is running, shooting, etc., the controls will change up whenever the camera angle does the same; if all of this would have been corrected this game would be a near must own.  The game's graphics have moments of brilliance, but are nothing special really, as is the sound effects.  All in all, despite it's flaws, Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a must play for fans of the Terminator films, but action gamers may be better suited to look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2002"}

(They are not identical twins.) I do have two identical TVs, one bed, one den. Both 50\" 1080p Panasonic G10s. For this review, I put the girls side by side in the batcave, 360 on one, PS3 on her sister. I played 360 on Hardcore. Wife played PS3 on Hardcore. We tested Casual mode with blindfolded babies. (One 3, one 7.) These are my raw Day 1 Notes.23 YEARS IN THE MAKINGI've been waiting to play this game for 23 years. I'm 32. I met my wife when I was 9. The girl next door. We played doctor in the treehouse, I diagnosed her with Sniffle-itis, then invited her down into my basement for a little \"Duck Hunt.\" We played our way. I was the Glorious Strategist. She was the Naughty Librarian. She held the Zapper with her feet. It got me thinking. I said shooting ducks is Weaksauce. She said someone should make Shooting Witches. (Her parents were Religious.) I said Black Leather Witches. She said Giants. I said Sexy Giants. She said With Glasses. I said Sexy Giant Black Leather Witch Girl should be The Shooter. She said With Glasses. I said Hot. Shooting ducks? No. Shooting demons. Demons suck. Sexy shooting Sucking Demons. And she said... With Guns On Her Feet. And I said, That would be Sweet. And she said, I would totally buy that with my whole allowance. And for the next 23 years my GI Joe had his face burried between her Barbie doll's legs. True Story. Hideki Kamiya can READ MINDS!FIRST AA GAME OF 2010You may think by AA that I'm saying the character model's breasts are too small, and you'd be wrong, though they are. You might think that by AA I'm suggesting that you play this game drunk off your nuts, and you'd be wrong, though you should. What I'm talking about is this. This game is Classy. Bayonetta spanks. She spanks Devils. She spanks Ninjas. She spanks Gods of Wars. Bayonetta is the Ultimate Spank Machine. So if you're in the market for the ultimate spank machine, you should pick this hottie up.SMALL HEAD, BIG HEARTI've never made love to an eight-foot-tall sassyass witch, but I've thought about it. Word on the street is that Bayonetta's head is too small. And I hear it. But unlike the haterz, I thought it through. She's a frickin' giant. Take any naughty girl. Take Kate Beckinsale. She's like 5'8\". Stretch that action to 8 Feet. If her head's not bitty, she don't look Giant. If you just scale her, she'd look thick. Huge. And then she's a fatty. Thighs the width of tree trunks. Fox News will be railing on the Japanese for indoctrinating American girls into getting thigh-reduction surgery in the Land of the Implants. You want her to look like Andre the Giant? Some Ukrainian circus freak? No. Leave the Tall Girl alone. Because it's not the size of a girl's head that matters. It's that she uses it to make you feel good.CONTROLS LIKE NIPPLEZRemember your first nipple? Nintendo 64, Baby! Mario 64. And did that nipple feel good. It felt like magic. Work that action with your thumb. Lightning in a bottle. But I'm old now. I've had too much action. Hard to remember how it felt, that first time. Gentlemen, meet Bayonetta. Touch these Love Nubs. She will melt into your palms. She will perform, at your command. Right on the screen, exactly how you want her. It feels like the first time. Every time. You're a Jedi. The prequels never existed. Now You're Playing With Power.THE INCREDIBLE EDIBLE JAPANESE VIDEO GAMESEXY GO CUTSCENE SHINE STARSome say The Story is incomprehensible. Too wacky. Too Japanese. That this isn't high quality narrative like a Michael Bay movie. That this has as much plot as Sarah P's first film, Nailin' Palin. But that's just the American mindset. And it's a legitimate POV. But I'm American. I think American. I talk American. I write American. But I have learned how to turn my brainpan into a donut. To oscillate levels of emotion. To breath cartoon jelly. I can appreciate foreign story structures. It's like a muscle. You gotta pump it. You gotta pump Bayonetta until she sings, until you just pop. You gotta evolve, man! Level Up. If you don't work Bayonetta all the way to the end, you are missing out on the glory of the total human condition. Platinum Games has engineered synthetic bliss. Bliss-On-Tap.HARDCORE VS CASUALI Am Hardcore. And my wife can spank me as hard as I can spank her. We thrive on competition. We hold our own annual competitive watersports. We each just finished our eleventh Iron Man. So we blindfolded our three year old daughter, gave her a controller, set her in front of the plasma, and put Bayonetta in casual mode. She almost beat the entire first level before she ran off shouting \"European Butter.\" This isn't Ninja Gaiden Black on easy, this is Wii Music. So if you like Sexy Action, but fear the Hard Spanking, know that Bayonetta will play with you the way you like it. It's all good, Babaghanoush.360 VS PS3(*SHAKES FIST IN DIRECTION OF JAPAN* SEGA!)It hurts me to type this. I make love to my PS3 every evening before bed. But the PS3 Bayonetta is a bit of a down syndrome baby. She's a supermodel. But her smoothness is a bit twitchy. Easily overwhelmed. Baby's slow to load. I saw it with my own two balls. That said, she's still a hottie. 360 is 5-Stars in bed. PS3 is 4.7-Stars in bed. I have every system, so I'm going to be keeping my girl in Bill Gates pants. But if I only had a PS3, I would absolutely Buy Her. Because Bayonetta is the New Sexiness. I'd just retrain my brain into thinking her flaws are cute. \"Oh, she's confused again, she's such a Hottie.\" I donated my PS3 copy to the foxy lesbian who lives in my building who I persuaded to buy a slim as a blu-ray player. She looks like Megan Fox, but only plays Peggle. She said Bayonetta was incredibly #&@%able! So there you go. 1 Review. 5 Points of view.BUY IT, PLAY IT, KISS BAYONETTA ON THE LIPS!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

Now, I have read a number of reviews on here about Battlefield 4 - some are obviously written by either crackheads or 10-year olds, while others are pretty well-written and articulate crucial points very well.  I will do my best to write this game review so that mine falls in the latter category.FYI, there are no real spoilers in this review, and covers both the single player and, briefly, the multiplayer.Ok, there are five areas that I will discuss a little more regarding Battlefield 4: Storyline, Graphics, Sound, Controls, and Replay value.Storyline:  While not as intriguing as or able to draw you in like its predecessor's storyline (which drew somewhat significantly from a previous EA game, BLACK), this story is a good one and is well thought out, albeit short.  It will make you feel like part of a well-oiled team at first, throw a monkey wrench in the works, and force you to re-think what you thought you knew about certain characters.  But, overall, the plot is worthy of a hollywood movie and is pretty cool.Graphics:  Here's the hiccup.  While EA was trying to get this game ready for FIVE different platforms, including PC, it skimped on the polish for current-gen systems, obviously.  I played the PS3 version, so I can't speak for the Xbox 360 owners, but I am sure they will see a similar lack of polish.  Does it look better than Battlefield 3?  Maybe in parts, but the whole is not greater - in fact, it may very well look POORER than Battlefield 3 did.  There are also graphical inconsistencies within the game (riding around in a boat in the water comes to mind - the water doesn't lap over the sides, it flows right through the boats sides then out of the boat again as if the boat is just a hologram and you're on a platform riding on top of sand), and it is obvious EA only worked on it enough to make sure it functioned without freezing.  Also, look out for the occasional teleporting enemy. Ouch.Sound:  The sound is pretty good, but not necessarily better than Battlefield 3.  The gunfights and team members shouting are pretty well put together, as is the vehicle sounds, although they should be just a little better, especially this late in the generation.  Not much real ambient sound noticeable except for when its raining torrents later on in a mission.Controls:  They are pretty tight and responsive, and there is a configuration if you want to use a Battlefield 3 controller configuration.  No complaints here, EA did a pretty good job.Replay value: Single player? Maybe after I finish a playthrough of the new Batman game.  It was fun the first time through, but not really compelling enough to make me want to come back to it.  Multiplayer is the saving grace of this game.  The variety of modes are great, and - although I've never really gotten into MP of any previous game - I find myself playing Conquest or Team Deathmatch for hours a day.  Its quick and easy to get into a game and very addicting.  Plus, the level of team work possible makes this portion of the game truly amazing.So, that's it in a nutshell.  The single player game is fun but nowhere near as much as MP.  It is a tremendous experience, especially when playing Conquest, and it is a great way to spend a Friday Night.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"A.

Waters","summary":"Lightning has struck twice!","reviewText":"First Retro Studios made the amazing Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Wii & 3DS and now they have what most would assume is just a glorified add on to their already amazing game but this is so much more. The concept is still the standard Donkey Kong concept and the game plays out like it did back in the Gameboy days. This is what is so great about this series just like most Mario games. The characters and story are top notch and so are the graphics. Donkey Kong is soooo furry. Each character has their own specific abilities so it add a layers to the game that was missing out of the first one and it greatly appreciated. The music is bouncy to fit the mood and the locations are all lively and dffierent enough to not give you that deja vu feeling. This is an extremely fun game for the whole family to play but it does require patience just like all Donkey Kong games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}

Dead or Alive Dimensions is one installment I've looked forward to with alot of anticipation simply because it is the first handheld Dead or Alive game(fighting DoA game) to grace a Nintendo console. I was expecting DoAD to be dumbed down to make it onto the system but I'm quite surpised that everything I know and love the series for is there. Deep technical fighting? Check. Gorgeous visuals? Check. Online gameplay? Check. Lots of play modes? Check. Extras? Check. Do I recommend the game to all 3DS owners out there? You better believe it.In my opinion, this has to be the best fighter on the Nintendo 3DS, thus far. Even toppling out Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition(And, honestly, I love both franchises). Seeing as to how the 3DS is the system for fighters, I hope we see Tekken, Soul Calibur and older favorites like Power Stone, Rival Schools, Star Gladiator and Bloody Roar.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2011"}

Zulli \"Tazz\"","summary":"Not perfect","reviewText":"I am the kind of fan that buys this game every year no matter how different it is from the previous year. But what drew me to this year's game the most was its tribute to the famous attitude era that played a huge part in the industry from 96-01 (from Austin winning the 96 KOTR to the demise of WCW). In it we get dozens of wrestlers from the attitute era (from The Rock and Stone to Billy Gunn). We event get a mod,e that replaces Road To Wrestlemania mode/storymode, that lets us reinanct the great matches from that era. Of course we still get most of the current roster. Although despite the game's large roster (over 100) we get duplicates. Meaning certain wrestlers take up multiple spots (three HHHs, three Foleys, 2 Cenas, 2 rocks, etc) so some wrestlers missed the cut especially popular guys like Tyson Kidd and William Regal. However a good ammount of guys excluded are included in DLC and for once all of the dlc wrestlers are ones fans were hoping were going to be in.One of the big issues last year was online. Most of the time, players cried in anger as they werent able to download created content or even play online. Fans were hoping this year would be different. For the most part it is. We can easily download created content with no problem. But online plays has a tendency to freeze or just no work. Sometimes you will win a grueling match and despite it being a rated match you wont get the win. Now these issues dont happen all the time so it shouldnt take too much fun out of it.Universe 3.0 is vastly better then past years. In the mode that allows you to create your own wwe world, this year the included the ability to make more shows on any day of the week (mon-sat) and even delete/edit current shows to your pleasing which is something fans have been wanting for a while. Now Universe mode still has its problems but its still a fun expereince. One big feature have been begging to return is create a belt which allowed players to create their own championship. The good news is it returns however ownly as edit a belt. Meaning we can edit an existing championship belt by changing its color, name and call name. Its still cool as we can assign it as a belt for your original show. Now what is always expected in any game, there are bugs and glitches. Stuff that even defies the laws of physics. I wont get into details but if you played past games, its the same.Overall this is a great game. Its far from perfect but being able to make dream matches featuring stars from today and the attitude era makes this the perfect game for current and old school wrestling fansPros:-Attitude era mode and wrestlers-Huge improvement to create an arena-DLC we actually want-Being able to make a third brand in Universe-Ability to make dream matches-Create a belt is back....sort ofCons:-Online is still annoying at times-Duplicate wrestlers-Exclussion of popular wrestlers (Regal, Kidd, etc)-Bugs-Create a belt isnt what we expected","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"This Game Takes Place a Really, Really Long Time Ago.","reviewText":"I grew up on the original Star Wars movies.  I've been a fan of the universe that Lucas built for most of my life.  However, when I first heard about KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC, I was hesitant about playing it.  I like the original universe that Lucas created and the world of KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC seemed a bit unnecessary to me.  I mean, the original movies and books made Lucas a fortune and I just couldn't understand why well enough couldn't be left alone.  Granted the age of the Old Republic is the perfect place to spawn new Star Wars tales without damaging the content or history of the classic series.  My curiosity about the game became further piqued when the game won several video game awards.  I eventually gave in and played the game and I'm glad that I did.Like many other Star War games, in KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC you create a character that seems to be tapped into the Force.  You're able to use a lightsaber (or better yet, a double-bladed lightsaber when you find them), become trained in the Force, and eventually gain many different Force powers.  There are other skills that can be acquired throughout the game and during your quest, you can be joined by several different characters that you can choose to play as throughout the game, including a Han Solo-kind-of-guy named Carth and a droid that reminds one C-3PO if he was more masculine and was an assassin instead of a protocol droid.The gameplay of KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC isn't really anything spectacular and the graphics are just a tad better than standard.  What separates the game from other similar games is the storyline.  KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC boasts an original story that makes a player want to continue playing just to see how the story will end.  Throughout the game your actions determine the nature of your character and ultimately there are four different ways the game can end.  I played the game so that I could see the four different endings.The game isn't as open-ended as the marketers have made it out to be.  Everyone who plays the game gets the general same experience, the major differences being in if characters join your group and how they behave.  The overall scenario is virtually the same with little variation.  Also, as noted before the graphics aren't that great--you would think that with an original Star Wars game, the creators would be able to come up with something more impressive.Overall, KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC is a great video game.  Star War fans are sure to enjoy it (if they are willing to put aside their initial reluctance), but people who aren't fans will enjoy playing the game as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2006"}

And the supposed marks are the ones pulling the strings. Would a made man allow this to happen?THREADBARE UNDERSHIRTS UNDER FLASHY SILK SUITSThe first thing that grabs you is how dull the graphics look once the (well-done) cinematics end. On top of that, it is not that the environments are badly designed, it is that the same patterns are used over and over resulting in...chain deja-vue episodes. This cookie-cutter approach could had made it easier to get lost - unfortunately, there is not even a chance for that.FOLLOW THE SCRIPT OR ELSE, CAPICE?If you enjoyed the freedom experienced in the GTA series, well, do not expect anything close to that degree of sandbox roaming. This a linear game only set on an open-looking background. Which, once more, shows that looks were considered more important than substance. And if you make a mistake and have to reload, be prepared to replay quite a long sequence because this is yet another game with only an autosaving option - and, once more, 2K behaves as if autosaving points are charged by the unit.JUST KEEP MAKING THE ROUNDS PAISANO!The next disappointment is how repetitive the gameplay itself is. \"Great fighting mechanics\" means all of two options: hitting or backstepping. Whereas, \"realistic driving\" means that your cars handle like boats - and you will still get killed once those 1940's-Detroit death-traps hit a wall or a tree. Realistic? Sure. But fun? Veramente not! All the mini-games and the money-worries are simply too trivial and half-baked to save the day. Fight-by-numbers made it to the big leagues...NICE SHADES MAN, BUT CAN YOU SEE THROUGH THEM?As if all of the above were not enough, the camera placement was so bad it reminded me of the notorious NEVERWINTER NIGHTS days. And sometimes, this turns more into a spectacle than a game.VITO! CLOSE THOSE SHUTTERS NOW!I always had a problem with censorship boards (from totalitarian censorship bureaus to Nielsen ratings) but, at the same time, I do respect the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit. Well, MAFIA II will manage to enrage both sides of the generation gap. If the slow-news days keep up, expect some \"outraged\" news-reports on the content of this game before school begins. True, there are numerous instances in which this game justifies its MATURE (17+) rating - but this hardly makes it an adult game. Like a Dutch school painting of children looking like smaller adults, MAFIA II offers the juvenile version of a grownup world. I very much doubt that any teenager (which obviously is the target demographic for this game) will be impressed.And for all this ...fun, we still have to activate the game and tie to permanently to a STEAM account. This is clearly not one of those game you would want to keep, so shouldn't you be able to resell it? Well, 2K GAMES thinks not. You can now make your decision accordingly.My advice: pass on this infamnia and, instead, get your Mafia fix from a good oldGodfather Trilogyweekend.This game is so bad it almost enters cult territory.But it is also boring so it fails to even do that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2010"}

It's still pretty good value at the normal price.I've been a PS3 owner ever since the 60GB Classic became available in 2007 and I've been impressed with the PS3's reliability, versatility and its sheer power - I've owned both Classic and Slim models, upgraded most, gave away a couple. In the end one's choice for a gaming console is a matter of personal taste and preference but the PS3 is by far the more popular 'gaming' or 'entertainment' implement in our household. And we do own an Xbox.I am buying this one (on the waiting list and hoping to get lucky) as a Christmas gift for a kid whose old PS3 classic seems to be about to give up and I know will enjoy playing inFAMOUS and the Uncharted.Here's a quick FAQ I put together on the new super-slim model.___________________________________________THE FAQ:Q: Why should I buy a PS3 at all? What's it good for?A: With a PS3 you can play disc-based or downloaded games and this includes no-fee support for multiplayer, play Blu-ray, DVD movies or stream, rent or download movies or your own videos, play CDs or upload and play your own music, upload and display your photos, listen to Internet radio stations, access an ever-increasing number of Internet services such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Music Unlimited, browse the Web, play content off DLNA-compatible computers, laptops, media servers or network-attached storage (NAS) or allow your computers to play content stored on your PS3, integrate with your PSP or Vita portable consoles.Q: In what ways is the new PS3 different from the current models?A: The new model (Super Slim) is smaller, lighter, more quiet, more power efficient, has a larger HDD and has discs top-loaded vs. front-loaded on the Slim.Q: Can I get the console without the games and pay less?A: No. This is probably the best PS3 deal you are likely to get this year, with or without games.Q: Should I buy this bundle or should I wait for more choices or a price drop?A: Wait if you feel like gambling but even if a better deal pops up between now and Christmas it's not likely to be a lot better.Q: Isn't Sony expected to announce the PS4 soon?A: It is likely that Sony's next generation console will be launched in 2013. Sony recently committed to support the PS3 at least through 2015.Q: If I already have a PS3 is this model worth the upgrade?A: See the answer to the first question. The new model has an additional 90GB of HDD storage when compared to the 160GB Slim.Q: I am planning to buy my first Sony console? Should I buy the Slim, the Super Slim (this bundle) or wait for the PS4?A: This bundle has a lot of value. We bought our first PS3 in 2007 and we paid a lot for it. The reward was us enjoying it for the 2 years between the time of our purchase and Sony announcing some less expensive models. In our case it was well worth it. I would expect the PS3 to remain a viable gaming platform and home entertainment center for at least two more years.Q: I owned an older model. Is the new model compatible with all my existing peripherals: controllers, Move, Eye camera, keyboard, charger?A: Yes.Q: Does this model come with HDMI, USB cables?A: There is a USB cable in the box but you will have to supply your own HDMI if you need one.Q: Once I buy this bundle, what else will I need to have a fully functional console?A: You should buy an HDMI cable if you are going to connect your PS3 to an HD TV. You may also want a second controller. A Move bundle (controllers, camera) is highly optional. A charger should be okay but it's not needed because controllers charge through the PS3's USB ports.Q: If I buy the 250GB model can I upgrade later to a larger size?A: Yes, Sony will allow you to replace the existing HDD with a compatible 2.5\" SATA drive without voiding the warranty. There are dozens of step-by-step guides on YouTube.Q: Will I have to pay Sony if I wanted to play co-op or multiplayer games?A: No. The basic PSN access is free. There is the Playstation Plus option that adds some perks such as free trial games, betas and demos and some discounts on downloaded titles but `non-essential' is the key word. I never felt I needed to pay for that service.Q: Is there a complete list of services currently on the PS3?A: This is what is available at the time I'm writing this: NFL Sunday Ticket, Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, Vudu HD Movies, Crunchyroll (anime), NHL Gamecenter Live, MLB.tv, XOS College Sports, CinemaNow, Laugh Factory Live (beta), Music Unlimited.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"David Smith","summary":"just another RPG... yawn","reviewText":"how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2006"}

THE BEST COVER BASED SHOOTER, DESTRUCTIBLE COVER,INTENSE ACTION SHOOTER, PLUS STEALTH, SNEEKING, AND STRATEGY. LOTS OF VARIETY.+Great Strategy via Synch Shooting: marking up to four unaware targets and synch-shooting.  Aim at the target four, ensure all four chevrons are blue (ready state), then you fire, the other guys will fire at their target. Select and deselect targets with your right bumper. If you fire before all chevrons are blue, just hold the right bumper down for a half second ordering your teammates to fire.OR you can select up to three unaware targets and your teammates will fire (synch shot) when you give the order (by holding down the Right Bumper).When marking targets, if you have your gun pointed at one of the marked targets, your teammates will assume you will shoot that target.  If you mark a target and point your rifle somewhere else, one of your team mates will shoot that target.+You can select a one or more targets for your teammates to focus on during combat (you'll need this to survive and to beat some missions).+Great sneak and stealth game, stealth kills and stealth shots.  You ghost camo becomes active after a second or two when you're crouched or on your belly.+THE VERY BEST COVER BASED SHOOTER, lean over cover or to the side of cover and peak/shoot.+THE VERY BEST POSITION SWAPPING MECHANICS AND ABILITIES: (much better than Gears of War series, Mass Effect 3, Deus Ex and FEAR 3). This game makes the best use of the idea: traveling from one cover position to another position. Just point or look at a position, a blue circle with a down pointed arrow appears, just hold the A button to go to that position (no need to keep the left stick pointed), or just release the A button in you want to stop before you reach your destination. You can swap cover for short or for very long sprints to other locations.  Use both the left and right stick together to use this feature to the fullest.  You to hop over cover to a new cover position.  You can also just sprint directly out of cover if there isn't a blur circle to cover swap. Just look/point the left stick where you want to go and hold down the A button.Also when in the prone position, you can do roll overs by tapping the left stick either right or left.+THE VERY BEST SHOOTER FOR DESTRUCTIBLE COVER AND ENVIRONMENT OBJECTS. When taking cover, it is awesome how the cover disintegrates and it is taking bullets.  You can shoot through cars, car windows, benches and other environmental objects/cover positions (cars, wooded walls, ect.) to kill enemies or make cars/vehicles explode. It may takes several rounds to do it, but you can do it, but not everything (thick concrete walls and some sandbags are impervious). The graphics are great for the destruction of objects.  The way the windshields and car windows breaks are awesome.  You can shoot out car tires and shoot through cars, benches, some walls, ect. The stronger object, the more bullets it will take to destroy the object and kill the enemy behind it.+Great intense epic battles (especially after the first 3 or 4 chapters).  You usually can approach the battle at first taking the stealth approach (but you don't have to) and then all hell breaks loose with several epic battles during most chapters.  You'll have battles where you are  surrounded on three sides by soldiers and tank surviving until air support arrives, for example. Or, you're on a cargo vessel, and you you have enemies on ground level, enemies surrounding you on three sides who are up on the next level shooting down on you, and more enemies dropping down to ground level.+Mission Challenges and Objectives: Every chapter seems to have 4 or more levels/parts.  Some are more stealthy where you must accomplish the objective without raising an alert (it's okay if you're detected for a second or two as long as you kill the guy before he alerts others), or other level missions where you must not be detected at all.  There are also challenges that the game will give you, for example, kill twelve enemies with a SMG without reloading, kill 15 enemies in a row with the sniper rife without missing, reach the objective without killing a guard, ect, ect.  Every level will have new challenges.  Accomplishing these challenges will unlock more weapons. The challenges are optional.+Great high tech equipment.  You'll get your Ghost Camo at the start of the second chapter. It's activated when crouching or when on your belly. You're sensor grenade is perhaps your most valuable gadget.  You have X-ray/metallic view and night vision goggles (you only get one or the other depending on the mission), sensor grenades, EMP grenades, drones (available in most, but not all, of the missions), a walking mortar and missile launching vehicle (used only in one chapter), in addition to the frag and incendiary grenades.+Customizible firearms.  You get a plethora of weapons to choose from and you get to customize each part of the rifle/gun and the paint job.  You scroll through the weapons with the left stick, select the desired weapon with the A button, select the desired part of the gun, customize each part by selecting among for options using the left stick, or by using the D-pad for power, control, maneuverability, or range. Some weapons have incendiary rounds, different weapons have different options. And you can do that for every part of the rifle and gun you choose.  You carry one primary weapon and a secondary weapon. There are several different sites you get to choose from on the firearms, from iron sites to different scopes. Some scopes offer magnification, some others offer a laser red dot, others have x-ray and thermal capabilities, heartbeat sensors, zeroing in/homing targeting, ect. The muzzle usually has muzzle capabilities, muzzle flash and sound, or just flash, just sound, power or control.  You get to carry two types of grenades of your choice.  If the mission allows you, you will also get to use a drone.  And on one mission, you get the walking mortar and missile launcher.+Some mission levels have a five minute time limit, but don't panic. You must still use your head and use strategy to win.  You must reach the objective in 5 minutes or less to prevent enemies from escaping, missiles to be launched, ect.+You'll be completely alone on one mission.  You must do everything yourself without teammates.+Great campaign. Long and fun chapters.  Epic battles in a variety of environment.  Every chapter will take you to different environments, some indoors, some in villages, some out in snowy terrain, car filled city streets, forests, on a cargo ship, up in buildings for sniping.  A wide variety of combat.+Great environmental graphics: dust storms, rain, snow, fire, shooting through obstacles, the ability to use the Sensor Grenade to locate enemies, the ability to use x-ray/magnetic view, night vision goggles, using the various scopes.  Yes, if you just take a screen shot, it isn't the most impressive game graphically from just a screenshot.  But when you factor in the gameplay/action graphics (for lack of a better term) it is a really good game graphically.  Unsilenced weapons are more powerful and do more damage to shielded targets.+Healing. You will get shot and incompacitated during the game.  You can crawl but that's it. You're AI teamates are good to heal you before you die.  You will also need to heal you wounded teammates as well.ONLINE PLAY IS FUN. Only the scout class has ghost camo.The RAVEN STRIKE DLC is length, challenging and awesome.  It has some of the most challenging stealth and battles in the game.+++AWESOME CAMPAIGN+++AWESOME VARIETY IN MISSIONS, LOCATIONS, OBJECTIVES AND HOW THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN EDITION TO THE MOST EPIC BATTLES AND STRATEGY OUT THERE.+++YOU CAN'T DIRECT YOUR TEAMMATES TO GO HERE OR THERE, BUT YOU CAN TELL THEM TO FOCUS ON THIS TARGET OR TARGETS AND THEY WILL DO THE REST. YOUR TEAMMATE ARE EXCELLENT AT WHAT THEY DO, USE THEM.+++EMP GRENADE EFFECTS. SOME OF THE ENEMIES YOU ENCOUNTER WILL HAVE EMP GRENADES THEMSELVES.  IF YOU HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY AN EMP GRENADE, YOU WILL HAVE 'EMP' WITH AN UP AND DOWN ARROW CLOSE TO YOUR TRIGGER AND YOU'R GHOST CAMO WILL NOT WORK AND YOUR RETICULE AND AIMING SITE WILL NOT WORK FOR A COUPLE MINUTES (the aiming will work if you have iron sites installed on your firearms since they aren't electronic/high tech).+++GUERRILLA MODE IS A GREAT EDITION.  There are several maps and 50 levels per map.  You first take over the site and then defend it for 50 levels/waves of enemies.  You can play alone, or co-op.GAMEPLAY NOTES:*SENSOR GRENADE: use the right stick to aim, tap the left bumper to throw, OR HOLD DOWN THE LEFT BUMPER to see the range that the sensor grenade will cover, adjust your throw with the right stick, and release the RB to throw. Select a different grenade, drone to cancel the throw.  Enemies are always oblivious to your throwing of the sensor grenade.*SENSOR GRENADES have no effect when fighting the Russian Spec Ops, because they are using ghost camo too.*Shooting range: when finished customizing your weapon, you can test it on the shooting range (pressing the X button).  There are different targets at different ranges in front of you, in back of you and to your left and right which you most likely be oblivious to.  When the game takes you to the shooting range, you'll face the target in front of you and be totally oblivious to the targets to your left, right and rear if you don't look around.*You can't pick up dead bodies. and dump them some place out of site or dump them some place to ambush other enemies.  Some levels require no detection or alerts.  If you stealth kill an enemy, it would be nice to pick the body up and dump it completely out of site.*Not able to shoot out the lights (at least when I deliberately tried). I tried to shoot out the lights during the one stealth mission where I was all alone, a la Splinter Cell Conviction style, and the game didn't allow it.*You foot steps will make noise when walking and crouching.  The faster you walk the louder your footsteps.  You enemies seem not to hear your footsteps when sneaking up on them.  I've walked while crouched and walked full speed sneaking up on enemies for a stealth kill, with all the footstep noise, and the enemy doesn't hear it.  Maybe the game only intended for me to hear my footsteps.Summary: I played this game all the way through back when it first came out several months ago. I loved how you could shoot through obstacles or be shot through obstacles.  I didn't think it was the greatest game in the world or the most fun.  I've recently re-played the game twice (once on veteran and once on elite) all the way through and think its great.  It's perhaps the best shooter game out there--It's far more than just a shooter.  Great entertaining story, videos, cut scenes, epic battles.  You will need you're teammates to focus on targets to help keep you from dying when you're overwhelmed or when you need to keep that chopper from escaping.I enjoyed this game far more than DISHONORED.  If DISHONORED gets an 8.75 as it's lowest rating and  a 10 and a 9 rating, this game should get a 15 rating on a scale from 1 to 10.  DISHONORED is pretty good, but only pretty good at best.  Ghost Recon is much more fun than Dishonored, Skyrim, Killzone 2, Killzone 3, DEUS EX, Batman: Arkham City and many other \"great\" games.  You need to play the game all the way through to get everything out of it because there is so much variety.  You can play half of the game and think that you've experience everything the game has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Crackdown + Mutant powers = PROTOTYPE","reviewText":"I don't understand all these really high reviews. This game was okay, at best. While the action and gameplay can be fun, at first (especially once you upgrade all your Movement abilities), the game falls flat because of many reasons.One, the missions are terrible and usually just involve killing things over and over, which even for a 'killing things' game, is uninspired. Two, the game graphics are ugly and bland, as if everything is faded of color. Seriously, i's supposed to be Manhattan and there's not a single recognizable thing. Not to mention how few character/pedestrian models there are (guy in a \"Bets\" jersey, guy in a suit, scientist in a lab coat, skinny blonde girl, skinny hispanic girl, middle-aged blonde lady, jewish girl in a dress, hispanic redhead in heels, chubby Asian girl, guy in a hoody, and four different soldiers. That's pretty much it. What's that, fourteen?) And Three, it gets pretty boring after a while. Mostly, because the missions are all lame, generic, and unoriginal, and the side-quests are all terrible and frustrating. At least, if you actually care abou getting Gold in them, which can be hard to do since many elements, like enemy groups, are set up randomally.Also, the game is very similar to \"Crackdown\", which was atrociously bad. Only, instead of using terrible firearms and climbing buildings, you use mediocre mutant powers and run up buildings. But everything from the clunky vehicle control, to the awful weapons system, to the HORRIBLE targeting system which only seems to target the enemies you desire to hit the least, to the stupid Orbs on a Rooftop collecting, the game is the same thing as Crackdown. I wouldn't be surprised if the same exact people who made Crackdown made this game. At least PROTOYPE's gameplay is actually fun, even if the grade-school-game-design is exactly the same.The disguise system, at least, is original and it can be quite fun to play Superhero (or Supervillain) as a teenage girl in a skirt, blonde businesslady or anyone else. I just kind of wish they let you do more things as other people, including the way you walk, react to the enviroment, etc. As of now, the only use it has other than escaping your enemies is the story-related memory absorbtions and being able to access special military items in certain disguises. By far, the gameplay, which includes Experience collecting and upgrading, and the Disguising yourself are the two best (and arguably, only) fun things about PROTOTYPE.Overall, it's worth a rental if you're the type of person who just wants to kill things in video games and doesn't care about anything much deeper than that. Otherwise, you might just be playing it just to get through it so you never have to play it again. Yeah, like Assassins Creed, Crackdown, and all the recent Sonic games, this is one of those \"chore\" games. But it can, at least, be forgiven since it's a first release. Now if the sequel ends up having the same problems in it...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Science-Fantasy, Mixed with a twist","reviewText":"If you're already familiar with Japanese Role-Playing Games (JRPGs), then the mechanics of Star Ocean: First Departure should be very familiar to you.  The game even borrows well-worn story cliches, like the boat that can't take you to the next leg until you deal with the menace blocking the waters.  Where it differs however is in the variety of environments:  it is a science fiction game wrapped in a fantasy setting.Star Ocean: First Departure begins with the premise that a non-spacefaring world has been hit with a plague.  It turns out that the plague was deliberately dropped on the world by a space-travelling culture and now the good guys are working with another group of space-travellers to set things right.  The plot expands to include destruction of planets, interstellar war, and more--but you still spend time in a fantasy-like primitive setting too.Like previous games, we have random encounters, wandering in world maps, encounter areas (castles, caves, spaceships), and \"safe\" areas such as villages.  Unlike previous games, we have a complicated skill system that requires you to purchase skill sets (which have levels), that contain skills (that can be leveled), that you can only add to a character by collecting skill points (at each experience level).  It gets a bit more confusing when you add an MMO-style ability to collect ingredients and (with the right skills) compile them into food or items that offer bonuses or healing.  Also different is the combat: it's action oriented, but you get the feeling that there are dice rolls behind how well things go for you: some of the skills you can gain say that they operate \"randomly\".  Changing tactics in the heat of battle feels turn-based, but the action itself is still real-time.  Special techniques can be mapped to the PSP's shoulder buttons, and timing these button presses is important to the technique's success.The combination of sci-fi and fantasy more resembles a Star Trek episode than Star Wars style action:  you have high-tech space travelers dealing with a low-tech pre-space planet, and muttering about their own version of \"The Prime Directive\" when they talk about how much they really ought to be getting involved.  And that's part of the problem:  for an action-oriented RPG, there's a lot of planning and a lot of talking.  If there's one flaw with Star Ocean, it's that at times the game can get too dialogue-heavy:  you have game events that drop into the middle of the action, talking sequences transitioning you from one place to another, conversation events at entry & exit points as mentioned above, plus animated sequences, cutscenes, and moments that yank your hands off the controls and either freeze you in place or take over the movement of your party, making you wait on the accompanying dialogue.  It can be very jarring, and at times it can make you feel like you've spent two minutes hammering 'X' to beat up some bad guys, only to then spend half an hour just reading and pressing 'X' to continue.If you really love the JRPG genre, you like character depth and story, and you're willing to grind levels in a light arcade-style way, First Departure is a breath of semi-fresh air.  Meticulous leveling and skill-picking will reward you.  If you're new to the genre, this might test your patience, especially when it comes making decisions about your party's future and to the jerky, fast-slow pacing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2010"}

I think it's the best system on the market, and at the time of this review it's been amassing quite a strong library of games.Nintendo Land is, if anything, a reason that the Wii U got off to a slow start if this is the game people have been recommending to their friends and seeing as a pack-in game showing off the supposed features of the system.There's very little fun to be had as a single player experience due to the horrendously annoying controls often involving rotating and physically moving the gamepad around. As a multiplayer experience, you're far better off with Sonic Racing or Wii Party U at this point. I realize that this game was a very early release, but it doesn't make it any more fun. If my friends had seen this game as representing the system at a party last year, I guarantee none of them would be running out to buy a Wii U!As for positives, at this point it's cheap and it's probably going to be slightly more fun for a little kid who isn't going to be quite as bored drawing lines to lead Yoshi to fruit.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Lars Kingbeard","summary":"++VISIONARY++","reviewText":"If you have ever wondered what hell might look like, Dante's Inferno offers an incredibly vivid and detailed hypothesis. The game is based on the 14th-century Italian poem by Dante Alligheri, but Dante never could have imagined a hell this visually captivating. The walls themselves crawl with the bodies of the damned, other lost souls intermitently rain from the sky burning in torturous flames. In the distance, great columns of souls can be seen marching along monolithic causeways. The air is acrid with smoke and charred flesh, pierced by screams, fitful sparks and motes of ash. Each of the nine circles is here, along with the river Acheron and Limbo, and each setting is distinctive and fiendishly impressive. Through it all Vergil is your guide, just as in the poem, explicating the diabolic machinations of hell's machinery with insuperable aplomb.The gameplay is fluid and satisfying, with Dante boasting an array of combos with either his scythe, stolen from Death himself, or his cross. There are a variety of trinkets to collect - from the 30 pieces of silver received in ramsom by Judas to dozens of relics that Dante can equip to enhance his abilities. You can choose either to redeem or punish vanquished foes, and this will determine whether your scythe or your cross is fortified. The numerous boss fights show off the game's impressive scale to excellent effect.I had very high hopes for this title, but it has far exceeded even those.

I would purchase upgrades for everyone, because my tactic is to complete each level using all the characters.  After all members completed that same level, I'd move on.  So, purchasing upgrades for everyone made it easier for me to advance as the next character.The game did get a little overwhelming, especially the levels where you had multiple enemies to fight, but the game is just awesome anyway.So, should you buy it.

There's been much ado about the fact that Nintendo was so involved with the development of this title, in an apparent departure from its supposed \"kiddie\" mentality. The hands-on work was done by Silicon Knights (Blood Omen on the PSX).  Was the game worth the wait?It's hard to classify Eternal Darkness into any single genre, which ends up being the game's biggest flaw.  ED doesn't have the dread factor of pure horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill, simply because the enemies in the game are dispatched rather easily.  The much-lauded insanity effects are certainly entertaining, but they are very obvious for the most part when they occur, which really detracts from the sense of involvement so vital to games of this type.  All things considered, ED has to be classified as an adventure game, despite Silicon Knights' and Nintendo's intention that it be a horror title.With that in mind, ED's strengths are major:  the audio and the story.  The game uses Dolby 5.1 to genius effect, with wonderful sound effects and a brilliant score (which changes to period-specific styles, fitting the timeline-driven story perfectly).  The voice-acting is among the best ever recorded, and supports one of the best plots ever conceived in a game.  These two things alone propel ED to the top of this year's releases, for all systems.However, the gameplay itself isn't quite up to the quality of the audio.  Trying to target enemies in confined spaces can be frustrating, and the frequent graphical clipping doesn't help.  There is also no moveable in-game camera, which would have been very helpful.  Some of the puzzles are also needlessly vague.  On the other hand, the magick system is superbly implemented.  The sanity meter is a nice addition, but the PS2 RPG Shadow Hearts' Sanity Points system affects the gameplay much more directly.  Most of the signs of insanity in Eternal Darkness are window dressing (albeit cool window dressing!), but little more.  If ED's insanity effects had been more subtle and more creative, they would have been much more involving.ED is a technical masterpiece that controls perfectly and sounds fantastic.  Its graphics show its N64 roots, with the aforementioned clipping and blocky character models, but are still super-cool to look at.  However, it seems that ED suffers from over-development, and Silicon Knights probably had too much time and too much input from Nintendo during the long development cycle.  It appears that somewhere along the line, SK lost focus.  As a result, ED is stuck somewhere between Resident Evil and Soul Reaver, unsure of its own identity.  Is it a horror game?  Kinda.  An action game?  Sorta.  Is it an adventure game with fast-paced combat, RE-style puzzles and backtracking, a Lovecraft-inspired storyline, and a few horror-based gameplay elements?  Yeah, that's about it.  See what I'm getting at?  Innovation is certainly welcome, but loses power when the game itself feels spread too thin.  Perhaps the developers suffered from their own loss of sanity...?  Despite this, Eternal Darkness is one of the strongest entries on the Gamecube, and is a powerful statement that the console is not just for kids.Fans of survival horror games should be warned that ED might not live up to their expectations, but anyone wanting a mature-themed, well-written, masterfully produced and involving adventure should take note:  The Darkness Has Come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2002"}

I just saw it and thought I would try it. Years later I decided I have to buy it. I kept thinking to myself, did I really play a game that simulates a game over screen?I've been building up my collection of GameCube games this past year and I started with games that I remember playing and thought they were fun. I also looked at the top 25 GameCube games list that IGN created after the GameCube was discontinued. This game was #5 on the list and for good reason. To even make the top 25 was a real treat for a game, considering the GameCube had over 550 games in the US.This game is very different from traditionally games. It's been called a cult classic along with games like Cubivore (also GameCube) and Deadly Premonition (Xbox 360). Each of these games including Eternal Darkness, have gameplay and a story that is both unique and never really tried before. While they all contain some flaws, you find yourself thinking about it more and more between sessions. It's getting where software companies are not really taking many chances on un-proven games and concepts. That is why you are seeing so many sequels, like Resident Evil, Zelda, Metroid, Metal Gear, Halo, Final Fantasy and countless others. It's nice to see a unique game.A little history behind the game. It was originally planned for the Nintendo 64 but was delayed. It was also the first game pulished by Nintendo to have an M (Mature) rating. Though it was not a commercial success, it was widely praised and even won an award for Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development.The gameplay is unique in that you get to control 12 characters throughout the story (and throughout time). Each character is unique and have their own missions to accomplish. The story moves throughout time from 26 BC to 2000 AD. The greatest accomplishment of this game was the use of the sanity meter. If something like this were to be true and you found yourself in this situation, just imagine your own sanity level. The meter provides some very interesting things that happen as the meter gets higher and higher.Bottom line, if you are interested in collecting GameCube games or want a different type of horror game to play on the GameCube or Wii, try this game out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2011"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization.

The load times are drastically reduced to nothing.  If you have played it on Super Nintendo recently, you know how crazy slow the load-times were.  I care less about added features (I like them, but I am more of a purist and just love the original game...I don't need extras), and more about the technical aspects.The top and bottom screens of the DS work seamlessly together to give you an awesome game-playing experience.  It's easier to pull up maps, switch around characters, get to equipment, and in general - know what the heck is going on around you.  It's hard to believe that the gaming experience could be better on this little system, but it is.If you were a fan of the original or love RPGs, then you need to have this game.

COD 3 is an incredibly immersive game and everything from its impressive graphics, (ignoring the awful smoke grenade effects) to it's incredible sound effects and its cinematic story telling approach, places you squarely in the heart of battle.  Any concerns about how this game would control on the Wii can be laid to rest.  Call of Duty 3 plays amazingly well on the Wii-to a point.  (More on that later)For most newbies however, it's still going to take a moment or two to get used to the idiosyncrasies of the Wii-mote.  Instead of controlling a second analog stick to move the camera, COD 3 (and every other fps on Wii for that matter) has you simply turning your Wii-mote left or right. Once the initial learning curve of this movement has passed-control feels completely natural and intuitive as if it was the way it was always meant to be.  This works so well after a while that in other games (like Zelda) you will miss the ability to do this.Where Call of Duty 3 fails however is in it's attempt to take advantage of the unique capabilities of the Wii.  Certain actions such as setting charges and such, become entirely too gimmicky and are a nightmare to control.  Initially I could set a charge by sliding the on-screen pin into the charge with my nunchuck, then turn the nunchuck around in a circle to tighten into place.  But then, when I needed to pull back from the charge, the game refused to recognize the action I was performing with the nunchuck.  This happened every single time.  There were certain moments where I literally sat there for five minutes (swearing heavily) trying to finish up the action, swinging the nunchuck about in every possible direction and at every possible angle with no luck.  The game simply refused to recognize my movements.Another gripe I had with the COD 3 also pertains to poor recognition.  During battle, it is not uncommon for German soldiers to toss a grenade or two your way.  COD 3 gives you the option of picking up the grenades and tossing them back.  It's great when it works, but 90% of the time when you \"toss\" your grenade by flicking the nunchuck it doesn't recognize the movement even after you've done it repeatedly, therefore the grenade blows up in your hand-killing you instantly.  I don't know how many times I died because the game simply wouldn't recognize that I had thrown the grenade.  Granted there are options to set grenade throws to button presses only, but the layout of the buttons is clunky at best and would render the grenade tossing entirely too cumbersome in the heat of battle anyway.All in all, despite its flaws, I still found COD 3 to be a very enjoyable game and played it all the way to the end.  I would even re-play it given the chance.  If you're a fan of the Call of Duty series, or any first person shooter for that matter-you'll enjoy this game.  Despite the occasional aggravation of faulty controls, COD 3 has still become my favorite in the series.  Here's hoping they'll do a better job with the controls in the next installment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2006"}

It's the type of game that begs for wandering around aimlessly, fighting zombies, playing with weapons, and discovering new areas. The biggest problem I had with the new one is that it did the same thing... put a time limit on you.I don't mind being forced to do missions, but a lot of times, the time limit requires that you sit around waiting for the new part to open up so you can do the timed mission and not allowing you enough time to go somewhere else and run a side mission. So, I didn't like that feeling of being trapped behind a time. I was under the impression when I preordered the game that the timelimit would be taken out.The first one was fun because it was over the top ridiculous and just plain fun. This game takes the story a little more seriously, introduced a little child that is just plain annoying, and doesn't give you proper time to explore in order to try out making new weapons. Also, some spots are just too difficult. I have been playing coop with a friend and we are stuck at a part with two sword weilding tv girls who just don't take enough damage from any weapon we've used thus far, run faster than us, and just murder us in no time flat. It's frustrating because we have to respawn and make our way back there every time. I ended up shelving the game and planning to go back again at SOME point in the future.The game is still fun. However, it's kind of like GTA games where the most fun is had by moving around and causing damage, murder, and mayhem! Minus the time limit and little girl who needs her medicine (not a spoiler, you learn about it in the beginning, or in Case Zero if you buy that), this game has potential. IF there's a 3rd, it needs to go back to being corny and ridiculous.I recommend buying it at $30. That seems like a fair price from what you get.PS - Amazon gave preorders a special clothing code as a bonus. Capcom took forever to make that code available, so we got a sweet 1/2 off coupon for Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 as well as an extra $10 off gaming coupon. That made me love Amazon, but Capcom definately seemed to take their time thanks to an underwhelming reception of the game. True or not, that's how it felt.

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY, KERRIGAN?","reviewText":"One can only respect BLIZZARD for not setting a release date before they knew they could meet it. No matter that this was the most awaited game for over a decade, they would release it \"whenever it would be ready\". Well, it is ready, it is here and it rocks. Too bad they kicked the respect bucket in the end. But first things first.THE GOOD OLD GAMEPLAY GETS THE CIGARSeasoned and new gamers alike will appreciate the simple yet highly enjoyable gameplay. The factions are well balanced and the units perfectly valued. You gather minerals and vespene gas, you build your defenses, you upgrade, you expand, you gather your forces - and you unleash hell. Repeat as needed until satisfied.STARCRAFT: THE QUICKENINGThe game is much faster than the original. Resource gathering, building, researching and expanding all go faster now. This is something that will appeal to most and I for one liked it. It conveys an enjoyable sense of urgency, adding to the immersion. And because the game is richer and deeper, the tension just keeps mounting.SWARMS!The game designers either enjoyed STARSHIP TROOPERS one times too many or they are fond of killer bees documentaries. Either way, be prepared to have to deal with a lot of swarming enemies! The plains shall be soaked in Zerg blood leaving you with a thick metallic aftertaste of accomplishment.SPACE. SPACE IS BEAUTIFULVisually this game is GORGEOUS. It looks like C&C4; was supposed to (but failed miserably). The units are detailed in design yet clearly discernible whereas the environments are superbly done (although not that variable). True, I could do with somewhat more realistic graphics but I can see that this could only be done at the expense of clarity when the number of units rises. What needs a bit getting used to is how some of the buildings do not look that different. No complaints about how they look but one can easily confuse them and build the same building twice.COME FOR THE VESPENE GAS. STAY FOR THE STORYThe story picks up just where SC-BROODWAR left off. Following each mission nicely done videos move the single player story along (no spoilers, not to worry) that, although we are given the illusion of choosing between different paths, apparently they converge towards a predestined end.DAMN IT JIM, WHERE IS THE REST OF THE GAME?Why only 3 stars then? Well, in a nutshell: GREED.Apparently ACTIVISION's influence is not very healthy to customer relations. Together with BLIZZARD they are trying to turn the StarCraft franchise into yet another World of WarCraft phenomenon - and, at the same time, using STARCRAFT II as the vehicle, turn BattleNet into the new STEAM.  Unfortunately this results in a barely palatable product and using your fan-base to advance your corporate ambitions is always tacky.Although priced even more than a full premium game, this is not a complete STARCRAFT sequel. You would not know this by its price-tag(!) but this is only A...THIRD of the game, the first part of three: you can only play the Terran campaign. The Zerg and the Protoss campaigns will be released independently later (and priced as if they were full games, one could safely bet).To add insult to injury, one has to keep spending even more money if he wants any \"premium maps\" and \"premium content\" sold only via the BattleNet. Since this is a game that will be played mostly online don't be quick to dismiss this if you have a competitive streak.OK, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT - BUT THERE IS A HYDRALISK IN THE ROOM, ISN'T THERE?Much more serious is the NeverLettingGo-OnLineActivation requirement. The game will ask for activation during installation, which also includes signing up to BattleNet (and, yes, this means that even this expensive game never becomes yours to keep). But that is not all: a periodic OnLine confirmation is also required EVERY THIRTY DAYS, FOREVER. You can play offline but no more than a month between re-activating.Unlike the latest EA and UBISOFT flops (which have an idiotic Always-OnLine requirement), with SC2, after its initial Activation, you CAN play a single player game (campaign and skirmishes) without logging on to BattleNet. Only, to do this you have to log on as a ...\"Guest\" (I know, a Guest to your own game and your own computer...). You will be able to save your progress but you cannot tie it to your BattleNet account later, so any progress or accomplishments are lost for your online Account. After your 30 days are up you have to re-activate once more.That is why a Broadband Internet connection is included in the minimum system requirements. You can decide if this bothers you.SORRY TO BRING THIS UP BUT SPAWN SEEMS TO BE MISSING FROM MY COPY...Remember how we could take our original STARCRAFT CD to a gathering of friends, Spawn it on everyone else's PCs and start a LAN party? Now one can play with his friends only through the BattleNet - and the Spawn function has been eliminated! Yes, that means each one of your friends now has to have his own original copy of the game!The brass at the top conveniently forgets that the ability to Spawn games was the main reason both STARCRAFT and DIABLO acquired such huge fan-bases.Et tu, BLIZZARD?This is a good game, one I think we will be enjoying for years - or for as long as BLIZZARD shall allow us to do so. However, I had higher hopes for BLIZZARD's respect to its own customers.RECOMMENDED.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2010"}

But for games for the Nintendo Wii, they still are playable on the new system. But there are games that are still defiant and driven in the way that the original Wii was designed for. That is definitely the case with Mario Kart Wii. It really is one of those games that continued to expand on a racing franchise that has gotten better with time. The game series had definitely taken a new direction when it came out for the Nintendo DS before, and it delivered with online gameplay, and battling against others through the internet. Mario Kart Wii definitely expanded that, and it definitely has shown it for the Nintendo Wii that has made it definitively worth while.Mario Kart Wii for the Nintendo Wii, which is also playable on the Nintendo Wii U, where you will race your way through over 30 different races from Mario Kart past and present from the driven karts, as well as motorcycles, all trying to make your way to get the Mushroom Cup, Star Cup, and finish the top of the class. You can play with your favorites from Mario and Yoshi, to Bowser, and Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy and King Boo from Luigi's Mansion. The gameplay is definitely challenging, and definitely worth its while with great courses like the kooky Coconut Mall, the Bomb-omb kart filled, traffic blocked Moonlit Highway, and classic courses like Bowser Castle from Mario Kart 64, and Peach's Garden from Mario Kart DS. The gameplay is definitely fun, where you can play against others online through the net, internationally by the Wii Wi-Fi connection, which works seamlessly. The control for the game handles well from each of the courses, with the Wii-mote & Nunchuck controls, the Nintendo Gamecube controller (for original Nintendo Wii gamers only,) the Wii Classic Controller, and the Wii-mote with the steering wheel attachment, that originally came with Mario Kart Wii, but you can buy seperately.All in all, if you have just bought a Nintendo Wii U, and you would like some of the classic games for the Nintendo Wii library, this is definitely one definitive game to start. What has made Mario Kart Wii a great title, is the fun and outrageous excitement that you get, racing your way to Lakitu's checkered flag. I absolutely have loved this game from the beginning when it came out in 2008, and still gets my gears going for fun. If you are looking for controls with the Nintendo Wii U, only the Wii classic controller and the Wii-mote & nunchuck will do for this game, but it still is one game that is worth the money. Until, Nintendo comes out with one for the Wii U, this definitely will tide racers over in the meantime. I definitely recommend this game.Graphics: ASound: AControl: B- for Wii Steering Wheel, B+ for Wii-mote & Nunchuck, A- for Wii Classic Controller, A- for Gamecube ControllerFun & Enjoyment: A- for solo player; A for multiplayerOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2013"}

Nothing against any in particular but I have a few things to say regarding those reviews:Graphics and sound are exceptional... As mentioned there are times when I forget its a computer world... Look up at the stars and see constellations with clouds dancing in front of them and tell me that's not exceptional - I dare you!  Hearing footfalls, animals digging, bugs buzzing, and other environmental noises is marvelous.  Experience it and don't compare it to other things...Gameplay is wonderful... All you need is a sense of adventure and curiosity and you're good for years of gameplay in this world... The controls are very simple... Some have complained that they are hard to understand: ummmmm... point and click, press a few keys to move... What's the problem?  If you can't stand using two hands at once I have genuine pity for you...  The controls are easy and once you understand the layout of the game's interface it's a breeze: easily memorized...There are other aspects such as the storyline, the interaction of characters, and so forth that would be insane to try and summarize... The world was designed for you to be part of and explore: it's not perfect but neither is ours!  Get into the story, get into your character, and have fun!  Explore everything, don't be afraid to run, and try lots of new things!The game has so much to offer and at the price it is now for the Game of the Year edition why pass up a potentially limitless gameplaying experience???Performance is great... You should have a strong PC setup, however... I have all graphics settings cranked up with a resolution of 1024x768 and 32 bit colors but I'm running a 128mb AGP 8x card with 512mb DDRam... Make sure if you want solid performance in this game you have some good hardware (should comfortable exceed the game requirements)...The only conceivable point I have to say is the learning curve for someone unfamiliar with this game is huge: but I picked up it pretty quick when I first played it (I have played the other Elder Scrolls games before) so that's not really an excuse in and of itself...  Just have some patience, practice the controls and you'll find yourself in your character's shoes in no time...... The game has its obvious quirks and deficiencies: but its not right to even call them problems - what game doesn't have something that somebody will complain about?  There is no perfect game so evaluate a game for what it has not what it lacks (is that the glass half full argument?)...So sheath your sword, load your quiver, and get out there and slay some beasts and plunder their treasure!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"dozramor","summary":"awsome game would recomend it to anyone","reviewText":"I just finished the full walkthrough for Halo 2, as well as played a number of multiplayer games. I'm finally ready with the review of this awesome game!First off, this is obviously the sequel to the hugely popular initial Halo game. You are Master Chief, a space marine who is sent out to battle the enemies. You are fighting the Covenant, who are your main foes, but you also run into the Flood, who are a space parasite that wants to eat all life. In addition, there are mechanical creatures on Halo who want to kill pretty much anything including the Flood. So each location and creature type has its own look, feel, attitudes and reactions.The graphics are simply gorgeous, from the rippling water to the clouds in the sky and reflections off of surfaces. I love taking screenshots of this game. The music is also extremely well done, in that the quality is always very high. But it's a little bizarre to be going from new age lilting softness in one heated battle to high intensity rock music in another and so on. It doesn't necessary track to the location you're in, either. It's just whatever the designers felt like putting in.The gameplay and plot is where this game really shines. Your characters that interact with you are simply BRILLIANT in how they each do what a real live creature would do. Grunts are my favorite - these little Covenant front-liners are brave and talkative when they're in groups, but when you whittle them down they suddenly turn and flee, shrieking at the top of their lungs. Your teammates leap into vehicles with you, either driving or shooting depending on your preference. They'll come alongside you to give you support, and duck for cover when appropriate.The quips the characters come out with mid-battle still make me laugh out loud. In one sequence you are the covenant Arbitor and are working your way through a room. You come across a pair of grunts and a jackal under attack, and take out the enemies. The grunt comes running to you in glee, shouting, \"Arbitor! My savior!\" Then he pauses and adds, \"Jackal, say thank you to the Arbitor!\" :)The cut scenes are equally as brilliant and are truly movie quality in the interactions. The timing, dialogue, everything is great. The little touches are everywhere. In one sequence, the Sergeant is preparing his troops to get ejected in pods down to the surface of Halo. He walks past the Master Chief's pod and thumps twice on it, as if to say \"All OK in there, ready to go?\" Right on beat, you see Master Chief inside his pod, thumping once back in response. You really forget that these are just computer generated characters.Multiplayer is the stellar addition to this release and there are reasons to be thrilled. You can play on a large variety of maps, in a number of styles, and there is even going to be downloadable content in the future.That all being said, there are of course a few non-stellar aspects to this release. First, the ending SUCKS. The first one was bad enough with its \"Oh I bet there is another Halo out there\" so you don't even feel like you really saved the world. In this one, not only is it not a \"you're done but it's not over\" ending - it's pretty much cut off mid-battle! That is INCREDIBLY frustrating for a gameplayer. Obviously they want you to buy Halo 3, but that's going to be a year or two away. Can't we have some satisfaction in the meantime?Next, the game is really short, even on normal mode. We had a friend start the game up Sunday morning at about 12:30 and he was done with the entire game by around 8. You can have fun replaying it on the harder levels, but that's a rather quick game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00002SVWG","description":"In Final Fantasy Tactics you must guide your nation through a revolution while defending it from otherworldy forces!","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Difficult, But Fun.","reviewText":"What can I say FF Tactics is an RPG gem. Which somehow got over looked by many, but maybe that's because it came out around the same time as FF7. If you are a fan of chess board RPG styled games like Disgaea, Phantom Brave, Saiyuki's Journey West, etc. I highly recommend snagging this on PSP, PSN, Or a PS1 copy sold here for cheap. Also if you're a Final Fantasy Fan I recommend this too. Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the first games to introduce the chess board style game play. Here's how it racks up.Positive ++ Character's are unique and the artwork is on par with Legend Of Mana.+ Job classes make this game all the more fun and each job has it's unique Attacks/Stats/Armor Equipment.+ Lots of different weapons to choose from, even more abilities to make you character awesome. Example: Have a gun wielding knight who can also use samurai skills. Yep, that's possible in Tactics.+ Soundtrack is amazing, it's not Nobou amazing, but whoever was in charge did a fantastic job. At times it can be soothing as you're fighting in the rain on some mountain tops or creepy as you're fighting an uber boss in a castle. Music sets the mood big time in this game.+ You can recruit just about anyone to join your party. Monsters, humans, a crazy robot, and even Cloud Strife as a hidden side quest.+ Levels are unique. Not just the same painted over texture board over and over again. Each place on the map has it's own landscape, weather, different times of day, enemies, trees, water, you name it. Lots of work went into this part which shows a lot.+ Overall it takes 40 hours to finish Final Fantasy Tactics, 50 with all the side quests. One can miss a lot of hidden things on their first play through, so it definitely has replay value.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, now the negatives.- Like the title to this review says \"Difficult.\" Final Fantasy Tactics can be just a pain in the butt sometimes. Especially when a 20 minute battle takes a turn for the worse. Your party starts missing attacks on enemies, The enemy uses status attacks like petrify, confuse, charm, and there's no Medic in your party to heal those conditions or they just don't know that move. Yeah, a lot can go wrong in a battle. Or simply the enemy is just too strong and dominates your party. A great example of this is one part in the game where you're prompted to save just before an uber boss fight. If you can't beat this boss, tough cookie. Since you already saved, there's no going back to level up. Better find a way to beat this uber boss. There's a couple of fights throughout the game like this one and man it can be frustrating. If you are a fan of really hard games then you'll love this game for the difficulty aspect.- At one point the story just kind of loses its edge. Mainly towards the end where the main character has no idea what is going on. He's just trying to get his captured sister back from the bad guys. The ending also lacks any real punch line or what is it called... Meh, I'll just say punch line. It's kind of like \" And Everyone, Died... But Not Really\" type of ending. Not the best, but there is some closure. So that is what counts. Like what happened to such and such character. Mediocre ending.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: Tactics is great and delivers as a unique RPG for its time.Happy gaming","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3PM","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Thoroughly impressed (4.5 stars)","reviewText":"I've always been mildly interested in this game up until its release, given that this is a Lego game that isn't based off a movie franchise, like most are. Instead, Lego City Undercover is, obviously, based off of the Lego City brand. I thought the idea was pretty neat and after completing the main storyline, I have to say, I'm pretty impressed.The main storyline is very well written. It's funny, very slapstick, and, most importantly, lengthy (it took me approximately 15-16 hours). As you progress through the game, you control Chase McCain, a Lego City cop returning from exile, something that was not explained in the game but was most likely revealed in the 3DS prequel. Chase learns that the mass criminal Rex Fury has escaped from prison, and he must traverse around Lego City, finding many new disguises that each have unique abilities to aid him in his journey to capture the escapee. The interaction between the characters is excellent and you can tell that there is a definite sense of distaste between Chase and Police Chief Dunby. The voice acting is, for the most part, very good, but there are some parts that are rather cheesy. There are plenty of hilarious references throughout the game (the construction worker's \"Get him to the chopper!\" was one of my favorites) that will make you smile and remember the good 'ole times.The GamePad integration is rather unique to this game. The GamePad serves as Chase's communicator, which he uses to communicate with various people throughout the game. You can also use the GamePad to take pictures of crime in action, you can use it to find hidden objects, you can use it to pinpoint suspects, and you can use it to eavesdrop on private conversations. This is perhaps one of the only games on Wii U right now that truly makes good use of the GamePad.Nintendo and Tt Games markets Lego City Undercover as an open-world game, and it is. Even if you have a mission to do, you don't necessarily have to follow it until a special assignment starts. You're free to wander anywhere in the city, and trust me, the world truly is massive.The game is also extremely lengthy. As I mentioned earlier, the main storyline takes 15-16 hours to complete, but then there's all the collectibles. This game is FULL of collectibles. If you push for 100% completion in video games, this one is going to take a while.The graphics for this game are very good. The HD looks great and the frame rate is, for the most part, consistent, with only a few minor instances when the frame rate lags. The music for the game is actually exceptionally good. In the beginning, it may seem mediocre and not that great, but as you progress through the game, the music gradually gets better until you reach the all-out epic final theme in the game.Lego City Undercover is not a multiplayer game. To some people this will be an issue, but it isn't to me. I've always ventured through Lego games alone so the lack of multiplayer doesn't really affect me too much.Now there has been many complaints about Lego City Undercover having long loading times. I thought that everyone was over-exaggerating the loading times. But, to be honest, they weren't. The loading times for this game are dreadfully long. Once you select your file, it takes at least 60 seconds to load the game to where you left off. It takes an additional 45 seconds just to enter the police station, which is just plain ridiculous. The loading times were NOT (I repeat, NOT) fixed with the Wii U system update that went live on April 25th. That update only improved the console's loading times and did not improve in-game loading times. In-game loading times can only be fixed by the game developers. Hopefully Tt Games is working on a fix for loading times.All in all, Lego City Undercover is an excellent Lego game that thoroughly impressed me. This is perhaps my favorite Lego game ever and it is very lengthy (I'm at 17 hours of gameplay and so far I'm only 20% through). It's very fun, comedic, and has a great sense of exploration. Lego City Undercover is a must have if you are a Wii U owner looking for a good game that will last a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"not that great","reviewText":"I was recommend Ratchet and Clank because I'm a big fan of the original Spyro the Dragon (before that purple little dragon turned into a sellout and was milked to death for the last several years).I have to say though, this game is much worse than the original Spyro, and Ratchet and Clank mainly fails so hard because it's not nearly as fun, adventurous, or does it contain the same kind of beautiful and magical environments that Spyro did.The main character in the game goes around slashing at things and breaking open boxes, but the thing is, the gameplay feels MUCH closer to Crash Bandicoot than to Spyro.  In addition to that, the actual platforming is more often than not quite difficult and a HUGE pain.Repeatedly falling off the edge of a strip of land while attempting to reach a higher area over and *over* again really gets on my nerves after a while.  It means whenever I fall off from a high platform, I have to return to the same low spot, once again climb higher areas, and attempt to make a successful jump all over again.  I don't enjoy doing this, and that's why Spyro the Dragon is the ultimate platform/adventure game to me because the very first Spyro game was capable of becoming a classic without falling victim to the same cliches that most platformers (including this one) are dominated with.I also hate the way he jumps.  It looks awkward and again brings back horrible memories of Crash Bandicoot and the way those overrated games play.I'm disappointed big time that Ratchet and Clank falls short of my expectations, and I can't believe people would recommend me this game and would claim it brings back the adventurous kind of gameplay where the original Spyro series left off.  I have to disagree.  Just an above average platformer Ratchet and Clank is to me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00149ILDO","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Pandemic Studio's Swan Song","reviewText":"The Saboteur can be described in many ways but probably best as an overlooked game that was too little too late for the developer, Pandemic Studios. Yes, it's true that the developer of such hits as Star Wars Battlefront, Mercenaries and Destroy All Humans final game is The Saboteur. It's a shame because this could really be Pandemic's best work to date.The Saboteur places you in the shoes or Irishman racer/mechanic Sean Devlin in 1940's Europe - mostly in France and bits of Germany. The Nazi's are at poised to invade France. Sean enters a race known as the Saarbrucken Grand Prix and is cheated out of a win by a Nazi Colonel. Seeking revenge Sean and his best friend Jules seek to sabotage the Colonel's race-car. That's when things go quickly out of control and Sean & Jules bite off more than they can chew. I'll stop there to avoid any spoilers. I will say that the majority of the game takes place on the streets of Paris with one area of Germany available later on in the game.The storyline isn't going to win any awards but I found it decently compelling and interesting. Along Sean's adventure to extract revenge on the Nazi's he'll encounter various groups and individuals with differing motivations. If you enjoy blasting away at Nazi's then this game is going to be a gratuitous grand adventure for you. This is a sandbox style game so you're free to complete storyline quests at your choosing. Along the way you'll unlock different areas of Paris and get closer and closer to the Nazi's seat of power in the region.The graphical style of the game is perhaps the most compelling aspect of the game. The graphics while not cutting-edge are fantastic. Paris is initially draped in black & white to signify the Nazi suppression of the citizens. As you liberate areas from Nazi oppression color will once again return to the city, block by block. It's a very cool way of seeing the city transform and to track your progress.The main story can be completed in around 10 hours but plenty of side-quests and items known as `Free-Play Event's' will keep you busy for many, many more hours. The game features tons of weapons, vehicles and even military equipment that you can high-jack and use for your own destructive adventures. The Free-Play Events consist of various Nazi targets that you're tasked with taking out. It's completely optional but does earn you money and unlock more areas of the map.If The Saboteur has one glaring issue it has to be the game-play. While generally good parts of the game are unpolished. The racing sequences for example are silly and incredibly easy - almost gimmes. You can bounce off fences like they're made of rubber and cruise into first place easily. Another problem would be the frequency of building climbing that you're going to do and how painfully slow it is to climb.For the discount price I would recommend this as a buy to anyone but the most discerning gamer. The Saboteur is a fine swan song for a developer that will be missed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

Instead, you have a ton of sets, and like 100 different scenes for every set that you can put actors into. This actually works out pretty well as you can create a ton of different interesting scenes in interesting ways by using tiny pre-built scenes. If you don't want to create movies, you can have script writers do it. There are seemingly billions of movies they can write. I get eager to see what kind of movie they are making when I see interesting titles and such.You create stars, cast the movie, then shoot it. During the shoot  you can alter the screenwriter's movies slightly. Or, you can let the director shoot it himself and manage your huge studio lot. You unlock more stuff as you progress, and every 5 years there are awards. The awards are hard to get, and I get excited whenever I see my name nominated.As you progress, your stars start to want things, and eventually they become big. It's really awesome to see one of my stars become such a huge success after doing so many crappy movies. You can give your star plastic surgery and treat him like royalty by giving him an entourage.

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An absolute triumph","reviewText":"Video game sequels that learn from their previous mistakes, and build upon existing foundations, have been a staple of the game industry over the last 5 years, and no other sequel exemplifies this more than Batman: Arkham City.I enjoyed the previous game in the series, Arkham Asylum (see my review).  It had some flaws that kept it from being great, and it demonstrated the hallmarks of a relatively young developer finding its footing, but it was a very good game regardless that showed lots of potential.  The new game, Arkham City, is the full manifestation of that potential.  It is a masterpiece through and through.  It retains all the excellent qualities of Arkham Asylum: the excellent graphics and soundtrack, the top notch voice acting, and one of the finest combat systems to ever grace a video game.The key difference between these two games is implied in the titles of the games.  While Arkham Asylum was a more closed-in, claustrophobic setting, the prison of Arkham City is vast, vertical, grimy, and glorious.  The huge, open gameworld is a natural fit for Batman and his arsenal of gadgets.  Stalking your enemies from the tops of high rises, grappling from rooftop to rooftop, finding secrets around every corner...the game manifests the concept of being Batman much more effectively than its predecessor.  Batman is a detective, and Batman is a hunter, and the environment seems to be designed around allowing these two concepts to fully blossom.  Also, given the multifaceted gameworld, there is also so much more to do here.  You can deviate from the story at any time to take on a plethora of side missions, which are not only fully-encompassed stories in themselves, but also introduce key characters from the Batman universe into the story.  This is a fuller, richer game than its predecessor, and offers an experience unlike any other video game out there right now.One other aspect of Batman: Arkham City worth mentioning is the story.  While the story is very good throughout, it takes an incredibly emotional, powerful turn in the last quarter of the game that will leave you stunned.  Narrative was a key focus of the previous game in the series, but just like in every other area, Arkham City's story absolutely soars.  It's an unforgettable Batman story that will proudly stand alongside the the best Batman comics and movies.If you played and enjoyed Arkham Asylum to any degree, buying this game is a no-brainer.  But for anyone else out there who is unfamiliar with this series of games and is pondering picking this game up, I highly encourage you to do so, as I truly believe that there is very little here that can possibly disappoint.  It is one of the most expertly and lovingly crafted video games I have ever played, and this fully manifests itself in the incredibly enjoyable, exciting, and unforgettable experience that is playing Batman: Arkham City.  This is one of this generation's top games.  Get it.ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Purchasing the game new will also give you access to several missions where you can play as Catwoman, who moves and fights very distinctly from Batman, and is SO much fun to play as.  Not only this, but her story arc intersects with Batman's several times in the game, and playing as her makes the entire experience much richer.  Be sure not to miss this part of the game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2012"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"The Biggest Surprise of the Year 2009","reviewText":"I just didn't see it coming.  I sure thought 'inFAMOUS' would be another pathetic open world superhero game like 'Spiderman' / 'Hulk' / 'Superman' or 'Assassin's Creed' (which was a huge let-down for me) rip-off.  What 'Sucker Punch' has created is a refreshing take on the 3rd person action platformer like 'Jak and Daxter' series or its own 'Sly Cooper' series with a twist of comic book superhero origin story set in the Dystopian near future.If you have been hugely disappointed by GTA IV or Assassin's Creed like many people have, let me assure you; 'inFAMOUS' is not is another GTA or Assassin's Creed clone.  It is an exciting and addictive action game combined with strong platforming mechanics, but most of all, the game offers solid storyline that oozes with highly stylized comic book sensibility.You are Cole McGrath, an ordinary man stuck with a super power that enables you to manipulate electricity after the mysterious but devastating explosion that put 'Empire City' in lawless ruin.  You need to unravel the mystery behind the incident by traversing around the three islands of 'Empire City' (which is conveniently quarantined from the mainland) and take main quest along with many optional side quests to level up and unlock more super powers and become stronger.The gameplay progresses just like 'Jak 2' or 'Jak 3'.  You take a mission for the main quest.  Between each mission, you can freely roam around the city and take the optional side quests you unlocked.  Story is progressed by radio conversation and comic book-styled cutscene. The cutscene is especially cool and highly stylized with some cool camera techniques and motion technology.Although you don't get to use any weapon or ride vehicle, your ability to manipulate electricity enables you to muster various destructive power to dispatch baddies and manuever to move around the city in style, and it's a blast to use the electical power you possess.  As you get stronger, you will really feel like a comic book superhero that put Spidey or Hulk in shame.There are two paths you take; Good or Evil.  Each path will unlock different super powers and side quests, and eventually lead to different ending.  Moral choice you get to make is important to shape your own path in the storyline.It takes good 20-25 hours to finish the game on one path.  There are several different types of collectibles scattered throughout the city and the city is quite large.  There are tons of unlockable Trophy.  'inFAMOUS' definitely has some longevity and replay value.  It doesn't just claim so, it definitely delivers so.The best part of the gameplay to me is the way you traverse in such style as you can scale any buildings and structures with such ease, jump from rooftop to rooftop, smoothly slide on the electrical wires and rails, and glide and hover around in the air.  Any combination of these abilities and the city is your playground.  The platforming mechanics are much more intuitive and accurate than 'Assassin's Creed' and 'Spider-man'.  The game might look like another 3rd person shooter but there are plenty of platforming in the game.As far as free-roaming, open world game goes, GTA III Trilogy and Jak Trilogy are still the best, but 'inFAMOUS' comes really close to the standard set by the renowned series and offers something much refreshing than most that have tried to imitated the success of GTA.  Maybe the inevitable sequel will bring the free-roaming, open world game genre closer to the illusive 'free-formed, open-ended, sandbox' game like 'Oblivion' and 'Fallout 3'.  Overall, this is the biggest surprise of the year 2009 and a game no PS3 owner should miss.*Free-roaming, open world game - You freely traverse an open and continous environment to take on mission to mission instead of being confined in the traditional closed and linear level to progress.  There are extra activities available when not restricted by main quest.GTA series, Jak and Daxter series, Mafia series, The Godfather series, Scarface: The world is yours, True Crime, etc.*Free-formed, open-ended game - You shape the storyline of game in any order to do whatever you want whenever you want however you want.The Elder Scrolls series, Gothic seriesCurrently the term 'sandbox game' is loosely and unfittingly used by many for free-roaming, open world game like GTA.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2009"}

Really three different GBA's? Four (and soon to be five) DS models? Once the latest and last iteration comes out you tend to think that model should have been the first. Same goes with the PSP since the 3000 is amazing and should have been the 1000 model. The first thing you'll notice when you take it out of the box is the weight. This thing feels light as a feather, and I almost thought it was a fake piece of plastic. This also is a benefit when playing games, and reduces the hand cramps.Another thing you'll notice is it's slimmer, and all the fat has been trimmed off. The D-pad is built better and it concaved on the inside instead of just flat like the original model. The speakers are located at the top front instead of the bottom thus the speakers are also more clear and less tinny. The addition of a built-in mic is great to for online play. The memory stick slot also has a major change with it up near the top left side instead of the bottom. The slot is also a piece of plastic that comes out instead of the black corner piece. The slot it hidden well and blends in nicely with the unit.Finally the UMD slot has changed with a pull-out slot instead of a switch that makes it pop out. You just lay the UMD in instead of sliding it in like a cassette tape. It's quieter, and seems to be slightly faster as well, and uses less battery power. Another good change is the WLAN switch is on top of the unit next to the USB port which keeps you from accidentally switching it on. The console feels better when holding due to its glossy back, and there are no contours for your hands, but this makes holding the unit better for some odd reason.Other than that everything is the same. The screen is crisper, brighter, and the new PlayStation home button looks great too. The Wi-Fi is slightly faster, supports newer security, and this unit is just solid and brilliantly designed.

Besides the long load times (that aren't too bad), that is about the only bad thing I can say about the game. The graphics are really good, but I don't know if I would say that are a lot better than any other games in the series. They may be improved a little, but not enough to be amazingly incredible.\"Smackdown vs. Raw 2007\" does offer a great selection of new wrestlers to choose from that obviously weren't available in the other games. This is always the best part of the game, being able to play new people. Another interesting aspect of this game is the story which is told by the commentary of JR, the King or whoever else are the announcer of the particular event. Each match reveals a little more of the story. During the fights, the game does a great job at making the match seem real by having continious dialogue between the announcers. The only problem is that some of the things they say get repeated.The soundtrack is pretty good, but maybe not as great as previous games. Overall, if you love the Smackdown series, then I would really recommend this to you. Just be prepared for the weird change in controls and load times that take longer than needed.

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"~30 HOURS IN . . . I QUIT!","reviewText":"[SPOILER FREE]A veteran of Final Fantasy 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and Tactics, for the first time, I have finally given up on a Final Fantasy game. Here are the contributing factors:LINEARITY:This word has been used so much in reviews that I feel it needs to be re-defined. Are the maps linear? In a general sense, yes, but there are dead ends, forks and roundabouts en route to your destination. You aren't walking down a hamster tube the whole time as some would have you believe.However! One often FEELS as if they were walking down a hamster tube because this game lacks things that most great RPGs have in common:Decision-making!A good RPG should NOT be a novel. A good RPG should be more like a CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE-type book. In an RPG, there is no little to no fun in following a story that is completely predetermined.Variety!In the ~30 hours I've played this game, not once have I seen any side quests, mini-games or other distractions.STORY:To be honest, I found the general story behind FF13 much more interesting than the story of FF12. Despite that, it still falls short of the superb storylines found in games like FF 4, 6, 7, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger and the Lunar series.MUSIC:Being honest again, I did think the title music was very good, as was the choir-driven boss music when you fight Barthandelus . . . ~20 hours later! All the music in between was either too soft to hear, some funky jazz stuff that needed to stay in Kansas City, or some weird drum and bass jungle beats.Nobuo Uematsu is not god. There are other composers who have also cranked out great video game soundtracks: Yasunori Mitsuda, Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata, to name a few.But what all those great composers possess, is the ability to match the music to that particular moment on the screen.Simply put, in FF13, most of the music doesn't fit the moment. The battle music is especially pathetic. Real good battle music should really get you in a MOOD to beat some guys around, not lull you to sleep.CHARACTERS:There are some good characters in this game. My favorite would be Sazh with the chocobo chick in his head. He's not as funny as Dave Chappelle, but he tries.On the other end, the most annoying by far is . . . you guessed it! . . . VANILLE! She has just witnessed the Final Fantasy equivalent of 9/11, and here she is grinning and smiling and running around like a ditzy schoolgirl. On top of that, she moans and groans more than most adult entertainment.But most inexcusable is the exclusion of the most important character:YOU! THE PLAYER!Final Fantasy 6 realized that the player was just as much a character in the game as the others were. If you recall, during the ~20 minute ending to Final Fantasy 6, the last character introduced was \". . . YOU!\"You were a character in that game because YOU got to DECIDE whether the raft went left or right, how to split up your teams, which town the airship landed near, which characters you rediscovered, whether Shadow got saved, and so forth.So although Final Fantasy 13 has some good characters, in the end one ultimately feels detached because the player is not PARTICIPATING along with them.WORLD MAP:The lack of a world map was a terrible idea.At the very least, a world map gives one the ILLUSION OF FREEDOM. You may be forced to walk down a mountain path on a world map, but you may also see villages on the other side of those mountains, seemingly inaccessible and mysterious. It may make you want to play the game more so that you can discover more of the world. In addition, it gets rid of the feeling of tunnel-vision claustrophobia that one gets in this game.I had a hard time visualizing the world of FF13. Another thing that a world map does, is give the game some cohesion. Instead of just walking into towns, you now know where those towns and dungeons are in relation to each other. If you think about it, just about every major fantasy novel has a map.I wonder why . . .COMBAT:In a nutshell, the combat is basically a dumbed-down version of the combat found in FF12. Instead of programming the actions of all your characters, you merely pick what task they should be doing and they automatically go out and do it.If only your characters weren't so bloody stupid!There are bonuses for characters attacking the same target. But guess what? If you have Lightning help out Snow, in the hopes of taking out that monster faster, what does Snow do? He switches over to the monster you just left! You can have 3 characters in your party fighting 3 individual battles.So much for teamwork . . .If the leader in the party dies, it is game over. The Medic often seems oblivious to this fact, healing characters that are not a priority, especially when you're at 245 HP and almost dead.Early on in the game, there were some nice touches to spice things up a bit: You could find enemies that were fighting amongst themselves or change the weather to fight different types of enemies. A nice try at variety, but the developers didn't follow through with it or include it as often as they could have.SUMMONS:Not only is it mandatory to fight Eidolons, but once you get them, the reward is very small. Instead of the powerful creatures that laid waste to everything in sight, the Eidolons are now about as dangerous and effective as a Navy Seal with a Super Soaker. The Eidolons are good for healing and that's about it.TOWNS:There ARE towns in FF13, like Palumpolum . . . but they're just set-pieces, places where you fight your battles, not buy your gear.STORES:I thought the idea of \"computerized stores\" at the Save Points made sense for the futuristic world of FF13. After all, you are reading this review on Amazon, which is basically the same thing and here it is 2010.But I was disappointed in how the upgrade system worked. While it is easy to pick out the best weapons and accessories, there is no indication of what materials actually DO and how they will help you meet your upgrading needs. You basically have to do it by trial and error, which is further complicated by the fact that gil is nearly impossible to come by.POLISH:The game is definitely polished and has some nice touches. I like the text on the load screens bringing you up to date. I liked the short animation of the character's faces on the Status screen. I liked the \"Datalog\" encyclopedia. A few other things. But if you take a piece of gravel from your backyard and polish it, is it worth anything? No. Although it looks nice on the outside, deep down it's still a worthless piece of gravel. FF13 may be polished, but polish means nothing when the original material is severely flawed.GRAPHICS:There is a reason why I mention graphics last, and that is because in an RPG, graphics are not all that important. Part of the joy of fantasy is using your IMAGINATION. Unfortunately, as graphics have gotten more life-like, less is left to the imagination. Sometimes for the better, but often for the worse.That being said, the graphics in FF13 are definitely impressive, even on the Xbox 360. Honestly, I don't feel like I'm missing much graphics-wise by not playing it on a PS3.CONCLUSION:Is Final Fantasy 13 a terrible game? No. Like I said, it has its good points and it is polished up pretty well, but deep down, there are severe flaws that ultimately made this game unenjoyable for me. It's not much of an ROLE-playing game when the most important character--the player--has little to no input or ROLE at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Renfield \"Up the Irons\"","summary":"Yeah I agree... getting boring...","reviewText":"Why does Square keep doing this? If anything, the last good Final Fantasy was the tenth one. Of course, the best one was 7 without a doubt. The rest that came were good but not as good (except for 9, which had good graphics but horrible gameplay IMO). Then with X2, XI, and XII, they started to go downhill. Then the FF7 spinoffs came. I enjoyed Advent Children even though the plot was a bit fanfic-ish, but hated Dirge and thought they blew it big time with Crisis Core. That said, I still had hope for thirteen.I am but 7 hours in and so far this is undoubtedly better than Crisis Core, and I'll admit that. But that said, it's still style over content, like the past three games.PROS:-The graphics are good-Good music from Uematsu as usual-The cutscenes don't go on for too long-The character development is more apparent.CONS:-The plot is REALLY rushed, really unoriginal and if anything, a bit too linear. It's like the writers thought that they could just write a Twilight fanfic for a thirteenth entry and it would still be FF. This plot would have been good for a Halo game, not for a Final Fantasy.-The battle system is unfortunately in Crisis Core mode again. It's all a bit too automated; you just smash the A button several times and it does all the work for you. Furthermore, what REALLY ticks me off is that you can't choose your party member's attacks like you could previously, so therefore if your character dies, well, he/she dies.-The dialogue is REALLY awful!!! I know that video game dialogue is not the best but with how long it took for this, you'd think they'd write compelling dialog.-This is no RPG game. The leveling up is gone, money is almost worthless and sometimes you have to make unfair decisions.-Also, I really hate the protagonist Lightning so far. She is really annoying and whiny.I haven't beaten it yet, in fact I am close to it, but so far, I'm starting to lose my faith in the FF series. If FFXIV is like this, then the series is pretty much done and over. This isn't a bad game, but beware. It's definitely no FF game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}

I skipped over the DSi but the 3D camera is a BIG draw for me.The 3DS also has a nice operating system that leaves programs running in the background while you go back to the home menu to use the drawing tool for game notes or take a break. Lastly the calibration for everything from touch screen, to the cameras leaves you feeling in control.  There will be improvements (vol slide feels flimsy) but for now this is one incredibly fun handheld with some serious possibilities.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2011"}

This series has actually been around for a while, and may be older than Final Fantasy. That I cannot be sure of, but what I can say is the first installment of this title was Dragon Warrior, released on the original NES system. This is, to this day, my all-time favorite game. After going through some of my boxes I stumbled upon this game; after wiping away the dust I fired it up in my PS3 and my quest of nostalgia began.**Note: Dragon Quest was originally released as Dragon Warrior in the states. With the more recent releases they opted to keep the name of the series universal, hence the interchangeability of Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest in the text of this review.**GameplayIf you have every played an RPG game, then you understand the concept of slay the monster, gain experience, travel from place to place and more-than-likely, save the world. To this end, Dragon Quest weighs in with the best. However, if you are a fan of the series, then you know that the core of any Dragon Warrior game is the run to new towns, buy new weapons and armor, find the special items and level, level, level. This game is no different.If you are used to the Final Fantasy series, this game may present its initial frustrations to you. Your characters start out weak, and it takes time before you have your full team (4 characters, about 10 hours in). You do not get super-special uber moves until much later in the game, and you will need to heal and rest at the inn A LOT until you get to a higher level. Saving is only available in churches, and you will find yourself using your augmentation spells (such as increase defense, etc) in many battles.Play is very familiar to any RPGer; it is turn-based random battles. True to Dragon Warrior, anytime you cross a bridge, the monster spawns are tougher. The world is HUGE, and there is a lot of exploring to be done. There are many sidequests, and you will find it necessary to \"grind\" in some areas, just killing monsters over and over again to gain a few levels until you can beat a boss. That is not to say that the game is unfairly balanced, rather, you will have a challenge on your hands if you do not take the time to explore and gain a few levels in between each boss fight.Also, there are a lot of 'run here' and 'find this item' quests. It is very repetitive, but not in a boring way. It gets funny sometimes. When you come to a new city, it is never simple enough to just waltz up and get the item you need. You will invariably have to chase down a thief or repair the broken item, or do some type of babysit quest and lead an NPC around. But the story more than makes up for these tasks.The story is very intriguing, although if you are a fan of the series, a bit predictable. Again, this is not a bad thing, currently, we are over 50 hours into the game, and we are still addicted. We have pretty much guessed a lot that will happen, but now we are spending our time creating new items and retracing our steps to make sure we leave no stone unturned. Since the game also has two possible endings, we are also making sure that we get the best ending possible.Look and ControlsIn simple, this game is gorgeous. The character design was done by a Mr. Toriyama, the same artist for the popular cartoon series Dragonball Z. The quasi-3D world is very colorful and vivacious, and the environments are expansive, beautiful, and easily navigable. You will simply be overwhelmed by how huge this world is.The particle effects presented are wonderful too. Spells are artistic and beautiful to watch, without being the cinematic episodes so exploited in the Final Fantasy series. Weather, time, even travel is done with detail. There is no framerate loss, either. Minor load times do occur between entering a city from the wilderness, for example, but those last all of 3 to 4 seconds. Once loaded, each area is huge and easily explored. Dungeons and other backgrounds have great detail without looking \"pasted\". In most instances, you can explore all that you see.Control is the same as most RPGs, you walk or run, and you can select from text menus to fight in battle. As the game progresses, more options become available to you, but the standard options include, Fight, Flee, Item, Intimidate, Spells, or Abilities. Depending on your character, different abilities are extended. And, each warrants a distinct and separate animation for that action.Overall, the game is simply gorgeous, colorful, and quite captivating. You will not be disappointed to look at this nor play.SoundThe soundtrack for the American version of the game is orchestrated. The music is very suited to each map area, and does not become annoying or aggravating. In fact, being a fan of that type of music, I would love to find the soundtrack. Sometimes the music reminds me of the music from the Sims game, but without being that annoying. Overall, the music is beautiful.The voiceacting in the game is colorful, and varied. Most of the characters have a very distinct cultural dialect, mostly from the British Isles. However, so far, I have not noticed any repeats in terms of the voice actors. Also, some of the voices are just downright hysterical, while others seems to suit the look of the character to a 'T'.OverallThis game is worth it to any fan of the RPG genre. Be warned, however, it will suck your soul and consume many, many hours of your life. The game is a pure joy to play, and with a huge world, involving story, and many, many things to do, it will take hours to play. If you do not have the time nor the inclination, do not invest the $50 in this game. Otherwise, this is a must-have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"The Good and The Bad. PLUS TIPS!","reviewText":"Recently got this game at LameStop for 4.99. With a price like that, it's basically a steal especially for this game. I'm going to go straight to the critiques:PRO:- Pretty decent graphics.- Had some scary moments or moments that put me on the edge of my seat, running for my life.- I like monster related games, that's why I chose this game. It delivers somewhat even though the variety of monsters was lacking.- Entertained me for a good number of hours.CONS:- Beating the game does not unlock anything. You cannot carry over any weapons, monster, etc. All weapons will remain locked when you plan to play brutality.- Even though I managed to get the best rifle, shotgun, and handgun in the game, I couldn't really get started until stage 7 (end stage is 9 and the last two are relatively short). I got the best shotgun earlier (Protecta stage 4 end), but I didn't like it much because I usually prefer keeping my distance from the enemy and taking them out from afar. Another problem was not only when it was available, but also money. Money is a bit rare to accumulate, I was able to afford the shotgun and rifle both at the beginning of stage 7 by selling pretty much all the upgrades that I found thus far.- That said, I find that most of the time you are stuck with the pea shooter (your starter gun), saving up money for the best guns, which surprising remains moderately effective even on the last stage, but is not advised. You can buy slightly better guns, but you run the chance of not having enough money for THE gun that you'd eventually want to get. Your gun sells back at about half price and you lose all the upgrades placed in it...which does hurt.- You cannot take out and move upgrades around. Once you put an upgrade into a gun, it is stuck there permanently.- You can probably beat the whole game with one main gun...- Not much of a variety in terms of opponents and monsters. I was more disappointed with the variety of monsters/mutants. It's really a very small handful and leaves a lot to be desired.- The story/plot of the game.....suuuuucks.- The cinematic are not memorable and noteworthy.- The bosses are a little too easy and the end boss got me a little irritated....Bosses are mainly easy because their attacks are quite easily avoided.TIPS:1. Make sure to always check around for those upgrade suitcases. They're good for upgrades and for selling. Some may be higher up so remember to search thoroughly. One thing that's neat is that the game doesn't really try to hide the upgrades in really hard areas so as long as your attentive, you should be able to see them. No worries though, at the last level, I was selling extra upgrades left and right.2. Every new stage grants you 4 grenades, you can use them, but I find them not super useful and so sell them for money. They're 450 each I believe? Times 4.3. Some of the most useful upgrades I find are stopping power, fire rate, fire rate, and enferon. Emphasis on enferon. Some of the most useless upgrade or upgrades I never touch are puncture, reload speed, and accuracy. Accuracy, however, put a question mark on that. Of course upgrade slot upgrade is useful, you can have a max of 4 upgrade slots per gun. My favorite gun was the kortov, which is the best rifle. My upgrade was stopping power, stopping power, enferon, and fire power. I question the usefulness of fire power mainly due to the fact that it increased the damage by 25%, but the gun wasn't high on fire power for it to change much. Anyway, two stopping power causes your opponent to be knocked down 25%x2=50% per hit. Enferon is a gradually acting poison. What I usually do is snipe the enemy from afar with one or two rounds, hide somewhere, and let the poison just kill them, especially if they're knocked down which lets the poison work on them longer. What I'd do is run down and as soon as I hear some enemies, run back up to a higher or more secure area. The enemies will be standing around and sometimes if your far enough, they won't attack you and you can snipe away and basically kill all of them without them laying a single finger on you. One or two burst and just stand and wait for them to die, this works throughout the game. I find load speed, puncture, and accuracy not so useful because loading for me happens while I move or wait for an opponent. I ALWAYS keep my gun fully loaded when there's no enemies and you don't usually have a huge horde of enemies going your way anyhow.....so reloading isn't an issue. Puncture works when enemies stand in a line, but I find it rare therefore not worth it. Accuracy I didn't find it worth the upgraded, especially with the kortov, where I can snipe pretty much anything and hit targets dead on even when they're pretty far away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00095LIC0","reviewerName":"Suzanne Amara","summary":"A terrific idea for a game, lots to do, a little frustrating...","reviewText":"This seems like one of the first games for the DS that gets it pretty much right.  It's a well thought out game, with a lot to it.  You use the stylus to draw paths to get Kirby through all kinds of levels, picking up stars along the way.  You make Kirby go faster by poking him, and by making twirls in the path, and you can pick up the abilities of enemies, as in other Kirby games.  There are medals in each level which are harder to get than what you would have to do just to get through the levels, and these can be used to unlock mini games and special features, like different colored ink to color the lines you draw.  When you have completed a level, you can go back and do it again as a race, or as a contest to use very little \"ink\".  It's a lot of fun figuring out each level, and the boss stages are GREAT---they are quite different than the regular game, and feature things like a breakout type game, a memory game and a connect the dots game!My only comment is that the game gets hard very fast for the average gamer.  My son is quite good at most video games, but he gave up on this one rather quickly as he just couldn't advance.  There are times you have to draw something exactly right with split second timing, and if you don't, you don't go on.  I kept trucking away but still eventually gave up on getting further, even though I devoted some time to the game.  It's great for a game to be challenging, but it's also nice if you can get somewhere with some work!Don't let that discourage you from buying this if you are looking for a good DS game, however.  There are NOT that many good DS games out there, and I think this is one you will be playing for a long time to come---there is so much to unlock, such variety in the ways the levels can be played, and it's a lot of fun to look at, too!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2005"}

It's not a must play game by any means, but it's also not fit to be a beer coaster either. It's an enjoyable experience, but honestly you're feelings towards the franchise as a whole would will be the deciding factor as to if you should pick it up now, or wait.This game has been in development for over ten years, so for someone to say with a straight face that this game feels dated, really needs to put things in prospective. Anyone with any common sense wouldn't expect this to be a FPS of this generation, it just goes without saying, at least I would assume.If you are a Duke Nukem fan and/or just a fan of the 90's style FPS all together, than you'll most likely enjoy this game. The game isn't without it's faults, but for what it is, it's not too bad. It's very tongue and cheek and by no means does it try to hide that fact, if anything it smashes it in your face like a clown with a cream pie.Would I recommend this game to someone who exclusively plays games like Call of Duty and Halo, probably not, but for someone with a diversified palate in gaming this may just satisfy.In today's day and age the old school gets no respect, however as the latest Mortal Kombat showed, there's nothing wrong with going back to a different time for the sake of nostalgia. I'm not saying every genre should jump on the old school band wagon, or even that they need to, but in my opinion there's nothing wrong with attending a class every now and then.Now on to the game itself, which by the way I've only played the single player campaign so that is all I'm reviewing.First issue, which honestly really isn't that much of an issue for me personally, but other's may not agree, is the graphics. Again, they are dated but considering when this game was started I would have to say it was pretty much expected that this wouldn't compare to Crysis 2. Truthfully it's not the graphics that make the game anyway, sure it makes for a prettier package, but over all as we all know it's the gift inside that makes the present something special.Second would be the story, the backdrop and pretty much all the dialog are of a very immature nature. Someone looking for a deep story and well developed characters may want to move along, there's nothing here to see. However f you're not one of those \"butts so tight they squeak\" kind of people and you're able to let your inner child out to play then you'll be fine. It's light hearted and meant to be played with a smile on your face.Finally, this by no means is a run and gun kind of game, there is a lot of down time and the story does move along at a slow pace, especially in the beginning. So if you're an action junkie, who wants all the explosions and bullets flying all over the place nonstop, then again this is not for you.Bottom line, if you're a fan of the series take the risk, the game is a lot of fun. If you have no idea who Duke Nukem is, then you may want to wait until the price drops.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

Or they think that games should look more real than life itself.  My computer is two years old, and it runs this game just as fast as it did with MW2.

It seems they tried to slow the game down by adding more \"enemies\" to each map, and made the bots in the game worthless.

You can play all the way through and never kill a soul if you wish. this game delivers OPTIONS!- great DLC.NEUTRAL:- (SPOILERS) some story items never get explained. who the hell is this Outsider guy? are you this chick's father? they're all left dangling either for a sequel, or simply because this is a video game.- some voice acting is a bit spotty.CONS:- visually muddy and low-rez textures. not really excusable for an Unreal Engine game this late in the console cycle. I don't care if this is a port from PC or not, the game has great style and aesthetics but the graphical fidelity itself is noticeably pixelated and ugly. the game is kind of a bummer to look at.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

In both your character hovers around the foreground of the screen shooting everything that gets in your way.  Really the big difference is the fact that in S&P; you move forward on rails and the graphics are circa 1987.By no means is this meant as an insult.  The game plays wonderfully.  The plot is nonsense and poor acted nonsense at that, but who cares?  There are lots of things to shoot and lots shooting at you.The other major improvement over Cabal (or the first S&P; for that matter) is the inclusion of IR aiming.  Twitch gaming is made that much more precise with that addition.How much fun you get out of it squarely lies on how you feel about games like Cabal, Wild Guns or the original S&P.;  If you are a fan, this is the ultimate next-gen version of those classics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

(Unless you hate QTE)","reviewText":"Many people are harsh to this game because they are expecting a Ninja Gaiden clone.Well, sort of, but not really, its like a game made up of blending a few other games together.Well to sum it up, this game is Ninja violence + Quick Time Events + some jumping/platforming.Story : 6/10The story appears to be a ripoff of a few themes: zombifie infection of a city, but not really (parasites!), ninjas wielding various weapons and powers but speak with an American accent, saving the city with over the top action and defeating giant bosses. And a really cheesy sensei.Graphics : 7/10Admittedly, not bad for an xbox 360 game. I liked the bird's eye views of Tokyo. Not fantastic but credible. Somewhere between an old xbox game and Gears of War 3, to put things in perspective.Sound : 7/10Not too bad, surround sound effects are okay. Lots of explosions.Gameplay : 7/10Lots of slashing, combos, violence like God of War and Ninja Gaiden. Quick Time Events play a large part and break up the game. If you hate QTEs then forget about this game. If you like them, they actually make the game a pretty exciting experience. The platforming and wallrunning will remind you of Ninja Gaiden. Collecting yellow orbs refill your health and red orbs allow for upgrades (reminds you of God of War or Dante's Inferno much??)Overall : 7/10For its price, its good exciting fun. Pick it up if you do not have other major titles to play. I would recommend it, UNLESS you hate QTE, or are bad at it (which I suspect is the reason why many gamers dislike this game).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2012"}

This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car.

It kept me entertained for years, no other video game I had lived up to my expectations as this game did (other than Road Rash 2, Super Mario Bros, and Sonic 3 and Knuckles). Like Sonic 2 isn't cool enough already, there's also 2-player. And 2-player mode isn't just a small addition, either-it's just as fun as single player. Sure, there are only four small stages for 2-player, but those four stages pack a real fun punch. The new special stages are also funner than the special stages in Sonic 2's prequel. Although Tails can't exactly use his ability of flight, it's still pretty fun if you play with a friend, because Tails can really help Sonic. He can make the boss fights easier, he can kill badniks before Sonic can devastatingly crash into them, and he can also collect those rings that Sonic doesn't want to get because he doesn't want to destroy his ring total. This game is purely amazing, and I think it's more of a classic than the first in the series, the one and only Sonic the Hedgehog.

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review if for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.Heavenly Sword has a great story and is beautiful to watch. The animation and cut scenes for this game are exactly right. The characters and scenery are beautiful, but still have enough of an animated feel so you aren't pushing the boundary of realism too far. We finished the game in three sittings, I would guess between 6-8 hours. I'm glad this was a short game, because while the characters pulled at your heart and the story drew you in, there were times when the game was very frustrating to watch. The fight scenes (even with the special move cut scenes that were imbedded in the battles) were long enough to get boring, but not so long that you had time to do too much else while they went on. The weapon guidance with the six axis controller was extremely frustrating to watch, especially in the beginning while you are getting used to it.If life were a video game, Nariko is the kind of heroine every girl wants to be. She is beautiful, strong, independent, confident, determined and beautiful. (Yea, I know I said beautiful twice.) Her \"sidekick\" Kai is equally adorable. Her relationship to Nariko is somewhat of a cross between a younger sister and a childhood pet. But don't let Kai's naivety fool you; she is as clever and cunning as she is cute.As a game, this would get 5 stars from me. But, since I'm doing a girlfriend review, I decided to give it 4 stars.

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Haters gonna hate, but this game is great!","reviewText":"In the highly unlikely event that you're unaware, Nintendo makes these games about an Italian plumber named Mario. They usually involve running from left to right to save a Princess and things of that nature. New Super Mario Bros. 2 is another game like that. It's really fun. You should buy it.New Super Mario Bros. 2 might look like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, but make no mistake, it doesn't really play all that much like it. The graphics are a deception. When it comes to gameplay, NSMB2 is like a return to form, in many respects.One of the best features of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World is Mario's ability to fly. Nintendo really nailed good gameplay in those games with the Super Leaf and Cape Feather, respectively. In New Super Mario Bros. 2, the Super Leaf makes a return, and it's GREAT. There's nothing quite like flying Mario high up into the air to look for hidden secrets.Another great improvement over the previous game would be the boss fights. These new boss fights are closer to being on par with Super Mario World than those in the Wii game were. The enemies have some pretty creative attacks, and often make use of the elements associated with their world (e.g. Wendy Koopa, boss of the water world, causes water to cover the screen and make Mario swim while he dodges her attacks.).NSMB2 is pretty easy, to me anyway. However, it would probably be a good challenge for someone who has never played a 2D Mario game. But that doesn't really matter, because there's much more to do in this game besides just saving the Princess. The game's main staying power comes from finding all of the Star Coins and secret ways out of the levels. Personally, I love doing that kind of stuff. Your mileage may vary.There's also a Coin Rush mode which involves trying to get as many coins as you can in three random levels. You can also purchase brand new DLC courses in this mode. Since the standard game has more than enough levels in it, the ability to purchase additional content feels quite welcome.In summation, NSMB2 feels sufficiently different from the previous NSMB game I'd played. I honestly believe that a lot of hate the game gets is related to its graphics. It's true that the NSMB2 could have used a new art style and some new music, but the gameplay is as good as it's ever been.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"Robert N. Kallister","summary":"Get Your Badge Out","reviewText":"At a first glance, True Crime: Streets of LA is just another GTA clone.  But when you actually get into playing it, it becomes a LOT different, and a lot more interactive.As Nick Kang, your job is an LA flatfoot with a short fuse.  Your antics have gotten you in trouble more than once, and currently you've been suspended.  But, the police chief decides to give you a second chance by admitting you into the Elite Operations Division (EOD) to try to crack down on a major threat the Chinese Triads have forced upon your city.Like GTA, you can &quot;steal&quot; any car you want to drive.  The only difference is that as a police officer, you're just commandeering them.  But as you progress though the game, you learn driving techniques, such as quick turnarounds, nitro boost, and even riding on two wheels.The shooting system is a bit far-fetched, but works out fairly well.  Your basic handguns (because Nick likes to shoot with two) have unlimited shots.  They do, however, have a number of rounds in the chamber, so you will have to reload them once in a while.  You can pick up other weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles, SPAS shotguns, and .45 revolvers, but those guns DO have an ammo limit.  In addition to just your normal target-and-fire abilities, you can learn different types of attacks by visiting shooting ranges.Last but least, Nick is also a martial-arts master.  When trying to apprehend suspects, you can use your kung-fu to take them down instead of shooting them (which can get you into trouble).  As you visit more dojo locations, you learn more combos and special attacks that can help you kick your enemies to the pavement.The story is very rich, with an interesting cast of characters, and very good voiceovers.  There's an aire of maturity of a good shoot-em-up action film, plus a lot of comedy throughout.  You get to explore the entirity of Los Angeles in full detail, from the ratty subdivisions to the high towers of the downtown district, even all the way up to Hollywood and Beverly Hills.A few drawbacks do exist, though.  Seems like the missions always involve the same premise, but just get a bit more difficult each time you do them.  More mission diversity would've been nice.  Also, crime happens EVERYWHERE, even as you're just standing around outside of your car.  These crimes are optional to do, but they can be distracting when you're trying to get from one place to another.  And the soundtrack is almost completely west-coast rap.  I'm not a big fan of rap myself (I'm more partial to heavy metal or rock), so I turned the radio off.  Kind of gets weird when you don't hear anything while you're driving around.Overall, this gets an 8 of 10.  It's fun, it's well designed, and it'll keep you entertained.  I recommend a rental before you buy, though.  Some people who are GTA fans may not like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"An obscure but excellent offering from Sony","reviewText":"This game is odd; and I mean weird.With that said, I really enjoyed this game for the following reasons- The graphics, the mood and the sound. Here's my review-Graphics-The first thing I noticed about this game was the graphics. Normally, PS2 doesn't impress me in the graphics department, but this game looks amazing. Especially considering the fact that it doesn't have jaggies, the character models are smooth with a filter applied but still look unique looking and the faces look like real people including the lifelike expressions. Ps2 pulls this off effortlessly but at somewhat of a cost.At times, I felt a if the filter applied to the graphics hid areas where nothing was applied, but did so in such a way that it really doesn't matter.There were slight cases of slowdown at times; but not much.Most areas take place in strange places like Suicide Forests, deep in the woods, or in tunnels, and they are imaginative. Overall, the game looks fantastic.Sound-I really liked the sound. It was so eerie. Including when you mind-tap someone and hear their guttural breathing. The music is more like moody ambient volume that envelopes everything. The sound effects were also a nice touch being that the gunshots sound really nice; especially with a sound system.Gameplay-The story to this game is odd; and I won't spoil it. But I will say Siren has a way of completely ripping the immersion away from you. A prime example of this would be the fact that there are too many characters going through too many things at one time. It's likely that you will play through two parts of a chapter with one set of people or one person that really tests your mettle, only to be introduced to a completely different play style and set of people altogether. This was somewhat of a mood killer in my honest opinion. But the mood that this game sets is truly unique amongst any game. In fact, this game defines Survival Horror and you will have to be extra careful with ammo or when looking around for a weapon such as a stick or obstacle being that there's no way to truly kill enemies. Instead, you they stay down for a limited time while you try finding a way around them or out of the area. These missions range from survival single missions to escort missions which can be extremely difficult. Once or twice I actually lost my partner and had to reload the level.So basically, Siren is a survival horror game but it's biggest problem which I'll speak about now is the fact that the control is not good for this game. Aiming a shot at an enemy with a sniper rifle was an absolute nightmare. In fact, I died more times on a sniper mission than I did with any other mission.I love how the mood is set in this game and it really oozes that Japanese horror factor containing less conventional horror elements rather than the usual &#34;run from a killer/teen slasher&#34; vibe.Siren is a very unique game and should be included in any PS2 collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"If this isn't a masterpiece, I don't know what is.","reviewText":"It's been hailed as the greatest Resident Evil game ever, and even as the greatest survival horror game ever...can these claims possibly be justified? Well, after playing it, I would have to say...yes. All right, maybe it's not better than the first Resident Evil in terms of conceptual perfection...that game will forever hold a special place among horror fans. But in terms of how the sequels and general clones of that series have turned out, I would say this one tops them all.As the back of the box puts it, forget survival horror, and forget zombies. By the time Resident Evil 4 was on the cards, it's creators must have seen the fun that people playing \"Devil May Cry\" were having and decided that the RE gamers would enjoy some similar all out action, because RE 4 is a perfect blend of that game and the original Resident Evil elements. So what's different? Well, remember in the first game how scared you were when that first zombie lurched down a corridor towards you, and then in Resident Evil 2, how scared you were when that group of 6 or 7 burst into the gun shop to make a meal out of you...? Well you'll soon be in a whole new world of danger in this game.Right from the start, you know you are in for something special. Playing as good old Leon Kennedy from RE2, you are dumped outside a small rural community and quickly introduced to it's freaky inhabitants...not zombies but seemingly possessed, homicidal villagers. After encountering two or three on a woodland path, you'll already be thinking \"these zombies are a bit too clever for my liking\", but just wait, because a mere 20 minutes or so into playing time, the game plays it's first major trump card as you reach the outskirts of a ramshackle village. There's no choice but to enter and getting spotted is unavoidable. What follows is truly breathtaking gameplay, as, from all corners of the enviromnment, crazed figures start emerging, all armed with pitchforks, axes and flaming torches, and all heading towards you! Run into a small house, and you get the option of pushing furniture over the doors. Run upstairs and look for escape, only to find that they are lifting ladders up to the windows and climbing in! You can push the ladders down but they only pick them up again...and then, as you start to dash from one window to another to keep them at bay, you hear a crash from downstairs as the blockades break, and before you know it they are inside the house and coming up the stairs. Panicking yet? Wait until you see the one with the sack over his head weilding a huge buzzing chainsaw that can kill you in one hit. It's nothing short of brilliance to pitch you against such an onslaught and see if you can handle it. There are no tricks or rules for beating this scenario, it's purely up to you, so use your wits. Run away, climb up the church tower and pick them off, set fire to them all with grenades, you can try anything you like and the game will probably let you do it. It took me two or three tries to make it through this set-piece alive, and then, I realised I had been having so much fun that I reloaded the game and did it all again a few times more, until Leon was a slick machine causing maximum damage at lowest cost to his own health and ammo. Totally awesome, and yet a sequence like this, that would form a climactic centerpiece of many other games, is merely the opening battle.So what next? Well, things just carry on in this vein of excellence and the action hardly ever lets up. Getting past the village leads to other rural settings like a farm, a lake, a quarry and a cemetery, amongst other things, and each new environment seems to be teeming with life - all of it trying to end yours! After what seems like hours, you will eventually find yourself in front of an impressive castle, and once inside, the second major playing field of the game begins, where you find yourself roaming vast chambers and battling scores of cowled monk-like enemies who are no less adept at fighting you than the villagers outside. Notice I said the second location - not the last - because after the castle comes still more, as Resident Evil 4 is an absolutely gigantic game. I can't go on to detail all the locations of the game,. as this review would take forever, plus it would also spoil the plot for newcomers too much, but be aware that your adversaries don't get any easier, and certainly no less numerous. You'll soon be facing snipers with crossbows, flaming catapults, and thugs sporting heavy duty gatling guns and cattle prods (yeoowch!), plus the game has subverted the idea of a well-paced head shot gaining you a swift victory - watch in later stages as decapitated villagers stand up again and bear down on you again with tentacles and flailing razor blades sprouting from their bloody neck stump...!As for graphics, things couldn't be better. Leon looks realistic enough, and the locations are gorgeous, but it's the enemies that really steal the show. The villagers look like real people! Male and female, they all point, snarl and shout at you in Spanish (I think!) as they approach with weapons at the ready. They're no slouches, either, and will also dodge aside if they see you aiming a gun at them for too long. Luckily the weaponry at your disposal is pretty tasty; you'll have the standard handgun, shotgun and magnum of course, but say hello to the the sniper rifle, sub-machine gun and of course the trusty knife, which has finally been awarded a place as a worthy weapon, as you can now lunge and do some pretty severe damage any time if the enemy is close enough. And it is permanently equipped, so you just use a different button for a knife attack, whatever your current weapon. Not to mention that all the weapons can be upgraded and improved by spending money (that you pick up from dead enemies or find by smashing crates) with \"merchants\" who crop up every so often, usually just before or after an important scene. This is a new aspect for the game, and one that is definitely borrowed from \"Devil May Cry\". You can even increase your maximum health with rare Yellow Herbs that complement the game's famous staple of Red and Green Herbs for health recovery.I honestly have to say that I could not believe just how big this game was. Even before the end of disc one, RE4 has crammed in more gameplay than a complete play through of any of it's predecessors would give you. There's hardly anything that it falls short on. Bosses? Plenty of them, and often more than one per chapter. Variety? You'll find lots of diversions here, such as playing sections unarmed as Ashley,  who is Leon's companion for some of the time (think Sherrie from RE2), riding vehicles such as mine carts and trucks while enemies throw themselves at you, and escaping near-death scrapes by following \"emergency\" button prompts on screen (think \"Shenmue\"). Plus loads I haven't mentioned...oh, just wait for the crane that you control briefly, which picks up enemies and drops down them a chute like you were trying to win a cuddly toy - a real hoot!I've only got a few tiny niggles, which are firstly that Leon still cannot move while aiming! Sure, the old fixed controls have finally been scrapped for the great new \"follow behind\" viewpoint, but I played the PS2 game \"Cold Fear\" before this one - which supposedly mimics this game's fighting controls - and in that one Tom Hansen could aim his gun and still walk...whereas Leon Kennedy becomes rooted to the spot every time he readies his weapon...imagine the fun of being able to step back or strafe while keeping your gun sight trained on an enemy's head. Why not, Capcom? However, kudos to them for scrapping the elements of the previous games that fans did not like, such as item chests that share the same contents wherever you find one, and the typewriter ribbbons needed to enable saves (they are now unlimited - hurrah!).But one last thing - the final battle has such a huge dose of deja-vu that I though for a minute I was right back at my PS1 all over again...you'll see what I mean.This review is going on too long, so I'll stop. Last thoughts are - yes it's worth buying, and yes it's the best Resident Evil and/or survival horror game since the PS2 was invented. As a Gamecube owner I'm lucky to be playing it long before it comes out for the PS2 - if you can't wait for that, simply buy a Gamecube. I'm surprised if any true RE fans haven't got one already, as they would also be missing out on the excellent original remake and RE Zero as well...but the console is worth owning for this game alone.

Should come as no surprise, it's not meant to be a new PSP, just a smaller PSP.- No touchscreen. See above.- Buttons feel cheap. I've read reviews saying the buttons had a nice, responsive feel. I think they just feel like cheap plastic. I also really wish they would protrude more, seeing as how they are already indented on the console and could afford to stick out more.- No HDMI or VGA adapter. This is a big bummer for me. I love playing my PS3 on my 23\" monitor because I feel like the image gets too stretched out on a HDTV. This is my personal preference though.- L and R don't click. For the most part, I like the L and R button designs. The only problem for me is that there isn't a satisfying \"click\" when you press down on it. It's just a soft cushion. I would definitely like to know for sure that I have pressed it down properly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2011"}

There isn't much of a story except that you are 15 year old Jimmy Hopkins, dumped off at a private school after your mother married some rich old man. Interacting with kids does nothing except you can get kisses from girls (and even certain guys) which improves your health bonus. That was kind of disappointing as in you don't have the ability to affect the storyline, but for an older game I guess it's somewhat expected.Classes are considered mini-games, and passing each session grants you some bonus. The bonus can be good such as unlocking a special bmx bike (shop class), kissing health bonus (art class), prank weapons bonus (chem class), or accuracy bonus (forgot which one--gym?). They can also give really useless rewards such as ugly clothing items from math or music class.Everything becomes repetitive after a while of playing, and the only real highlights are the missions. Bullying people doesn't really do anything or affect how people treat you, except get you into trouble with prefects. You can do whatever you want...skip class, go shopping for clothes or change your hair, do part-time work for money, race bikes, play games at the carnival, etc.Bully is fairly long so you definitely get your money worth. I haven't had any problems with the game freezing or glitching but I'm about halfway through now.

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

Simcity 4 is not as good or easy as 2k but much better than 3k. In Sc4 you play the mayor and design the city. At first you built a power plant, a water pump and put some low industrial, low commercial and low residential zones. People will start comming to your city. You have to remember things like, People do not like to live near a factory, They like to live near parks. Put more parks and you get more people. Make sure that people are happy and paying their taxes. There are a very few changes. The best thing is that now you choose a city from a large country map and you can be the mayor for neighbour cities too. Another good thing is now you can charge different taxes for people living in high, medium or low zones. I have Win98SE, P4 2.4Ghz, 512mb Ram and a GeforceFx.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Blu \"I buy and share my experiences!\"","summary":"Reasons to buy a Wii U","reviewText":"The Wii U (unlike the Xbox One & the PS4) allows for free online gaming. It's not a big deal, but it should be appreciated because if you already pay for internet, no one should be milking you for more money to use it through a device that you bought from them in full (fair & square).The Wii U has multiple options to enjoy your TV, movies, sports and things of that nature without paying Nintendo extra for it. Again, you bought the device, it has the options, you aren't locked into paying more to continuously enjoy the thing based on aspects that should be free.A lot of great games are being released on the Wii U, and if you are familiar with Nintendo... they have one of the strongest IP libraries in the industry. Nintendo isn't trying to play that little exploitation game either.Let me tell you what the Nintendo Wii U does NOT do:- It doesn't require you to pay a monthly free- It doesn't have advertisements running in the UI- It doesn't use a camera device for target advertisement- It doesn't have 1st party games that are incomplete experiences for the purpose of selling day 1 DLC (that we've experienced thus far, and if they did, they'd get complaints too)Don't appreciate the system because you fear change in another company's console, appreciate it for trying to deliver without trying to be slick and milk you for as much money as possible. If you are barely getting by, yet you love online console gaming, get a Wii U. You won't have to wait until you have the money to play online, and even if you buy 2 consoles, get the Wii U & the PS4 so that you have a worthwhile variety of gaming experiences (Playstation+ is cheaper than Xbox Live Gold, and you get to play \"Free 2 Play\" games free online, use your Netflix service at no extra charge, etc.).Game without the TV on the Wii U, chat and have a ball while someone else uses the tv and you can basically buy 2 Wii U consoles for the price of one XB1. I have an Xbox 360, Wii, PC, and several other consoles so i'm not a fanboy of one console. I am a fan of gaming, and greed is a major problem that does nothing but hurt the gaming industry. I don't want to warp this review of the Wii U into an XB1 smashfest, but appreciate the consoles that do not serve as all out money machines for greed.The Wii U's games and types of games increase based on the consumer response, whether its 1st party or 3rd party. We, the people, make an impact on what we want. If something sucks and we don't support it, companies beware because its not good for business. Keep gaming alive, and protect it from those trying to exploit us through it!There are plenty of examples of companies making stupid decision on the Wii U, but they want to blame the console. If you remove features from a game and charge a similar price for that version... it's likely not going to sell that well. If you release a game on multiple consoles, and one version is nearly double the price... it's likely not going to sell that well.By the way, don't believe everything you see in the news and read online, because you may find that some of these journalist work for companies that have deals with a particular company.This is real:Microsoft has a long term deal with Viacom (inked back in 2007), and Viacom owns multiple companies and outlets like GameTrailers. Michael Pachter, who is usually always anti-Nintendo, works under this company and outlet.Make sense?So even if something is bad, with enough money it can be made to look good, while something generally good, can be made to look bad. If someone is impressionable, they will buy into a lie versus doing their own research. If the Wii U's dual screen gaming was so bad, why do other companies want to invest in having similar for their consoles, which includes 3rd party developers like EA developing games that utilize dual screens? Nintendo doesn't speak on it that often, but they are doing fantastic regarding sales and profit, look at the facts in regards to actual profit in regards to these companies and ask yourself why someone is saying something if it isn't true, and see if they have something to gain from saying so.This is a link to my Amazon online store, if you're interested (there are many items from games, to art supplies, etc.):B009AGXH64","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Siddiqui","summary":"An another great Assassin's Creed game.","reviewText":"Since it's release in 2007 the Assassin's Creed series has seen numerous updates such as new locations, historical figures, and characters. Desmond Miles, a bartender from New York, has gained the knowledge and skills of his ancestors Altair Ign-La'Ahad and Ezio Auditore da Firenze but now a new assassin must rise to help Desmond on his journey, this hero is Ratohnhak&eacute;:ton. He's better known as Connor, the son of a British immigrant and raised by his Mohawk mother, now caught between the struggle of the colonist who are spreading throughout the Northeast, the American Revolutionary Way, and his own people. Assassin's Creed III takes a lot of chances in both narrative and gameplay but overall creates a thrilling adventure for fans and newcomers.Assassin's Creed III sets you before, during, and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783. This brand new location and time period is absolutely teeming with things to do in the open-world provided. History comes alive as you climb ancient buildings, hide within the forest of colonial America, and sail throughout the Atlantic ocean engaged in sea combat. You're set to enjoy this world as you see fit and set up elaborate assassinations that end each chapter.Expect a long tutorial, Assassin's Creed III attempts to fully establish Connor's background from innocent child, lost teenager, and finally vengeful adult. Unlike past assassins Connor tends to be more stoic and cruel, but he won't be the only character you play as. Each character is wonderfully written and voiced, but unlike past Assassin's Creed games these characters feel distance. But once the back stories are fully fleshed out and limitations are removed is when you appreciate that the game provided you with this information. Throughout his journey Connor will need to interact and participate in significant portions of the American Revolution, like The Battle of Bunker Hill and The Boston Tea Party, in order to complete your real objective. But Connor has little interest in the fight for independence, his motives require him to take sides in order to track and eliminate targets on both sides, this is a fight between the Templar and Assassins.Since you will be playing as Connor with a large portion of this journey it's easy to forget that this is venture belongs to present day Desmond Miles. Desmond is now at the end of his adventure and must stop a global disaster. Unlike Assassin's Creed: Revelations these segments are mandatory but absent of the horrible first-person puzzles of Revelations and actually get to be a modern day assassin with the skills that he has acquired. By creating connections between both of these stories to reveal a expected truth about mankind.Assassin's Creed III is definitely the biggest and most ambitious Assassin's Creed game to this date. The story spans a series of years and seasonal changes dramatically alter the environment: forest covered in snow; fields rich with blooming flora. The streets of is equally stunning with people, noise, and activity injecting life into the artificial setting. These incredible marvels have a array of problems such as clipping textures in character models, environmental pop-ins, and graphical issues that make you wonder if the depth of field is actually a mask to cover these problems. But these are only minor inconveniences to a utterly stunning game.The developers at Ubisoft Montreal have turned this notorious branch of history into a open-world playground for you to explore. It's all about giving you assortment of acrobatic abilities and equipment to traverse a range of rooftops, hunt in the forests, and sail the seas during the Revolutionary War. These elements truly shine when preparing to assassinate major targets in the story missions by collecting information, locating a specific location, scouting the area, and finally killing them. Outside the main story you are free to explore to find pages of Benjamin Franklin's almanac, complete side missions, and to follow up to myths told by strangers. Outside that you can build and maintain a homestead by populating it with people that will provide you with equipment and products that you can use or sell using a caravan.The locations throughout Assassin's Creed III maintain the same high quality that the series is known for. You'll travel to a large amount of areas but will spend most of your time on the streets of Boston and New York. Within the frontier you will find a large amount of animals that you can kill and skin for usable material. Unless you are invested in the homestead economy hunting is mostly practice for sneaking and killing.The controls of Assassin's Creed III has been simplified. The parkour has been improved to allow for quicker movement through obstacles that look impressive. New climbing techniques such as tree hopping and automatic climbing abilities make traversing the environment on any plain easier but not without its faults. Like past Assassin's Creed games you can still find yourself unexpectedly jumping off ledges and foolishly running up walls without anything to hang on to. Combat has been refined to include the classic parry and counter system but now has some brutal killing animations with each weapon you wield against man and animal. You don't have to use a manuel lock-on mechanic and parry attacks when an indicator appears overhead an enemy. Each attack has a significant amount of weight to it, making each strike feel less like transparently fast and unnatural.Connor may be a skilled warrior but the best assassins take to the shadows and strike without notice. Connor automatically crouches in tall grass and peak around corners. These are put to the test during high-profile assassinations which require you to kill targets without being found. There are stealth, parkour, and combat issues that were previous left as a minimal in games but show up frequently. Minor glitches such as character animations running in place or animals running in place. Assassin's Creed III mask these muddy issues with its large amount of content and incredible presentation. This is especially present in the naval battles when waves bash against the ship and crew members hard at work. In some missions you can board enemy ships and battle with the crews.Multiplayer returns was first introduced in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and makes a return in Assassin's Creed III with new modes, characters, and customization options. Traditional modes such as death-match, team death-match, and capture the flag. New modes include domination and wolfpack which you and allies kill computer targets in a synchronized manner to gain the highest amount of points possible. While objective games offer variety to the mix the idea of hunting your target while avoiding being killed is still highlighted throughout multiplayer games.As you complete matches and complete challenges you gain experience points to level up and Abstergo points to purchase new abilities and cosmetic items. Each agent has a collection of specific clothing and weapons that can be obtained by leveling and earning Abstergo points or you can purchase these upgrades using micro transactions. The multiplayer is a decent treat for those seeking to test these assassin skill against other opponents but won't have you straying far from other multiplayer titles.Assassin's Creed III is an incredible game that attempts to push the boundaries of previous titles in the series. It achieves so much but unfortunately this leads a moderate degree of inconsistently due to lackluster missions, training assassins, and graphical hiccups. The voice-acting and soundtrack maintain the same high quality as other Assassin's Creed games, so whether you tracking a target or just exploring the area your eyes will be treated. Assassin's Creed III takes a lot of chances and brilliantly constructs a story that will have you playing until you reach the end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"It had great potential, but ultimately fell very short.","reviewText":"STORY:The modern-day events of this game take place immediately after the end of Revelations. For the majority of the game, you play as Connor, a Native American Assassin who fights in the American Revolution. It's very cool to interact and see famous historical figures of the time, and if you're a history buff like me, you'll love the story of Connor. You also play a small portion of the game as Haytham Kenway, Connor's British father. His section of the game is especially interesting, as Haytham was a cool, likable character. Connor, however, was not as good of a character. He's very bland and dull most of the time, not having much of a personality. He's fine to play as, but it's ultimately the supporting characters who carry the story of the game. Unfortunately, you're forced to play as Desmond a few times during the game. I've never really liked Desmond or his story all that much, and I loved the way that they did it in Revelations. His gameplay was completely optional, but if you liked Desmond and wanted to invest some more of your time into his story, then you could. In this game, however, it is not the case. You're forced out of the Animus to play as Desmond at some points in the story, and while these mandatory missions, while brief, are a very annoying pause in the engaging story of Revolutionary America. Unfortunately, the ending absolutely stinks in this game. It was just so abrupt! and it wasn't a cliffhanger-level abrupt like in the past games: the story of Desmond Miles, who we've been playing as since the very first game in the series, has an absolutely awful ending. This, combined with many other flawed aspects of the game, makes me believe that the game was extremely rushed. Like I said in the title, Ubisoft could have made this game a whole lot better, but they rushed it out and it was very disappointing.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay in the game is much different from the previous games, and the changes are a really mixed bag. Some of the new additions, such as hunting or trading on the Homestead, are useful, but the past games' versions of these were much better. Ubisoft tried to fix many things that were fine in the first place, such as renovating shops and collecting your income from the bank. Combat has been simplified a lot more, and some strategy is required for some enemy types (this prevents you from counter-spamming every single enemy in the game). While it's very fun and much simpler to do, the other games just seemed to do it better. Switching weapons is very annoying here. The other games got it perfectly! Here, you're taken to a huge menu where you have to scroll through many items to select your weapons. This can be extremely frustrating if you're in a tight spot and you need to switch weapons very often, very fast, because the whole menu transition disorients you for a second or two. Notoriety has been changed slightly as well, now being represented in three levels rather than one percentage. You can travel to four main zones in the game, although you'll only really be spending a lot of time outside of main missions in one or two. There are many annoying bugs with the game, and these can be really frustrating. Sometimes, even when your Notoriety level is incognito, guards will randomly come attack you while you're on your way to a mission. It's easy to deal with the initial 4 or 5 that come charging at you, but you can be stalled up to about 20 minutes because wave after wave of guards just come out of nowhere after you eliminate one. This is good if you just want to slaughter guards, but when you're simply traversing the city or on your way to a mission, it can be very frustrating. For the most part, the game world looks great, but there are MANY graphical errors and bugs. Most of the time, these aren't game-breaking, but sometimes it's annoying when your objective is to follow someone and then have them stand completely still for five minutes. While for the most part, the majority of missions in the game are good, many of them just aren't that good. There are too many tailing missions, and it can be frustrating to do them when your target is moving very slowly. Some of the mission constraints are near-impossible, and some of them were just bad level design rather than an actual challenge. It's also frustrating when you spend many hours crafting the best weapon in the game and then not being allowed to use it because the optional objective says otherwise. A lot of the missions don't require much strategy at all, just memorization of a specific route to take. This can be very annoying, because in some missions there's 1 or 2 ways to do it right an a million ways to do it wrong and fail. Naval combat, however, is probably one of, if not the, strongest aspect of the game. You can purchase upgrades for your ship, select missions, and look for treasure in the Caribbean. The combat itself is extremely simple and fun, and I'm glad that Ubisoft is incorporating it much more into the next game. The free-running in the game, while made simpler and faster, is also very flawed. Sure, it can't be absolutely perfect all the time, but it's very annoying when you're trying to scale a large building and then you jump off because you were holding the stick in the wrong direction.OVERALL:While this game had the potential to be an awesome game, it fell very short of most fans' expectations. Most of the side missions are really pointless and boring, and they didn't add anything at all to the game. While the supporting cast of characters was very interesting, our main protagonist is nowhere near as likable or interesting as Ezio and Altair. Many missions are flawed and/or tedious, and Desmond's sections are just frustrating. The story is great for the most part, but the ending completely ruins it. In the end, I feel like this game was very rushed. If Ubisoft had waited a few months, maybe a year, to release the game, then it could've been much, MUCH better. I still recommend this to fans of the Assassin's Creed series, but it isn't even nearly as good as the previous installments.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2013"}

Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"Completes Diamond and Pearl!","reviewText":"Once again Nintendo has pulled off a classic. Pearl and Diamond were great Pokemon games for the DS, and now, to complete the pyramid, comes Platinum. This game compliments the first two as others in the series has done (such as Yellow for Red & Blue). For some, this game could be considered a minor makeover of Diamond and Pearl, but Platinum has additional features that make it worth purchasing in it's own right.Pokemon are available in this version that you would need to trade for in the first two of the series, making it worth getting for that fact alone. Not everyone has friends they can trade with, so this extra will provide Pokemon for them they couldn't get otherwise. Graphically, there's some additional tweaks that improve areas, and the sound quality is as good as ever. the day/night cycle helps you to catch Pokemon that only appear at certain times.Since I haven't fully explored this game yet, I can only give opinions on where I've gotten to at this point, but I have no regrets in purchasing this game. For the casual gamer, there might not be enough incentive to spend another $35, but for Pokemaniacs, this will be a worthwhile investment until Soulsilver and Heartgold arrive next Spring.Here's a summary breakdown:Pros:Another great Pokemon game for the DS with additional Pokemon and featuresExcellent graphics and soundSome new areas to exploreCons:Same old formula might put some people off from buying this titleThose casual gamers who already have Pearl/Diamond won't want to invest againNot enough additional features to warrent purchasing to someReally only enough content and diversity for Pokemaniacs to buySummaryIn all, if you love Pokemon, you should add this to your Pokemon titles for your DS. Enough diversity and gameplay will keep you coming back for more, and this will tide you over until the new Pokemon games for the DS arrive in 2010.

For fans of Mario and role-playing games alike,Super Mario RPGshouldn't be missed.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Mario's first and finest RPG for the SNES","reviewText":"First and foremost, I am not an RPG fan. I never jumped on the Final Fantasy bandwagon. I don't care for the Dragon Quest games. I have never played Chrono Trigger or any of its remakes. But I have to admit that all of the games I mentioned helped usher in a major video games category that has been around since the days of the original NES. So when word broke out that Nintendo and Squaresoft (now known as Square Enix) were working together on a RPG game featuring Mario & using Final Fantasy style game play, many gamers were immediately excited and waited to play this masterpiece. And so, in 1996, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars was released on the SNES and was and still is one of the best RPGs. If you haven't played this game yet, you are missing out.The game starts out with you controlling Mario running off to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser. During your fight, a sword-like enemy crashes through the roof of Bowser's castle and everyone gets blown sky high in different directions. After watching a few scenes and reading text, you find out a new enemy is out to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and it's up to Mario to find Princess Toadstool and defeat Smithy, your new rival. And that's basically how the story begins. You control Mario as you make your way through different sections of the Mushroom Kingdom, talk to different people, discover side quest missions and buying and finding various weapons and items for you and your party to use. That's right; you eventually befriend certain characters who join you on your mission and when you face off against enemies and bosses, you can use them during the fight. You can choose Mario and two other characters to fight your battles and swap out the other two characters with new characters (you meet 5 or 6 characters in all who join your party.) It adds to the strategy on how to beat the bad guys since each character has different strengths and weaknesses along with their own attacks and defenses that benefit a character or all 3 characters in play.The PROS: There is a very good reason on why this game was and still is cherished as one of the finest RPGs ever made for the SNES. It's that every element of this game works well and compliments each other. The graphics feature colorful backgrounds and scenery & fully rendered characters all under a \"bird's eye view\" set in 3/4 overhead perspective. The sounds, including audio tracks and sound effects, fit the mood nicely. The story is told very well, as if you are playing a Final Fantasy game mixed with the Nintendo brand humor that will have you laughing at what happens. Plus, this game is loaded with references from past Mario games and nods to Final Fantasy games (including an appearance from a well known enemy from the Final Fantasy world, if you know where to find him.) The game play is taken entirely from past Final Fantasy games so anyone who has played them will feel right at home; new RPG players like myself will catch on pretty quickly. That's because the controls are easy to use once you learn all the buttons and pay attention to prompts in the game on how to fight, etc. This game is also long and challenging so prepare to fight, fight and fight and completing all of the side quest missions extends the life of the game after you beat the main story.The CONS: The only thing that I could say here is that this was one of the last batch of Super Nintendo games that was released as the Sony Playstation was making huge waves and the world was waiting for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo's next console, to be released. It's not a knock on the game itself at all but it was just the timing of its release that makes it unique.You cannot go wrong with getting this game. It made guys like me, who don't like RPGs, take a chance and play this game. If you're tempted to find it, I wish you good luck because there aren't many people willing to part with it and for those who are selling it are asking for a pretty high price. You can download this for your Nintendo Wii for 800 points ($8.00), which is a pretty sweet deal. I have the original SNES cartridge and absolutely love this game. You will too and you can find videos of this game in action so check them out first if you want to. ********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

Accompanied by Aika and Fina, he will wage battles against savage monsters, evil pirates, and a powerful enemy nation.Skies of Arcadiadelivers a brilliantly animated cast of characters, monsters, and villains, along with astounding 3-D graphic environments and a wonderfully scripted story line.","reviewerName":"Poo Poo Pooey","summary":"the best rpg on DC and one to contend with FF","reviewText":"The storyline is familiar and conventional. An evil dictator is looking for a weapon of mass destruction and our would-be hero is out to save the world. Players take to the skies above and the dungeons below in search of mystical items and rare treasures. They battle strange looking monsters and evil henchmen in turn-based combat, becoming more powerful fighters/spellcasters in the process. Eventually, they gain enough power to stop the bad guys and save the world. Theoretically.Even with this basic premise, Skies of Arcadia manages to develop an interesting plot with lots of twists and turns to keep things interesting. This is one tale that RPG fans will thoroughly enjoy.Now if Skies of Arcadia was an average game, I could just throw in a few words about graphics and the review would be done. But alas, the Skies hold much more treasures for role-playing fans. Shall we commence with the goodies?In order to boost the typical RPG combat to a higher level, Skies of Arcadia includes element-based weapons. Upon obtaining a Moon Stone, characters will be able to imbue their weapons with elemental properties based on color. Think of it like Magic: The Gathering (the card game) or even Pokemon. For example, yellow (lightning) weapons have an advantage over green (earth) creatures. Usage of each weapon type also boosts that character's equivalent magic powers. Use your blue weapons a lot and you'll boost your blue magic skills that much faster.The world in which Skies of Arcadia takes place is large, with plenty of places to explore. As a sort of side quest, players can freely explore the world in their airship and discover hidden lands and landmarks. Hunting for these secret locations can be fun on their own and info regarding the discoveries you make can be sold to the local sailor's guild for a nice chunk of change.Adventures in the sky lead to another take on the turn-based combat system. Sky battles can happen with ships instead of swords. Players enter a string of commands and then watch as the crew carries them out. Occasionally, players will also have to decide the ship's strategy, such as closing in on the enemy or keeping a safe distance away. While these ship to ship battles are a bit more interesting than the hand to hand combat, they tend to be drawn out way too long.Eventually, when Vyse gets a ship of his own, you'll also need to find a suitable crew. Gaining specialized crew members, such as a gunner or engineer, will boost different parts of the ship. So you won't just be hunting for treasure and new lands, you'll also have to be on the lookout for new crew. There's just so much to do within the world, you'll never be stuck in any one place doing just one thing.Within the dungeons you'll also come across a few puzzles to solve. While none of these are particularly challenging, they offer some nice variety.The graphics are top notch. Skies of Arcadia shows off smooth and detailed environments as well as very solid anime-styled characters. Even the cool looking spells and super moves put on a dazzling display of color and light.Surprisingly, bits of audible speech are thrown in every once in a while. The voices are cheesy at best, but it was nice of them to give it a shot.The most enjoyable aspect of Skies of Arcadia is the way the game flows. RPGs that follow the typical dungeon/town/dungeon pattern get really dry and boring. In Skies, the story, as well as the ability to freely explore the map, move the game along at a brisk pace. Even the dungeon expeditions move along nicely. You won't have to endure level after level of similar looking environments, desperately looking for the next save point. With this type of gameplay, you'll never feel like you're stuck in one place for a long time.So whether you're a classic RPG gamer or a newbie to the genre, you're bound to have some fun with Skies of Arcadia. With a great presentation and a well-developed story, this is definitely not a game to miss9.6 / 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2001"}

In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look.

I certainly paid more than what it runs now but it was a gift and one in which I use as well.The combination of the Zapper and Link's Crossbow Training was well worth the much higher price I paid. The Zapper is only a plastic shell for the Wii remote and the Nunchuck and is very tough plastic and a well thought out design.It is very straight forward on the placement of the remote and nunchuck and if you have those rubber covers from the charger stand, I found I had to remove them to make it fit right, but it works for me.This item will take some practice for sure and thus why it is fun as you'll screw up allot or loose allot possibly at first until you get use to it and learn how to move and hold best for yourself.The bundled game, \"Link's Crossbow Training\" is multifaceted and exactly what's needed to give the player practice using the Zapper.

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Talitha Snyder","summary":"i hate this game. so scary. your werehog at night. i want cole selling this game right now. do not get this.","reviewText":"this game sucks.

See my detailed thoughts below.+ The visuals are excellent, although not quite as sharp as Uncharted. The production value is quite high and it's evident that a lot of attention to detail was put into this game.+ Controls are very nice and smooth and are customizable in terms of sensitivity, which is very good.+ Level design is impressive. Maps feel very large for the most part.+ The VAN-Guard \"perk\" system is pretty cool, but they take a long time to charge up.+ Audio for this game is on par with some of the best motion picture scores. Nicely done.- I experienced some stuttering but not a huge deal.- Checkpoint system in Campaign mode may be one of the biggest complaints that I have with this game. You can manually get checkpoints by visiting a Blackjack crate, but that breaks the flow of the game. You CANNOT save during a mission which I think is a bad design decision. While it's true that you can get to a checkpoint and put the Vita in sleep if you don't want to continue, this does not solve the problem of changing games in the middle of a long mission. In campaign mode, most missions take between 20 to 30 minutes so I see this as a drawback.- The ending was somewhat of a letdown. I was hoping for more of an epic battle but oh well, maybe it will be better next time.+/- Weapon selection is diverse but it's hard to distinguish between the different weapons in terms of performance. May or may not be a big deal depending on your personal opinion.+/- 4 vs. 4 multiplayer is somewhat disappointing given that at times it's hard to find enemies with such as small group.All in all, despite its flaws, KM remains one of the best Vita games I have played, and will likely stay in my console for many weeks to come.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Winston Fraser \"Arcade Bee\"","summary":"This is no fun!","reviewText":"This game makes me mad, i have played Resident evil 0,2,4 and code Veronica so i had different expectations from this game, the graphics are great and the puzzles keeps within the Resident evil tradition.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"postman","summary":"Okay, I'm convinced 343","reviewText":"I was skeptical, like most, about buying this game. 1, because it was made by a new developer and 2, Halo 2 AND 3 was a disappointment for me. I didn't like Halo 2 at all and Halo 3, although better than 2, did not live up to the expectations of the very first Halo which by far is the best Halo in my opinion.I read some reviews for Halo 4 and watched some gameplay footage of it on YT. It looked pretty good, but I still wasn't sure. I could not rent the game because it would take FOREVER to become available so after a little bit of thought I decided to go to my local game store and plop down the $60 bucks it cost. I knew if the game sucked, I would never buy another Halo game again and I can just trade it in for credit and use that for Black ops 2 instead. It looks like I won't need to do that.This game is awesome. I really enjoyed it. Although, not to the level of gameplay enjoyment that Halo combat evolved had, its still better than 2 and 3. I never played Reach so I can't compare.The story in this game is very good and so are the graphics. The guns are very nice to use and the controls are very smooth without that jaggyness I felt when I played Halo 2. All of the games soundtrack is new but it fits well with the game. The sound effects are very nice and sounds so realistic. If you have surround sound, prepare to be blown away. The covenant look quite different in this version. The small ones don't speak english anymore, or at least I could not hear it. The elite look much bigger than before and they too look quite different. Matter of fact the only covenant that looks similar to past Halo games are the Hunters.The new enemies they have, the Prometheans, are a much better enemy than the Brutes in my opinion and the weapons they have are awesome. Yes, you can pick them up and use them along with the Covenant weapons although the plasma rifle is not in this version. They have another plasma rifle that is bigger, but still fires automatic rounds.As I said earlier the graphics in this game are absolutely sickening. I didn't know the 360 still had the power to pull off graphics like this. They look very good and there is no frame slow down either. The colors they use are beautiful and the animations are very smooth and almost life like.I don't want to reveal anything about the story, you just have to check the game out yourself. I recommend renting it first though. Even though I took a chance on this game,  I am satisfied. It is worth my 60 bucks. I don't play games online so I can't rate that feature. There is also a second disc with the game but I didn't get a chance to check that out either.343 is a good developer so far. I wonder what the next Halo game will be like on the next Xbox......","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYDEQ","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Ciriello \"AdWhois\"","summary":"Very different from regular Forza but tons of fun","reviewText":"I was not planning on purchasing Forza Horizon, but I was able to pick a copy up for $15 on black friday so I did. If you're used to Forza 3 and 4 it's going to take you a while to get used to the driving dynamics, the lack of mechanical damage, and the lack of tuning setups, once you do get used to it, it's great fun.I love the free-roam feature of Forza, to be completely honest I'm only through 60% of the campaign but I've spent well over a day playing Horizon. I could waste hours on end just driving around the map trying to set higher speed trap speeds (which get ranked against your friends, car club, and the whole world).Unlike past Forza multiplayers it seems they finally figured out how to make a multiplayer that works (for the most part). Where as in Forza 4 it would take 20 minutes just to find a lobby some times this one finds a game very quickly and the intermission is just 45 seconds. Another benefit of Forza Horizon multiplayer is the online Free-Roam, get together with up to 7 people (or find a public game) and accomplish group challenges together, getting 8 people to work together isn't always the easiest task however. If you have a strict NAT you can expect issues joining multiplayer games, like the previous Forza games.The final point I'll talk about is the lack of installation necessity. I install every xbox 360 game I buy, since I wanted to try this out as soon as I got it I never bothered to install Horizon and surprisingly it's been working flawlessly. No noticeable load times (if any) during free-roam and everything runs pretty smoothly.Forza Horizon is a fun game, it's not as in-depth as the other Forza's (no tuning, no mechanical damage) but you can still upgrade all the auto parts. If you've played and enjoyed Burnout Paradise I would most aptly compare the two, with the addition of real cars in Forza, Car customization, and the lack of the random crash function. Don't know if it's worth full price but for $30 or less it's a definite buy.Pros: Free RoamReal CarsGood Radio StationsRuns well without installOnline is much betterCons: No Tuning OptionsNo race selection mode (only way to race is to drive or teleport nearby on the map)Showcase eventsHope it helps!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

After losing 200+ hours of my time playing in the Wasteland of Fallout, I tried Fallout: New Vegas.  I was dissapointed with New Vegas, because even though it had all the basic elements of Fallout 3, it felt more like a large expansion than an truly new game.  Then a friend convinced me to play Bethesda's previous game, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.  I enjoyed Oblivion, but I couldn't get over the outdated graphics and ugly character models.  When I saw the trailers for Skyrim, I was very excited.  The graphics looked awesome, the characters seemed more alive and better animated, and the gameplay looked more refined.  I was a little worried because there were talks of streamlining the RPG elements, and usually that equates to dumbed down gameplay, and also Bethesda is notorious for having buggy games.  Fortunately, this isn't the case in Skyrim.If you haven't played an Elder Scrolls game before, the basic concept is you can be whoever you want to be.  This means total freedom, from what race you want to play, what type of combat and skills you want, and where you want to go and do.  There is a main story quest, which will take about 20-25 hours to complete, but it's completely optional.  The great thing about Skyrim is that if all you want to do is slay monsters and be the hero, the game has that.  But if you want to get jobs, make money, buy a house, get married, and live out a virtual life, you can do that too.  The game doesn't have an end, and it's completely non-linear.The game plays from a first person perspective, so anyone familiar with FPS games should have no problem figuring out the controls.  The combat feels more natural than Oblivion, but it isn't perfect.  There are still times where you feel like your sword is slicing through thin air even though you're hitting enemies.  The hit zone on enemies is pretty generous, so even though combat isn't as visceral as it could have been, it isn't an excercise in frustration like Dead Island.  Using arrows and magic is easy, and the aim is pretty accurate.  Even at low levels, your skills as a gamer have more impact on your aim than your character's stats.The graphics are really good.  They aren't Crysis 2 good, but then nothing is, except Crysis 2.  Anyway, it can easily stand among the best looking Xbox 360 games.  There are plenty of times where you'll be exploring the snow capped mountain ranges of Skyrim, and you'll just have to stop and admire the beautiful scenery.  Character models are a big improvement over Oblivion and Fallout 3, although they still look a tad creepy.  Conversations are more natural, and the game no longer pauses and zooms into character's faces when you talk to them.  The animations are pretty good, but still a bit stiff at times.  Nothing too distracting, but hopefully the next Elder Scrolls game will be better.  My biggest complaint with Oblivion was the graphics, so I'm really glad Skyrim is a huge improvement and much easier on the eyes.The sound is impressive in Skyrim.  One of the best aspects of Skyrim is easily the musical score.  It is simply one of the best game soundtracks ever composed.  The voice acting is pretty good, though on some rare occasions the voices are a tad weird.  The sound effects are good, and most sound natural.  When you're dealing with a Fantasy game like Skyrim, all of the sounds should sound like things you'd hear in real life.  For the most part, they do, but occasionally there are sounds that sound more \"video game\" than \"real life\".Story in Skyrim is what you make of it.  The main storyline is well crafted, but some of the side missoins can feel a little underwhelming.  The strange thing about an open world RPG like Skyrim is that the best stories, the ones that you tell your friends and remember for a long time after you're done playing, are the stories that you make by playing the game your way.  When you find a path off the beaten trail, come across a river and see a deer drinking on the other side, so you draw your bow in hopes of making a kill, when a giant spider jumps out of nowhere and chases the deer across a field and into the woods.  You give chase, running into the woods after them.  You fire an arrow into the spider's rear end, and it turns it's attention to you, spitting poison in your face.  Using a combination of fire magic and a sword, you slay the spider, and loot it's corpse.  Then you notice a bloody skeleton mounted on a wooden stake, and a little farther ahead a cave.  You explore the cave, and inside you find undead monsters guarding a long lost weapon of great power.  You claim the weapon for yourself, and now every time you draw that weapon, you think about that deer drinking water.  It's those unscripted moments that are truly memorable, because you made them your own.I mentioned earlier the bugs Bethesda is infamous for, and Skyrim is no exception.  My first time loading up the game, instead of the beginning sequence playing out, the characters just stood there and nothing happened.  I was forced to reset my game, but since then I've played about 60 hours and haven't encountered a single bug or glitch.  I've heard some people complain of bugs, but I personally haven't had any (besides the first), and none of my friends who play the game have had any either.  It seems more stable that previous Bethesda games, so don't let the possibility of bugs sway you from playing this excellent game.This game can be whatever you want it to be.  If you just want to play the main quest, there's nothing forcing you to play side quests.  But if you want to get the most from Skyrim, you can go out exploring every cave, reading every book, talking to every NPC, trying every potion, crafting every weapon, and losing yourself in the massive, endless world of Skyrim.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZ0SY","description":"","reviewerName":"TheTruthHurts","summary":"(Primarily) Technical Commentary...","reviewText":"7/10To begin, I'm here to help and offer my opinion...you're free to provide yours in repsonse, but let's keep the \"Crysis 2 is better than Crysis 1?  You're insane.\" comments to a minimum...not interested.  That said, while arguably stronger than Crysis (in my opinion, one of the most overrated games of all time), Crysis 3 simply doesn't generate anything approaching the level of energy and excitement as Crysis 2 (which, in my opinion, is one of the best pure-action FPS titles of all time).  The single-player campaign, comprised of seven stages (about half the number of Crysis 2), comes in at *under five hours*, and to be honest, by the end, I was looking forward to it being over so I could begin playing Dead Space 3 again (which, after completing the intro, looks much more interesting and engaging already...).  Visually, it is simply not the leaps and bounds beyond Crysis 2 (ultra, high-res) that we've been promised...it is certainly a noticeable iteration better, but there's no point in the game where you'd say \"wow...this really does blow away Crysis 2.\"  While the new de facto \"king\" of graphics, it simply isn't the \"revolution\" that critics have been labeling it as, and at no time was I \"startled\" or \"stunned\" (to quote a couple game critics) by what I saw, which was something only marginally more detailed and \"awesome\" (that's my own quote) than Crysis 2's graphics (again...assuming you've downloaded DX11 and high-res).  Which, of course, isn't to say that the art of the game isn't beautiful...it is, especially the urban jungle (literally), and which isn't to say that there aren't awesome graphical effects in the game (the water, and the refractions it causes onto nearby pipes, etc., are gorgeous) and that textures aren't noticeably improved (especially facial close-ups)...but overall, it's simply another bump up from what Crysis 2 accustomed us to, and I'd say it's underwhelming in comparison to the expectations raised by Crytek's videos (e.g. the tessellated vegetation, etc. [on that note, they've de-tessellated the bricks...all is once again flat]).I have two MSI 670 PE cards (more than 20x the GPU power of XBOX 360 [Xenos], as it were...), and I can confirm that Crysis 3 can more than max them out, even at 1080p, if TXAA is employed (take a look at the difference between FXAA and TXAA (high) when looking at blades of grass, for example...not hard to see why it eats so much GPU power).  With all settings on 'very high', at 1080p, with FXAA, I never encountered GPU limitation, though it did push 90% utilization at 60 fps from time to time (averaging somewhere in the 70% range).  That said, much like Crysis and Crysis Warhead (neither of which will ever use more than 36% of a quad-core CPU), this game is *massively* CPU-bound...forget about maintaining 60 fps throughout the duration of the game for at least two generations of CPU architecture.  Using a 2500K at 4.3 (no, 5.0 wouldn't make a substantial difference...read on), the game (and GPU utilization, in kind) drops to between 30 and 40 fps frequently (and lower, on rare occasion) (while GPU utilization drops to 40-50%, confirming CPU-limiting [I never saw CPU utilization above 70%...are we really still unable to make full use of a quad-core processor in 2013?)...and not for split seconds that are inconsequential, but right into the heat of battle in major sections of the game for minutes on end.  Unfortunately, it seems to happen as the game reveals its most graphically beautiful scenery (outdoors, primarily...must be the vegetation again...)...though I suppose that one might argue that this is logical given the amount of on-screen activity.  That said, this is not a problem that I've encountered with Crysis 2 (sure, there's a drop to the low 50s here and there...but below 30?  I think not...), despite nearly as much activity (minus vegetation) being present on screen at a given moment.  I can't speak for anyone else, but I generally find gaming at anything under 60 fps to be intolerable...but I guess it comes with the territory, in this case, despite finding it jarring and significantly denigrating to what should be the ideal Crysis 3 experience (not possible for three or more years).Aside from the technical issues, in playing through Crysis 3 a second time, I'm concluding that there's little within the game that's really very interesting, or worth playing through a second time for, at all (in stark contrast with Crysis 2, which I've played a dozen times and look forward to playing again).  Feel free to disagree, but the game has a very subdued feel to it, that, despite the implications of its dark environments (everything is shaded in by the foliage [trees grow up and out of buildings, creating a canopy over the landscape, etc.]), simply doesn't feel right in a Crysis game (which, in my mind, should be pure, undiluted action, energy, and excitement).  The music, in particular (excluding the opening and ending sections of the campaign), is also very subdued (oddly reminiscent of Assassin's Creed 2), and extremely weak in comparison to Crysis 2's awesome score (which absolutely makes a difference in the degree to which a game draws you in).  Form your own conclusions, but if you've spent $500 or more on GPUs recently to max this thing out (amongst other games, of course), prepare to be massively CPU-limited throughout major portions of the game, and prepare to potentially become unenthused by the game itself, as well, if you're expecting energy and pace on the level of Crysis 2, or any kind of true innovation.  At the end of the day, Crysis 3 strikes me as little more than a marginally graphically-enhanced, generally mediocre, Crysis 2 expansion pack that simply isn't really much fun to play (if this doesn't turn out to be the most disappointing game of the year, I'll be surprised); at the very most, simply to own the new \"king of graphics\" (but for nothing else), I'd value it at $20...spend wisely.Edit, 3/28: Crysis 3 may have just been usurped as most disappointing game of the year by Bioshock Infinite...eight hours in, and my conclusion is that it was a complete and utter waste of $60.  Man...2013's looking like a real downer for video gaming.  For shame...Edit, 8/13: Apparently, a patch was installed at some point during the past five months that boosts CPU utilization to near 100%...so now, with \"objects\" (geometry) set to \"low,\" I can finally almost maintain 60fps at all times.  Hurrah!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}

Join Mario as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he&#x2019;s done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Out of This World","reviewText":"Mario is a huge staple in gaming.  When a Mario game comes out it can't just be \"good\" it has to be \"great.\"  In the past, Mario games have defined the platformers of their generation.  From Super Mario Bros. over 20 years ago, to Super Mario 64 bringing platforming into 3D in a whole new light.  Super Mario Sunshine, however, did not turn nearly as many heads as Super Mario 64.  Understandable, seeing as how Super Mario 64 is a tough game to compare to.  Super Mario Galaxy does compare, though.  While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it serves as an example of why Mario continues to rule the platforming genre.Mario has never been a game to pick up for its storyline.  As usual, things are peaceful in the Mushroom Kingdom.  In this case, they're enjoying the star festival.  As usual, Bowser comes in and decides to stir up trouble.  He ends up kidnapping Princess Peach and once again its up to Mario to go rescue her.  In order to reach Bowser's hideout, though, he'll have to collect power stars to do so.  It borrows a lot from Super Mario 64 in the plot development, but this is hardly the same game.  Like all Mario games, the story is simplistic.  We've been saving Peach for over 20 years and it won't be stopping soon.  You do not pick up Super Mario Galaxy for its storyline.  It's all about the gameplay.Like every Mario game, Galaxy is easy to pick up and learn but incredibly difficult to master.  Through your travels you'll control Mario as you tackle the bad guys of the Galaxy.  Mario's basic movies are all here.  He can jump, triple jump and spin.  It's very similar to Super Mario 64.  The obstacles in Mario's way however range from Bowser's troopers to natural disasters like black holes.  Getting every single star can be a tough task.  Like the other Mario games in the past, though, it isn't necessary to get every single star in order to fight the end boss.There are also suits for Mario can wear in his travels.  There is the usual flower power and invincible star, but you'll also find new suits.  There's the bee suit, which lets Mario fly.  He can turn into a Boo and go through walls.  He can even become a spring.  Needless to say, there's a lot of variety in this gameplay.There are several Wii games where the motion sensor controls have either been overused or they feel downright tacked on as an afterthought.  In Super Mario Galaxy that's not the case.  The motion sensor controls are not overused, nor are they forgotten about.  From time to time you may find yourself rolling a ball around using the Wii remote like a joystick.  Or you might be surfing on a manta ray.  You'll shake the remote to execute Mario's spin move, and there's also a star you can control to pick up star bits and fire them off at enemies.There's also a multiplayer aspect to Super Mario Galaxy, but it's certainly not all that engaging.  Player 2 can use a separate remote to control a star and collect star bits and shoot them at enemies.  Player 2 can also hold enemies still for Mario and make him jump.  That's really all there is.  Nothing more.  It's interesting at first, but it's hard to shake the fact that player 2 just doesn't do a lot of anything.Visually, Super Mario Galaxy is a pretty good looking game.  By far the best the Wii has to offer.  The detail is just incredible and the environments are gorgeous looking.  There's also a great deal of attention done with the physics.  It's fun to just jump up and watch Mario get pulled into the gravitational pull of another object.  It's pretty cool stuff.  If there was anything wrong with Super Mario Galaxy's presentation it would be that the player doesn't have complete control over the camera.  The camera work isn't bad but from time to time there will be an object in your way.  Luckily, this doesn't happen often enough to be a problem.The game also sounds brilliant.  Easily some of the best music the series has ever had.  You'll hear remixed tunes from previous Mario adventures as well as whole lot of new stuff.  It's perfectly orchestrated.  There isn't a whole lot of voice acting in Super Mario Galaxy aside from Mario's shouts and screams and Bowser grunting.  This probably won't bother most players as there isn't much story in the game anyway.Super Mario Galaxy is a great game.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it has fantastic gameplay that is unmatched and unparalleled.  If you're a Wii owner, this is the game to get.Pros:+Strong and varied gameplay+Gorgeous looking environments+There's co-op play for those who want it+The game sounds really good+Tight intuitive controlsCons:-The multiplayer is not very involving-The player doesn't have control over the camera, which can be a burden in some spots","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"Christian Wheeler \"Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","summary":"A great controller at a great price","reviewText":"All three major game systems offer at least one wireless controller. But while wireless controllers for the other systems start at around forty dollars (and that's for the off-brand ones), Nintendo offers their name-brand Wireless controller for only a few dollars more than the standard Gamecube controller. This may be the best bargain available for any of the systems. The Wavebird is a nearly flawless accessory. It's only slightly larger (owing to the battery pack) and has the same button layout as the standard controller. Its forward range is somewhat limited (about 20 feet) but it suffers little or no fading of signal and control if one goes more than forty-five degrees to the left or right of the receiver (a common problem with all but the very best wireless controllers). Adjustable frequencies mean that multiple Wavebirds can be employed at once, so long as no one is using the same signal (there are twelve different ones, so this shouldn't be a problem). Its biggest drawback might be the lack of a rumble feature, but this is compensated by long battery life (due to the lack of an energy-devouring rumble feature). Using a standard set of batteries, I got more than a hundred and fifty hours of gameplay before a change of batteries was needed. And, the best thing of all: no cords to trip over. (How many of us have done that and ruined someone's game!) As both a gamer and a games retailer, I have to say this is one of the best controllers on the market of any type, for any system, and is highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Evan Eberhardt","summary":"How not to make a game","reviewText":"I loved the idea of this game.  The Horseman War in battle?  What a great concept.  Well, the concept is the only great thing about this game.  What the makers decided to do instead of making a pure fighting game was instead create a mutt of a game that incorporates WAY too many aspects, and, big surprise, hardly anything is done well.  Darksiders is basically a fighting/adventure/puzzle/exploring game topped off with a story that other than using a Horseman of the Apocalypse has no other bearings to the Book of Revelations or anything else from the Christian myth.  Yeah, does that sound like trouble to any one else?So, the fighting.  Oh boy, what a mess.  I am a Ninja Gaiden fan (1 &2) and consider these games the apex of how to make a fun fighting game.  Both of them compelled me to play all the difficulties, including Master Ninja, which is unbelievably difficult to accomplish.  But the fighting is so fluid and fun that the challenge is worth the effort.  Then there is a game like Darksiders that is the exact opposite of my beloved NG games.  The fighting schematic is so thin you will be bored within a couple hours.  War's sword is the primary weapon and you use the X button to control it (plus, some RB and direction pad moves).  The combos are all pretty short and become tiresome quickly.  You can purchase more moves (by collecting souls), but most of those were yawn inducing in no time too.  War also has a secondary weapon that is either a scythe or a glove.  The scythe is okay, but again the combos are very limited.  The glove, however, is a joke (and a dumb weapon idea).  On top of this, War also has a throwing star and a pistol (yeah, a pistol, with infinite ammo no less) for long range attacks.  Both are so weak though that they are essentially worthless except for very specific uses.  The enemy's AI is okay, but the fighting becomes SO repetitive that by the end of the game I was just running past battles.Then there is the adventure aspect of Darksiders.  This too was fouled up.  The controls are not very well made for this aspect and this was by far what I disliked the most about this game.  War has the sorriest jump of any game in recent memory.  War also has the sorriest double jump as well.  Plus, the game is notorious for having unresponsive controls when you jump from an edge and instead you just drop to your demise like an idiot (I must have fallen a couple hundred times, really annoying in general and insanely frustrating on some of the puzzles).  The game makers decided to add a winged feather option to float War down softly if need be after a jump as well (this feature is handy, but it does add yet another control to remember).  Then War also has a grappling arrow and a portal gun (plus the throwing star that is needed quite often) to make his way through the dungeons and landscapes.  The problem here is that War is so clunky that these maneuvers are often a battle of controls and do not feel intuitive (or fluid) in the least.  And there are so many tools put into use here that it simply overloads the game and bogs down any fun in the process.  Plus, War often needs to be in a closer 3rd person mode to do all this stuff (by clicking the right analog stick...I think, can't remember).  Then suddenly you are fighting and forget you are in the close in mode which is yet more annoyance.  Anyway, just suffice it to say that Prince of Persia was way simpler and more fun for an adventure game where lots of exploring is involved.  Heck, so was Crackdown for that matter (lots of running and jumping, but done in a fun and fluid way to keep one interested).The Puzzles.  Let's just say the puzzles were too easy or if not too easy, then made hard because you are trying to jump to a tough spot and keep falling or are hanging from the ceiling and something snatches you, etc.  More frustration than fun because of the clunky and way too complicated controls.  I typically do not like puzzles in any fighting games because they nearly always suck, and Darksiders is no exception.The exploring.  The world is decently sized in Darksiders with plenty to look at.  Too bad exploring it is such a chore since War isn't the least bit nimble.  Plus, this game falls into the worn out tactic of having to revisit areas as you acquire more tools.  It even has you go all over the place to find pieces for a required sword right before the end of the game.  Maybe it's just me, but I hate revisiting maps to explore areas you couldn't reach before.  It makes me feel like I am being forced to replay stuff I already did just so the makers can add extra game time.  Yawn.  You do get to ride Ruin, War's horse, at certain areas of the world, which is nice (although war's horse is supposed to be red according to myth legend, but it is black in the game).The story.  This is where I was really scratching my head.  I am not a Christian, but I enjoy some of the myths of the religion when used in fiction (the Exorcist movie for example).  Darksiders has no relation to anything from the Apocalypse myths that I am familiar with except breaking seals and War the Horseman.  There is heaven and hell, but they are mediated by a neutral third party called the Council that keeps the balance or something.  Huh?  I don't know who thought up the story of the game, but it isn't good.  Samael makes an appearance, and is a key player in War's journey, but I didn't quite get what he was doing in the story (he is the angel of death in Jewish lore).  It is like they decided to use War the Horseman, but then just made random crap up from there (including a huge Scottish blacksmith called Black Hammer that I think is a deity, maybe).  Anyway, you get the picture.  I just see a blown opportunity here to make use of a Horseman in a game.  And speaking of War, he is a paper thin character, given absolutely no depth at all.  Why do we care about our hero/anti-hero (I don't know which he is)?  Beats me.  Plus, the tone of the game is uber serious which only makes it seem that much more ridiculous.  A game like Bayonetta is also ridiculous, but that was done on purpose for the most part (plus, it is a tongue in cheek style).To sum up, Darksiders is trying to be way too many things and winds up being pretty bad at them all.  A jack-of-all-trades, master of none experience overall (except jack is too high a compliment...fool is more appropriate).  Bayonetta is a FAR more enjoyable game because its fighting engine is pretty decent and its controls are nicely done also.  Ninja Gaiden 2 blows this game away for its pure fighting, wicked gore, and combo depth (I highly recommend it, but only if you have patience because it is one tough mother of a game).  Prince of Persia is also superior for an adventure/explorer game.  I suggest you play these other games instead of this mish-mash misfire.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2011"}

The graphics are exceptional; the environments are breathtaking and even when there is a lot happening on screen everything runs very smooth.  The sound is also great too; it is Dolby Digital 5.1 and has a superb soundtrack with Rock/Alternative artists such as Jeff Beck, The Futureheads and WolfmotherThe game itself is built around a system which rewards you for performing tricks (a possible 80 different ones) by giving you `boost'.  To do the tricks is simple - you just push a button and a direction when you are in the air.  The more of a risk you take by staying in the air longer and doing the extra complex tricks - the better rewards you get.  You can then use the boost you get to go faster during the race.The element of risk when doing the tricks is really what makes the game a lot of fun.  When you succeed it is exhilarating and the tricks look spectacular.  If you fail, it is heartbreaking and you go smashing into the ground!  Either way it is a blast!The race side of the game is adrenaline-rushed and high speed so it keeps you on your toes all the time!The tracks themselves (30 in total) offer a lot of variety with everything from a airplane graveyard to coastal landscapes. The tracks also have alternate routes so if you take a chance to discover (even if it is by accident) then you could take minutes off your time.The only downside I felt with the game is its lack of originality.  Most of what happens in this game has been done before in other racing games.  I will however state that this game tries it's best to make up for this with the special attention it gives to every detail.I would say the standard game is moderately difficult overall but online play is a different thing entirely and really tough!  You play against a potential of up to 16 players and although this is a new game you would be surprised at some of the unreal tricks and fast times some of these players are already doing!Final Conclusion - I enjoyed playing this game, the action is intense and even if you are not an expert at these type of games, the game is very rewarding because the trick system is straightforward so you can get into it really fast.

It's Resident Evil 4 in a Doom 3 setting.  It's well-paced, gruesome, and legitimately made me jump out of my seat a few times.  I know that a game is scary when something surprising happens and my instinct is to RUN.  It doesn't matter that I have a flamethrower in my hands, I am getting the F&*@ out there there!The graphics are solid, and the style compliments the action very well.  Battling monsters is disgusting and satisfying.  The main combat mechanic revolves around blowing the limbs off of mutant space monsters.  You can pump bullets into bodies, but maximum damage is scored by blasting off arms, legs, and other unnamed appendages.  Every battle leaves behind a mess, and each slain monster feels like a real accomplishment.The control scheme of Dead Space is the best that I've experienced in a survival horror game.  There are a bunch of skills and abilities that need controller real estate, so there's a bit of a necessary learning curve - but once you get the hang of things moving then controlling your character is fairly fluid.  The movement isn't as fluid as your average first-person-shooter, but it's a step ahead of your average slow-paced scarefest.Dead Space's UI, or rather the absence of one, is another major step forward for the genre.  The default view is a typical over-the-shoulder camera, but the interesting thing is that there's no HUD at all.  A tube of blue liquid down the back of your character's space suit represents your life total.  Whenever you bring out a weapon, a small display appears on the model to give you information about your current ammo levels.Access panels and computers are interacted with by just moving towards them and pressing A.  If an info panel pops up, or you bring up the full menu then it appears as a 3D object (a full in-world textured quad) in the scene.  It's a bit tough to describe, but it really works.  Things are so much scarier creeping down a hallway all alone without even a HUD standing by your side.  As far as I'm concerned, Dead Space's UI should be the genre standard moving forward.The story is nothing special, but functional.  It's just typical sci-fi fare that pushes the action along.If this sounds good to you then pick up Dead Space!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Anarchy 99","summary":"Cheap fun!","reviewText":"How did this game fly under the radar, no exposure, not too many reviews?

{"product_name":"B0015HYPOO","description":"Logitech Driving Force GTPS3 racing gets real with the official wheel of Gran TurismoHold on to your seat. Designed from the pedals up for PLAYSTATION 3 and Gran Turismo, this racing wheel lets you feel every bump in the road, crash and tire spin with jaw-dropping realism. With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Paul Hemenway","summary":"I Can't Race With a Controller Ever Again","reviewText":"BACKGROUNDI've always been skeptical about buying a wheel for racing games. 100 bones to put down for a video game accessory is a bit much, right? Then I looked at my library of racing games for my PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, and I got to thinking how much more playable these games just might be with a wheel. After all, what fun is controlling a stock car or indy car on your computer with a Joystick or Keyboard anyway? And why is it that I can't seem to seamlessly go through turns and straightaways on my controller for my PS3 or Xbox 360? So I read the millions of reviews for this thing along with several other wheels out there on the market, and decided to plop the money down for this thing.WHAT I USE THE WHEEL WITHI play Grid and Formula 1 extensively on the PS3, and for PC it's the NASCAR series from EA and TOCA Racing 3. This wheel works phenomenally with these games. However, the wheel is only is as good as the game it's on. With that said some games you can't adjust the sensitivity and the force feedback like you can on other games. You can't tweek the wheel in some master hardware setting on the PS3. Everything is done in game. On the PC it's different. There is software that comes with the wheel to where you can set everything how'd you like it universally with every game. I've been treated just fine so far with the games I play for PC with this wheel.WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE WHEELWhere do I begin? This wheel is amazing. Really. I've been shaving lap times left and right on all my games. In one case I can actually just play the damn thing (Formula 1). I couldn't play the game at all with a standard controller without running into somebody or just completely spinning out. In fact, I contemplated selling it outright just because how frustrating it was to play. Now I can actually enjoy racing in that game, and be competitive against the AI for a change with this wheel. The ability to shift in two different spots is awesome. There are paddles located behind the wheel, or you can use the shifter to the side. The force feedback can get wicked crazy, and for me I've had to dumb it down on all my games just because of how powerful it is. The pedals are nice, and have a rough bottom edge so that they won't slide around on the carpet either. The wheel itself is a pretty good size; as it's just a couple inches short in circumference in comparison to my real wheel for my '08 Honda Civic. On the subject of the wheel, the grip of the wheel is solid as well. Sensitivity is nuts, and the ability to turn the wheel a couple times over is great, too. However, if you do have to turn the wheel that much, it's probably because you've spun out and you should just restart the race anyway. Overall, the wheel just feels well made despite the lot of plastic on this thing. Nothing feels like it could come apart if I were to jerk the wheel a certain way. I've had this thing for about a month now, and between myself and wife beating the heck out of this thing it still works like a champ. Oh, and my wife hates sim racing games ... until now. She loves the wheel, and I'm so happy that she can enjoy a racing game that doesn't involve Mario for once. I also love that I can use this wheel on both my PS3 and my PC without problems.MINOR STUFF I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE WHEELWhen I first tried to play the game Grid with this wheel it was unplayable. I came real close to giving up and going back to my controller. I read online to try and find fixes for this, and the results were mixed. Some said they gave up and said this wheel is not meant for Grid. Others said you have to take your time and tweak the heck out of it to get it to work. Well, I stayed patient. After a week of off and on tweaking, I managed to not only make the wheel playable, but I was beating my old times I incurred using a controller. But that's what I don't like: if I pay 100 bucks for something it should work right out of the box and it didn't. I had to mess with this thing for days before I could actually start to enjoy it. However, my persistence did pay off and now I have to play this thing at least once every other day. However, to set thing thing up is a pain. There are 3 cables: one for the pedals, one for the USB connection, and one for the power to the wheel. It takes some creativity to get the cables to go places without causing a tripping hazard for those not playing, and so that your cables aren't intervening upon your pedals, either. Plus, you have to find a table of some kind to hook the wheel up to. My wife and I don't have a coffee table, but we do have TV trays. So my wheel has to connect to a TV tray with me on the couch, and that is not a comfortable situation without some creative pillow placement. Don't even try using this thing on your lap ... just don't even think about it ... it won't work. Now using this at my Computer Desk is a different story. It sits perfectly there, and it takes up minimal room where the only thing I have to move out of the way is the obvious object that needs to be moved anyway: my keyboard. Oh, and then the obvious no-brainer MINOR reason not to like the wheel; it won't run on a 360, but you can blame Microsoft for that one. The Xbox 360 only runs with proprietary hardware made by/for the Xbox 360. So if you think you can play Forza with this wheel ... well you're out of luck.OVERALLOverall, this really has been a fantastic purchase. I never thought blowing a hundred dollars on something so trivial as a thing like this could escalate the amount of joy I get in racing games, but it sure did. However, you really have to be a fan of racing games to enjoy this thing, and you must be patient, because unless you plan on only playing Gran Turismo games with this thing, you're going to be spending an exorbitant amount of time tweaking this thing until you feel it's right. However, the experience you get in return is amazing. I don't know if it's realistic or not, because I don't race cars in real life. However, I do know that I think this thing is ridiculously fun to use with my racing games, and I do know that it's made playing them about 500% easier! Plus it runs on your PC, too!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Good Fun With A New Coat of Paint","reviewText":"I actually recommend buying this game since the Wii U pickings are very slim.  It does show off the new gamepad benefit as long as you have the players or you can play it on the gamepad without the t.v.  Usually it just involves creating blocks for your friends to jump on.  I don't think you are gonna be too disappointed with this game but you may not be overly ecstatic.  I think if you have a family you and your kids are gonna eat this game up and love your time playing.  Having a Mario game at launch is a good benefit and would be a shame if they didn't have one so its good its here.The fun is there in this new Mario game but the issue is its not really that new and quite familiar.  The fun factor is there and lots to be had in multiplayer.  The formula is there with the 2D Mario and for nostalgic purposes I find it very fun like the games of old.  I grew up with Nintendo and can appreciate how the games have come along.  Playing with other players is where this game shines and there is great fun to be had.  It will cause frustration if you are a serious player since your friends or family will get you killed intentionally or not.  I noticed my youngest daughter kept getting frustrated since sometimes it does get kind of competitive.The graphics are awesome and seeing Mario in HD is fantastic.  The colors pop off the screen and it looks fantastic.  I recommend anyone who loves Mario to check it out just to see.  Everything just looks great and the quality of the graphics are superb.  It is a step up from the Wii of course since that was SD and now we live in the time of the amazing HD.  The colors truly shine and looking at it I am always glad I got the Wii U just to see it.Sound is the normal Mario and if you played it on the Wii you are gonna be familiar with it.  The sound effects always take me back such as the jumping on the turtle shells or goombas and I am glad there are a lot of new sounds but also a good amount of old.This game just feels like NSMW 1.5 in HD.  I ran through the first two worlds in less than an hour and the levels are kind of short.  I think sometimes the game lacks substance and Nintendo kind of got to a point and said they thought it was good enough.  It feels familiar which is good but than again too familiar which isn't really a good thing.  I don't know if the formula is getting stale or I am just getting superb with Mario games but I found myself just running through levels.  Though some levels are challenging while others can be ran through in a minute or so, well that could be an exaggeration.I am not done with the game yet since I can't sit down for long periods of gaming but so far besides getting the big gold coins the game is kind of a cake walk.  I will say with others on the screen it is a little more difficult since you will get knocked around quite a bit into the enemy or fall into holes.  I don't want to deter your purchase or playing of it but this game is more like the Wii version with only a couple new additions.  You may feel like you're just playing the same game from before with a new coat of paint and and a couple of new additions.This is one of those games I think anyone can pick up, play and enjoy.  I didn't hate the game and I didn't want to come off like Nintendo or Mario could do no wrong but honestly it felt the same as always.  You might like that aspect or not but my honest opinion is its gonna be up to the individual to decide.  This is just my opinion of what I played which you might think I am wrong but give it a try and see.  There are enough reviews around to help people make up their minds.  If you have kids or friends this game will put you all in front of the t.v. and having a good time.Update:After playing this for a while I went with five stars instead of three simply from the enjoyment we are having.  The games difficulty does shoot up (though not by much) later.  So all in all just have fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

And it'll save you money!","reviewText":"I picked this game up maybe 2 months ago, and I think it's great!  I played Final Fantasy XI a few years back and had fun for a while.  About 2 months into it (FFXI), I hit a wall as far as progressing through the game.  Quests took way too long and the rewards were rather lame.  If you want to gain levels, you NEED a party (I barely made it to my low 20's in 3 months).  Also, travel was very lengthy; getting from one major city to the next took at least 30 minutes on foot.  Getting killed was also an annoying setback as well.  Finally, if you want more than one character, you need to cough up an extra $1 per month.Well, World of Warcraft changed all that!  Quests not only give you some reward that you may or may not use, but experience, money and reputation.  I've played for 2 months now, and one of my characters is 36, and the other 2 are  in their teens (no extra fee either).  I had a lot more time to put into FFXI, since I played it during the summer.  I've been a full time grad student during my time with WoW.  By the way, most of that leveling was done solo!  Blizzard also took care of the annoying travel times: hearth stone, trains, boats, magic and gryphons all help you get around a lot faster.  As far as getting killed, you might have to spend a little time running back to your corpse (or taking a hit on your armor repair bill, your choice), but you loose no experience and you have no chance to level-down.  Ultimately, this is a very well-done game.If you're wondering how this game will save you money, try it.  You'll likely go out much less, and hence will save money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GZ5Y","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Amazing Kingdom Hearts game with tons of backstory","reviewText":"I got this game around a year ago, but never got around to playing it until now. It's a fun game, and the major story developments you find out for the Kingdom Hearts franchise make this game worth even buying a PSP for.Story:The story revolves around three different characters that each have their own campaign for you to beat. Even though its three separate people's stories, it's recommended to play as Terra, Ventus than Aqua last. It's set up this way due to the fact they visit the worlds in this order (ie. Terra visits one first, and Aqua visits it last) and you will understand what is happening in the story this way.The story is really good and it's really cool visiting some of the previous worlds of Kingdom hearts before Sora even sets foot on them and getting some back story on everything. Even though its completely new people to the franchise, i find them to be likeable and its set up so that it doesn't mess up what's already happened in the Kingdom Hearts franchise since it's a prequel.Soundtrack:The soundtrack is just as awesome as it was in the other Kingdom Hearts games, and they bring back a bunch of themes from the previous worlds, along with adding new themes for the new characters that appear along the way. Even being on the PSP's UMD disc, the soundtrack has a great quality and I didn't notice any reduction in quality due to being on a portable device.The game has full voice acting for everyone and only the shop NPC's have text only dialog. Along with that, it's really good acting and I didn't get annoyed at all with the dialog. Sound effects for all the commands, finishers, and the normal attacks all sound well, but the key-blade noises could just be recycled from previous games.Graphics:For a PSP game the graphics are really good. All the cut-scenes are rendered with in-game footage, and the only CGI movie is the opening video you see when you load the game. The in-game graphics are really well done, but the mouths of the people do look a bit odd then they are talking. All the spell animations look really nice, and the finishers look and feel powerful when you activate them. All the worlds have that Disney feel to them and they look really nice on the PSP's screen.Verdict:This is a great RPG for the PSP, especially for Kingdom Heart fans. If you are a fan of Kingdom Hearts and don't own a PSP yet, this would be the game you would buy the system for. The answers they give you and the story that is presented is well worth the price, and I didn't see the ending coming and it was so cool that I highly recommend all Kingdom Heart's fans out there to go and buy a PSP just to play this game.~ Written: April, 2012Positives:* Great story and ending* Fun combat and spells* Soundtrack is just as good as the previous games* Ton of content for a portable game* Bunch of stuff to unlockNegatives:* Some mini-games are required to proceed and some of them are annoying* Gets a bit repetitive at times due to the fact you are starting over three times over","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2012"}

The game, on its own merits, is a lot of fun.  You have a handful of abilities that you earn as you progress in the game that helps you solve puzzles.  There are also &#34;elemental controls&#34; that you can develop which will help you in combat situations.For me, what made this game a winner was that the controls were pretty tight and the puzzles were rarely too difficult.  I hate puzzle games for the most part.  Nothing is worse that playing a game and then getting stuck for an hour on one puzzle.  It totally destroys the flow and artificially inflates game time.But that's not the case here.  You have various talents, and figuring out which one resolves the situation your in simply requires trial and error.  There is a logic to everything in this game, and it's not impossible to figure it out.  Yes, there were a couple of times where I had to keep playing the same checkpoint over and over, but it was because of my skill and not a puzzle.  I *knew* what I should be doing, I just had to keep practicing until I could *do* it.In any event, I've played one other Prince of Persia game, so I'm not a devotee of the series.  But I will say that, in terms of sheer enjoyment, I found this game to move more quickly and to be much more enjoyable than any installment of Assassin's Creed.  If you like platform games, this one is a winner.  Yeah, it's not the longest game ever, but considering what you'll pay for it these days, you'll certainly get your money's worth.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

First of all its very unintuitive.  When I rented this game as a kid, I had no freaking idea how to get past a red door.  In fact, I never even found any missles to blast the door down with, because the game's just so darn big, and many of the rooms you go through look exactly the same.  Its tough to find your way around.  I wouldn't even attempt to play this game without a map of some sort now.If you have any intention of progressing through certain points in the game, you absolutely have to go through secret passageways using bombs.  This is another thing that makes the game very unintuitive.  And for this reason, I wouldn't attempt to play the game without a walkthrough in addition to a map.And what's worse, even if you have your walkthrough and your map, there are areas in the game where you can get stuck indefinitely.  I tried to access a secret room by doing a bomb jump over a statue, and sure enough, I got stuck in a nook behind the statue and couldn't get out.  No matter what I did, I was stuck.  Talk about frustrating.  I shouldn't have to reset the game when I make a mistake like that.  At least give me a suicide option or something.Then there was another time I got an energy pack in a secret room, and when I tried to roll and explode my way back out of the secret room, I couldn't get out.  The last rock in my way refused to explode, and freaking bees kept flying at me while I was trying to escape.  Dog gone, why have a secret room at all if I can't get out of the darn thing?But despite all this, Metroid is a pretty good game.  Sure, there are times when you're swarmed by enemies that'll beat on you until you're forced to run away, but you've got to take the bad with the good sometimes.  Its fun to just run around, get all the special items, and shoot stuff.  When you have that jumping attack and the wave beam, man, you can plow through enemies like you're the Terminator.  Nothing can stand in your way.  Except those jelly fish things.  You can't screw around with those guys.I'm glad I gave this game another shot 20 years later.  It was a lot of fun.  It still seems so futuristic even though it's a blast from the past.  I'm just glad modern games for the most part don't let you get yourself into situations where you can't escape without hitting the reset button.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"B.

The boss creatures in the game are very tough, especially the final one. The graphics were solid, the sounds were solid, and the game was solid. What kept this from being a truly awesome game was there was a little too much story telling. Seemed like every time you turned around, you had another cut scene. And most of the weapons weren't all that good and neither was the magic.But one of the neat features was the Scrye spell. It let you see things that happened in the past. And when you used it while looking at some pictures they looked different. Very cool. You just have to see for yourself.Overall, this was a solid game that had some creepy music to set you up for quite a few good scares. Gave me goose bumps the whole time I played it.

They soon uncover a plot more dangerous than they could have imagined. Ratchet and Clank make their PSP debut, in Size Matters! With wireless multiplayer gaming, up to four players can connect for intense combat and head-to-head action","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"On the PSP, Size really Does Matter","reviewText":"The good news is, Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters is a very faithful entry in the Ratchet & Clank Series.  The creators didn't try to do anything too outlandish, tamper with the game to 'be different', or strip away any of the PS2 release in order to fit it into the PSP (this may be due to some claims I've read that the PS2 version was a port of this PSP version).That said, there are severe limitations to this title that all seem to center around having to use a PSP to play it.  I love my PSP, don't get me wrong:  but this platformer is not easy to wrangle on it.  I seem to be constantly suffering from camera problems:  slow panning when I call for it, and quick snapping away from the scene when I'm just moving around means that a lot of times I end up having to run away dodging so I can put distance between myself and my opponents and buy some time to get them back in my sights.  There is a \"strafing mechanic\", but heaven help you if you start off at the wrong angle.  There is a \"snap the camera to center\" mechanic, but fumbling for it during combat is awkward.There is also some difficulty with button-mapping.  Jumping, high-jumping with mechanical assistance, and long-jumping use the same button mappings.  Trying to time the act of running, tapping the shoulder buttons, and simultaneously hitting the 'X' button can be really difficult--and performing the wrong type of jump can be either frustrating or fatal.For those reasons, I don't recommend that someone new to Ratchet and Clank start here.  Try some of the newer entries in the series to get used to the gameplay, then get ready to have to make some accommodations to do on the PSP what you're used to doing on the PlayStation.If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.  He is a whiz with gadgets and mechanics, and from day one of the series he quickly fell into the role of 'Hero', a celebrity status that he seems to enjoy.  His sidekick is a clever little robot named Clank.  Clank not only helps him figure things out, he serves as some of Ratchet's gadgets, transforming into jetpacks, one-man helicopters, and more.  Clank also gets some play-time of his own, too:  there are times when you get to navigate him around a smaller-scale world, often enlisting the help of his fellow robots.  They live in a sci-fi world where there are plenty of planets to explore and all kinds of interesting life forms, most of whom want to kill you (but a few would settle for a good 3-lap race or two).  Dialogue varies from funny to downright hilarious, and there is enough variety in your objectives to keep things from getting boring.The beauty of the Ratchet & Clank series is that it marries both sides of platform heaven:  Ratchet gives you the jumping-action-shooting, while Clank lets you play strategy-maze-puzzle styled areas.  As a whole the series is quite fun, and each installment seems to come up with more gadgets and fun things to do than the entire run of Warner Brothers' Roadrunner/Coyote cartoons.That said, if you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank and you know your way around, you will be pleased to see that the graphics haven't been compromised.  Colors are rich and bright and sounds ring out crystal clear.  You'll probably get used to the way things work on the PSP, but be prepared for some frustrating reloads in order to get where you're going.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

(SquareSoft retooled some aspects of the game and added some nice features to please the classic RPG enthusiasts as well as the diehard Final Fantasy fans.)I like to think of FF4GBA as the \"upgraded\" version to the original program - similar to downloading a patch for a PC game, only, of course, it still remains a console game.The major stand-out benefit I gathered from this version of the game is that now the gameplay flows smoother into the Final Fantasy III version.  (FF6 for you diehards that know the Japanese nomenclature.)  That is, the switching of the party members - that was introduced in \"FF3.\"  Also, the unlocking feature where optional side quests result in more loot!The last part of this review deals with the most important topic: the cost-benefit analysis.  The question is, Do you want to enroll in this common tactic of the video gaming industry?  Is $30 worth the SNES FF2 \"patch?\"  Does having the portable version of the game (albeit a great game) meet your desires?Probably for most of us, we got rid of our old NES and SNES a long time ago.  (I didn't - they are right next to my N64 and GameCube.)  A lot of us downloaded emulators a while back and now play these games on our PCs.  And I would venture to say that almost all of us who love RPGs don't even care about video game consoles anymore and have gone to PC (more features in our games).So my recommendation here is, leave your impulses behind.  Yes, Final Fantasy II (and the FF4 GBA version) are classic, great, wonderful games.  But nostalgia shouldn't cost this much or require special circumstances to be taken advantage of, in my opinion.  Buy the game if you are a collector or have money to burn.  But always remember, they can't take our memories away!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000GR9P76","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Immerse yourself in Middle Earth","reviewText":"As a huge fan of JRR Tolkien I review this game with a bit of a bias.  While there have been video games set in Middle Earth before, none of them has offered what this one does: complete freedom to quest, explore--just immerse oneself fully in the world Tolkien created.  As a gateway into Tolkien's world this game succeeds admirably--as an MMORPG in general, however, it can't avoid the shadow of a little game called World of Warcraft.The comparison is inevitable since WoW is and has been the dominant force in MMORPG gaming since its release in 2004.  In reviewing this game, then, I will sometimes compare it to WoW.Audience/community: This game targets both LOTR fans and MMORPG gamers in general.  While I believe Turbine intended to shoot for a more mature audience for Lord of the Rings Online than is present in World of Warcraft I think this is only partially the case.  I have encountered immature and annoying people in LOTRO just as I do daily in WoW.  The Middle-Earth community as a whole is more mature, but I suspect that will change if LOTRO can ever rival WoW's popularity.Control:  This is LOTRO's biggest downfall.  While the interface is very accessible and combat is relatively easy to perform, the action lacks the fluidity that WoW has.  The characters are somewhat stiff and awkward as they fight--something I expected from a game like this until a couple years ago.  It is not enough to seriously hinder the game, but it is a significant drawback for anyone who plays WoW.Gameplay: The gameplay is excellent.  Not only are there more than enough quests to go around, there are also side objectives called Deeds which don't give your character experience but which do provide for added customization.  Depending on how you spend your time (exploring, killing many of a certain type of enemy, etc) you can earn \"traits\" and titles for your character which can be used to make him or her all your own.  Traits go beyond the typical talent points acquired through leveling--they give your character bonuses through charity, wisdom, and other such attributes.  You can also earn titles for your character, from such things as \"Wolf Slayer\" to protector of such and such a town.  This is a great aspect of the game and certainly adds to the enjoyment of creating and building a character.The game features professions which are about what you'd expect from an MMORPG.  They are enjoyable and easy to get the hang of.  One area this game does fall a bit short in, though, is player vs. player combat.  PVP takes place through \"monster play,\" which just isn't quite the same as all-out PvP with your own character.Graphics:  The graphics on this game are absolutely gorgeous, and certainly one of the high points of the game.  The landscape and terrain, the towns and cities, the water...everything is just pristine.Storyline: This is another of LOTRO's strong points.  There are many interesting storylines in each area as well as an \"epic\" storyline which is basically a quest chain that has more far-reaching consequences in Middle Earth than the \"go kill some of those wolves\" variety.  As your character grows and progresses he/she becomes more valuable to the overall cause of Middle Earth.I have enjoyed this game very much.  At the end of the day, however, I ask myself one question.  Would I play this game if it weren't set in the LOTR universe?  The answer, quite frankly, is that I probably would not.  It's not that the game has any huge flaw or that it's not enjoyable (it is)--it's just that without the LOTR franchise the game would come up even shorter of MMORPG greatness.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2007"}

You are a miner, mistreated by the guards of the facility and have taken the last straw so the flag of revolt is raised and fighting ensues. You fight your way across Mars with somewhere around 15 or 18 weapons (Each with their own secondary operation). You can take vehicles and destroy and annihilate anything almost at will.

Kennedy","summary":"Fun but Simple","reviewText":"Most people have given a pretty accurate depiction of this game, so I'm not going to write a really long review. I'm halfway through the first play-through of the game in only a couple hours and have yet to die. This game has revitalized the series, but does not possess much of a challenge other than finding some of the better hidden coins. While there are a decent number of levels, if you race to the finish you can probably beat this game in 5 hours. I have yet to use Street Pass, but I can't wait to see how it works when my brother gets this game.On a more positive note, this is the first game I've actually seen on the 3DS that uses 3D as a tool to help in game play. Using the depth as an indicator for how far away an enemy or platform is, is actually quite useful. Don't get me wrong, Zelda, Star Fox, Pilot Wings, and MarioKart in 3D are amazing. But the 3D in those games doesn't seem to affect game play, they were more of an added bonus.Overall This is a great game... as one would expect with a nintendo original. And I would promote it to any 3DS owner. But I would advise waiting for a sale on it. I feel like $30 is a more realistic purchasing price. (Nintendo originals rarely go on sale, so finding a buy 2 get one free deal is a bit more feasible)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

The graphics are great and it runs smoothly(I think there was a update to fix the hiccups). The main reason I like the Wii U version so much is because of the gamepad features. You can do quite a few things with the gamepad like control gadgets, mark enemies and plan out your route/strategy. These additional features show a glimpse of what the Wii U gamepad is capable of. The gamepad really does add new ways to play/interact within a game and this is very important since graphical improvements are becoming less significant.I also like the fact that you can choose your way of approaching the missions and be lethal or non lethal. If you like stealth you can get through the game that way or kill every single enemy along the way, it's your choice. The story/plot is kind of all over the place but honestly I wasn't even paying attention to the story much, it's not bad by any means but I wasn't interested.In the end I can easily recommend this game to people to who like action/stealth games or games like metal gear solid.

If you're a fan of this era of music, you will be in music heaven!First, let me admit that I adore all of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games. I think it's amazing that you can play along with songs you love, learn real life singing skills, and play with friends and family who don't normally play video games. These series are amazing.You could complain that they didn't change the gameplay - but really, this is meant as a booster pack of songs. You get the same general characters, the same general gameplay, the same graphics and sound as the previous level.  You only get one character to unlock.You get 8 songs in play mode but to unlock any others you have to go through Career mode. All together you get about 30 songs. I love many of these songs so to me it's worth it.Now here's the trade-off. With modern Rock Band / Guitar Hero games you can get a new song to add in for about a buck a song. With this one we can assume you probably already had the regular Guitar Hero song. You're getting another 30 songs for MORE than a buck a song - and you're being forced to buy them in a \"package\" that includes songs you might not like.Still, the PS2 didn't have a healthy online system like the PS3 or XBox side did so they didn't have the ability to easily add on songs. For PS2 players this really was the only option to add in new songs to their set. It also meant that players who didn't like the music in the original set could buy a \"fully functional game\" with 30 songs they loved all in one package.So I definitely understand the complaints of people who owned the regular software and felt they were being ripped off by paying this much for \"more songs\". I also understand the people who had no interest in buying into the Guitar Hero series until this group of songs came along, and they adored this game. To them this was an awesome deal.Looking at it from modern times, you can buy this game fairly cheaply and enjoy a wealth of songs you might not find elsewhere. So while I found this well worth it when it first came out, I find it an amazing deal here in current times. Well recommended if you have a PS2 and the guitars!Of course, if you hate music from the 80s, I'd recommend steering clear :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001FPBZ3U","description":"","reviewerName":"Tiger","summary":"Good Bundle if You Want The Two Games for Free","reviewText":"This is the Christmas 2008 bundle where 2 games are included for free.  So compared to the same-priced box without the 2 games, so if you were going to buy one anyway, there was no reason not to get this bundle.  After the holidays the free games disappeared and the console shipped for the same price without the 2 free games.  Having this box doesn't imply anything much about the version of the hardward you actually get other than you can expect the hardware manufacture dates to probably be within Januaray 2008 to October 2008 which spans several revisions of varous components, preloaded xbox operating system (which updates when you connect it to the internet anyway), and even among revisions the actual components vary by manufacturing plant.  But this box doesn't mean any specific newer or older version within that range because all existing stock in retail stores were updated to this bundle.  Microsoft representatives simply went to all stores, opened all the existing boxes, added 2 games, and applied new stickers to convert them to bundles.  So you can see how all existing stock can be this bundle.  Then there were actual new boxes that shipped with the holiday bundle box art.  You can tell the difference by whether there are stickers or not that tell about the 2 new games vs being printed directly on the box.Don't let the console revisions scare you about older versions.  The biggest thing to look for is at least get one with lower power consumption, I think it was the 175 Watt power supply which is in most 2008 versions.  I actually much preferred the June 2008 revision over the August/September 2008 revision and choose an older box after buying and returning several.  There could very easily be more updated versions by now, but I can only speak of the 2008 versions that I spent a considerable amount of time pouring through when I bought mine.  My biggest problem was a high pitched noise that came from the power supply brick.  I had to go through several purchases and returns until I finally got one that didn't make a high pitched noise.  Some were far better or worse than others.  My bottom line is that when not using the xbox, I don't want a constant high pitched noise in the background when doing other things like watching movies on my DVD player.  Some people cannot hear electronics noise since the higher range goes as you get older.  If you are one of those that can hear if a TV is on without looking when muted, then you'll hear this since it is far louder than the TV noise.  After several purchases, I finally found a power brick that didn't make a noise.  If you are stuck with one that makes a noise when off, you can put it on a power strip and turn the power off, but that isn't very convenient.The XBox console makes a bit of noise while running, especially when a game is in the DVD tray and not installed on the hard drive.  I highly recommend using the option to install the game to the hard drive and it loads faster and is much more quiet when running.  When installed, I don't even notice the noise, but it certainly isn't quiet.  Note that some console's DVD drives are noisier than others.  But if you just install all games, it make virtually not difference.  It also saves wear on the DVD drive which is one of the componentns likely to fail first.At this point in late 2009 you can probably find several bundles available from the past years and this year.  So first figure out how much a plain console costs without a bundle, then see what games you can get for free bundled with it at no additional cost, or maybe slight additional cost as long as it is still a value to get the games included.  Then choose which games you want.  The 2 games included here are good for children and casual gamers, maybe not hard core gamers.  Personally, my wife really likes the lego games and we can play together.  Kung Fu panda is more of a solo experience, but I found it entertaining to play through once as a casual gamer.Beyond considering hardware version & bundles, regarding the console alone, I really like my console.  There are plenty of games at reasonable prices that I like.  It has never failed me once.  But I do feel like they are lacking some quality control due to the number of consoles & purchased and returned due to noise or vibration issues until I settled on my final one which has been great since then.  But if you are a hard core Playstation fan, then I wouldn't force an xbox on someone who doesn't want one.  I'm sure Playstation is great and am not comparing the two.  All I can say is I am very happy with my xbox.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

Boss fights also require a great deal of strategy which is something I really enjoy, you'll need to figure out what makes them vulnerable before trying to make the capture. There's a money system that allows for upgrades for items, hidden Boo's that need capturing to unlock levels, and even gems in each level that need to be found. There's certainly a lot of content/unlockables to be had here even upon completing the game. One last thing I really like about this game is that there's practically zero violence. Where as in other Mario games you're stomping/smashing/exploding/kicking enemies to bits, this title takes on a more passive role which fits Luigi nicely. Instead you have to capture enemies or if there's a spider in the way shine your flashlight at it and *poof it becomes a coin.

Medal of Honor went the way for Call of Duty and adapted to modern warfare which works for this series. The single player campaign is nothing really too special, but it does showcase the realism of war and really makes you feel like a helpless nobody warrior in the middle of a Taliban shootout. It does this better than Modern Warfare, but not the multiplayer.The single player campaign has you playing as four different parties from a regular soldier, a navy SEAL, a pilot, and a Tier 1 operative. Like most war games you never get attached to the characters, but you do care for them enough towards the end. The games pacing is pretty good with you moving from night to day levels, and there is even an ATV level (why choose the loudest vehicle to do a night raid?), and the flying levels are pretty fun, but extremely linear and limited in control. You can actually move the helicopter, but instead just aim and shoot. There are some great moments like the Tier 1 sniping sections, and cinematic parts, but these are far and few between. Most of the game consists of moving cover to cover and shooting everything in sight. Sound familiar? Sure! Is it still fun? Why not! You seem to always be equipped with the right weapons and ammo is unlimited since you can just ash your fellow team mates. I never had to pick up a weapon off the ground, but it's there for variety.My favorite moment in the game has you playing as the army soldier Adams, and you and your squad are stuck on a hill inside a tiny little mud shack and Taliban are raining down on your from the mountain. You hear military chatter an awful lot, but it sounds more authentic and not just silly babble. Your team slowly runs dry on ammo and after the cinematic music plays, and almost all hope is lost in comes the helicopters! During this sequence it seems it never ends, but the surrounding chatter makes the whole experience more intense and authentic to real life battle warfare, but the whole game isn't like this. There are a lot of moments that seem more like the rest of the shooters, so the pacing is off a bit, but it doesn't fall apart.You'll mainly come back for multiplayer which is your standard military shooter affair. There are only three classes, a few maps, and that's pretty much it. It's fun since DICE (Battlefield: Bad Company) makes it, but it's no Modern Warfare. You have your usual three classes of ranger, sniper, and specialist, so everyone is pretty much the same person. It's basically shoot whatever moves and rack up a score. There is an objective based type of game mode, but it's essentially the same.The game also does one of the weirdest things, and that's use two different game engines. The single player uses an outdated version of the Unreal engine, and it's obvious that it looks outdated due to low resolution textures, and some low models. It uses the Airborne engine which was a poor move on Danger Close's part. The multiplayer uses the Frostbite engine that's used in Bad Company 2 and it looks great! Why the weird design choices? I don't know, but I hope MoH2 changes their engine. Is the game worth a purchase? Not really, but maybe a weekend rental. After about five or six hours of multiplayer you'll be bored, and probably just switch back to a better shooter. If you get bored you can go into the Tier 1 mode which disables everything and times you. Yes health restores slowly, no ammo refills, no reticle, nothing. So enjoy the super hard mode.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Movieskinny \"WayneG\"","summary":"Can't wait to play it!!(half way thru now on PC)10 zombies outta 10","reviewText":"If this is anything like Rez Evil 4.......count me in for five stars when I update this later. OK, I'm giving this a full five stars now after playing it on the PC. Once I finally play my PS3 version I will update this again, if need be.The game is not nearly as dark and cartoon-like as RE4. Level of detail is better than RE4. The African sundrenched landscape gets a very nice harsh brightly bleached-out look from being baked day after day. The creatures are not necessarily much smarter but they ARE definitely faster and edgier looking. RE4 let's you run away and get some space to do battle. These zombies and other creatures follow you at a much quicker pace to put pressure on you. By the time you turn to fire, sometimes you are a multiple lunch host. RE games aren't for everyone. This is horror. If you like being chased, eaten, chewed on, hunted, and fighting monstrous creatures, you will love this.We are definitely light years beyond Resident Evil 1 and the puzzle solving with slow pizelated zombies and quiet walkways of Raccoon City.Rez Evil 4 isn't really the 4th! AND this isn't really the fifth. Now if you count 'em, I've got Rez Evil 1, Directors Cut(does that count?), Rez Evil 2, Rez Evil3: Nemesis, Rez Evil: Survivor, Rez Evil: Code V', Rez Evil Outbreak: Files 1+2(do I count file2 as one?), Rez Evil 4, and this one, which makes 7,8 or 9 for the 5th?? It's not even close to a correct count. All are classics in gaming history, OK, except the Outbreak series, which thought was tediously boring.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5JW","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"3 Fun Games, but Sound Issues Detract from the HD Facelift","reviewText":"I purchased this HD Trilogy thinking it would be given exactly the same treatment as another HD Remastered Collection - God of War.  The Audio/Visual Upgrades for God of War were fantastic, and I believe they struck the perfect balance between compressing two games onto a single bluray and minimizing loss of quality.THIS review is ONLY in regards to the HD remastering of the PS2 games, and the compression for all 3 games onto a single bluray.  I suggest reading reviews on the individual games (Legend, Anniversary, Underworld) to learn more about those games.  All 3 of Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider games feature some large-scale environmental puzzles, some interesting stories (if you are interested in ancient history/myth), and some competent platforming.  They also have an occasionally difficult camera, so-so combat and slightly imprecise gameplay mechanics.  In short, these were the predecessors to Uncharted.  Controls aren't as great and the stories don't quite feel like Oscar winning material but the puzzle design is much more thought-provoking with a lot less hand-holding.If I were to assign individual scores for each game Legend is a 7.0/10 (decent graphics, archaic gunplay, average puzzles), Anniversary is an 8.3/10 (best puzzles) and Underworld would be an 8.0/10 (best graphics).  However, I would have given this collection a 5/5 based on the overall value if not for the several issues I experienced.In Tomb Raider Legend the sound between cinematics and gameplay is not uniform and is slightly higher during the latter.  Lara often receives instructions or commentary via radio transmissions that will distort 90% of the time.  These audio segments are unusually high in the master audio mix, probably as much as 25% higher at times.  Since these messages can be very difficult to discern, I had to turn on subtitles just to make sure I wasn't missing anything related to the story.  Visually there are still some interlacing issues as well which *could (*read SHOULD) have been addressed as well.  The game is old, but if Sly Cooper doesn't have any of these problems then I believe it is sloppy to see them here in Legend.  The elevated grapple points are also highlighted by an \"X\" even though \"[]\"  is the grapple button.  This problem was corrected in Anniversary, so it was indeed a problem nobody caught when the game was remastered.In Tomb Raider Anniversary the sound distorts primarily during the cinematics.  The sound during gameplay is usually pretty good, but voiceover work when you read Lara's journal is very very loud compared to everything else. I also experienced some distortion at certain locations when music reached a crescendo.  (I was more annoyed during these parts because the music in this game is phenomenal!)  Graphically this game is a step up from Legend (probably because it was a newer game to begin with) and I haven't noticed the same interlacing issues evident in Legend during in-game action.  Cinematic sound is somewhat quieter than the rest of gameplay, and I have to say it is somewhat jarring to experience sound issues during a pre-rendered segment that is \"supposed\" to demonstrate film CGI quality.  For the sound to distort during quieter segments makes me think these files were compressed quite a bit!The audio problem with Legend could be attributed to issues adjusting the audio tracks to a a uniform dB level during the remastering process; However, the problem with Anniversary is more likely a result of file compression since it is present in every cut-scene.  Visually these cut-scenes are a step-down from the rest of the gameplay as well.  Considering that these pre-rendered CGI segments are the largest individual files within the game, it would be easiest for the developers to compress them first.Many people have stated that the original retail version of Underworld is superior due to problems with compression in the trilogy.  Since I did not have the luxury of playing the stand-alone version, I can neither justify nor dispute this claim.  I have not noticed any jarring issues that could be attributed to having this game on the same bluray as the other games.  At the same time, I find it helpful to note that Square Enix has stated that Underworld is the exact same code as the original.  This means it would not have any improvements, but could have additional issues I would not notice in my playthrough.Just as a point of reference - I play Uncharted 2, Killzone 3, Crysis 2, God of War and many other games at around 50% volume on both the Astro mixamp or conventional speaker setup with the in-game menu sound options set at default.  I haven't adjusted the master volume in about 6 months because most games or films are within the same volume level.  In order to prevent most of the distortion so that I can enjoy the Tomb Raider games I had to set the master volume to 30% and change the in game sound options to 75/100.  I actually lowered Sound Effects to 69/100 which seems to be a better level for the mix.  I have experienced less audible clipping since changing this, but it shows how much of a difference there are in volume levels based on proper encoding.Since the whole reason for buying this trilogy is to have an HD release of some great older puzzle games, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed in the overall treatment.  Although still an improvement from standard definition, I feel like Tomb Raider doesn't quite provide the HD experience I had expected.  HD collections should have a bit more polish, considering they're a game we've already seen (and often purchased).  I applaud Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics for trying to maximize content for the consumer (even though one game didn't take any work on their behalf to include), but I wish QA had worked out the bugs.***Personally I would have been much happier if this was a collection of Legend and Anniversary that included a voucher for the retail (not downloadable) version of Tomb Raider Underworld.  The development team could have minimized any compression to allow both games the maximum amount of file space onto the bluray disc, and spent more time trying to polish the code.  Considering Underworld is now selling for $19.99, they could have lowered the MSRP on the collection to $29.99 and included a $10 voucher for Underworld.  This would have been the best way to experience this trilogy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}

This game did one thing that Smash Bro's couldn't. That was introduce an online multiplayer mode... THAT WORKS! (if you've ever played Super Smash Bro's Brawl online, you understand what I mean).ProsWell Balanced and Fun.Online mode not only works, but works well. (so far only had one game DC on me, and in another game, it changed my character once it entered the match)Done Right!Great/Interesting Roster. Each character feels unique, while fitting into the game quite well. Each with their own tactics and play style, offering a variety of different game play.A number of good and interesting stages.Possible incoming patches/DLC! (I'm hoping for more than costumes, emblems, and avatarts... I'm hoping new character/stages/balance issues)ConsThis game isnt perfect. As I mentioned before, there is a bit of learning that needs to be done for each character and items to really get an understanding of the game. If you just walk in, pick up a controller, you probably are not going to have a great experience, but the game DOES HAVE a button masher quality to it which allows for decent game play without full understanding. Each character has a wide variety of moves and tactis to learnAdventure mode is slightly lacking, but thats not a bad thing, just doesnt add to replay value, which is mostly in the multiplayer mode.Each characters move list is a lil much (although simplified enough to make it accessible to all). Some moves seem pointless, or just like a 'meh' move, just added to fill in space, while others seem overwhelming. But this game is still very well balanced considering.I feel like the stages get old very quickly, or they seem very routine at some point. Others seem forced together (two different stages from two different games merges in a way that doesnt really work).I'd give this game an 8.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"al","summary":"fun to race","reviewText":"i like the gran turismo games but i hate the license.  with some of the license you have to drive in a complete circle 3 times.  this is a fun old game any fan should try or try again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2012"}

I have spent hours just tweaking spells and weapons I think I could just do this for 100+ hours. I've been playing non stop since it's release and am completely addicted!!!!many people are comparing this to oblivion, the world is bigger I'd wager, I think it's better and harder which I prefer.the online modes are amazing and fun. I've read of glitches but Ihave experienced none. the voice acting is by and far NOT the worst I ever heard. it's actually not bad at all (when compared to the severely wooden acting of SOME other games I will NOT name..) if you liked oblivion andthought to yourself \"I want More\" this could be the perfect fix until Elder Scrolls V.the graphics are really amazing with some of the best lighting effects I have seen in any RPG on PS3.the controlls take getting used to but you can assign hotkeys and this speeds things up very well. also I loved the fact that no armor/weapon you loved (early on in the game) is useless,you may disassemble any weapons and armor for the base componentsto make your new weapons/armor far more powerful (though the sell price doesn't change) I'd easily recommend this RPG to ALL Major RPG fans!the game is simply a blast online or offline.your single player character cannot be used in multiplayer *sniffle*though I can cope with having several characters. I especally LOVE they put Necromancy in this to summon your own virtual army much like diablo II's Necromancer and that's just awesome!the game is deeper then the ocean!

The AI is great, the graphics are stunning, and gameplay is simply fun.First, if you've never played the Splinter Cell theory, you really have to see these graphics. Curtains ripple in the wind. Candlelight gleams faintly. Streetlights fall through blinds in rippled patterns. It is gorgeous to watch.The plot feels very real and current. You're a lone spy, sent in to get information and extract hostages. You learn more as you go through the game, finding out who to trust and who not to trust.All the latest gadgets and techniques are here. You have to use your heat vision, night vision, electronic vision to scan for danger. You have a wireless device to scan laptops from nearby. You can shimmy along pipes, hang by your knees and grab people beneath you. You can slit holes in fabric curtains and grab people through them. You really begin to forget that this is \"just\" a game.The enemies have become quite intelligent. If you turn off lights, they wonder who did that. If you open doors that should have been closed, they notice. You really couldn't ask for much more.But then, it gets even better. The missions offer a number of ways to solve them. There isn't just \"one path\". And multiplayer is truly phenomonal. You could play multiplayer every day for months and never get bored.Of course, it needs to be pointed out that, while you can aim for stealth as much as you wish, this is a game involving violence. You are snapping the necks of guards, watching hostages be killed in nasty ways, and generally dealing with adult dangers. This isn't a game for pre-teens.But that being said, the game is amazingly immersive and does reward you for taking the stealthy way through the course. You get far more points for sneaking in and out of the enemy base, vs doing a Rambo and blasting away everything in sight.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000JLIXI6","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Graphics, Great Gameplay, Giant Enemy Crabs","reviewText":"Genji Days of the Blade is probably most notorious for its silly E3 demonstration. The speaker talked about how it portrayed authentic feudal Japanese battles - involving Giant Enemy Crabs :) He also talked about novel concepts such as \"attacking its weak point for maximum damage\" and how you could do (gasp) REAL TIME weapons change in the game. This last item actually looks very silly - you could be swinging one sword, hit a button and MID SWING the sword changes into a new weapon.In general, this is a fighting game set in PRE feudal Japan, i.e. 1187. I ran a Feudal Japan newsletter for many years, and feudal Japan was the 1500s, the days of Oda Nobunaga and the wars then. Back in 1187, there was a quite different government setup. If you're curious about this time period, read The Tale of Genji sometime by Lady Murasaki - this is acclaimed by many as the first novel ever written. It was written back in the 11th century! It's a great read even today, which is quite an achievement.So back to the gameplay. You play a young two-sword warrior and have as your pals an older warrior, a female warrior and a war-god turned spellcasting warrior :) You fight through various Japanese landscapes and settings, taking on the Bad Guys. You have your combat techniques and magical powers to help you triumph.The graphics are very impressive. In the cut scenes, you can see the fabric weaves on the layers of kimono, the metallic sparkle in the lacquerware, the rippling heat waves by the fire. During gameplay the character movements were fluid and natural.  Fabric pieces would sway and tiny, glistening sparks would float on the air.  Some scenes were really quite lovely in a painting sort of way.Gameplay itself involves slicing with swords, chaining up attacks and blocking. There are, a la the Giant Enemy Crab, situations where you have to Attack the Weak Point for Maximum Damage. I didn't like the HUD of the map in the top left - it took up too much space and looked \"silly\" in almost a PacMan kind of way. The top left HUD of characters and health was much better done, less intrusive.For sound, I love Japanese culture and really enjoyed the traditional music that played in the background in many scenes. For me it really helped immerse the game in an authentic setting. Many of the characters speaking are obviously Japanese and hearing that accent and proper pronunciation of historic names was great. Some have British accents ... odd.There were a lot of little details that I really enjoyed. Obviously these guys had done their research. The little click as a sword was reset into its scabbard, the traditional sword holders on the ground, the way the swordsmen would set up a stance and move, it was all really enjoyable to watch. In many ways it was like being in a well done movie. That all being said, they took a few liberties about what the buildings looked like, and the characters dressed like, back in 1187. It was more like a time traveller from the feudal Japan period (i.e. the 1500s) went back to 1187 in some cases :) But that's sort of like the movie Excalibur, where King Arthur and his knights were wearing armor from the 1600s England. Historic King Arthur certainly wasn't alive in the 1600s :) But we accept that anachronism as part of the myth. It's not like the Japanese soldiers in 1187 had magic powers, either.In general I really love this game. If I'm going to pick out a particular flaw, it's the camera. You can't control the camera at all, and there are situations where it becomes incredibly annoying. Still, that's something you can just resign yourself to while you enjoy the game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

Not with this game a second person can jump in the middle of a game (you never have to stop playing for them to join in) and when you get to a hard part (for a 3 yr old) I just tell him Drop out for second and get him past the hard part then he jumps back in and he gets so excited when we make it to the end of a chapter together.

To be truthful, of the Mario trilogy on the NES I don't know which one to choose as the best (but #2 let me play as Toad and Peach so that's probably the best one). They were all awesome games that I'll never forget and this vast one really stands out.Super Mario Brothers 3 had the biggest selling video game release for years to come. While Super Mario Brothers 1 still remains the best selling game of all time, Super Mario Brothers 3 had the biggest selling release from 1990 to 1999. Unfortunately it's record was broken in 1999 by Final Fantasy VIII I believe.First of all, let me remind EVERY gamer out there that this game certainly wouldn't stand a chance today with the more 128 bit systems (or would it?) around.  Second, it was made in 1990! Why do gamers constantly try and compare old classics with today's standards in areas that they KNOW old classics can't match (Graphics, lentgh, sound etc.)?

{"product_name":"B00DC7G3Q8","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"Yoshi's New Island is cute, charming and fun, yet very conservative","reviewText":"Yoshi's New Island is, without a doubt, a very controversial title from Nintendo, in the sense that it appears to be slapping the word \"New\" in the title without actually adding anything new. Even though I have never played this game's predecessors, I can admit that I wasn't overly impressed with the early footage of the game. However, as time went on, bits and pieces of this game started to appeal to me and I soon found myself in Walmart last Friday purchasing it. After playing through the main adventure, I can attest that Yoshi's New Island is a fun game, yet it's very conservative with its otherwise daring new introductions.*STORY*Yoshi's New Island begins exactly where Yoshi's Island left off (I did some research for this part) with the Stork delivering Baby Mario and Baby Luigi to their parents. We then learn that the Stork had accidentally delivered the babies to the wrong house (consider your childhood ruined). In a mad attempt to correct his mistake, the Stork is ambushed by Kamek, Baby Luigi is kidnapped once again and Baby Mario falls to Egg Island, the second home for the Yoshi Clan. We also learn that Baby Bowser has taken over Egg Island with the intention of building a summer home there. The story for Yoshi's New Island is rather lacking, as it doesn't really provide a good reason for why we should even go on this adventure in the first place. There is little to no plot progression as the game wears on, which is rather underwhelming. Even though games in the Mario universe have never been big on the story, they could've put just a little more effort into this storyline.*GAMEPLAY*New Island's gameplay is very simple and smooth. The button layout is simple to learn and memorize. This game allows you to use either the Circle Pad or the D-pad to control Yoshi. I personally prefer using the Circle Pad because using the D-pad really cramps my hand, but there were some instances where Yoshi would unintentionally go through a door or into a pipe because the game registered my movement of the Circle Pad wrong. It got really annoying at points, especially in levels where there are lots of doors. Other than that little mishap, New Island plays smoothly and Yoshi really feels like an extension of your own arm, with his deaths being more or less the fault of the player and not the fault of the game.New Island also introduces several new gameplay mechanics, with the Eggdozers being the most notable. Eggdozers are essentially giant eggs that come in two forms: Mega Eggdozers (giant-sized eggs obtained from eating a giant Shy Guy) or Metal Eggdozers (metal versions of the Mega Eggdozers, obtained by eating a giant metal Shy Guy). The Mega Eggdozer can be thrown in any direction and wherever it goes creates a path of destruction. While it is being thrown, Yoshi can earn up to three 1-ups depending on how much damage the egg delivers to the environment. The Metal Eggdozers, on the other hand, can only be rolled along the ground. You can also take the Metal Eggdozers underwater, as they will weigh Yoshi down to the sea floor. This adds an interesting twist to the water levels, as Yoshi can generally only float on the surface of the water. Other new gameplay mechanics include the new transformations. These transformations seem more like a distraction than anything else, however, as they require you to play them using the gryo capabilities of the 3DS. The gyro controls feel very tacked on and most of the time I am forced to retry a transformation section simply because the 3DS would not register my movements. I feel that I would've enjoyed the transformations much more if there was a way for me to turn off the gryo controls. This game also introduces \"Yoshi Stars,\" which act similar to the Starman power-up in the Mario platformers. Yellow Yoshi Stars allow Yoshi to gain speed and run up walls and along the ceiling, while Red Yoshi Stars turn Yoshi into an indestructible rocket.While most of these new gameplay ideas are creative, I feel that they are spaced too far in between. Each of the new additions are confined to their own areas within levels and are maybe used only once per world, which is rather disappointing given that each world has eight levels. To be honest, I think I only found a Yoshi Star three times across the whole game. This does provide a general feel that the new additions are tacked on, as they don't really change the levels or the way the game plays at all. This goes to show that the developers really played the game safe and were very conservative with their new ideas without allowing them to blossom. It feels like such a wasted opportunity.*LEVEL DESIGN*Yoshi's New Island is comprised of six worlds with eight levels per world plus two unlockable levels for each world, bringing a grand total of 60 levels to the table. At first glance, the level design seemed meticulously planned and well-crafted, until I reached World 3. That's when I realized that all of the levels started to blend together. The level design for this game is really bland in the later worlds and some levels simply feel like a rehash of a previous level, simply reskinned with a new color scheme. The levels are not distinguishable from each other and I can barely recall 75 percent of them. By the time I reached World 5, I felt that I had developed the mentality that I was simply finishing this game \"just because,\" rather than to have a great experience playing the game and have that magnificent feeling of success that I felt when I completed Super Mario 3D World. Which brings me to another point, this game is very easy. There is no increase in difficulty at all throughout the entire game and it baffled me that I was able to blow through the first seven levels of World 6 (the last world, mind you) with ease. The real challenge comes from finding all of the red coins, flowers and health stars, but I believe they could've balanced the game's difficulty with finding the collectables better. It really is a shame that the developers didn't spend the time improving the level design, again showing that they were very conservative in allowing their ideas to blossom.*BOSS BATTLES*New Island does have a wide variety of boss battles, with each world having a mid-way battle with Kamek and an end battle with an over-powered common enemy. The boss battles, unfortunately, are quite bland, much like the level design of the game. The Kamek battles do vary between each world and I commend that, but I felt that the developers could've been a bit more creative with the end-world bosses. Much like Paper Mario: Sticker Star, they simply took common enemies, enhanced their power and called it a boss battle. The only boss battle that really intrigued me was the final boss, as it was the only battle that made use of the game's new features. The boss battles lent themselves to adding to the overall feel of conservative-ness that seems to be slapped all over this game.*GRAPHICS*This is certainly a touchy subject with this game, as it introduces an entirely new art style. Many people have written the art style off as being \"too different,\" but I rather enjoy the look. It's very cute and charming and it fits the overall feel of the game quite well. The graphics physically look much better on the actual 3DS screen than they do in the gameplay trailers and the colors really pop in the actual game. I like the art style and I'm glad they chose to go this direction with the graphics. The 3D effect, meanwhile, isn't really anything special in this game. It's simply there to add some distance to the backdrops and it makes the foreground slightly pop out. If you've played New Super Mario Bros. 2 with the 3D effect turned on, you pretty much know what to expect.*MUSIC*The music, on the other hand, is an entirely different story. The new main theme is really cute and catchy and I like it. However, it becomes plainly obvious after three or four levels that the majority of the soundtrack is simply the main theme remixed in different ways. At some points though, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some of the remixes are quite good. There are several tracks that are not remixes of the main theme, such as the castle and boss battle themes, but they sound very basic when compared to the remixes. And then there's the kazoo. I have no idea what the composer was thinking when he decided that a kazoo would be a good instrument for the music. The kazoo is very annoying and it really degrades the quality of the music. Fortunately, the kazoo is sparsely used across the duration of the game. Overall, the soundtrack isn't bad, but there is much room for improvement - it shows that the composer, much like the developers, was very conservative in allowing his ideas to fully develop.*VERDICT*In the end, Yoshi's New Island is not a bad game. Despite all of its shortcomings and conservative ways, I still enjoyed the majority of the experience and found it to be a fun game. It does contain a certain degree of charm, found largely in the graphics and occasional good music tracks, but the overall feeling of conservative-ness never fails to butt in and lend an overall feel that Nintendo has played this game safe.STORY: 6/10GAMEPLAY: 8/10LEVEL DESIGN: 7/10BOSS BATTLES: 7/10GRAPHICS: 9/10MUSIC: 6/10OVERALL (not an average): 7/10 (or 3.5/5, displayed as 4 stars)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Andrew Hamada","summary":"Great for newcomers to the genre","reviewText":"Being a gamer used to the slower paced moods of RPGs, puzzle games, and the like, I did not expect to overly enjoy this game.Just goes to tell you first impressions ain't everything, eh?Being *extremely* similar to  Goldeneye (another Rareware game on the N64 that still sells well), this  game is not only fun for its involving and often humorous plotline, but  also for its ridiculously fun multiplayer capabilities.  Going head to head  with your friends is fun, but the fun adds up even more when you see the  new gaming modes Rare has added in.  Veterans of the genre will recognize  themes like &quot;capture the flag&quot; and &quot;king of the hill&quot;.  In addition, the option to play &quot;counter-op&quot; is included - where  one player takes on the role of the heroine and the other player takes  control of the enemies in pretty much any of the single player  missions.In addition, players have to work to get all the fun stuff -  most game modes, weapons, and difficulty levels are only unlocked after the  player has played through a significant portion of the single player game  and possibly completed certain tasks.  Its well worth it to do so, trust  me.  With well over 50 different weapons to choose from, multiplayer is the  main reason to buy this game.The one downfall is the requirement of the  N64 memory expansion pak to play more than 60% of the game.  Without it,  the standard N64 doesnt have enough RAM to handle Perfect Dark's intense  graphics.  Serious gamers wont find this a problem though, as they should  already have one, and those that dont will find that some places will even  sell you the pak &amp; Perfect Dark together for a cheaper price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2000"}

And this kills GTA3! I am impressed. There are so many great improvements. First off, the story. You play Tommy Vercettin, a mobster kind of guy (the only mobster who looks bad ass in a Hawaian shirt) that, after 15 years of prison, is released. However, people don't really like Tommy in Liberty City. So, Tommy goes down to Vice City to negotiate a deal for his boss, Sonny Forelli. (You may remeber killing some of the Forellis in GTA3) The deal:$10 million for a lot of cocaine. However, the deal is busted by some cops and you make a getaway. There's more to the story, however. This is one of the best stories i've seen in a game. Straight out of Scarface and Miami Vice.The gameplay is godlike. More of that great GTA3 fun, but now you have motorcycles, helicopters, and excellent cars. The freedom is still here, and the missions are more varied. Don't say this is a GTA3 clone, because it isn't. Missions include 1st-person shottings, drive-bys, chases, protection missions, or simply, crashing into a employer's wife and making it look like an accident. Plus, you can buy hideouts. Saves me the trouble of going back to the same hideout over and over again. Really cool!The graphics are incredible. Very very smooth and pretty. It feels like Miami.This is a must-have.

And it was. This game still is the best out of all of them, even though San Andreas you can do everything. As everyone knows, this game was supposed to take place in the 1980's. The cars, clothes, hair and music was all transformed into one package and became the best game.So, why was this the best game ever? Like every worried mother out there, the whole concept of the game is to go around killing people. There is a storyline, unlike some of these baby games where you go around doing chores for people. You can go around and kill people, but they are pixalated little people that re-spawn and the same looking guy comes walking down the street again. Okay, so there is some bad language. But saying that you shoot someone and they fall into a puddle of blood is that violent, then you out of watch some more horror movies.Anyway, you can really do anything. You can do the old taxi driver missions and fire-truck missions, but now you can deliever pizza on a cheap little bike, sell \"ice-cream\" to the locals and enter NASCAR type races. You can buy property, like the Malibu and other \"clubs\". You take over a mansion and you can run around in it. New things like bikes and more boats make this game great.But, this game has some problems. They took out most of the glitches, but it does get annoying if you are falling into green hell all over again. (To people who don't know what green hell is, you keep falling and falling and falling into this green background.) The graphics are pixalated and cartoonish, and sometimes you lose health by just walking off a curb.Well, besides the minor bad things and the horrible gaphics, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is still an instant classic, and being that the controllers and whole game is just GTA3 with an 80's style, you think of it as Grand Theft Auto: Expansion Pack.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2004"}

Trying to improve your mental reflex is a worthy effort.My only issue is that getting an answer correctly entered into the system can be the hardest part.For example, with questions that require you to 'draw' a number value using the stylus, the system never recognizes my \"9\"s.  Granted, I draw 9s in an unconventional pen stroke, but the end result should be readable.  This game forces me to use a different stroke when drawing my nines.Another example, is that when you speak your answers aloud for the color questions \"RED!\", \"YELLOW!\", \"BLACK!\", etc...  the game enforces a militant level of articulation and enunciation.  Maybe its just my DS microphone, but I don't think so.  It seems to have a real problem understanding me when I say \"BLUE!!\".  And this is bad because every time you mis-speak, the game judges your brain as less active.In closing, the game is fun, and if you just play sudoku its perfect.

And I liked it like everybody did, until I met the X-Box on December 25th, 2003. This is when gaming was changed. This is the better choice, and I will tell you why.First off, X-Box is able to hold more memory then Ps2 can EVER hold. With a hard drive that can hold more things then paying about 1000 bucks for Ps2 memory cards that hold nothing, this gaming storage system is 100% percent better then PlayStation 2's. And now with game files getting bigger and bigger, you can hold as much as you want without ever worrying about losing memory. No memory cards, no worrying about losing them, jst a free hard drive.Secondly, the quality of the system over Ps2. Even though you can't really notice the difference in graphics, just take GTA. The Ps2 GTA characters look like a mess. X-Box has improved graphics. Also, the loading times. If you are patient, this is not an issue. But when it comes to video games loading, nobody is patient. That is why having faster loading times is much more convienent and you don't have to be stressed out enjoying yourself. And the grand finale, you can mix your own music and burn CD's, and actually put them inside your game. Ps2 doesn't ahve something that is even close to doing that.(...)Oh yeah! Don't listen to people when they say X-Box breaks down alot. One, it doesn't. My cuz had one since 2001 and he never had one problem.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Call of Doodie Good but Not That Terrible?","reviewText":"Let me first say I don't like reviewing games since most people have their own taste in what they like.  Some people forget that a review is someones personal experience with a product.  I know some people do create crap reviews for no reason except maybe they are lonely or they like to see the rise out of people but I can usually get into any game type.  I really enjoyed Gears 3 along with the Modern Warfare series but now am currently in Battlefield 3 and anxiously awaiting Skyrim and Asassins Creed.  I have been playing games since I was four starting with the Atari and now am about to turn thirty.  Though games have taken a back seat in my life now that I have a family but games are still apart of it.  It is amazing to see the change in games and the change in people that go along with it(especially multiplayer).  I rented this from Gamefly and am not sure if I am gonna buy it as of yet and thankfully I didn't have to purchase a game pass to try out multiplayer.Geez I have read some pretty terrible reviews about this game.  Some I see valid and others are by people who clearly hate the Call of Doodie (no offense meant) series.  Me personally I don't care since I have followed all the games dating back to the first ones on the PC.  I know a lot of reviews speak of rehash of really every game.  In the single player I finished last night which took around four or five hours I noticed none of what was going on would live up to the effects of Modern Warfare 1.  The airplane level was probably the best with being bounced up and down as its crashing and the such.  Nothing could live up to the first such as running through ruins of a ghost city as a sniper or crawling through the field as tanks roll by.  The story is weak and the AI could be taken down no problem and your team is good but sometimes stink.  I played the series so I wanted to see it through to the end but in my mind the ending was still weak and as usual everything in the game was over the top.  Outrunning bullets and being chased I don't know how Price deals with it.  He must be a broken man at the end of the day.  Personally my heart would explode doing all that.  Three was fun but I ran through it no problem except the one issue I always have with the single player Modern Warfare and that is the stinking deaths from grenades.  I rolled my eyes a few times like a teenage girl or something but I still enjoyed the game nonetheless.  I didn't hate the single player but it really did feel extremely familiar.  If you have followed the games I think most will feel the same way.  If you just want to see the series to the end you will be happy since it does close out but I didn't walk away with any certain memories from the campaign that would stick with me.After about twenty minutes online with multiplayer I remembered why I have to mute so much in Modern Warfare.  I had just started and of course coming in last because I have no clue of the maps or anything and being put in a game with level thirty to fifty people so I was pretty pathetic.  I can't say the words on here so I will substitute the persons f words with the word love.  This team sucks love you Rageaholicdad13(my gamertag), how the love, last place love you, love, five hundred points love you,  LOVE YOU RAGEAHOLICDAD13!  Then I was saddened he left.  I hope it wasn't me but I think he missed his morning feeding or maybe his parents walked in or something along that line.  I don't really talk much on my mic but I did want to antagonize the person but I chose not to.  Seriously Modern Warfare has its share of insanity but not all are like that since I have met plenty of fantastic people in my course of gaming on Live.  Who knows the raging character may be a great guy outside of Call of Duty but jeez calm down a little bit.  Unfortunately someone always has to come in last.Now the actual multiplayer is somewhat disappointing since it like I said all feels very familiar but its still lots of fun and pulse pounding and don't get me wrong I have wanted to smash my controller in my bare hands in frustration at people.  You know when you shoot someone twenty to a hundred or so times and they kill you with three or less shots.  Very frustrating but very fun to do.  I do feel like the multiplayer feels more like dlc than an actual new game.  Almost like Modern Warfare 2 with updates.  I don't know how exactly they could of improved on their formula much more without taking some of what people like away.  If you enjoyed the multiplayer in the Modern Warfare games you will still enjoy this even though its really nothing that new.As far as graphics I think the game could use a new coat of paint but I never had any slow down or anything but if graphics are a big thing for you than you may be disappointed.  The sound is fantastic even though I like Battlefield 3's echos and bullet pings better.  Everything thing in Battlefield has a deep sound to it and though this game sounds great I have always enjoyed the booms and pings and thuds in the Battlefield series be it Bad Company or Battlefield.  This game still doesn't disappoint in the sound department so crank up the surround even though I have my own preferences as far as sound it is pleasing.  A.I. can be stupid sometimes and I think twice I had my teammate get stuck while running and it wouldn't get to the next checkpoint so I shot and knifed him to get him going.  Its not that big of a deal since I think most people play for the multiplayer anyways.All I can say really is to try it like than buy it and you might hate or love it.  I am still gonna play another good amount of time before I decide whether or not to buy it.  If you have access to gamefly I say try it that way since you don't have to buy the game pass for this.This was a long winded review and I dont know what I would say that could add anymore to what people have said already.  I don't know if anyone will even read this since it will be in the middle of the expansive reviews on Amazon.  The recent war games have taught me one thing and that's those silly Russians when are they gonna learn to stop being bad.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Schmidt \"TotalHavoc\"","summary":"A great game, BUT...","reviewText":"I feel the need to disclose my credentials before giving you my review.  I'm an avid gamer.  I own a gaming PC, PS3, 360, Wii, PSP, 3DS, and IPAD.  I play every genre that is out there:  MMO, single-player RPG, FPS, racing, 3rd person adventure, puzzles, casual games, etc...even kid's games.  The reason I tell you this is because I think I have played enough games, across enough platforms to be able to intelligently discuss and compare various games.  As far as MMO's are concerned, SWTOR has a lot of positive things going for it, and also has a lot of shortcomings.  I have been playing the game since the beta, so I have seen some of the improvements they made before release and have had an opportunity to have more time with the game than some other people may have had.PROSWhere SWTOR really shines is in the story telling (class quests).  Being a fully voiced MMO and using cutscenes, the game presentation is great.  Stories for each of the classes are interesting and compelling.  The problem is it's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness (see cons).  Most quests are the standard run-of-the-mill, kill this many of this and grab that many of that, so it won't win any awards for original gameplay.  The atmosphere of the entire game is very Star Wars.  There is something very satisfying playing as a Jedi or Sith and hearing the whoosh and buzz of a wielded light saber.  Combat feels more viseral than other MMOs I've played.  There are a wider range of player animations than typically seen in an MMO and the effects look good.  Sound design is also great and the orchestral scores are epic.  Planets like Tatooine and Hoth really make you feel like you have entered the Star Wars universe.  The game employs 4-player flashpoints that give players a chance to go thru a longer, dungeon type mini story that require players fulfilling various roles to complete objectives to get better loot (the old tank, dps, healer formula).  If the game was a single player RPG or even a local coop game this would all be great but when a game is advertised as an MMO people have certain expectations, well this is where the game falls short.  Another interesting mechanic to the game is that you get your own crew and a starship.  As your class storyline progresses, you will be introduced to NPCs that will become your companions.  These companions actually gather the mats for your crafting and do the crafting of your items.  You also get to take one companion with you everywhere you go.  Each companion has their own class so you can choose to take your healer, tank , or dps companion along with you on quests.  There are also rail style starship missions that act as a welcome diversion from the normal MMO grind.  These type of innovations are headed down the right path and have the potential to set the game apart from it's competitors.  As part of the competitive multiplayer aspects of the game, there are three warzones that players can participate in which are variants of capture the flag and capturing and holding certain areas on a map.  Being someone who enjoys all types of games and gameplay, I am content in playing the game and can keep myself occupied by playing every aspect of the game to it's fullest.  However, if you are the type of player that only likes to do 'battlegrounds' or questing, etc. and focuses only on one aspect of the game, there may not be enough content to keep you engaged for very long.CONSBeing a story driven MMO forces the game to be fairly linear, this hurts grouping and reduces the feeling of having an open world to explore as you wish.  While having a variety of planets to visit, each planet is geared towards a particular level range so once played there is no reason to return and revisit a planet.  Also, there seems to be very little variation in the climate or terrain of each planet so each planet can be quickly reduced to the flat desert planet or fissure ridden ice planet if you get my drift.  And the part that falls flat and will disappoint hardcore MMO fans...end of game content.  End game content is lacking.  Leveling is fairly easy and quick in the game so unless you plan on playing the game to experience all the various storylines of the different classes you will probably get bored pretty quick. Armor models for high level gear are absolutely awful.  Being an artist myself I wonder who got the job of designing the clothing in this game.  You'll find yourself reaching to get the better gear for the stats only, not because the better gear actually also looks cooler. Despite the novel approach to crafting, there are not enough schematics or compelling schematics to engage you in the crafting process.  Most gear you can make for your level is lower quality than you can find.I could go on much longer about the pros and cons of this game, but then I would never finish this review.In summary, SWTOR has advanced the MMO genre in it's presentation and the addition of a strong story telling element, however, the implementation of these aspects caused some of the traditional aspects of MMOs to suffer.  I think the game has a lot of potential, but it will be interesting to see how Bioware and EA handle the MMO in the upcoming months to see if they can tweak the formula and evolve the game to the point where things begin to mesh better.  I am enjoying the game at the moment myself but hardcore MMO fans may get bored with this one quickly.  If I reviewed this game after only playing a character to level 30 or so I probably would have given it 5 stars, but it's clear that the crafting system and end game content are too weak to sustain most people's attention on a long term basis.  I think it's a game worth experiencing, but the decision is whether to give it a go now, or wait until they add more end game content and hopefully tweak the crafting system.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

I played DOOM and Duke Nukem games for the PC and console systems, the Quake Games for the Nintendo 64 back in the day, played tons of FPS games on last-generation's PS2, and have most of the FPS's worth owning for my Playstation 3 (Modern Warfare Trilogy, Black Ops 1&2, Bad Company 1&2, Battlefield 3, Bulletstorm, Bioshock, Doom 3 BFG edition, and the original Medal of Honor).  Now, with the original Medal of Honor there were some shortcomings, but I overlooked them, as I was actually deployed to Afghanistan in July of 02 and saw a number of places in MOH first-hand while on deployment.  The second one, however, I had no personal ties to, and so was forced to see the game for what it was: a poorly-executed hair-brained idea of a game.Now, it is a military first-person shooter based around Delta Operators and other Special Forces units from around the world - that concept is cool.  However, the execution of this idea is crap.  Before I become un-objective, I will break it down into different areas.Graphics:  Very nice, but have been done before.Sound:  Nice and fluid, decent music score.Story:  Too much trying to be both an action game and a drama game.  Leave the drama to Heavy Rain.Gameplay:  The controls are tight and responsive, BUT damage inflicted on the enemy is horrible.  I shot an enemy combatant five times in the torso - \"center mass\" shots and he still shot back.  That's a load of garbage.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Lara's Brilliant Return","reviewText":"I might have been the harshest critic of the new direction Crystal Dynamics decided to take \"Tomb Raider.\" There are several angry posts to my name across the web, talking about why this game would fail, and how it was a desecration to the franchise. After all, I grew up with Lara's series, and in fact, \"Tomb Raider II\" was the first video game I ever played. To this day, I thought that this would be a simplification of the timeless series, and a desperate attempt to make the series fit in with newcomers. Thankfully, I have been proven wrong. \"Tomb Raider\" is one of the venerable heroine's finest outings, and possibly the best action game since \"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.\"We begin with Lara being trapped on an island, searching for her friends and being pursued by a menacing cult. But this isn't the cocky, oddly-proportioned character we're used to; this is before her official tomb raiding days, and the first major expedition she sets out on. As such, she is inexperienced and vulnerable, and the game chronicles her ascension from scared teen to powerful warrior. Now, you might think the trailers give away the plot, but you'd be dead wrong. The story is every bit as strange and wonderful as some of the earlier games, containing unpredictable twists and surprising supernatural elements. It would be a crime to spoil it, but let's just that fans of the old games need not worry; Crystal Dynamics (developers of Legend through Underworld) still know what this franchise is all about, narrative-wise, and they hit the nail right on the head.Special props should go to Rihanna Pratchett, writer of the woefully underrated \"Heavenly Sword\", for making Lara into one of the most empowering female role models ever crafted. Even in her weakest states, she is never a victim, always resourceful and one step ahead of everyone else. Through the story, we see her learn from mistakes, and turn into what we typically think of as Lara Croft. Special little nods the series' roots, right down to the origin of her signature silver pistols, add in flavor to her character, and turn into a much deeper protagonist than she has ever been. Even as somebody who loves the old character, I must say that Pratchett has actually made me prefer this interpretation of her. Full-speed ahead with this new Lara, I say; she's smart, cheeky, and powerful, which is exactly what she's supposed to be.Fans' biggest concern about this new entry, however, was undoubtedly the gameplay. The seemingly liberal inclusion of Quick Time Events, and the deceptively linear design of showcased levels both indicated an unwelcome change. However, it turns out we were only drip-fed bits and pieces of different levels. The game itself is an entirely different matter, because it is teeming with as many secrets as the old games, if not more. While it is easy to simply follow the set path, there are numerous alternate routes to pursue in search of loot, and even entire optional tombs. These tombs are more in line with the classic puzzles we're used to, fun little mind teasers that are a great distraction for old-school fans. Whether you want to get to the point or indulge in some side quests, this game has got you covered.As far as the gameplay itself is concerned, Crystal Dynamics has unquestionably changed the formula for the better. Platforming is now much more tight and urgent than ever before, requiring the precision fans are used to. While it is significantly easier than past entries, the sheer creativity that went into the dynamic set pieces more than make up for it, and it isn't necessarily as streamlined as the demos make it seem. Attention still must be paid at all time, and once you get past the initial 2 to 3 hours, the game stops holding your hand and expects you to dive head-first into somewhat tricky platforming, fully prepared to punish you with brutal deaths if you fail.The biggest overhaul by far, though, is in the combat department. Now, even as a fan of the series, combat in \"Tomb Raider\" has always... well, it's always kind of sucked. Even the improvements in Legend couldn't quite find a way to balance platforming and shooting up enemies. However, the developers have learned from their mistakes, creating a seamless blend of platforming and TPS mechanics that must be played to be believed. There's also a leveling component that really makes or breaks the combat; your survival is dependent on scrounging for salvage and strengthening your weapons. Most games mess this mechanic up pretty badly with upgrades that are seemingly meaningless, but this is pleasantly a whole different bag altogether.Even more impressive is how important each weapon is, some being required to solve puzzles and progress the game. My personal favorite is the bow, which can be used as a distraction, a stealth weapon, a capable frontal assault companion, or a key to burning open pathways. Oh, yes, and it can be used to choke enemies from behind. This is just one example of the versatility weapons have in this game. Heck, even the climbing axe ends up becoming a lethal tool of destruction...Graphically, the game excels. While some may argue that the rendering power is not on par with some other AAA titles around today, it only takes one look at the brilliant art direction to sway non-believers. The mysterious island and all of its secrets are a marvel to behold, a mixture of jungle, forest, and even desert-esque canyons. Shanty towns and elaborate Asian temples alike comprise the architecture of the island, and ominous tunnels range from wet rock to a disgusting river of blood and corpses. The key word here is \"variety\", really, as most locations tend to not look the same one bit. Older entries had to span multiple countries in order to convey a sense of changed locale, but this time around, they only needed one island to create a living, breathing world. It's a wonder to behold, and one of the most unforgettable video game environments ever crafted.Soundscapes are another strong point here. The background noise is convincing, with the caws of birds seemingly surrounding you, and the distant war cries of enemies preparing you for battle. You'll always be sucked right into the action, regardless of the situation. Ditto for the score, which is surprisingly similar to the early games; it's tense and dramatic, but always has an element of mystique to it. It is one of the rare video game soundtracks that doesn't simply blend in, but stands out and demands you pay attention to it.The new voice of Lara is also wonderful, and I daresay the best portrayal done yet. Sure, we see the frightened and timid girl advertisements seem to highlight, but we get hints of what is to come with the character. Moments of wry sarcasm between her and her shipmates, as well as her cheeky observations and bold proclamations of assault on her enemies, are pure 90's \"Tomb Raider.\" The game lets you know what to expect in future entries, and this is due in large part to this fantastic performance. Kudos to Camilla Luddington for a performance which is sure to be lavished with awards in the coming months.As mentioned above, I was a complete non-believer with this entry. I feared that one of my favorite franchises was cashing in on cheap gameplay mechanics and a weak plot, while shedding what old-school fans adored about the games in the first place. Luckily, I was proven to be a complete fool. Square Enix has released a game that not only reminds me why I fell for Lara and her exploits, but why I love video games as well. The story is a brilliant tour-de-force, the gameplay is perfect, it's a feast for the eyes and ears, and the protagonist is one of the best in a very long time. Everything about this game, from top to bottom, is positively flawless. There is not a single ill word I can speak of the game, whatsoever.Filled with enough nods to the series' history to satiate diehards, but with enough innovation to snag newcomers, this is a game that shows Crystal Dynamics is the perfect developer for this household name series. \"Tomb Raider\" is an instant classic, and should be a benchmark for which all future action games are played. It is utterly perfect on every possible level, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.Story: 10Gameplay: 10Graphics: 10Sound: 10Overall: 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

It had that fanboy-stink on it: mediocre reviews, but a devoted following who claim, \"OMG! This is one of the bestest games ever! :OBut after receiving a coupon from a certain nationwide chain for 10% off of any game purchase, coupled with a ton of gift certificates, I decided, \"What the heck?\" and picked it up.So, let me begin by saying that I went into this one with somewhat lowered expectations, and I can happily say that this game surprised me on most counts. But it's the way that the game surprised me that, well, is the most surprising thing of all.The Good:1) New playthrough = new contentOne of the worst RPGs I've ever played was \"Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter.\" I won't go into that atrocity here (feel free to read my ages-old review on that game's page). However, BoF:DQ had one of the most novel ideas I've ever seen in a game. Assuming that you could stand to beat it, on the replay, there were more cutscenes, and more content. New dungeons opened up depending on how well you did in the previous playthrough.It's a scary gamble, when you think about it. RPGs are already long affairs, so expecting multiple playthroughs to get the full experience might be a bit much. Still, \"Nier\" succeeds admirably in this regard. It's really strange - the story of the game is a sap-filled joke for the first half of the game. However, it starts to pick up in the second half, and becomes quite interesting (if somewhat sketchy) by the end. Play a NG+, however, and the story moves into high gear, as you actually learn the motivations of the supposedly mindless bosses you fought the first time through. All in all, there are 4 possible endings (WARNING: one of them erases all of your saved data! You've been warned), and they are quite well-thought-out.2) GameplayI have to admit - I'm a nut for hack and slash. I've played every Dynasty Warriors title in existence after all (and am even importing \"Orochi Z\". So naturally, I love a game where you go around beating the crap out of enemies with a sword and magic that...acts like a sword. There are some problems with this (a multitude, in fact), but the idea is solid.3) Weird ideasI like a game that takes chances, and \"Nier\" has a lot of weird things in it. There is fishing. There is farming. There is fighting. There is collecting. There is even a weird place where you will read walls of text before making decisions, like an old pen and paper game. Not all of these ideas actually work (in fact, few are implemented well), but the fact that they tried still makes me happy.The Bad:1) ControlIt's atrocious, really. It shouldn't be hard to just walk around and swing a sword, but in an attempt (I guess) to convey some sense of realism for different weapon types, your main character will just do stupid stuff. I can't tell you how many times I've said, \"What are you doing? Swing the sword THAT WAY!!!\"2) MagicIt gets its own category. Magic, simply put, stinks. You have something like 10 spells, but I never saw a need to switch from the first two I earned (Dark Blast and Dark Hand).  They were ALWAYS plenty good enough. Come on. If you're going to go through the trouble of creating all this magic, at least make it worth my while to try it out.3) SidequestsPointless. The vast, vast majority of this game's quests are of the, \"Go here and fetch me this!\" variety. In the rare cases that you fight an enemy, it's just one of the stock Shades you've seen 1000 times before. A little originality would have gone a LONG way here.4) Overall poor implementationRemember all those great weird ideas I mentioned above? Well, most of them suck in practice. Fishing is OK (it makes a decent moneymaker), but there is no real reason to do it other than to complete a few quests and make some money. Farming is a major hassle (It actually works in real time), and has absolutely NO bearing on the game (there is a single trophy which can be gained, but there is no benefit within the game for the hours of time you will put into farming, if done legitimately). Collecting items for upgrades suffers from the same problems as it does in any game - there are like 100000 items, of which 99,975 are completely useless. The ones that aren't? Expect to spend HOURS farming them in the necessary amounts. Why not just have super difficult dungeons house these items, a la \"Star Ocean\"? Nope - you'll be fighting the same stock losers for hundreds of battles, hoping that the items drop.So, there you have it. I can understand if someone thinks I've overrated this game, but the fact is, there is an undeniable charm in the interactions of the characters, the overall story, and the game itself. It has the feel of a product that was rushed, or possibly poorly budgeted. Still, I would recommend it to RPG fans who have been...disappointed by other JRPG entries (such as \"FFXIII\" or the odious \"White Knight Chronicles\").","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2010"}

While it's hard to deny the series was running out of gas by this point - just take a look at some of the robot masters - there were several things that managed to grab my attention. The most important additions in Mega Man 6 have to be the Rush adapters that grant the player the ability to turn into Jet and Power Mega Man. These forms allow the player to reach previously inaccessible areas and help bring back a little of the exploration that's been slightly siphoned out of the games over the years.Welcome as adapters are, they can also show one how sloppy the game can be. The first eight stages of the game play like a dream and I have no complaints. It's only after the player enters the final two fortresses do we see where how ugly things can get when game's challenges are not tackled the right way. Things are entertaining and a breeze with the right weapons/form in hand, but this slick veneer is quickly peeled away when the player is caught between a rock and a hard place. Even with advance knowledge of what's ahead it's amazing how easy it is for this to occur.Still, like the family pet the fails to do its business outside, it's hard to stay mad at Mega Man 6. This especially holds true when one considers the fact the game almost didn't make it out of Japan. With the arrival of Mega Man X, Capcom decided to forgo publishing the game abroad; it was only after Nintendo decided to pick it up for the fading NES that we actually got the game.Its interesting history and aggravating points aside, Mega Man 6 is an excellent conclusion to the NES library of Mega Man titles. While my memories don't exactly gel with currently realities - the game not being the juggernaut I remember - such is the fate of many of the games we grow up with. That said, the game is easily a worth while investment for fans and newcomers alike.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2011"}

I see some people docking stars here for minor quibbles, but the positives of \"Dead Island\" so far outweigh any negative, I can't honestly see how any survival horror fan could rate this a less than 5 stars.The basic story is that you're stuck on an island resort when a zombie outbreak occurs. For some reason, you and 3 other survivors are immune to the zombie virus. You choose to play as one of four characters at the beginning of the game, from there you must help the other survivors on the island try to survive and ultimately escape the island.Within the game you will be given various quests, and each quest has it's own challenges and rewards. The quest range from very easy to very, very hard....but all of them are a blast. I highly recommend you try to complete all of the quests as the rewards can really enhance your gameplay. Your character will make their way through 4 \"Acts\" each taking place on a different part of the island; The Resort, Moresby City, The Jungle and finally the Prison. Each level comes with unique challenges and pulse pounding action.What I loved best about \"Dead Island\" is the free roaming aspect of the game. You can literally play for hours and hours without taking on a quest if you wish to. I spent quite a bit of time on the Resort level searching the beaches and huts, the hotel area and everplace in between. \"Dead Island\" rewards players for basically taking this grand tour as well as I tripped our quite a few wicked weapons, some mod blueprints to upgrade weapons, as well as other game collectibles sprinkled on the paths less traveled. And \"Dead Island\" features some beautiful graphics, and sounds to boot, so there is always something cool to discover.All around this is the best game I've found for the PS3, and \"Dead Island\" has really raised the stakes for future survival horror games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

Then there was the constant, &quot;you got more gold than me, i hate you&quot; fights. This game started to remind me of 'zombies ate my neighbors' in the fact you can't seperate from your party, i swear everyone should have used the old 'toejam and earl' split screen method. This game would probably be even better on-line because the person you were playing with wouldn't be right next to you, so you wouldn't be able to hit the other person, when you got mad at them.all in all great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000R0RHPY","description":"Delivering both wartime authenticity and a fresh perspective through an intense, action-driven storyline, Turning Point&#xBF;: Fall of Liberty makes war personal and relevant. Presenting this scenario as a powerful and realistically crafted alternate history, Turning Point&#xBF;: Fall of Liberty delivers an explosive First Person Shooter experience in a world where famous real world locations appear startlingly different under Nazi occupation.","reviewerName":"Cobalt","summary":"It's nothing special, but it's not a complete atrocity","reviewText":"I've seen people everywhere label this game as one of the absolute worst FPS games ever created.  I saw some videos of it on YouTube and became fairly intrigued by it, especially after seeing what the story was about and some of the moves you could do.  I finally decided to get it, and after completing the entire game, I have to say that it's not a game that will blow your mind, but it's definitely not the worthless atrocity everyone's making it out to be.Developed by Spark Unlimited and published by Codemasters, \"Turning Point: Fall of Liberty\" immediately distinguishes itself from every other WWII game with its alternative reality story.  It envisons that Winston Churchill was struck by a taxi in New York City and died as a result(this actually happened in real life, but he survived).  Since he was then unable to rally the British against the Nazis, all of Europe was overrun.  The Nazis then eventually decide to launch a full-scale invasion of the US, fronted by a massive fleet of titanic war Zepplins, starting with New York City.  Your character, Dan Carson, is a lowly construction worker on top of a skyscraper foundation who's suddenly caught in the middle of it all.  As he tries to get off the building as fast as possible, he manages to throw a Nazi paratrooper off the building and take his weapon.  He continues toward ground level, gunning down Nazis like a pro, despite the assumption that due to his profession, he's likely never had any experience whatsoever with firearms.  Soon, he's recruited into the Resistance and sets off on a journey to drive the Nazis off of American soil.Out of the collection of WWII FPSs that came out around the same time period and use the same graphics engine, which includes \"Hour of Victory\" (which I absolutely hate) and \"Medal Of Honor: Airborne\" (which I absolutely love), TPFOL falls squarely in the middle.  Its controls and gameplay are relatively smooth and responsive, and it includes a few special elements that are actually useful.  You're able to use an enemy as a human shield while you steal his pistol to shoot other enemies, which is perfect for very tight areas with little cover.  During certain actions you perform, like climbing a ladder or shimmying across a ledge, the camera cuts to a third-person view of your character, similar to games like \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas\" and \"James Bond: Quantum Of Solace.\"  It's a nice stylistic choice that lets you see exactly where you're going without hindering your view.While it's true that your bog-standard WWII weapons are in here, like the M1 Garand, Thompson sub-machine gun, Colt M1911 .45 pistol, and C96 Mauser pistol, there are some very interesting special weapons that are relatively advanced for the time period.  The MP-50 sub-machine gun is based on the infamous MP-40; however, it has a 50-round magazine and a flashlight mounted under the barrel, perfect for navigating dark, claustrophobic areas.  The Gewher Vampire is based on the infamous Gewher 43, but sports a long-range, infrared scope that's perfect for pin-pointing the exact location of distant enemy snipers.  The FG44 assault rifle is based on the infamous and highly damaging FG42, but has a mounted scope that allows you to take out enemies from a little farther away.  Finally, the \"Panzerschlag\" is a massively upgraded version of the infamous \"Panzershrek.\"  It holds 3 rockets in a special casing and can fire them in rapid succession before needing to reload.  It's perfect for demolishing enemy tanks, armored cars, and those menacing war zepplins.There are achievements available for completing the game on the hardest difficulty, and this is where the game shines the most.  While its true that the enemies may not be the smartest you'll ever face, they more than make up for it with their tight accuracy and high damage from both guns and grenades.  If you wish to survive, you'll have to make extensive use of salvaging enemy weapons, using the proper type of weapon for short and long-range combat, and taking human shields.  Thankfully, it's nowhere near as cheap or unfair as other FPS's hardest difficulties, and success lies in exploiting the weaknesses of the AI's behavior.  It's a fairly tense, engaging, and rewarding experience when all is said and done.The graphics, powered by the Unreal Engine, are much better when compared to HOV.  There's very few, if any, instances where textures pop in and out, and the environments look big and expansive.  There's also some pretty destructible envrionments and big explosions.  As a whole, though, everything still looks relatively below-par when compared with other Unreal-powered games out there.  It's not extremely ugly, it's just on the bland side.  The rag-doll physics of the enemies are also enjoyable when you kill them, especially when you perform a cinematic melee kill or cause them to flop off a high ledge.TPFOL is definitely a game where its bright spots are equally weighed down by its bad spots.  The story is never really deep or moving in regards to American life under Nazi domination; you just travel with this band of rebels all over the place and kill basically everything that moves.  It's also extremely linear, and really short, so the replay value is very low.  Still, it's a nice change of pace from killing Nazis only in Europe, along with some pretty impressive prototype weapons.  TPFOL is not a game that is mind-blowing or revolutionary; however, it was still satisfying, and I don't regret the time that I spent with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2014"}

It is incredibly fun, can be played co-op, and exposes players to all sorts of great music. Guitar Hero III ups the ante with even more fantastic songs plus a new battle mode for fun head to head gameplay!Once again you're a small time band starting off in your garage - or make that, your back yard. As you play through songs on your guitar controller, your career begins to take off. You make videos, play larger arenas, and earn money. The money lets you buy yourself new outfits and guitars. As you battle special players, you unlock their characters - like Slash from Guns 'N Roses.In every Guitar Hero game there have been songs I've liked and other songs I haven't liked. That's going to be true pretty much no matter who you are. They try their very best to provide a wide range of music to suit all guitar tastes, and they do an excellent job at it. Some of the songs are SUPER in this set and got me up off the couch dancing around while I played along.The new battle mode is a ton of fun. Before, you'd get a simple encore at the end of each set. This time you occasionally have to fight a newcomer for guitar supremacy. In battle mode you earn \"attacks\" that you can then lob at your opponent. These do things like break strings, make you play double notes, make your screen shake, and much more. It is super fun. Near the end of the game when you're down in \"Hades\", you have to battle the devil himself playing ... Devil went down to Georgia!There are of course the extras to unlock by doing things like playing 100 notes in a row, the ability to play against friends head to head locally, plus the new ability to play against others online! Talk about a true challenge! It was always scary enough looking at XBox Live and seeing how amazingly high some of those scores were. Imagine trying to play those people live?The graphics are great. Each location is fleshed out in fantastic detail, from the flickering flames of Hades to the glowing red lanterns of your back yard. The audience always seems a little robotic, but heck, how much do you want from a guitar game?Many of the songs are now original band-sung songs - including a Living Color song that the band re-recorded specifically for this game! There are still a collection of songs that are \"in the style of\" - some are good, some are really not so good. The Stevie Ray Vaughn song stands out as the not-so-good reproduction. Still, what can you do. Why aren't those bands giving the Guitar Hero guys permission to use their real tracks? Don't they know how immensely popular this game is?We do have the wireless guitar controller and it's worked pretty flawlessly so far. We've noticed a tiny amount of 'misses' with the red button, but that may be us getting used to it, we'll have to see.Highly, highly recommended. It was so much fun that my boyfriend, a guitar player, would occasionally try to play the \"real notes\" rather than the Guitar Hero game notes. It really is absorbing!Make sure you get TWO guitars to go with it, so you can play with a friend!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

Everythings A-OK with the Gamecube's controller, but if you're a newbie and mistakingly try to play with the remote and/or nunchick, you might wanna go back to Gamestop and shell out 20 for that classic or cube controller.Besides wonky new controle schemes, what else is new in the game are the shiny new Final Smash balls.

Mindless brawling turns into a mad dash to see who can get what is potentially your character's own unique powerhouse attack.

{"product_name":"B00006GSNY","reviewerName":"L. Blasiman","summary":"Old Fomula Refined","reviewText":"In a nutshell Raven Shield does a lot right in a pretty package but suffers from the same pitfalls of past games. The game sticks to the same winning formula of the past titles. For the most part this is a good thing.The first thing the player sees in the game is a number of slick looking menus. These have been revised from past games to make them more player friendly. They are all well done with dramatic music and familiar voice over. R6s' famous planning phase is intact and still not as easy to use as it should be. Clicking to place waypoints for your team seems easy enough until you click on an area that you can't put a waypoint at, like overlapping another waypoint. There is no indication that you can't do this, and in game it doesn't matter one way or another, there isn't a good reason why the game won't let you. It can get picky about other things, such as putting waypoints too close to walls or doors. Assigning your team to toss a [explosive item] in to a room can be tricky. You might want them to toss it clear across the room and find out that it's out of range or there is some object blocking LOS that is not obvious on the map. So you have to keep clicking on the map until you find a spot that the game will let you assign a [explosive item] toss waypoint to. You can avoid this pain in the neck if you use a default pre-made plan. There should be nothing that makes your own planning such a hassle however.Of course the actual meat of the game is the action. Rainbow Six really shines here for giving you a mix of stealth, suspense, loud gun battles, impressive [explosive item] effects, and team tactics. The new first person gun models look great.  The vast number of [firearms] all sound distinct and are very impressive. The HUD has been cleaned up and better laid out. Another new feature is adding other equipment to your [firearms], like a scope or a silencer. Your team can now be given dynamic orders outside the plan via an easy to use pop up menu. Watching them breach, flashbang and clear a room is interesting and just plain cool. With Ghost Recon it seems that Rainbow isn't going to be outdoors much. With the Unreal powered engine one would think they could toss in a few missions hunting down [criminal] camps. So most of the time you play a high tech SWAT team rather than a real spec-op unit.Not all is well. The AI is a hit or a miss, and this is usually a weak point for Red Storm. The enemy AI is very good. It will try to flank you, flush you out with [explosive item], and go for reinforcement or when they know they are out gunned they will surrender. Yet it doesn't do this in any clever manner. A [criminal] might run from a frag [explosive item], and run in to your team and get chopped down. Often they will [destroy] them selves with their own [explosive item]. Other things about how the AI reacts are erratic and break the illusion of competent enemies.However inconsistent the enemy AI is, your team's AI is worse. A lot worse. From getting stuck on doorways, grenading them selves, getting in your way, to just plain not paying attention and getting killed by a trigger happy bad guy. For some reason they all use full automatic with whatever gun you assign them. It's terrible to see your team fire off rounds and simply not hit anything. Nor can they slowly open doors. They just fling them wide open for all the tangos to see and fill with lead. Much of the game I had to plan my assault based on what my team couldn't do very well rather than what they could. Since they [end life] so easy, and you can't replace them, you might have to reload a dozen times before you get it right.Still this is done with some good graphics. Character models are made with lots of polygons and great textures. Some of the faces look photo realistic. The environments are richly detailed, even if you are indoor most of the game. Little things like footprints, steam from pipes (or bullet holes in pipes), detailed shadows, reflections in car windows, animated tree limbs and seeing the breath of your teammates on winter maps all paint a realistic feeling world. Oddly it seems that with the newest 3D engine they could have pushed it further. 3rd person [firearms] could use some more polygons, the sky is a simple skybox, nor are shadows as good as in Splinter Cell.One area that has really been improved is multiplayer. No longer are you bothered to log in to MSN to play. The game comes with an in-game search and browse screen. Setting up filters makes it easy to find the kind of game you want. Of course if MP isn't your bag, there is a nice single player custom mission option too.Overall this is solid game that features a range of features and great action worth checking out for weeks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2003"}

More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"George","summary":"A must buy!","reviewText":"I got this game when it first came out which was a couple years ago, but I'm just now writing the review, strange isn't it?

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Clash of the titans","reviewText":"When Midway first unveiled Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe, I thought it was an elaborate joke.  Turns out the joke was on me, as the game quickly shaped up to be something quite different indeed, as familiar faces from Midway's massively sucessful Mortal Kombat series unite with superheroes and supervillains from the pages of DC comic books.  The end result is pretty much a standard Mortal Kombat game, but that isn't such a bad thing, and as a whole, Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe is a blast.  On the Mortal Kombat side of things are fan favorite fighters like Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Kung Lao, Shang Tsung, Shao Khan, Baraka, Sonya, Kitana, Jax, and Kano; while the DC side offers up Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Lex Luthor, The Joker, Darkseid, Catwoman, Captain Marvel, and Deathstroke.  Seeing all these characters together in one game is brought to you by a goofy story from comic writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, but what's really surprising is how good the DC characters manage to mesh in with the MK universe.  The fighting system is rock solid, the game looks and flows spectecularly to boot, even if the violence level has been noticeably (and expectedly) toned down.  There's smooth online play as well, which is a big time plus as well.  All in all, Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe isn't without its flaws, but the game is a sheer blast regardless, and is definitely well worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2008"}

The graphics are incredible and the replay value is fantastic.I will say this though, if you don't have Xbox LIVE! then I don't really think this game is a good solo option.  Sure you can fly around all of these exotic locations and fire off your guns, but really, this game is all about LIVE!I have had this since Xmas and have played on the LIVE! service pretty much every day since then.  I tried playing the solo missions, but found it just wasn't enough (they are good to teach you the controls though).So once you hop onto the LIVE! service, you can choose your poison: Dogfight, Team Dogfight, Capture the Flag etc.  I have had very little lag issues with the service and must say, there is nothing like flying with 16 other planes in a dogfight over Chicago :) Not to mention hooking it up through your Dolby Digital Surround system to hear planes scream by you as you fly through their wreckage.This game alone is worth the price of admission to the LIVE! service.Get it and get LIVE!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2004"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Stick with your SP","reviewText":"I never thought that Nintendo could shrink the GameBoy any more, but once again they've managed to make the most compact handheld system even more compact.  The new GameBoy Micro, the sixth incarnation of the system since debuting in America, is astonishingly small and amazingly still features a sharp screen.  The battery power also lasts longer than the SP, and on it's own, the Micro is a great innovation of the classic system, but it's not without it's share of faults.  The biggest being that the Micro only plays current GBA games, and is not backwards compatible with old GameBoy games or even the GameBoy Color games like the SP is.  For GB owners who still love playing their old GameBoy games, this is a big downside, and if you already own an SP, there's really no reason to lay down the asking price for the Micro unless you want a more compact GameBoy and don't play any old games.  It's neat having a GameBoy this tiny, but if you own an SP, or even a DS (which also plays GBA games but doesn't play old GameBoy games), there's really no reason to pick this up unless you're a Nintendo fanboy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2005"}

Allow me to expalin...Let's lay out the facts: AWii Remote Controlleron its own is $39.99.  This Wii Remote + Wii Play game is $49.99.  In essence, you are paying $39.99 for the Wii Remote and the remaining $10 for the game packed in.Since you could just buy the remote separately what you really need to know is: \"If I want another Wii Remote, should I pay an extra $10 for the Wii Play game?\"The answer is NO.The Wii Play game is a collection of mini games in the vein of Wii Sports.  The catch is that this time the games have far, far less appeal.While we have logged countless hours on truly fun games like Wii Sports,Rayman Raving Rabbids, andMario Party 8, it took my wife and I only about 20 minutes to play through the entire Wii Play collection and not a single mini-game left us wanting to play it again.  In fact, each game on Wii Play reminded me of cheesy freeware games you can download or play online at \"cure for boredom\" sites.If, after reading this, you are still just dying to try it, I say: Borrow it from a friend.  No friends have it?  Ask yourself why.  Then, if you STILL want to play it, go rent it.  Spend $5 on a rental and discover for yourself that Wii Play has no \"Rii\" Play value.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2007"}

YES!) and immediately struggled with what game to buy for our 7 and 3 1/2 year olds...we wanted something we could all play together, and something that wouldn't be too challenging. After a lot of debating and searching, Wii Play was chosen (mainly because it came with another wiimote).This is the perfect game for people just learning how to use the Wii. The whole purpose of the game is for you to learn how to controlt the wiimote. You learn how to twist it, and get comfortable learning how to play in 3D. Pool, however, is ADDICTIVE. My husband and I have spent a few nights now trying to out-do each other.Surprisingly, finding the Miis is the favorite game of both of my children. They love trying to find the Mii the fastest and giggling ensues once they start playing. I realized quickly that it's great for them both, as it helps them to concentrate and look closely. Riding the cows is also a favorite, and I often walk in to find them on the floor laughing so hard they can barely breathe.I am extremely glad we got WiiPlay, and know that no matter how many other games we buy, we'll be playing the mini-games on this for a long, long time!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2007"}

I consider this a game in that category.  Having played two of the previous games, I have to say that the graphics, and more importantly the controls, are far superior in this iteration.The problem is the setting and the environment.  This game is very seedy and would probably be the equivalent of a straight to dvd R-rated movie, too many expletives without much context.  Where are the missions like in the past games where you go into foreign countries taking out some general, or the great White House mission.  Now it's one dank alley after another taking out sleazebags without any context.The game play also has some issues.  I think the developers lacked imagination and for that reason only included a few open ended &#34;hitman&#34; scenarios.  Many of the levels are not assassination scenarios, but rather sneak and escape.  Single start point, single exit point, multiple corners and paths, you choose the path from A to B, through a maze of enemies and civilians.I'll only play when I have more extra time, but this game does not draw me back at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2013"}
