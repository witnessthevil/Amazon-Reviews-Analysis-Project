{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Dearth Of Competitive Matchups","reviewText":"When it comes to the Madden video game franchise, I am pretty easy to please.  I don't get into the \"game modes\" hardly at all, but instead prefer spirited exhibitions with my friends and family.  As long as the controls are good and we can all have fun playing it, I'm good to go.For reasons I have yet (if ever) to determine, though, this year's Madden 13 has not produced competitive matchups whatsoever, with the games usually either over by halftime or punctuated by a string of one frustration after another.  Primarily, there are two main flaws I see with this game that (at least in the early stages of playing) make it more of a chore than an experience:1.  The \"little bugs\" that just continue to aggravate players.  For example, skipping the instant replay after each play will (for some reason) remove the play clock from the play-calling screen.  The only way to get it back is to press start and then resume the game.  I've actually resorted to playing without a play-clock, as it seems to run insanely fast to begin with.  Also, often times one has to click the control stick upwards of 15 times to get a kick or punt to work.2. The gameplay seems to be shifted far too much towards defense and the running game.  For example, good luck trying to pass your way down the field.  Any roll out from the QB and the corresponding DE will immediately break off his block and close in for the sack.  Then, any pass itself has about a 50-50 chance of being picked in a variety of extraordinary fashions.  If you play with a team like the Ravens (crushing defense) or the Vikings (Adrian Peterson), all you have to do is run pretty much every play and you will be guaranteed a victory.Overall, Madden 13 has been (for the first time in a very long time) a truly disappointing experience.  I can't quite put my finger on exactly why this is (as the game still looks great and the controls are basically the same as always), but SOMETHING is obviously different that severely limits the ability of two people to have a really fun game against each other.I sincerely hope that either I get used to the new experience (however unlikely), or changes are made for the next edition.  This franchise represents roughly 75% of the video gaming I do these days, and it is sad that I can't even fully enjoy it anymore.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2012"}

Square Enix and Jupiter team up once again to showcaseThe World Ends With You, a trendy and vibrant gaming experience developed exclusively for the Nintendo DS. Featuring an intuitive combat system and exciting multiplayer mode,The World Ends With Youis set to immerse gamers into the modern-day culture of Japan.StoryThe story begins as Neku Sakuraba, an unsociable 15-year-old boy, unexpectedly wakes up in the Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, Japan. While trying to piece together his rude awakening, he receives a strange text message warning him that he will cease to exist unless he accomplishes a certain mission.

Certainly, TWEWY features an experience-building system, like most RPGs. But this is where the comparisons end--the main character uses pins to fight with crazy psychic abilities. And there's hundreds of pins in the game, many of which can be \"evolved\" into more-powerful pins, a la Pokemon style.Also, characters don't exactly build up strength and defense--players have to feed their characters food to upgrade their stats. However, they can only attain these abilities by digesting the food. And the only way to digest it is to fight battles. So in this aspect, TWEWY is like a Tamagotchi simulation.Believe it or not, the battle system adds plenty of insane twists as well. Players battle with two characters. The character on the top screen is controlled with the four-directional D-pad, while the bottom character is controlled with stylus movements. It's almost too daunting to learn how to multi-task, but it IS doable. More importantly, players get rewarded for their mad skills with a letter grade, a la Dance Dance Revolution style. Thus, high ranking players will receive more PP experience if they defeat monsters as quickly as possible and getting as little damage inflicted on their characters as possible.Even the armor system is a fully customizable clothing system. Players won't get the extra abilities for their clothing unless they visit the right vendor who loves wearing the clothes. Store owners won't offer all the clothes in their inventory unless players shop 'till they drop.With that said though, one might wonder how the storyline fits in with all these customizable systems. And it does. The main character, Neku, is a loner trapped in an alternate dimension of the Shibuya shopping district in Tokyo. He has seven days to survive the games in the Underground alternate dimension, or he will be erased (Don't worry, players don't have to finish the game in a week).He has no choice but to befriend people to fight with him, so that he can escape back into the real world. However, the storyline takes some intensely dramatic twists and turns, as Neku tries to remember how he came to be trapped in this dimensions. The story encompasses everything, from death to rebirth.It's almost daunting how much material is in this game. However, this makes this video game an excellent, entertaining mix of hip J-Pop music, blending together with a flashy stylus-twirling battle system and a dramatic, emotionally moving storyline. And there's so many extras that players will want to play more and more.As I said, it's too incredible. Incredibly beautiful, that is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2009"}

You can now install the game onto you hard disk and this makes a world of difference. The load times are hardly noticable now. They are still there but no more than other games. No more loading when you pick up and item or when you pause the game or a long one before you watch a cutscene. The install is a few gigs of extra space but its worth it.I haven't encountered any framerate drops like some of the game review sites mentioned. I also think this patch cuts down on screen tearing a little bit. That might just be me though.The reason I didn't give this game five star overall is because the story is blah and the voice acting isn't good and the way the main caracter stands when she's not moving is just a little over the top.

This is to first-person shooters/adventure games what Final Fantasy VII was to RPGs, or Gran Turismo was to racing. It tells a tale that has echoes of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", one that most people can relate to - of living in security while giving up one's freedoms, and of ultimately tiring of it all and attempting to undermine it. Mirror's Edge, in a way, touches on the security measures being taken in today's world for the sake of \"security\" while keeping the thin story personal and relatable. Yes, the plot is thin, but it is told in a clear, concise way that is easy to understand - but more difficult to unravel.There are questions raised that end the game on a massive sequel hook: who is Callaghan and what does he really want for the City? What will become of Faith and her sister? Will the Shard's servers stay down long enough for a rebellion to stir? The questions, as of yet, have no answers, and hopefully, eventually, the game will see the sequel it deserves.Do not be fooled by the naysayers complaining of short length and thin plot: the game's strengths lie in the freedom of the parkour and freerunning disciplines, where the only obstacles are momentum, gravity, and, occasionally, level design. The first time the player clears a gap fifty stories up, or runs across a pair of cranes while being pursued by the city's defense force, or chains together a series of free-flowing, gravity-defying moves to make their way across a wall and over a fence will suddenly clear up any doubts the newcomer may have.\"Mirror's Edge\" is unlike any game made before or since, a master combination of realistic physics and the sensation of flying that could only be duplicated properly by the game's original developers. A definite perfect ten.------------Upon downloading the demo from the PlayStation Network, I immediately became addicted to Mirror's Edge. The full game is even better: though deceptively short and oftentimes downright aggravating, the beautiful visuals and unique perspective manage to crush such nitpicks the majority of the time.Faith is a Runner, a \"courier\" of sorts in a police state very similar to 1984's dystopian setting. Though the first mission has her doing what she lives to do - delivering a package - she is then swept up in desperate search to find out why the police are so \"trigger happy\" lately, and to bail her sister out from being unjustly imprisoned. The result is a fast-paced adventure across some of the most beautiful and glossy architecture ever seen in video games.What is most attractive about this game is its twist on the first-person perspective. Faith's body is visible: her hands and feet regularly pop into frame when jumping, kicking, falling, and especially rolling. For a first-time run through the training level, the effect can give a slight touch of motion sickness. For example, to break a fall and keep momentum, Faith must tuck and roll when she hits the ground. The camera rolls with her and can be disorienting, if not sickening, for the newcomer. Though the effect takes some getting used to, it is a very freeing experience - unconstrained by holding weapons, where the only thing holding you back is momentum and gravity. It's a game where the goal is actually to AVOID combat - picking up a weapon actually tends to take away from the experience - by scaling walls or finding creative ways t sneak around hostiles.Some of the levels can feel a bit long, especially when the player is caught off guard and is forced to make a snap decision, usually resulting in sudden death. Thankfully, for the most part, the checkpoint system is quite generous. Also, there are collectible, known as \"bags\", hidden throughout the city, making more than one playthrough necessary. Unlocking Hard difficulty (and therefore earning some bragging rights) requires a playthrough on either Easy or Normal, though I highly recommend starting with Easy on the first time through. Removing the targeting reticle also increases the sense of realism, which is already fairly high as it is: everything Faith can do is called \"parkour\" and is possible to perform in real life.Where the game truly shines, though, is in the Speed Run and Time Trial sections. Speed Running is where the player runs a level already finished in the campaign to attempt to beat the clock. Time Trials are basically checkpoint races where the player's reflexes, agility, and ingenuity will be tested. The free map \"Synthesia\" is quirky and beautiful, and there are seven maps available on the PSN (for [..]) that feature twelve additional Time Trial races.Though the plot is lacking and the game is short, these are hardly problematic in the grand scheme of things. The biggest problems will be the first time through, such as struggling to find a way to escape from armed cops and having to die numerous times before finally discovering the escape route. I have lost count of how many times I have perished for not hitting a wall just right for a wall run, or having Faith's normally sticky fingers miss a critical leap. Still, the requirement to find multiple routes and get creative makes for a fascinating, if occasionally frustrating, game experience.The visuals are beautifully rendered in primary colors in full 720p HD. Though the character models are a little over-detailed for the generally textureless architecture, and the Flash-animated cutscenes can be jarring, it's often tempting to just stand on a ledge and gaze at the white buildings below. Stairwells, doors, elevators, and pathways are colored in bright primaries such as red, green, blue, and yellow. Object models are very nicely built. Motion capture, as well as facial expressions (in-game engine only), tend to fall a little bit into the \"uncanny valley\", but otherwise the game suffers little in terms of telling its tale. The music is often exciting and unique with no truly \"annoying\" tracks. The game's theme alone, \"Still Alive\", is itself worthy of \"single\" status.It's a shame the likelihood of a sequel is so low now, as the game obviously works and really could use only a few minor tweaks. Still, as it stands, Mirror's Edge is a great game and a good way to waste some hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"If only the campaign was longer","reviewText":"When I first played the beta, I did not want this game. It is too much like BFBC2, I thought. Then, I saw the advertisements and videos. I decided to give the game a try.Single player - The single player was better than I expected. I liked the missions, though I did not completely understand the story's plot. Still, the alternative missions between the Tier 1 Ops and the Rangers keeps things interesting. The cutscenes gives players a cinematic experience of the the game. The first couple of missions are a little stale. However, the experience gets really intense, and dangerous, once you fight in the mountains, huts, and valleys of Afghanistan. On those missions, mass amounts of enemies come out at random. They are not the most tactful enemy, but they fight in numbers, which can be really dangerous. The mission \"Friends From Afar\" was the best sniping mission I have played on a video game bar none. You owe it to yourself to experience that mission. Calling in airstrikes, riding a quad at night, and flying the Apache adds more variety to the game, as well.The realism of Medal of Honor made me feel a part of the action. Despite opinions, the graphic are superb. The various landscapes of Afghanistan makes the player feel as if he was there. The sound is just great, but not as good as BFBC2. Still, I cannot get enough of shooting it out with the Taliban. The sound of gun fire has authenticity, which makes the player feel as if they are in a real live shootout. Not to mention, I like hearing the sound of reloading the weapons. Hearing the bullets hit substances, such as bricks and rocks is the most authentic sound I have ever heard in a first person shooter. Despite the opinions, the guns had much recoil. I realized this when I pressed down on the trigger, and my shots were not as accurate, as opposed to tapping the trigger. I loved the sliding feature for the players. Many times, this came in handy, while under heavy fire. Moving in the prone position was very realistic. The camera goes from side to side, as if you were really moving about in the prone.The environments are interactive like BFBC2. However, they are not as much. On some missions, you cannot always just sit in one place. Many parts of the environment can be destroyed. The characters communication with each other made the experience realistic, as well. They help you, tremendously. Sometimes, they pick off enemies, without having to shoot one, yourself. Not to mention, they keep enemies busy, so the player can flank or go for easy kills.Multiplayer - The multiplayer is much better than the beta, as well as BFBC2. The graphics are vastly improved. The weapons actually look like REAL weapons. The maps are smaller, but nobody wants to just run marathons, just so they can engage in combat. The multiplayer relies more on teamwork, rather than being a lone wolf. Sometimes, being a lone wolf is possible. However, that strategy may not always bring success. Pace must be slow, and corners must be constantly watched. COD noos, beware!!! Combat Mission is the best multiplayer mode, in my opinion. Players must obtain various objectives, while the opposing side must defend them. The action is intense. Not to mention, it does not feel as if you are playing multplayer, while playing Combat Misson.The coolest part of multiplayer is the use of the support actions aka killstreaks in this game. A player can get up to seven offensive and defensive support actions. Not to mention, the player can use them ALL with continuous kills, unlike COD. I have actually done this. The seven offensive support actions are Mortar Strike, Rocket Attack, Missle, Artillery, Strafing Run, Air Strike, and Cruise Missile. The player can decide to choose a defensive support action, which helps his team, such as the UAV, Ammo I, Armor I, Ammo II, Jammer, Ammo III, and Armor III. Who would've thought a game could have perks, which help your teammates out? An example of how the defensive actions works is if a player chooses an actions, such as Armor I, the team will receive flak vest. If the player chooses Ammo I, the team will have stronger bullets. Keep in mind, both support actions cannot be chosen at the same time. The player must decide on an offensive or defense support action.The downside of multiplayer is you must select from weapons, which are a part of the team you are playing for. Why couldn't EA just made it, which player can choose any weapon, no matter what team they are playing on? There is not a vast amount of weapons to choose from. Sometimes, it takes entirely too many shots to drop someone. There have been times, which I had to hit a person multple times for a HEAD shot. Not to mention, there are not a ton of maps. The grenades explode too quickly. Sometimes, I will throw a grenade, without cooking, and it will explode in mid-air.Sniping is very easy in the multiplayer. It requires no skill, unlike COD. This is why sniper rifles is the weapons of choice for most players. They just sit and pick you off, very easily. This issue can make the multiplayer experience very unplayable. Sometimes, it is hard to decipher enemy from team players, which can cause many deaths. I would recommend gaining knowledge of the maps, so you can find out where opposing players like to snipe.Another issue is the spawn points have been figured out by many players. Don't be surprised to get picked off, right after spawning. Plus, you and your players may be pinned in one location, and if you peek or try to go to another location, your sniped. They would've been better off giving the player the option to go prone. Not being able to go prone gives the advantage to the snipers. Why have prone in one game mode, and not the other? That makes no sense.With all of this in mind, I am uncertain to what the replay value will be for the multiplayer in a couple of months, especially when Black Ops reigns. Overall, the multiplayer has the realism, but not the level of excitement, which COD has. EA really needs a patch for the multiplayer. However, the experience is very rewarding, once the player learns the tactics of multiplayer.The Verdict - Overall, the game is a good and realistic experience. Despite the excitement of the single player, it was waaaay too short. This is what really disappointed me most about this game. The creator of the game said the single player was eight hours. I would say it is about 4-5 at the most. I would have expected a lot more for paying $60. After the last mission, I thought, \"is that it!?\" I wanted to keep battling. Just recently, the price has gone down on the game, which makes this game even more worth purchasing. However, I give the game a rating of four because of the short campaign.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2010"}

I like playing cell phone games on my TV. So when I first got this a day after launch I hated it. I wanted to throw it out the window because setting it up the way I wanted it to work was a drag. The performance was and still is below what it should be for the specs. This console was supposed to be easily hackable. I would hack my friggin toaster if I could. I own tons of devices that I have hacked so it's nothing new to me. I gave up trying to hack this thing. Pushing super user onto it was a fail. I did get it running cwm which was easy but as far as it being easy to hack. Forget it. Okay so emulators now. Two systems that are important to me are ps1 and n64 which my free cell phone run fine. Ugh. Mupen 64 is okay but I wanted to be able to side load n64oid and run it the way it runs on my nexus 7 and my cell phone. Not happening. It's possible to run okay but not worth the hassle of changing the settings for each game. Now fpse which is an emulator that runs great on all my devices and is the emulator on the ouya store. It lags and the only way to get it running smooth is by selecting software rendering mode which makes the games look awful! So I side loaded epsxe and that works okay but games like wipeout Xl and ridge racer lag a bit causing the gameplay to be unplayable. Some racing games are good because the controls are easier but ridge racer and wipeout are important to me so I hope the issues are addressed. Side loading apps is a pain but does make the purchase worth the fight. Mame4droid reloaded works great and plays all the 2d mortal kombats full speed with some tweaking. All the .emu emulators work great! Onlive works great. A couple games on the ouya store are nice. Most of those are just mobile ports. Tegra games like the conduit HD can be side loaded and work great. I think the sandbox idea can be fun. I like checking out the games and thumbing up the ones I like to help out the devs.  I don't have many issues with the controller except the d-pad and lack of a start a select button. The touch pad is a pain. However the controller doesn't feel cheap to me. 8 gigs of memory is not enough as well. It's nice to be able to expand with USB storage but it can't be used for apps. If you want people to download apps from your store you will need more then 8 gigs. Which you really don't even get 8 gigs. It's only a little over five. The WiFi is bad you will need Ethernet and there are over scan issues. The menus are ugly and they are not very understandable. Also it's odd that this \"open\" device has encrypted HDMI ports to stop people from recording gameplay. All in all the experience I'm having with it now that all the backbreaking work is out of the way is great but I can't reccomend this device to most people. Also the backer thing is messed up. Other then that this device is a pain in the butt that is only possible to be used by massive tech nerds. Consoles are supposed to be easy experiences.

I've only ever played one Star Wars game (Jedi Knight Pathways to the Force) that I completely fell in love with. I think I only saw half of one Star Wars movie when I was little (the one with Darth Mual) so I didn't really get the plot-I just played. That game used a gun, though. I've always wanted to try playing a video game where I could swing a lightsaber (again, I only saw half of one Star Wars movie so sorry if I spelled lightsaber wrong) at my opponent. I wasn't going to buy the Clone Wars game so I gave the brand I trusted a shot. My favorite characters would be Qui-Gon Jinn and Yoda-I don't even know who Qui-Gon Jinn is or if I even spelled his name right! The little cutscenes are easy to follow, although it was quite upsetting when x's appeared on Qui-Gon Jinn's eyes, (him being my favorite Jedi) in the first episode. The worst episode would be the last one (the one with Luke Skywalker) because that one doesn't have too many lightsaber action. When you actually swing the Wii-mote, the lightsabers move at your Wii-command! You swing, your character swings. You defend, your character defends. There are also many characters to unlock, buy, and choose from. This game is worth the buy--5 out of 5!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2009"}

It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor loaded with 10 MB of embedded DRAM, 48-way parallel floating-point dynamically scheduled shader pipelines and Unified shader architecture. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for great looking games in standard TV definition, and even better thanks to built-in support for HDTV 1080i televisions. It also supports the widescreen 16:9 format.The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays both the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For game-save and media storage, users can choose between the detachable and upgradeable 20GB hard drive, or a separately sold 64MB flash Memory Unit. Along with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 backward-compatible with part of the existing Xbox game library.Control your GameplayXbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and Start buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox Guide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user interface.

The console itself includes 3 usb ports. which comes handy when you need to charge your controller, ipod, or anything you wanna plug into it. with the 360, you can download various tv shows, movies, games, and xbox themes to your console. in addition to that, you also can use your xbox to listen to your ipod via usb connection. or if you dont have an ipod you can sync your xbox to your computer and have it play the music off of your cpu onto your 360.

Over the past 4 years, I've tried numerous other mice including its more recent relatives from Logitech (such as the G9), and have kept running back to my trusty G7.So what do I think about the G500?Let's say that my G7 has not been used since I laid palm on this new mouse. Or, in engineering terms:G500 = G7 + custom_buttons - wireless;Where do I start with the praise?1. Ergonomics==============The ergonomics of this mouse are absolutely identical to the G7. The G500 has a natural curve that fills my palm as if it were designed for me. This is a make-or-break feature for mice, and my brief flirtation with the G9 ended when I just couldn't get over its flat form factor.2. Additional Buttons=====================It adds scads of fully programmable buttons, all positioned in very easy to reach locations. They really show me how constrained I was with the single thumb button on the G7.Even more cool, the scroll wheel actually does function as three distinct buttons now. In the G7, I've had trouble with programming the scroll wheel click, left shift, and right shift to separate actions, because the mouse would invariably confuse a shift action with a scroll click. Not any more. The G500 interprets these crisply and clearly.3. Hyper Fast Scrolling=======================The free rolling scroll wheel seems to be much more improved from the G9. I can't imagine living without it any more. This is truly a programmer's best friend. I'm able to cruise through the longest of source files, stopping instantly when something catches my eye.4. SetPoint===========The current SetPoint version is way more advanced - and I absolutely love it. Button functions can be customized almost infinitely. Choices range from basic functions such as scrolling; to more advanced functions such as closing a window, pulling up an active window selector, launching a program, or showing and restoring the desktop; and to power functions such as supporting custom key strokes and macros.This is what makes this truly a programmer's dream mouse.(I hate to admit that I have spent more time configuring this thing than I normally do, and that I've loved every minute of it!)5. Aesthetics==============The design on the top of the mouse is truly attractive. Not that I spend a lot of time staring at mice, but this one looks really professional and arty, giving my G7s a serious inferiority complex.What I'm not too enamored by?1. Corded-ness==============I absolutely love the freedom that comes from owning a cordless mouse. The G7 is truly a marvel with  twin battery packs that can be exchanged so that you always have one ready to use, and with an amazing range. Being tethered cramps my style. However, if I'm going to be bound, then the G500's excellent quality cord (which has a fabric weave to it) would be the way I'd go. The jury is still out on this one though. I'd readily give up wireless for the customization, but why oh why is this an either-or?2. Weights==========I've never understood the fascination with customized weights for mice. Don't get me wrong, its a cool idea, and may be material for some users. It just doesn't do much for me. Even though I have played FPS and strategy games over marathon sessions, this was never on the top of my wish list.I simply got my G500 to weigh as close to my G7 as I could and I was done.3. The new position of the DPI buttons=======================================I'm okay with having to launch SetPoint to change the DPI, so I normally reprogram these buttons to more useful functions. However, the G500 moves these buttons to the head of the mouse, making them awkward to use. I personally would have preferred having these moved down to the right edge.Conclusion==========I absolutely love this mouse.In my opinion this is the absolute best mouse currently available for right handers, with large hands, who prefer to cup, rather than claw, their mice.I'd have preferred a cordless version, but this mouse is a wonderful next step along the transformation path of the lowly point-and-click device, into a multipurpose swiss-army-knife type tool.This is a worthwhile replacement for a G7. However, if you currently use a G9, you might want to check out the G9X instead. I found the ergonomics of the G9/G9X to be vastly different to the G7/G500.Happy Mousing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYYEK","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"just the best multiplayer experience!  pure awesome!!!","reviewText":"I won't go into the minutiae of the game.  There are plenty of reviews for that.  The bottom line is you like dancing at all and if you liked DDR, Dance Central 1, or the Just Dance series, you have to buy Dance Central 2!  It improved on DC1 in so many ways (and Dance Central 1 is already an awesome game as it is).  The only weakness now is that there is no online multiplayer but no other dance games provide that option except for Zumba Fitness so hopefully DC3 can address that.I will detail what my friends and I have found that we love and probably isn't covered by most reviews.  Had a DC2 party last night and everyone loved it so much more than DC1 (though they loved DC1 way back in the day).The best new feature to them was the fact that you can sign into 4 profiles and you can rotate through profiles easily (had each of them go through KinectID so that there was facial recognition). Just step up and bam, the Kinect recognizes the person and provides scoring for that unique individual.  In DC1, everyone pretty much played under 1 profile.  You can also set up different difficulty levels for different people so the great dancer doesn't have to do easy steps or the average dancer doesn't have to feel under duress with difficult steps.The soundtrack is just awesome this time. They all mentioned how they liked this soundtrack more and I agree. Did the song import as well so people like all your Dance Central songs in one place, using 1 disc.The other great new feature they liked but caused us minor problems some time was the automatic drop-in/drop-out feature. If there are 2 people playing and one person sits down, he drops out and there's only single player dancing. If a second player stands in the frame, he joins in and the players are dancing side by side on the screen. But in the beginning (since this was a new game to us), when we had people switching, we weren't quick in switching people so it would drop to single player and then back to multiplayer. That was a little disorienting on the screen so this time we made sure people didn't drop out during a song or we made sure people switched fast (no indecisiveness!).And the tutorials section is better as well. Now you can practice just the moves you are having problems with, without having to go through the entire tutorial.For those interested in dancing as exercise, now you can set up playlists and have nonstop dancing.  This was a weakness of DC1 because in DC1, you had to pick a song after each song was completed so there was a downtime of about a minute between songs (choosing the song, the difficulty, etc.).You can also now record videos and upload pics/videos to the Net.  In DC1, it took pictures of your dancing but it stayed on your Xbox.There's just so much that makes DC2 truly superior to all dance games out there to cover.  I get excited just thinking of the fun I've had in the brief time I've had the game.  Now I can conquer the steps for all my DC songs and then can go back to DC1 to finish it and get all the achievements for that game (now that you can tailor your tutorials completely).And just one more tidbit to finish this off:The most crazy thing is one of my friends never plays video games. His aunt bought him a PS2 way back in the day when it was well over $200, and it sat under his bed until his friend found it. He then sold it to his friend for something like $100 (when it was still hot and going for over $200).  He bought a Wii since everyone else got one but he never used it.And now, he's going to pick up a 360 with Kinect after playing around with DC2, DC1, KS2, KS1, and Lips. He's big into rapping so he'll probably get Def Jam Rapstar as well. This might be the first system that he actually plays and enjoys.  The cool thing is I made zero sales pitch because I knew he didn't play video games, but he got excited anyway and plans to pick up a system, just because of Dance Central 2 (well, also because of Lips and Kinect Sports 1 and 2).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000NJH6YG","reviewerName":"mkllby","summary":"It takes a little while","reviewText":"I rented this one (thankfully) and all I can say is I understand the people who completely hate it and the ones that like it. Everyone is right and for today's standard the graphics are pretty bad though by no means make the game unplayable. As for the voice acting....personally I think it may be the best part. I have been laughin' my butt off for hours and hours thinking about it. Then again I am not sure that the makers really intended it to be joke, even so it is freakin' hilarious. Yes the inventory system is just barely tolerable as everyone has reported and I will be honest after 5 minutes of playing this game I turned off my system and never planned on playing it again. Thanks to a rather boring weekend, I picked it back up and played for a while and all I can say is despite its many many many shortcomings this game does kind of grow on you and almost becomes fun to play. I think the reason for this is the story. While not engrossing, it is at least a tad interesting and seems to move along at a pretty decent pace. Honestly to me the story here is better than Oblivion, which I found to be very slow and boring. Though if comparing the two(as everyone seems to want to do) that is definitely the only place where this game is better than Oblivion. Though I have never completed Oblivion I still play it occassionally just to walk around and enjoy the breath-taking world Bethesda created......you definitely won't find yourself doing that with this one.Overall my suggestion is rent this one to see if you like it and definitely give it some time. It takes some getting used to without a heck of a lot of guidance (tutorials). If you give it some time I think you will find that even though it isn't a great game it definitely isn't as bad as a lot of people are making it sound. And DEFINITELY don't comapre it to Oblivion because you will more than likely be really really let down.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Robert evans","summary":"GOt it but","reviewText":"When Ever I get to the undercity and talk to mission avo my game keeps freezing when it loads every time i go to the sewers or any place thats in the undercity.

While I thought it was rather simple, I soon corrected myself once I took a closer at the internal workings. First of all, the graphics are quite nice for the Super NES. Yeah, it is rather pixelated, but the cartoon style and wonderful effects make up for it. The also game is quite complicated for it's time. The 3-layer engine runs around 7 different tilesets each with diffrent scenery and enemies, and the complicated isometric map screen runs even more. To top that off, enemy generators and scrolling varations are almost always used. The heavy use of flags and scripts on the map screen make the game even more amazingly complex. However, even to people who aren't interested in Mario's internal engine design, Mario World is still every bit enjoyable. The levels come in all shapes and styles with creative enemies to match. Mario World introduced Yoshi, the dinosaur pal Mario can ride on and make eat enemies. Yoshi is vital to the game if you want to win it. Mario World also introduced many other memorable elements that make Mario the most awesome platformer around: Ghost Houses, Switch Palaces, Secret Exits, Star World, Bowser's Koopa Clown Car, Renzor, etc. Your not a real gamer until you've felt the magic of the world and suffered the burn of the challenges. If you think Nintendo is going to be soft and hold your hand like in New Super Mario Bros 2, your in for a big surprise. Nintendo was a completely different company back when the Super NES was launched, and Mario World is proof of that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Gorgeous, but still a rental","reviewText":"Bioshock 2 follows Subject Delta, a prototype of the Big Daddies, awakened in Rapture ten years after the war, to find it recreated by Dr. Sophia Lamb, who is trying to create a Utopia, and who kidnapped Delta's Little Sister Eleanor. The story manages to avoid several cookie-cutter plot twists nicely, and there are quite a few points that fleshed out in the background to make the plot almost as good as the first incarnation.Graphics are as to be expected, though the introduction of the undersea areas is a nice addition. The enemies could have been better detailed, and show little improvement. Audio is similarly spot on, though underdeveloped, but containing a few gems that'll definitely make you smile.Gameplay has probably the weirdest set of problems. You can not revisit earlier levels, for no apparent reason apart from a particular stage, forcing you to scour every level rather than explore at your leisure. Despite being a Big Daddy, you don't seem to possess the same abilities, and the other Daddies have attacks that're appealing and would be very useful.Another bizarre point that has been worse from the first volume is the gathering of Adam, the magic goo of the game. Despite being a supposedly balanced good/evil setup, there is zero reason to go evil. Not only do you get the feel good points, but you wind up earning more for doing the right thing, making the evil path not only so warped that you feel like you should turn yourself into the police, but you're also handicapping yourself later in the game. The new interaction of the Little Sisters is well inserted, and stops just short of being grinding, though protecting yourself from every angle of ambush is at times incredibly frustrating.Despite being fantastic, this is still only worth a rent, unless you're a fan of the MP, otherwise this is a title that can easily be completed in 2-3 days. Good, solid story, gameplay with a few kinks ironed out, and a setting that you still love carried over well, this is definitely worth it, but sadly not worth buying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000099T2G","reviewerName":"W. Scott Heitman","summary":"Underrated and Misunderstood","reviewText":"I held off on buying this game because I read all the reviews when the game came out.  The prognosis was not good.  It was getting very mediocre scores.  In addition, many reviewers seemed to dislike the control scheme.  Naturally, when I picked it up, I wasn't expecting much.20 minutes later, my jaw was resting solidly on the floor.  Several things impressed me greatly:1. The whole game is set up like a dvd.  The menu has new game, load game, scene selection, special features, and options.  All of these, except for load game, match up with what you would find on a dvd.  The scene selection, which lets you go to any scene of the game you've already been to, especially makes this obvious, and all of the menus have a certain flair to them.2.  If the menus weren't enough of a hint, the very decent voice acting, cinematics, and full score continue the impression that the player is actually playing AND watching a Jet Li movie.  The game has the flow of a movie as well (as long as you don't get bogged down in any one place).3.  The gameplay...yeah, this is where my jaw was dropping to the floor.  The analog attack system is really a lot of fun.  I wouldn't want it applied to every game, but it really fits this game well.  The moves just look incredible...and there are so many hidden moves that require a bit of experimentation.  In addition, there are scene specific moves that use the environment....some are pretty spectacular.  I've played through once...my guess is that I missed some, so I'll have to go through again :D  When certain moves are performed, the game goes into a slow-mo cinematic....yeah, again, jaw-dropping.I think reviewers gave the game low scores because A) they aren't open to innovative control schemes (some places gave Mark of Kri bad reviews), B) the short length, and C) many professional reviewers have forgotten how to have fun.The only real flaw I can see with this game is it's length.  It won't take the average gamer longer than 6-7 hours max to beat.  Some stuff unlocks after you beat the game...new difficulty, costumes, etc.- there is some incentive to play through a second time (or third? anybody?), but the game itself is pretty short.  Still, this is a game that I will keep.  I typically turn games in after beating them if they haven't really wowed me; this one has earned a permanent place on my shelf!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"(4.5) Another Great Link Adventure","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Absolutely charming atmosphere; rock solid gameplay; clever puzzles; awesome music; great weaponsTHE BAD: May be too short and easy for Zelda veterans; backtracking through some areas can be tedious; some puzzles and objectives are too vagueDIFFICULTY: EasyWith the amount of countless Zelda games out there, it can be easy for one to overlook the gem on the GBA. Still, if you own a GBA, this Link adventure should definitly be on your wishlist.The story revolves around the again mute Link having to rescue princess Zelda (real original, huh?) from the evil mysterious Vaati (no Ganon here), who has won a sword tournament, but then turns the princess to stone in order to abstract the Light Force which she carries to use to gain great powers. Link meets up with Ezlo (the minish cap) who was once human. The cap has the power to shrink Link and to visit lands in which the Minish live (the Minish being tiny little mousy people). Anyways, Link must collect 4 sacred elements to fuse with his sword in order to undo Zelda's spell.On to the game! You'll start off with only 3 life hearts and a basic sword and shield. From this, you have to explore around 15 areas which are all connected but not yet accessible, each with their own brands of fantastic music, some remixed from older Zelda games. The game goes back to the top down view of the original Legend of Zelda game, so it's really easy to navigate around Hyrule and see various areas which you can view later. You will eventually meet with the Minish cap who will more or less guide you to what areas you're supposed to go (or just remind you, as he annoyingly doesn't offer much information beyond that). So in true Zelda game form, you must go from area to area, find certain items to upgrade your weaponry and strength, you learn various attack abilities, and even collect these pieces of Kinstones, which can be used to fuse with other people's (or things) Kinstones and offer various bonus items like money, health, secret passages, etc. Once you have certain items you must backtrack to other areas and progress from there. Thankfully the in-game menu is short and to the point, very easy to navigate through and the maps couldn't do a better job. What's great about all this is the game's ability to keep things fresh. Some objectives are more like puzzles, and although some may be too vague (prepare to sometimes have no choice but to check internet walkthroughs), the rewards are great.The ability for Link to shrink when walking upon certain stumps leaves another entire world to explore - the world of the Minish. The first time I stepped up onto the wood boarded ceilings of Hyrule town's shops and cafe's with candles and shoes towering over me, and able to look down up the store, I was absolutely charmed. It's really like living out some sort of kid's fantasy, like becoming as small as a bug and exploring a whole different world. This along with the game's cute sense of humor, and overall adorable townspeople will have you smiling all the way to the end.As stated before, there are 4 sacred elements to collect, each hidden behind dungeon levels. Now, the puzzles get a lot heavier during these areas, as you'll not only have to use certain weapons and abilities to figure out how to progress through these areas, but also have to figure out exactly how to beat each boss and exploit their cleverly disguised weaknesses. But what was a bit distressing about these areas is that at times progressing through them would be so vague that after you finally get the answer from some internet walkthrough you'll be telling yourself how you would probably NEVER have figured it out on your own. Fortunately, these times are few and far between. Most puzzles are extremely well designed and will give your brain a good dose of excersize (though never extremely heavy).Now, while going through this adventure was definitely enjoyable, it wasn't very hard. I would say through the entire playthrough of the game, I died only two or three times (once being a complete idiotic fluke). Money is VERY easy to find so being able to collect health power ups is never a problem. Zelda veterans may be dissappointed with this aspect, as well as that the game's overall scope isn't too big, the game will take roughly 10 or 15 hours to complete (maybe less if you don't partake in any optional side missions or backtracking). You can tell this game was trying to build a bridge between the hardcore and casual gamers.While some areas if the game may have been a bit of a bore to walk through again and again, most areas are very nice to look at, as everything's always very colorful and interesting in detail. But once you beat the game, you won't feel a huge urge to play through it again. Still, don't let this deter you, the vast majority of the game is incredibly fun and addicting, you'll really come to care for Link and his Minish cap and things always stay fresh enough to make you really want to get to the end.BOTTOM LINE: Given the GBA's current library, I would definitely put this down as a must buy. Accessible and somewhat challenging enough for gamers of all ages.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game.

Final Fantasy 7 wowed us with its vast environments, Goldeneye with its lovely weapon models and effects...Metal Gear Solid with its complexity and comic book flair.  Let it then be said that Splinter Cell has forever raised the bar for detail.  This game, from the training level to the final climactic sequence is going to blow your mind.Now, first off, are you a die-hard fan of non-stop blasting stuff apart with a .50 cal?  Do you feel that hiding from guards or any other kind of stealth is for wimps?  Those who answered yes to either of those need not apply.  Everyone else, welcome to the NSA.As OPSIC ninja Sam Fisher the player is instantly immersed in the most comprehensively realised spy thriller you'll ever play(and yes, Metal Gear fans, this means you too).  Starting with a training refresher level you'll learn how to scale walls and slide down zip-lines, jump and roll over barbed-wire, vault off walls and creap past cameras.  You'll learn how to use night-vision and lock picking tools, learn how to disable security systems, how to silently dispatch guards with your bare hands.  Basically, if you saw it in a spy movie, you'll learn it here.By the time you've played this far you'll have certainly noticed the graphics this game has to offer...the only good word to describe them is 'woa-arhhh-oooooh-mmmm'.  Yes, they're amazing.  Everything and everyone casts real time shadows, light filters through tiny cracks and bullet holes...subtle drafts move cobwebs...water drips down pipes and pools on the floor.  If you've seen it in real life...yeah, its in this game!And so, its on to the game.  I won't give the plot away, but suffice to say its a totally original, believable evil dictator vs yankee super spy thriller, with twists and turns that won't leave you baffled cuz hey, you were really THERE when they happened.  You're going to believe everything you see in this game, from the guards complaining about their girlfriends while you creep past them, to the tinkle of spent cases when Sam reloads his silenced assault rifle.  Tons of cool gadgets await, although you should probably looks elsewhere if you're expecting a massive variety of weapons to choose from.  Sam can only carry his 9mm, later his versatile scoped rifle and maybe some grenades before his weapon inventory is full - because this is real dammit!  And believe me, he only needs these few tools.  Sam is a master of espionage, and you'll spend countless thrilling hours hiding in shadows, slipping through gaps in fences, sneaking sliently across moonlit roof tops.This is one of those games that you'll look back on when you're trembling after the last level and think 'Wow, that was cool'.  You'll play every level again to do it better, quicker, stealthier.  You'll gasp when you see the fish in a glass tank casting their own shadows on the floor.  You'll subdue a yelp of joy when you hear the little whine of your heat-vision gear warming up.  And when you roll out of the darkness to slap a hand over guard's mouth and a silenced pistol to his temple, you'll think you're a real spy.The only possible downside that I can think of to this incredible game is that you'll need a fairly hefty computer to get the most out of it.  My computer is a pretty tough pentium 4 with 512 megs of RAM, but I still had to turn down the resolution to 640x480 to smooth everything out during smokey or rain filled levels.  But even then it looked fabulous! Buy now, with extreme prejudice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2003"}

The game is a tad on the short side as many other reviewers have noted.  The game is an interesting non-authentic adaptation to the first part of a three volume work written by Dante Alighieri the Divine Comedy, this one focuses on Hell.  That being said they had to change many crucial elements from the original work to make a game out of it, that being said a retelling of the original poem word for word wouldn't have interested enough people beyond literature majors and professors.So in short,The Good:  The game can be fun at times.  The games graphics are very well done.  The Score is equally impressive.The Cons:  Too short, the puzzles are ill designed, and the game-play is somewhat frustrating \"if in doubt press the O button.\"--> Lastly, so much work was put into creating the world of Hell that we all wanted to see so badly, which is mainly negated with the fixed camera angles that are predetermined for the player throughout the entire game, what a shame.Summation: It's a good game as an in between game, meaning a game to play while your waiting for something better to come out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2010"}

Probably, particularly given the variable width of the letters in this font -- but I had to try.  Moving right along; you can play a very limited version of Bookworm free online right on your browser, or you can download a free trial of a more functional version from the same site.  Despite this fact, and despite the fact that I have another version of it through Apple's AppStore on my iPhone, I was excited to have a copy of it for the DS.  I was surprised, right off the bat, to see that it required that you rotate the DS ninety degrees to hold it like a book and wondered immediately how that would work out for left-handed folk as the game screen with the tiles is on the right.  I didn't see a way to flip it, and sure enough there's a review just a few posts down from \"Settermom\" that addresses just this issue.  So lefties, beware.That aside, those familiar with the title will find this just what they expected with a few bells and whistles.  Just like the AppStore version, there are books of words that you can complete for extra points.  You still have those horrid (but necessary so one can go on with their life after a game finally ends) flaming tiles, and the greens and golds to go with them for extra points.  You have bonus words and daily bonus words, but where this version offers new 'bling' is in the form of rooms that you decorate as you level up and gain points (books start to line the shelves in the library, etc.) in the secondary screen.  Moreover, the game keeps a more detailed assortment of stats than other versions, and there's an intriguing xray-style scan of the worm in there that's slowly filling up the more I play (the brain meter, I think it's called).  It will be interesting to see how that plays out over time.  The point here is simply that beyond the actual play, there are a number of secondary and entirely aesthetic/novelty/informative (read: non-game changing) elements that are intended (and to a measure succeed) to grab and hold your interest.Few games can claim to actually exercise the brain, but this might certainly be one of them.  It's a great and not-entirely empty time killer (nothing against empty timesinks, I can and do enjoy them as well), and a worthwhile entrant to the family of Bookworm versions.  On Settermom's behalf (and lefties like her), I wish that had offered an orientation toggle somewhere, but that's really the only point of criticism I have to offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2010"}

Well, this is not a game for everyone.  It's not that the story is impossible to pick up.... this is my first experience with the Yakuza franchise and I certainly followed the story.  It's not that the game isn't well put together, because it is.  But if you're thinking this is going to be a game like GTA or even Mafia II, you're going to be rather disappointed.  It's got some of the same play mechanics, but it's more of an RPG than an action title.  So, if you don't have the patience for cutscenes or reading dialogue, this may not be the game for you.  But if you're willing to put in the time, it's a well put-together game.  The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars is I didn't care for the navigation system.  Finding a point on the map, putting down a way point, and navigating your way there can be very frustrating and clunky.

It is really cool.As a shooter, it is very tight and a little hard. Many larger enemies require the player to hit a tiny little red spot on the target. To make matters harder, the red spot is only shown for a split-second for some enemies. The Demons are thin and they move alot, making them hard targets as well. However, it is satisfying when you finally defeat them!Graphics are the Unreal Engine, so nothing great here. Still, the style of artistry is kinda neat and gloomy.Sound is pretty awesome, especially the music. Guns are not Borderlands-quality but they are ok as well.There are not enough Red Gem upgrades to be found, so you have to farm White Gem currency when you can to get the Red Gem upgrades. White Gems are also used for drinking heals and buying extra ammo. Ammunition is not a major concern as there are usually colored boxes lying around for ammo (Blue is machine gun, Red is pistol ammo, and Green is shotgun). The weapons have cool names.There are some arcade sequences that are ok. Also, there is a Quick-Time-Event sequence at the beginning of the last chapter which is NOT easy - kinda frustrating.Overall, this is a cool game.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Uncharted is Back And as Good as Ever!","reviewText":"Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception lives up to the pedigree of the Uncharted series and delivers a fast-paced, action-packed, third-person shooter that's become the premier franchise on the PS3.For all the Uncharted fans out there, you should already know what to expect - stunning graphics, slick shooting mechanics, an evolving story arc, supported by some of the best voice acting in the gaming business. Naughty Dog hasn't (thankfully) reinvented the wheel with U3; instead choosing to carefully refine the gameplay and graphics that many of us have come to love.Uncharted 3 picks up with familiar faces, Nathan Drake and Victor \"Sully\" meeting with a shady character named Talbot in a pub in England. Drake and Sully are selling legendary explorer, Sir Francis Drake's ring to Talbot for a sum of cash. Not wanting to spoil any of the story or events that transpire I'll end there. I will say that U3 delves into the history of Nathan and Sully's relationship and gives an excellent back-story of how the two came to be partners. If you're a fan of the game it's really a fascinating aspect of the game and adds to the lore tremendously. The story in U3 doesn't disappoint and you'll soon be exploring far reaches of the world just as in Uncharted and Uncharted 2.I have read many of the negative reactions by fans of the game complaining about the story and although yes there are plot holes and yes there are instances where things could've been done this way or that... it's a game. It's entertainment. The player has the advantage of viewing the series as a whole from an end-user perspective when in fact developers don't. Had Uncharted not garnered positive word-of-mouth recommendations it's very possible that we would never have had U2 or U3. So I always try and give developers a little slack in that they have no way of knowing if they're creating a one-off title or a series of titles.I've read some reviews complaining of the gameplay or more specifically the controls feeling sluggish compared to the original games. At the time of this writing U3 v.1.9 is currently out and the gameplay seems identical to Uncharted 1 & 2. No complaints there so maybe the controls are something that was modified via a patch.Graphically, U3 is as incredible as can be expected from Naughty Dog. The game is absolutely beautiful from the rendering of water to vegetation that sways with the wind and rays of light bursting through the jungle canopy overhead lighting the way ahead. This is as good as it gets on consoles and is a sight to see.As with Uncharted 2, U3 features a fully fleshed online multiplayer component. This time you get the usual competitive modes, and cooperative multiplayer modes but additions like co-op vs. co-op. This is where you and a partner take on another pair of human players in combat. It's a very fun addition to the standard online component. There's also a story-based online multiplayer component that adds to the co-op fun.Definitely recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"A flawed but fun whimsical adventure","reviewText":"Paper Mario, a particularly quirky and delightful spinoff of the Super Mario franchise, has spawned a great variety of installments known for cutesy, whimsical design and dry, offbeat humor. Paper Mario: Sticker Star marks the series' first installment on a handheld console, which is wonderful because this is the platform on which it feels most at home and seems to have always belonged. Sticker Star is a highly charming game that offers some substantial fun alongside a hearty helping of setbacks.As with most other Paper Mario titles, the game is set in an alternate world of the Mushroom Kingdom in which anything and everything is made of paper; this is weaved into the scenery and dialogue in various unique ways, whether it's a character complaining of creased, crumpled edges or an entire town being endangered because it's been \"rolled up.\" The story begins with Mario and Princess Peach celebrating the Sticker Fest, an annual event in which the residents of \"Decalburg\" come to witness the soaring Sticker Comet, a powerful magical object that descends onto the land only during this time. Expectedly, Bowser crashes the party, attempting to snatch the Sticker Comet's mystic powers and nabbing Peach in the process. Unfortunately for both him and Mario, the comet shatters, its pieces scattering across the land in the form of both larger, power-granting Royal Stickers and smaller Comet Pieces. Bowser hightails it out of there in an attempt to gain the Royal Stickers' abilities while Mario of course heads out after him. In the process he meets Kersti, a sticker fairy in the form of a glittering tiara, who grants Mario the ability to utilize various abilities using stickers he comes across, as well as the power to Paperize, or to manipulate the environments around him with strategically placed stickers. As delightful as some of this story's quirks and new characters are, it's more than a little disheartening that the ordinarily refreshing Paper Mario originality has been scrapped in favor of another Bowser-has-Peach rehash. Another new villain along the lines of the bewitching Shadow Queen or mysterious Count Bleck from games past would've been preferable.Despite the predictable storyline, this game's focus is its unique new combat system and other inventive mechanics. As you progress through various worlds and stages, you'll come across hundreds of stickers-you'll pry them off walls and floors, receive them as prizes from battles or in-game events, pop them out of \"?\" blocks, and more. These stickers make up your arsenal for this game's battles; each sticker is single-use, so once you use a sticker in battle it vanishes. Each sticker is representative of a single attack, status or recovery move; you'll be able to stomp enemies with Jump stickers, inflict sleep with the BaaHammer sticker, recover health with a Mushroom sticker, and so forth. This adds a unique strategic element in that you're better off using specific stickers for specific enemies and battles and will usually want to conserve more powerful ones for boss fights; enemies with spiked or helmeted heads are immune to jump attacks, for example, as where your hammer can't reach airborne foes.Like past Paper Mario titles, the game is a turn-based RPG in which running into overworld enemies initiates a battle sequence. You must defeat all in-battle foes to win, as where it is of course lights out if they deplete your HP first. Action Commands also return, allowing you to block enemy attacks or boost the power of your own with well-timed button presses. The difference this time around is that there are no experience points and Mario never actually levels up (your HP will progressively increase with Heart Containers you track down instead); this sounds and feels wonky at first, primarily because you may feel unmotivated to \"grind\" or battle many enemies as a result, but you'll eventually learn the value of the coins and stickers each battle earns you. Certain powerful stickers will only be coughed up by specific enemies, and coins become an invaluable resource as the game goes on; you'll need them to purchase stickers and other important items, in addition to powering the ever-useful Battle Spin wheel. This is a roulette wheel that you have the option of spinning each turn in battle; if you match up two or more objects, you'll be able to attack that many times instead of just once. This is a highly useful mechanic since Mario is going it alone this time around (there are no teammates or allies in Sticker Star, so you'll be fighting as just Mario the whole campaign, another mild disappointment in comparison to past games), so consecutive attacks become a necessity when you go up against big hordes of foes. As a bonus, if you match up a trio of identical objects, you'll earn a bonus attack dependent upon what the object represents (three lightning bolts will strike all on-screen enemies with electricity, while three mushrooms will recover a huge amount of your HP). If you want a higher likelihood of matches, you'll have to pay for it; you can automatically match up or slow down portions of the Battle Spin wheel for a fee that doubles with each consecutive use; this again emphasizes the usefulness of coins, particularly during boss battles.The ability to Paperize is a highly unique one and one of the elements that best ties into the game's overarching \"made of paper\" theme. You can instantly Paperize by pressing the Y Button, at which point the screen shifts to 2D (even if you have the 3D slider up) and Mario is literally able to manipulate the world around him as though it were a piece of actual paper, tearing or replacing portions of the environment to make doors, hills or other areas newly accessible, or placing strategic stickers to bring them to life. Although it's not always completely clear when or how to use this ability in specific locations, it's an inventive, exciting mechanic that makes exploration that much more fun. Can't figure out how to advance in a particular spot, but noticing there's something off about the environment around you? Chances are Paperization is key to moving forward.As you explore the land you'll also come across a variety of \"Things\" (as they are literally referred to in-game), or real-world objects placed sporadically throughout nooks and crannies of each world; these items range from a pair of scissors to a giant cake to a goat. These Things can be transformed into enormous and highly powerful stickers that will crush most enemies in a single blow, although you'll need to conserve most of them for boss battles, primarily because each boss has a notable weakness to a specific Thing sticker. It is occasionally easy to figure out when to use each one-you'll expectedly need to use a bowling ball Thing sticker to knock down a road-blocking group of bowling pins, and a baseball bat Thing sticker to knock a giant Pokey's segments out of the park. Unfortunately, this is not the case across the board, which contributes toward one of the game's major flaws. As where most ordinary enemy battles throughout the game are simple and straightforward, the boss battles are disproportionately difficult in that each boss is absolutely loaded with an enormous amount of HP, and most of these bosses are near impossible to defeat unless you pinpoint their Thing sticker weakness. While it may be simple to figure out when to make use of the scissors or the faucet, chances are most players will be clueless as to when they're supposed to use the goat, the shaved ice or the sponge, unless they've got a strategy guide handy. This can make for tedious, grueling and overall frustrating boss battle sequences; it's lame that there's no room for experimentation, either-you'd think you could use the baseball bat to shatter a giant Whomp, but nope, no such luck, because each and every boss has one and only one Thing weakness, and it's anyone's best guess exactly what each one is. This prevents the Thing sticker mechanic from being as fun as it could have been, and in general this game's attempts to shoehorn in puzzle elements just come in the form of random scatterings of items throughout randomized locations, and you'll rarely be notified if you've found something of significance or when exactly you're supposed to use it (this means you'll have to constantly scour previously visited locations in order to advance, because roadblocks are frequent in this game). If you use the wrong Thing sticker against the wrong enemy, you're left without it until you go buy another one (once you discover each Thing you'll be able to repurchase its sticker for a large sum of coins), which can make for battles pointlessly cut short and Mario's wallet quickly and frequently being drained. While exploration is fun and has always been a key element of Paper Mario games, it's poorly structured here and feels forced.Despite this aggravating flaw, Sticker Star has a lot of things going right for it: the game as a whole is extremely polished and nice to look at; the colorful, whimsical environments and character designs are a sheer joy to behold, and everything from minute details in the scenery to plucky sound effects and quirky character interactions keep the player enveloped in what's around them. As with most Paper Mario games, there's also a wonderful soundtrack to enjoy, and the combination of all these traits keep the game moving at a strong pace and contribute toward an overarching effervescent sheen of the whole package. It's only during some of the clunky, confusing boss battles and poorly executed puzzle elements that this all comes screeching to a halt, but it's thankfully not enough of a consistent problem to make for a wholly terrible buzzkill. Unfortunately, the game doesn't take enough chances (or at least not the right ones) to be as excellent as it could have been; despite the tongue-in-cheek humor, unique new combat system and other quirks, this is a pretty run-of-the-mill rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom and its typical supporting cast; Peach reprises her role as damsel in distress and most other characters do the same-the enemies are mostly made up of overly familiar Goombas and Koopas, and most of the traits that made installments like Thousand-Year Door and Super Paper Mario stand out are sadly absent. Despite all this, however, Paper Mario: Sticker Star is a game with a whole lot of charm and some admittedly addictive gameplay elements; it's also impressively long, with a campaign that should keep most players busy for quite a while, particularly if you invest in its various side quests. Additionally, the game makes excellent use of the 3DS's 3-dimensional capabilities, as various characters and sceneries routinely pop out of the screen in various creative ways. Although it's a bit crumpled around the creases, Mario's papery world is worth another visit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

This is a perfect port of the original Super Mario Bros. Every last mushroom and goomba is accounted for, and you'll feel yourself slipping into a blissful recollection of your early days as a gamer.

Yes he was featured in Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. before this game came out, but SUPER Mario Bros. invented platform games. To this day the game remains as playable as the first time you opened the box of your NES (back when they packed in games, I miss it). The graphics are great for the time period they were developed for. Remember a true reviewer considers the age of a game and doesn't compare to games that have the benefit of todays technology. Back in 1985 this game was top billing at arcades and at home, the fun factor and replay value was the top priority back then. Unfortunately that philosophy has practically died, and your lucky to even want to play a game after you beat it the first time now days. This game echoes a time when games were fun, replayable, and didn't require a large investment of time to beat. As you get older you find you like these games better and better because life is so busy.

It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends.

{"product_name":"B00I5LMSE2","description":"","reviewerName":"Mali","summary":"The Kirby you know and love...","reviewText":"I was hesitant to pick this game up because it's been a few years since the last Kirby DS game and I wasn't sure it would be anything new or even enjoyable anymore  However, I have loved all the others, from Squeak Quad to Super Star Ultra to Mass Attack.When I price matched, it was $32.99 and looks like it went back up in just a few days, which is shady...Anyways, this Kirby has a new story, in that Kind Dedede had been kidnapped and Kirby is going on a quest to get him back. The gameplay is basically the same. Suck up enemies and swallow them to gain their different powers. There are a few new powers in place of some of the older ones, and many of the older ones remain. The levels follow the same formula you know. Grass land, fire land, water land, and so on. The game play hasn't suddenly gotten hard- you will die a few times, but you will not throw the game down in anger. There are new incentives to reply the levels in that you collect a set number of hidden sunbursts and also hidden &#34;keychains&#34;. The sunbursts are hidden in secret doors, up or down that path that is off screen, and some of them you have to solve little puzzles to get. Find the key and figure out how to get it to the end to unlock the door, etc. When you find enough, it unlocks the boss. When you find them all, it unlocks a bonus level. The keychains are also sometimes hidden, sometimes require making it past that spiky enemy on a conveyor belt. After you collect them, they are revealed to be types of Kirby's, friends, or foes from previous Kirby games, and they hang on a little keychain board. The goal is to collect them all, and play coins can be traded for them as well. It seems that the keychains are different every time you collect them, but you can also get duplicates. The last new thing is a hyper kirby. In certain levels there is a flower that you grab (non-optional) that turns you pearly iridescent rainbow colors & allows you to suck up almost anything. Doors, trains...Another new thing is some mini bosses have creative ways to defeat them. One trio of birds requires you to suck turnips out of the ground to hit them with. Once defeated, they smack onto the screen. Another pack circles you on a tower and requires you to hit them with a ball they throw. And yet another scene has Waddles hiding in a little house you suck up. They build a stronger one, but that one is no match for you either. The next one has giant rocket bullets. It's a cute reference to the 3 Little Pigs, and very well done graphically.The playtime is pretty short, it can probably be completed in a few hours if you aren't collecting sunbursts. I am and I have been playing about 2 hours a day for 2 days. Trying not to be done too soon, because I am having fun with it.There are also two mini games, a fighting game where you battle other Kirby's in rounds and are timed. And a rhythm game that is not very much fun at all, where you bounce on trampolines to collect coins. Apparently two more are unlockable.Overall, if you loved the other Kirby DS games, and loved spending the extra time going back to collect everything, you should love this too! It's just over all too soon...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2014"}

Ever since the previews of Doom 3 blew away most gamers with its graphics and level-design, a lot of gaming enthusiasts began wondering if there ever would be another game that would match Doom 3. This I say, w.r.t both PC and console. But a game developing studio called Bungie, quietly entered into the fray and released Halo as the flagship of XBOX in 2001.And the rest, they say........ is history.Now Doom3 might have to set itself gainst Halo.Halo is unlike most other games you might have played so far. Agreed it is an First-Person-Shooter (FPS), meaning, you get to play themain protagonist from your visual perspective. Any FPS will have the same basic characterisitics--Move, Aim, Shoot, Reload etc..And the cycle repeats. But Halo takes FPS one step higher. It gives you enough freedom to engage your enemy in a myriad number ofways, without ever losing sight of your objective.  Much like GTA3, but with a more focussed theme. Hosting destructible environmentsincrediblly mobile vehicles, mind-bending graphics and some really smart-ass enemy, Halo is now the pinnacle of 3D programming.Story...To keep it short....500 yrs down the line,  Humans are forced to seek other planetary systems for colonization owing to their vast andunmaneagable numbers on Earth.  A mysterious alien race dubbed the Covenant, wipes out one the colonies called Harvest and threatens to draw closer to the Solar system. As a result, research into the Spartan-II 'super soldiers' program assumes greater significance on planet reach.But the Covenant is the first to draw the sword and ultimately obliterates Planet Reach and the program.The only undamages ship called 'The Piilar of Autumn' ,housing the final Spartan-II soldier-- the Master-Chief, i.e you, makes a blind warp jump into space, hoping to lead the Covenant armada away from Earth. You finally arrive to an uncharted part of the Universe wherein you make an emergency landing on a mysterious planet sized-ring called Halo. What is Halo? Why is it here?. Who built it and for what? And why is the Covenant so desperate to seek out the secrets of Halo?...is what the you have to find out. That is your mission throughout the game.Graphics:The very definition of surreal.. Simply put.....stunning!. It is a visual treat. Games with stories like this tend to have very gloomy and dark environments, but not so Halo. It perfectly combines lush outdoors with extremely claustrophobic indoor environments. Very much like Serious Sam. The lighting and in game-physics is truly magnificent. Take for instance your shadow, which moves when an external light source falls on you and the undulating shadows it can cast on the surface if you are say, near water. The landscapes are astonishing, with precise rendering of different textures to various elements of the game like buildings, constructs, enemy etc. The world of Halo puts movies like  Star Trek and Star Wars to shame.The characters are so beautifully detailed that if you are inconspicuous enough, you can veiw how life-like they are....Magnificient.Gameplay:Along with the graphics, this is where Halo sets new standards. As the Master-Chief, your blood may be thicker than your fellow Marines, but the enemy views you just the same and believe me, the game isn't easy. Rather than allowing you to carry the entire arsenal, Halo allows you to carry just two, at any given time. Hence you need to strategize. Is your approach going to be stealth based or like a raging bull. The vehicles are diverse and downright gorgeous. The Marine vehicles include the superb cross-country Warthog, the indestructible Scorpion Tank while the Covenants have the ground hovering Ghost and the flying Banshee.Another innovation is the use of a single button on the XBox controller for 3 different actions, such as reloading, weapon change and vehicle mounting. The console controller really complements the games' actions and makes the gameplay much simpler.Level Design:Another real standout. The outdoor environments are vast and beautifully detailed. Driving your Warthog or Ghost will be a treat. Since the action is on Halo, you will always see its distinctive ring as you move your gaze over it and ultimately you see it ending at you. A breathtaking sight, truly.I must say that though the levels are well planned, the only downside is that some come out to be a bit repetitive. The indoors actually, because some feel the same. In the course of the game you would have to back-track levels of an entire chapter!.However, the story and the action saves it from being tagged as 'repetitive'. This minor blemish should hardly be considered when u buy Halo.Sound:The Music is award winning. The Gothic chants are superb and instantly recognizable.. Throughout the game, the music tempo changes with the situation you are in. Voice-acting is flawless and the sound variety is immense. Bungie has now released stand-alone music Cd's that are now amongst the industry's best-selling. Take time to listen to the tunes in the game. U'll love it.Summary:Dont let me fool you into thinking that Halo is the greatest...best...brightest...or whatever game it is. It really depends on your taste. An RPG fan will not even take a first look at FPS games and like-wise. Halo is serious stuff, with very little humour and NPC interaction. You might say that you've seen better gameplay and storyline. But objectively speaking, there is true brilliance in Halo. It cannot be touched by ano other game in terms of graphics  except by Ninja Gaiden, which is on equal terms. A taut, gripping story bundled with jaw-dropping graphics and mersmerizing music is all you'll need to make a movie actually. Halo has two more things to better a movie. It has the XBOX...and it has you...... the Master-Chief. Start playing!....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2004"}

Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"I'm a Halo hater and I loved this game","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing graphics even for today, continues the great Halo story, nice selection of weapons, playing as two characters keeps things fresh and interesting, extremely addictive multiplayerThe Bad: Extremely linear, same weapons and enemies recycled from first Halo, short campaign, disappointing ending, over exaggerated physicsI was a HUGE Sony fan when the first Halo came out and I always hated the series. About a year ago I played Halo 1 on the PC and thought it was pretty good. Just a few weeks ago I picked up H2 for $17 and blew through the campaign in about a week. Halo 2 has a very good story and the cliffhanger ending everyone talks about is pretty damn disappointing. The graphics are something to take note of because they are AMAZING and I didn't know the Xbox could run these kind of graphics.The game is more balanced out this time around and you don't have 300 Flood coming after like in the first one. The levels are still as linear as EVER and they actually make you feel cramped since there is not much room for you to run around in. The added weapons and Brutes are a nice touch as well. Now for XBL I don't know because I don't have Gold but I know its really good. If this game had a longer campaign and a bit more too it then this would be a perfect game. It has its flaws and glitches (over 500 so far that people have found) and if you haven't played Halo then you're just a big idiot.

It amazes me that Capcom has decided to take this franchise in two radically different directions. On one hand, you have the portable game, Revelations, which you'd expect less from. Then on the other hand, you have RE6, which just released, but it's full of action sequences, quick-time events, weird controls, etc. Considering RE6 had a bigger budget, is on more powerful hardware, and is a numbered sequel in a beloved franchise, how could it be worse? Well, it is, and Revelations is the best thing to come from the RE franchise since RE4.Graphics - Phenomenal! A real showpiece for the 3DS. Everything is nicely detailed and it all pops in 3D.Sound - Wandering around the ship will provide sounds that are chilling and immerse you in Revelations atmosphere.Gameplay - Perfect! To make it even better and a little more intuitive, I recommend picking up the Circle Pad Pro.Revelations is a game that deserves to be in the RE franchise.

It was original, artsy, had slick controls, and clever humor that you could only find on Sony&#8217;s consoles. After Sly 3, the series went into limbo during most of the PS3&#8242;s life cycle with no sign of a new game in sight. With Sucker Punch powering away at the Infamous series all fans lost hope. Thieves in Time was finally announced with much rejoice, but once the game arrived everyone was scratching their heads. Why was this is game almost identical to the previous three in every way shape and form?If you&#8217;re familiar with the Sly games you know how this game plays out. 5 chapters of various different villains that the gang must take down. Each chapters starts with an intro from Bentley the turtle (the computer and tech wiz). After this Sly goes and takes pictures to gather recon for what to do next. As soon as I saw this in the first chapter I rolled my eyes. I knew I was in for another Sly game with the same gameplay we are now tired of. Sure it&#8217;s quality but I wanted evolution in the series. When I say nothing has changed I mean absolutely nothing. The same guard paths can be followed, pickpocketing, the same yellow flashlights, the same small confusing hubs with 30 clue bottles and a safe. You get the picture. However, the hubs aren&#8217;t as interesting to traverse and I completely bypassed collecting any extras as it felt like a chore.That&#8217;s not to say every little thing is the same. The clever and witty humor turned into Saturday Morning Cartoon slapstick humor with jokes written by 8 year olds. No longer do you find the darker humor that adults can relate to. I didn&#8217;t laugh or smile at a single joke or line of dialogue. This is especially sad since you go back in time to find 5 of Sly&#8217;s ancestors which opens a path for great dialog. Roichi is Sly&#8217;s Japanese Samurai ancestor, Tennessee Kid is his wild west ancestor, Bob is Sly&#8217;s very first ancestor from 10,000 B.C., Sir Gallenth is his medieval ancestor, and Salim is his Arabian Nights ancestor. These are actually interesting characters, but their personalities are limited by the poor writing. No longer is the banter between Sly, Bentley, and Murray something you look forward to at every cut scene.I also miss the more clever gameplay segments, now we just get a ton of boring mini games and quick time events. Hell, even the final boss is an easy quick time event fest. The most interesting part of the whole game are the bosses which are rather challenging and fun to fight. The only new addition to the entire series is the new costume abilities. These add a special set of skills Sly needs to get through some missions. Apart from this you can expect the same controls even. It&#8217;s a crying shame for a series that is so dear to PlayStation fans.With all of that said the game looks pretty damn good on Vita minus the occasional slow down and the super long load times. Jumping from area to area was painful due to the 45 second or longer loading screens. Some gameplay segments were shorter than the actual load times. This really hurt the game as I set my Vita down to actually go do something while the game loaded. Long term fans may either hate this game or love it. New comers will actually see it as a quality PlayStation title. As someone who has played the games since the very first one, I find it rather disappointing and almost a chore to play through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000K9K9AC","description":"WarHawk Bundle with BlueTooth Headset PS3","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Just about terrible","reviewText":"This game must have a kind of cult following with all the positive reviews, because I just don't get it.  Warhawk is likely the worst PS3 game I've played to date.  To start with, there is absolutely no tutorial or any place to practice.  You are instantly tossed into chaos before you even know which button shoots.  The single solitary reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is flying.  The planes are fun to fly around in, that's it, nothing else worth a second look here.The games only purpose is combat, yet the combat is awful...simply awful.  I always hated war games where there is an advantage to jumping around.  Here comes warhawk.....you will immediately see people jumping through the air like a bunch of ballerinas fighting a war.  It just looks so stupid.  In real life do you think soldiers are jumping around on the battle field?  There is a crouch option which gives you no advantage at all.  So jumping is good, sneaking (crouching)is useless hmmmm....okThe absolute stupidest most irritating thing about this game is how the knives are the best freaking weapon to use...in a gunfight!!!  Wait until you get online and see how many people are running around with knives.  You can be shooting someone with a machine gun and they will run up to you and stab you.  You die faster from a stab wound in this game then from 40 rounds at close range with an assault rifle. There were hundreds of times where I am unloading my weapon into a guy and he's still running towards me to the point of me wondering if I'm even hitting him despite the crosshairs being directly on him. I'm serious, I even snuck up directly behind a guy and shot him in the head, did he drop dead?  No...he turned around and stabbed me, then I die.  OkBasically all the \"war\" consists of is a bunch of guys running around like chickens without heads and jumping through the air.  It reminds me of the lame online combat of Socom 1 for the PS2.  Dogfights in the air are clunky and depend on sheer luck.  Driving tanks is awkward and they explode far too easily.  I really could list more annoying features but it's even bothering me while I type this so I shall stop.  In closing, the graphics aren't even all that impressive.  I'm sticking with Call of Duty, which is light years ahead of this kiddie nonsense.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2008"}

The treasure hunt story line has been played out recently (National Treasure movies come to mind), but it still makes for a fun game.- Overall, the sound is good. The musical score is excellent and really sets the tone for the game; however, the sound effects fall short in some areas.- Graphics a pretty good, especially the details. Water stands out as one of the best details. The way the light and scenery reflects off of it is amazing. Detailing on the buildings is also very good.- Controls are easy to learn- Game is a good length. It took about 9 hours to finish the game, and kept me interested almost to the end... more on that below.- Nice selection of weapons- Vehicle sequences add some depth to the gameplay- Climbing, jumping and puzzle solving is funThe Bad:- Although the controls are easy to learn, they are very frustrating at times. It takes forever for Drake to turn around. Very frustrating, especially towards the end of the game where the zombies come in. Pressing Triangle to pick things up doesn't always work... you need to walk around, turn around to get it to work. Firearm aiming is decent, but not great.- Some of the graphics are poorly done, namely the enemies. They just don't have much detail, the blood looks fake when you shoot them. Seems like not much time went into that aspect of the graphics.- Enemy movements and motion is completely unrealistic... very arcade like. Time Crisis comes to mind, which isn't a compliment. The computer AI is also very basic. These are some of the dumbest enemies you'll kill in a video game.- The amount of enemies you need to clear out gets ridiculous at times, they keep filing in. This is especially funny when they come in from an area that Drake had to scale a wall to get to... how did they get there?! Also, they have a \"stealth kill\" available, but there are slim to no opportunities to use it in the game. Seems like an afterthought.- Zombies... seriously? For me that killed the last 15% of the game. They're stupid, hard to kill and there are a ton of them! It's as if they decided to throw in some poorly done Resident Evil action at the end.- The puzzles are almost too easy at times- The jet ski is very hard to control","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"Beyond: Two Souls was a fresh experience in a game!","reviewText":"Intro:All of the talk throughout 2013 about Beyond: Two Souls was related to no one having any idea what kind of game this was going to end up being. Every trailer seen and demo played for the game was completely different than the last, which confused the hell out of people.  The game was finally released on October 8,2013 and was met by a mixed bag of reviews; as high as a perfect 100 and as low as a 25/100 according to Metacritic.com.  This is the fourth game for French game studio Quantic Dream and the first game since Heavy Rain in 2010.Story:The story line is about a girl named Jodie and the invisible entity named Aiden that is permanently attached to her.  She can control Aiden and make him do just about anything she wants him to do, such as open doors, knock things over, or even possess people.  The story takes place over the course of several years, from the time Jodie is a small girl until she is a full grown woman. You get to experience all of the thrills and downfalls that Jodie, and any other human for that matter, goes through as they grow up, only for Jodie it&#8217;s slightly different as she has Aiden with her at all times. The story skips around so consecutive levels are never set in chronological order.  This actually made the story much more interesting in my opinion because you would see things when she was older and wonder how it got to be that way and then get to find out later on by playing it.  The reason for the story skipping around is explained at the very end of the game.  Some examples of playable incidents are having a snowball fight with friends in the street, sneaking out to a bar, going to a teenage birthday party, and joining the military.  Each and every one of those seems sort of normal, right?  Try having Aiden with you and see how normal they are.  There are also scenes revolving around other entities like Aiden that I am not going spoil those by going into any detail.One thing that stood out to me about the story line is that Jodie is a very strong female protagonist, which is refreshing to see in a video game. There are not many games out there with a female main character that has to go through some of the things Jodie does and still finds a way to shine.  Not to mention when there is a female character in a video game these days, protagonist or not, she is almost always a well-endowed woman to cater to the mostly male fans. Beyond: Two Souls does not cater to that audience at all; Jodie is a petite, skinny girl that has to deal with real life (and fake) challenges that come her way.  You can easily fall in love with her just because of how human she is as a character, which is not something you can say for many other games.Graphics:The graphics are absolutely stunning.  These are just the kind of graphics you would expect to see on a video game coming at the end of a console&#8217;s life cycle.  They have had enough time to prefect the formula and make a beautiful video game.  Quantic Dream used motion capture in order toget the facial expressions and body movements for this game to make it feel as real as possible.  The main characters are played by Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe; which made it that much better by having experienced professionals playing the parts.  It was very cinematic and could easily feel like you were watching a movie because of how good it all looks.Gameplay:Let me start by saying that this is a video game, despite claims to the contrary by others.  I understand everyone has their own preference on what kind of video game they like to play, but just because you do not like a video game does not mean that it is not one.  Now, this game can be described as an interactive drama and action-adventure.  It is played much like The Walking Dead video game from last year in that you never have full control over your character but you can still lead your character where to go and click the right stick in the direction of objects in order to interact with them.  This may sound simple, but it is much deeper than you might initially imagine.  You can turn into Aiden at almost any time you want by clicking the triangle button and then proceed to fly around the area and interact with objects as Aiden as well. During the more intense scenes of the game, there are QTEs (quick time events) that enable you to react to what is happening.  By either succeeding or failing them, it will change what happens next.  These QTEs are easy for the most part, but there are a few times they are extremely difficult because it does not pop up and tell you which button to press next; instead you have to pay attention to where Jodie is moving and then move the stick in that direction.  This makes it hard because sometimes it is not always obvious where she is moving.The Verdict: 9.0 out of 10.0After hearing so many doubts about this game all year long, I was very skeptical on whether or not I would enjoy my time with this game. Having finally played it, I have no doubts left in my mind; this was a great game. I loved the fact that the story was so interactive and you could change how things were done.  It must have taken so much time to design all of the different aspects and story paths the game can take.  The story had excitement, love, depression, and even fear during the paranormal scenes.  The acting in this game is above par and the motion capture was almost perfect.  Even though I had several screw ups with the QTEs during the fast scenes, I never became mad at the game or wanted to give up because it was too fun and interactive.  Even if you are not into this sort of gameplay, this game is a must play just to experience the story.  Jodie&#8217;s story is one I will remember for along time as she is not an easy character to forget.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2013"}

Imagine that you had control of an entire movie studio, competing with others to create a string of box office smashes. Imagine being able to use your judgement alone, deciding whether success lies with epic action pictures or lots of low budget, hammy 'B' movies.Will the stars you've so lovingly groomed develop monstrous egos - refusing to accept that they are now too old to play the romantic leads that made them famous? You can help, but there are only so many times you can send them to fat farms and plastic surgeons.Will you watch your movies being shot or do you want to direct the action yourself? Will you decide to innovate and introduce the talkies, color or digital sound before any of your rivals?

The reviews here on Amazon run the gamut of all the game's pros and cons very well.  I'll try to summarize my experience and opinion without getting into all the details already covered.Game Summary: The Movies sees you in charge of a studio starting at 1920 and going to the present day - with all the changes in technology and world events to go with it.  All the changes affect everything in the game: the game-world is very interactive as far as what sells and what's happening.The game has two major components (with so many sub-parts I couldn't even begin to write about): building and managing your movie studio - all the buildings, staff, and finances that you can imagine going into it; and making movies - replete with script-writing, stage sets, and marketing.  The experience of running your own movie studio is very compelling.As an added bonus you can create your own movie stars - everything from head shape to eye color to personal hygene.  And you can throw movies into post-production and edit every single detail of every single scene if you so desire.  Movies can be saved in files or CDs to play in the standard Windows Media Player (make some \"interesting\" family movies).  If that doesn't strike you as astounding for a simulation game then don't waste the money on this one.Quick list of pros (+) and cons (-):+ Graphics: excellent, believable, and engrossing+ Sound: fitting, clear, and engrossing+ Gameplay: intuitive, easy-to-learn, and addictive+ Performance: solid, smooth, doesn't distract- Learning Curve: there's a LOT to do here- Expansions: expansion pack \"STUNTS\" over-priced under-packedMake sure your system meets all the requirements on the box: you'll need directx 9.0c compatible hardware to run the game.  Updating your graphics and sound drivers may also be needed.  The game comes with the STARMAKER program to make your own movie stars; but check the company's website for the current update patch.Also I had an installation issue where the autoplay menu wouldn't install after clicking the 'install' button.

Rhodes","summary":"The Force is Strong With This One","reviewText":"After the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith in theaters we got Lego Star Wars; a game that was a lot of fun to play simply because it emulated the movies rather well with all the characters being made entirely from Legos.  Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is even better for the simple fact of nostalgia.  Any Star Wars fan will enjoy this.You'll begin the game in the Cantina in Mos Eisley.  This is the hub, and from there you can go into any of the three episodes and play through them.  At the start you'll only be able to choose A New Hope, but after completing the first chapter, you can choose The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.  As you go through the three episodes you'll some of the most memorable moments of the movies acted out entirely with legos.  These moments aren't only memorable, but they're given a hilarious charm. These moments are also from the actual original versions of the movies as well.  In other words, Han Solo DOES shoot first.The game is visually striking.  Seeing your favorite characters from the original Star Wars films as legos is quite a treat.  Not only do you get to have nostalgia with Star Wars, but with legos as well.  Even better are the hilarious antics of most of the scenes.  To benefit the nostalgia even more is how John Williams' classic score accompanies each and every level of the game.  For a Star Wars fan this game is the ultimate nostalgia.As you play through each of the classic episodes, you'll be in control of several characters.  Not all at once, but you'll end up having to switch.  At times you may only have two characters, at others there may be as many as seven in your party at once.  Your characters, depending on who they are, also have their own unique skills they can use.  Jedi for example, can double jump and use the force.  Those who wield blasters have a grappling hook that allows them to ascend to accessible platforms.  The droids can open up special doors for you.  Other characters, like the Jawas and Ewoks will be able to go into vents and access areas the other characters can't.  In all actuality, they're really no different than their counterparts in the original Lego Star Wars.  Also like the original Lego Star Wars, you'll constantly have to switch between characters in order to get through each and every area.  You'll have to switch to R2-D2 to open up a door, for example.  More than one person can play at a time, which is also really cool.  You can also beat up your allies if you wish, and they respawn instantly.  The gameplay isn't completely the same, though, there have been some small tweaks made here and there.The additions to the gameplay aren't huge, but they are welcome.  As you progress through levels all your characters may be able to assemble certain materials together to form a droid to help them fight.  In the original Lego Star Wars this ability was only given to the Jedi, but here everyone can do it.  There are also moments when you'll have to dress up as a stormtrooper in order to gain access through certain doors.  You'll also be given the chance at some point to dress up as a bounty hunter and you'll be able to use Thermal Detonators.  Characters also have their own unique abilities.  Chewie, for example, can rip a stormtroopers arms right out of his sockets.  All of these are welcome additions, and that's not even all there is to the gameplay.  From time to time you'll be in command of vehicles.  Landspeeders, the Millennium Falcon, the X-Wing and more as you take on some of the more memorable moments from the film, like destroying the death star.It will probably only take you five hours at the very least to complete the story mode of all three episodes.  However, Lego Star Wars II is full of extras.  Each time you dispatch an enemy, whether it be in story mode or not, you'll earn money.  You can also destroy certain objects and obtain money.  You can use the money you gain to purchase cheats and hidden characters.  Each time you get a new character they'll walk around in the hub, and you can switch to them.  \"Purchasing\" characters isn't the only way to get them.  You could easily just use one in story mode and you've got him or her.  You'll also get hidden characters if you've got save data from the original Lego Star Wars.  Just unlocking all the characters takes a lot of time.The importance of unlocking characters is so you can play through certain aspects of the free play mode.  There are places that in story mode the default characters couldn't reach.  These hidden characters might be able to reach it, though, and so you will find yourself playing through levels again.  The good news is these levels are so much fun that playing through a second, third or even fourth time is no hassle at all.Free mode also offers a way for you to customize what a character looks like.  You could put Yoda's head on Luke Skywalker's body, for example.  This is mostly just a lot of fun to mess around with.  Some combinations are just all out crazy.  You could, for example, put Chewbacca's head on Leia's body from when she's wearing the slave outfit in Return of the Jedi.  This really doesn't do a whole lot for the gameplay as a whole, but it is quite fun to mess around with, and the combinations are endless.The only real problem with this game that I can really think of is that there is little, if any, challenge at all.  Each time you die you respawn right where you left off and you have infinite lives.  There's really no such thing as a game over.  If you die the only penalty is that you lose money.  However, the sheer fun factor of the game is enough to do away with that, and still makes Lego Star Wars II a treat.Lego Star Wars II surpasses the original in just about everyway.  It's a Star Wars game for the classic trilogy done with instant perfection.  If you love the original Star Wars movies, you'll definitely want this game.On the positive side+Based off the original theatrical versions and not the special editions+Beautiful game+Addictive gameplay+Co-op mode+Several extras and hidden characters+Customizable characters+Tons of replay valueOn the negative side-The story mode is quite short-While not really much of a con for this game, it's got very little challenge","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2006"}

When I finally decided to give it a shot I had a hard time getting into it. I have played RPG's for years and some of my recent gen favorites are Skyrim and Kingdoms of Amalur. So the gameplay of The Witcher 2 threw me off a little since I was used to those types of RPG's.Once I sat down and finally understood how the game was supposed to be played I was hooked. The story line is one of the best I have experienced in a game. The characters are well developed and I took a keen interest in everyone I met along the way. The combat was different, but once I got used to it, it was good in it's own unique way. Oh and the graphics, WOW. The graphics are some of the best I have seen on any game.The only complaints I have for this game is lack of direction on some of the sidequests. You will get a sidequest and normally you would think that a quest marker would show on your map, or some kind of guidance on what you are supposed to do. Not here. You have to figure it out the hard way. But it it does give the game some challenge and I felt rewarded once I completed a sidequest.All in all a great game and a wonderful experience.

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

This holds true for the story, the missions and most of all, the gameplay.  This is quite a feat, and this is why this was the most fun I've had playing an open world action game since GTA: San Andreas.In Infamous, you control Cole, a bike messenger who finds himself endowed with amazing & destructive electrical powers after surviving a mysterious explosion in the middle of the city in which he lives.  Cole is a great character.  He says all the things you'd expect a completely pissed off regular-Joe-turned-bad@$$ to say.  Right away, you are tossed into the middle of a conspiracy that grows more sinister and intriguing with each completed mission.  All the while, Cole has to deal with his ever growing abilities as well as the city's residents' reactions to him.  There are \"good\" and \"evil\" choices that you will have to make in this game that will not only affect the storyline and the city's reactions to you, but also the way your superpowers evolve.  This system is very well implemented and seamlessly blends into the story and gameplay.  The story unfolds beautifully (especially with the help of some awesome, graphic novel-inspired cut scenes) and never loses pace nor substance, and is capped by the first game ending this generation that has completely blown me away.  Missions are never dull either.  Although there are several missions that require similar objectives, all the missions feel distinct and fresh.  They never feel like tasks or chores.  This is quite the accomplishment for a game with so many missions!The highlight of Infamous is the gameplay.  Infamous excels on all fronts in this department.  Controlling Cole is a sheer joy.  This is the first open world game I've ever played where moving my character from place to place never once felt tedious in the 30+ hours I put into the game.  A lot of this has to do with Cole's abilities.  He is capable of easily scaling buildings, jumping (and later gliding) from rooftop to rooftop, making dramatic drops from the tops of skyscrapers to the streets below, electrically sliding across train tracks and power lines...there are just so many ways that Cole can use his powers and the environment to make even the most basic movements a thrill.  One aspect of the game that surprised me because it was so unexpected is the platforming.  There are several sections of the game where Cole has to platform across areas to accomplish mission objectives and these parts of the game are just awesome, especially the levels in the sewers.  Cole's ever evolving abilities make the platforming more and more fun as the game progresses.  In a nutshell, just moving Cole around Empire City is a thrill.  I don't recall ever playing an open world game where this was the case.The other great element of the gameplay is the combat.  It's extremely satisfying and extremely fun.  Especially when fighting at street level, a battle with multiple enemies can look up looking like a big budget Jerry Bruckheimer production.  Electricity and bullets flying everywhere, explosions bursting all around you, cars and bodies getting hurled through the air...you have to see it to believe it.  It's just as fun as it sounds.  Enemies attack from around you, above, and below.  As Cole's powers become more advanced and more destructive, he gains the abilities to wipe out huge groups of enemies in seemingly unlimited ways, which makes you feel like a truly powerful being.  And when you combine the combat with the exceptional freedom of movement the game provides, it just multiplies the fun factor.  Bottom line, this is a fun game to play.  One of the funnest I've ever played.There are a couple of improvements that could be made.  While the game isn't visually weak in any way, it doesn't have a striking visual style that so many other games this generation do have.  This is not a hindrance in any way.  The graphics are very satisfactory, if unspectacular.  Another issue has to do with the climbing mechanic, a double edged sword.  When Cole is either jumping or falling and passes close by a surface that can be grabbed, he will grab it.  90% of the time, this is a good thing.  It is necessary to be able to keep Cole under control in these situations without too much difficulty.  But there are also times when it becomes a nuisance, like for instance when you are trying to grab an item that is hovering beneath the window sill of the 13th floor of a 25 story building.  Like the graphics, this is not a game breaker in any way, just a minor flaw that doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game at all.A final thought....this is the first game I've played that I think be absolutely incredible in 3D, and would greatly benefit by being presented in that medium.If you own a PS3 and you like open world action games, you can't afford to miss this one.  It's simply awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"A Link Between Sequels and Remakes","reviewText":"Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is a fine game, which is unsurprising since it does not stray far from its roots.  A Link Between Worlds is being billed as a direct sequel to Zelda: A Link to the Past, the Super Nintendo game regarded by many as the best Zelda game ever, and even considered by some to be the greatest video game of all time.The gameplay is largely the same, the map is the same, and even the narrative structure of the story is the same.  Depending on your attitude toward Nintendo, A Link Between Worlds stands as an example of wonderful nostalgia or alternatively another example of Nintendo's inability to generate new, relevant ideas.The game is short.  This comes as a blessing to those who found Zelda: Skyward Sword to be composed of too much filler.  On the other hand, the roughly ten hour story may leave people feeling gipped.  Each dungeon also felt shorter than the average Zelda dungeon, though I don't have any empircal data to back that claim up.  Personally, I resented the filler fetch quests from Skyward Sword, so it was nice that the game returned to its dungeon-focused roots.  I also appreciated that the game has less dialogue than Skyward Sword.The sticking point with some Zelda purists may be the change in how most of the classic Zelda items are acquired.  Instead of finding the big chest in dungeons that contains the bomb bag, bow, boomerang, etc., most of these classic Zelda items are acquired from an item rental shop.  When you die, any rented items are returned to the store and you have to pay the rental fee again to rent them out (later in the game you can buy the items permanently to avoid the death penalty).The change in the Zelda formula has the consequence of altering the feel of the dungeons because you are no longer hunting for the big chest item in each dungeon that unlocks secrets that you may have passed by in the overworld.  Instead, fairly early on in the game, you can rent out all the items in the store, which unlock most of the secrets in the overworld.  (There are still a few items that must be obtained through dungeon progression).On the other hand, the free availability of most of the items allows you to tackle most of the dungeons in the order of your liking.  It also makes the puzzles somewhat more difficult to figure out.  In older Zelda's, it was fairly obvious that the item you obtained in the dungeon was the answer to most of the puzzles in that dungeon.  That reasoning no longer applies to A Link Between Worlds.  However, the freedom to complete dungeons in any order also presents scaling problems with the dungeon's bosses.  Since most of the dungeons can be completed in any order, the bosses are all scaled in difficulty to be vanquishable by a weaker player.  Thus, by the time you upgrade your equipment and collect your final heart containers, you'll be rolling through the final bosses fairly easily.Personally, I enjoyed A Link Between Worlds quite a bit, though admittedly I got a good deal on it.  If I had paid full retail price, I may not feel the same way.  IMO, A Link Between Worlds is a game to rent, or alternatively to buy, play and sell.  If you liked A Link To The Past, the nostalgia alone will satisfy you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"Excellent sound quality, clear and crisp","reviewText":"I must admit I was slightly surprised with the XP400 Digital Headset from Turtle Beach.  Normally I play games with my xbox (and playstation) hooked up to a fairly expensive full surround sound system. I didn't think the XP400 would quite live up to the experience I was used to but it did.The headset delivers full dolby digital and is very crisp and clear. It's extremely easy to setup on both the Xbox and the Playstation 3 and comes with a dual band connection so that it does not interfere with your wireless network (2.4 and 5. I chose 5 as my network runs on 2.4).  Low bass noise as well as high treble and the ranges inbetween are very sharp and not tinny in the high range nor distorted in the low range.The in-built microphone works well for chatting whilst playing games and hearing other players' chat is much better than using the chorded Microsoft headphones that come with the Xbox.There are a couple of downsides to the XP400, hence why only a 4 star rating rather than 5.  The first of which is the tight fitting of the headphones.  Over time and use however I expect this to loosen slightly and be more comfortable.  The other is the actual padding on the earpieces. Out of the box it feels quite solid and abrasive however again with time and use I think this become more tolerable.The XP400 headset isn't exactly cheap, weighing in at nearly $200 however they are fairly comfortable to wear and the sound quality is excellent.  If you have children (or a spouse) who likes to play games loudly in one room whilst you are trying to watch TV in another, I can definately see the XP400 being worth the investment.  Even if that is not the case, you may wish to consider these for the excellent sound quality.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZBP6","description":"","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"They didn't reinvent the genre with MOP: so what?","reviewText":"World of Warcraft, now a veteran on the market, is one of the most successful RPGs of all time. In its latest installment, we're taken to a whole new continent full of a race of Pandas who are based on Chinese culture.The Good:1. Monks - The monk class is extremely interesting, able to fill all roles and with some mechanics that are new to WoW. A healer monk (mistweaver) is the highlight as you can actually melee things to heal your group. In fact, one of the best high-end raid strategies for a healer monk involves him spending almost the entire fight doing melee DPS while healing. This is being referred to as \"fistweaving\", and it's one of the most powerful healing techniques in the game as of the time of my writing this.2. The Presentation - The game has a lot more speech and much better storytelling in the quests. The zones are beautiful, and the new models are perfect. The main gripe still is that old player models need an update.3. The Raiding - WoW is still the best game out there for a MMO PVE raiding experience. In other words, the endgame 10-25 man boss fights are incredibly well designed and fun compared to the competition. The game still has a healthy raiding community with thousands of guilds vying to be the top guild on the wowprogress website. Looking For Raid tool allows solo players to see the raids in a dumbed-down version, but the content is similar enough that it prepares new players for the real thing. No other MMO on the market has a system like this. The raiding experience really sets this game apart.The Bad:1. Daily Quests - This is an issue that Blizzard has acknowledged, so it's expected to improve over time. The problem is that players are pushed to progress by participating in daily quest chains which are very boring. You must do these in order to unlock the vendor gear that you're going to want to be an effective raider. While it's totally possible to be a successful player without doing daily quests, it would take you a lot longer to gear up. Even though Blizzard claims they will make this less necessary, I am disappointed that the quests are so boring. They could have had a lot fewer quests and just stuck with the fun ones like the bombing runs, gunning mini games, racing mini game, and other similar quests. Right now those are diluted by hundreds of kill and fetch quests. It's not a bad thing to have to go out there and kill things, but killing 12 non-elite mogu every day gets very boring. Killing a big boss every day is much more fun.2. Talents and glyphs - Talents and glyphs are mostly impotent these days, and do not significantly alter the way you play your class. The only reason this isn't gamebreaking is that there are so many classes and class specializations to choose from, and all of them are viable these days. While the talent tree may have felt more complex in Vanilla WoW, you could only pick one role to fill for your class in a raid. Now you can pick any role. Druids alone could fill 4 different roles if they wanted, and with success. I'm still putting this down as bad because any MMO is going to be better with more player control over their character. I would like at least a little more control over how my spec plays.3. PVP - PVP in WoW is basically instanced battlegrounds, some of which are the same things you've been doing since 2007. I want more maps for the same game type. After all these years, we're still running the flags across the same Warsong Gulch. No thanks. WoW's PVP is not exactly subpar for the genre, but it's clearly taking a backseat to raiding.Final Words:In the end, I still give this game a 5 star rating. If you want a huge role playing game to play with millions of people, WoW is still the best one. Other games like Guild Wars 2 have made the questing more fun and the world more alive, but nobody tops the WoW endgame raid experience or the exceptional class design. When it comes down to it, I'd still rather play WoW for the long haul.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FW87AI","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Probably the last good WWE game","reviewText":"This game has it all. Good graphics, good sound, a robust career mode, a deep CAW mode, optional control (face buttons or analog grapples), good music, an excellent roster, a plethora of moves, GM mode etc.This is probably the last good WWE game that was released other than SVR 2009 and 2011.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics are excellent, especially considering how limited the PS2 is in the graphical department. I really enjoy how full of impact each move actually looks. Certainly, while it doesn't touch WWE smackdown Vs Raw (the first game), it certainly isn't a slouch.Each wrestler are highly detailed and the arenas are nice to look at as well. With that said, there are a few gripes I had about this which are minor.Some wrestlers hair textures had clipping issues and although I used component cables, there was absolutely no difference in seeing this game with Component cables and an S-video cable other than it being slightly easier to see and perhaps the color being vibrant. Still, if you played SVR 2006, Or the first SVR game alongside HCTP, you'll notice the resolution is a little lower in this game. Nothing major, but nothing not worth noting. I also have run into slight slowdown at times when the ring is filled, but this is far too rare. Just worth noting.I wasn't exactly crazy about the game's menu layout. I could care less about seeing WWE clips endlessly looping the side of the option selections, but it does change things up a bit. The graphics are actually really good to be honest. Unfortunately, this game has terrible loading time that can be a minute or longer.Sound-The sound is somewhat recycled from SVR2006 only a little different thanks to &#34;money in the bank&#34; and different superstars being introduced to the roster.During career mode, the dialogue is fantastic, almost along the lines of being as good but not quite good as SVR 2006. The slams sound hard, the chair shots sound good and the commentary is good enough though very dull at times.Gameplay-Easily the best aspect of this game would be the gameplay. SVR 2007 introduces a few new game mechanics and the return of weight detection. Much like SVR (the first game), you're able to do certain things before a match such as shove an opponent, lock up or cheap shot etc.You also get a great level of interactivity with the arena such as being able to rip signs from fans, take drinks from fans or hide behind referees etc. In addition to this game being so interactive, this is also the first game to introduce the ultimate grapple control where you can do things such as pull off a delayed vertical suplex and hold your opponent in position for as long as you want provided your stamina is high enough.You can continuously bash an opponent's head against the turnbuckle or steel post provided they don't reverse you.Anyway, there's a big selection of match types and a robust roster which I'll get into now. The roster features-Kurt Angle, Big Show, John Cena, Randy Orton, MVP, John Morrison, Viscera, Carlito, Bobby Lashley, Booker T, Finlay, Undertaker, Triple H, Great Khali, Edge, Chris Benoit, Chris Masters, Boogeyman, Mick foley, Mr. Kennedy, Paul Burchill, Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis), JBL, Joey Mercury, William Regal, Umaga, Vito, Mark Henry, Kid Kash, Lance Cade, Kane, Snitsky, Batista, Chavo Guerrero, Trevor murdock, Gregory Helms, Bam Bam Bigelow, Mr.Perfect, Hulk Hogan,  Bret Hart, Tazz, Mankind, Mick Foley, Dude Love, Mr. Perfect, Shane Mcmahon, The Rock, Eddie Guerrero, Cactus Jack, Steve Austin, Lita, Torrie Wilson, Candice Michelle etc.In short, the roster is impressive and probably even more impressive after you play with the CAW mode and expand the roster.The match selection is the usual with Money in the Bank tossed in.Single, Triple Threat, Fatal Four way, royal rumble, buried alive, elimination chamber, Money in the bank, TLC, Hell in a cell, steel cage Fulfill your fantasy,  etc.The pacing of this game is really good and you can actually have some pretty good matches against the CPU or with a friend. I really enjoyed the optional control schemes and the game's presentation. Unfortunately, the next game in the SVR series fell short of memorable being that it's the pits.This game is much better on the Xbox 360 and features shorter loading times. The ps2 version holds it's own and I thoroughly enjoyed this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2013"}

It is great that you can listen to the scanner communication between the cops, and you can adjust your strategy on the fly. Overall, this is a better multiplayer experience in Hot Pursuit mode, but the single player is quite lacking.Now to the many criticisms...First, the cheap camera tricks such as stand-still effects is very annoying, particularly when things are getting exceptionally tricky.  Next, the damage should be much more realistic.  Additionally, the game should have included a 4-player or even an 8-player experience, with spectactor as an option for the other players like in NASCAR Thunder.  Lastly, it is annoying that the cops in single-player mode generally focus on you, and not the other cars, especially the leader of the race (quite often) when he or she gets far ahead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2002"}

There are more difficulty settings to tinker with and it was hard to find the sweet spot of challenge and fun at the same time. First thing that bugs me is the VIP code to play online, I got mine with the code so it was not an issue for me, but I am not happy with the idea of VIP codes. The second part that bugs me is the forced on Gymkhana aspect of the game, some of those stages were really difficult and hindered the progression of career mode. The third part that bothered me is the locked track as if the publisher knew it would have DLC and put it on the menu that those tracks/events were not unavailable as standard but for purchase. Now I see months later, the publisher comes out with a \"complete\" edition containing all the tracks that were locked from the first release.

In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

It is strange, and nowhere near as good as Ocarina of Time, but it is oddly amusing. It is a lot of fun to collect the masks and figure out what you're supposed to do with them.

Your fairy, Belle(or Tatl in the English version) can get a bit annoying however, even more so than Navi was. The time limit is also annoying - you can't take more than an hour to beat each dungeon or you have to start all over. Definitely get this game if you like weird stuff or just Zelda in general. I must warn you, however - Princess Zelda is not a part of this at all, and it doesn't really have much to do with the vague but existent Zelda storyline. If you have a choice between this and Ocarina of Time - get Ocarina of Time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2002"}

We have two in our house.  I've been especially careful to keep them cool, and so far they have run without a hitch.However, the new Halo Edition that I bought has a power button that's a bit wonky right out of the box (it only works when you push the right edge).  It's fine, because I hardly ever use the power button, but it just illustrates that there are still some issues on the newer models.On to the games.  This is what makes the XBOX 360 the clear choice over the PS3 and the Wii.  If you look at the exclusives--Bioshock, Gears of War, Halo 3, Forza Motorsport--the PS3 titles can't touch it.  Even cross platform games are coming out first on the 360, and often times look and run better because the PS3 is apparently difficult to program for, and while \"on paper\" they say it's more powerful, it's technically constrained in other ways.I might buy a Wii eventually, but if I could have only one console it would be the 360.  The Wii is great for casual gamers but the control scheme is rather gimmicky to me.

Houston","summary":"Surprisngly Good Deus Ex Style Shooter","reviewText":"I purchased this game for the Xbox 360 without any idea what to really expect other than a shooter.  As a shooter it's a mediocre game, and there are a lot of better titles out there.  As an overall game though, it's a fun title.  The graphics and controls can be a bit clunky, but are still good.  The AI is usually decent, but sometimes will have a complete meltdown which can be frustrating or disappointing.  The story progression and the characters are excellent.  What makes this game is the choices you can make and the results of those actions.  Do you try to do X, or save person Y, or try to figure out alternative Z.  All of the main characters in the game you can attempt to become friends or enemies with, ally with them or betray them, let them live or kill them (or let them get killed).  The RPG elements are a split of perks for performing certain actions or accomplishments, and a selection of skills and specialties to suit your play style. Alpha Protocol is substantially longer game than a normal shooter.  The multiple endings are also a nice touch even though they are all lackluster in their execution.  Overall I enjoyed this game, and I'm really glad I ended up picking it up.  I would suggest giving it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Call of Duty 4-ever!","reviewText":"Should a game's rating be punished if it's basically just an update of something that's already been done? I don't think so. If you like a good First Person Shooter, look no further than the Call of Duty series...whether it's Infinity Ward'sCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfareor Treyarch's Call of Duty: World at War...or both!...you won't soon get sick of storming the plethora of battle fields that the games have to offer on and off line.World at War is a really fun game with extremely intense battle sequences. And an upside to World at War over Modern Warfare is that offline, split screen, campaign co-op is available so that you can play with friends or family.In single player Campaign mode, you're back in WWII with a team of characters that are your band of AI brothers. I think that the AI was a little better in Modern Warfare, because in Modern Warfare there were some missions that you could rely on the AI of your squad to get you through; in World at War you're mostly on point and there aren't any chapters that you can breeze right through without firing your weapon(s).As some familiar voices command you through (like Kiefer Sutherland), you fight your way through some intense chapters. The weapons aren't as good as the ones in Modern Warfare, but that was to be expected going back to WWII. However, the World at War weapons are a huge improvement over what was offered inCall of Duty 3(including a flame thrower!!!). You're mostly shooting whichever WWII weapon you happen to have picked up (mostly from dead soldiers on the ground) along your objective route. Your objectives that guide you along are updated regularly as you complete each task throughout each chapter. And some of those tasks are brutal.All of the chapters are really fun, but some of the chapters are really difficult. The early chapters are designed more to challenge you to correctly navigate yourself and your team to the correct objective and get a feel for the weaponry, but World at War gets progressively more fun and difficult at the same time.Online multiplayer play is a different world, and very similar to Modern Warfare...you'd almost think that Infinity Ward and Treyarch were the same company; Activision did a great job in not fixing a system that wasn't broken for online play. No AI brothers online...just your fellow gamers. You'd better have your FPS skills honed if you think that you'll beat some of the online players. The more you play, the higher you rank allowing you to unlock more (fine tuned) weapons. Like Modern Warfare, once you level up to the best weapons and perks, the game gives you the opportunity to go \"Prestige\", meaning if you start back from level one you can level up all over again and be rewarded with a badge of honor and another slot to create a class of weapons / perks. Not me, pal. Unlike Modern Warfare, once I get to the highest level in my first level-up, I'm staying there for World at War; you don't get the flame thrower until the highest level, and I'm not turning that in after only one level of play...no way, man!World at War even throws a multiplayer game modes at you that weren't available in Modern Warfare (like War and Capture the Flag).Oh, and how can I not mention World at War's online co-op mode? I haven't played the campaign mode in co-op online; I have enough fun with my kids offline doing that. BUT...the online co-op mode of Nazi Zombies is a BLAST!!! You're holed up in one of the buildings familiar enough from one of the multiplayer maps. Outside hordes of zombies attempt to break through the boarded up windows and doors to get in and tear you up. It's your job to rebuild the barriers on the windows and take the zombies out before they can get in and get you. You'll also need to revive your teammates if they get taken down by a zombie. The room is 4-player max, and if one of your mates goes down you'd better revive him if you expect to survive yourself. Nazi Zombies mode is a real team effort, and it's as addictive as multi-player! The downside (as of this writing) of zombie mode is that there's only one map to play on (and it's only unlocked if you finish the single player campaign).So all in all Call of Duty: World at War is major fun. I suggest that anyone with a PS3 NOT miss out on this super-fun, FPS game. Add it to your cart beforeKillzone 2comes out and takes up all of your time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2009"}

Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.The return of Commander Shepard.View larger.A new cast of characters.View larger.Along with familiar faces from the past.View larger.New damage and dialogue systems.View larger.Integration with original game.View larger.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

After recently installing an updated driver for the graphics I thought I'd give it a try.  It installed with no problem but at the end I got a notice saying the game would continue but there might be problems because my hardware was unsupported.  I also installed the latest game patch before starting.  After playing the game through to the end (twice) I can say it worked flawlessly - not a single crash or freeze up.The game is heavy on cinematic cut scenes with fully voiced dialog (including your own character).  It often feels like you are playing an interactive movie.  Actually it is way too long for a movie.  It reminded me of a tv series like Star Trek Voyager.  Each mission was like a new episode.  They all stood on their own but there was also a main story which continued through them all.  The interaction with the other characters was great.I love rpg's and was disappointed at first as you only got to choose male or female.  Shortly into the game though you get to customize your facial features and hair, choose a name and select a class.  It is not a traditional rpg with attributes like strength, dexterity, etc. and the number of skills is limited.  You don't get experience with every kill and you can't loot the bodies.  However, with all the choices you get to make, your growth in skills, weapon upgrades, and the interaction with your crewmates, it definitely belongs in the rpg category.Graphics are great and the voice acting ranges from fair to great.  Some nice touches of humor are mixed into the game.  I loved the fact that there were some missions you could fail and keep playing.  Sure, you could go back to a save and do it over if you wanted but to me it is more realistic to fail sometimes.  There were a few missions that had a \"timed\" element but they were always reasonable - not like some games where a single misstep will cause you to fail.  The AI of your companions is quite good.  You can pause the game and issue orders to them but they act pretty competently on their own.  In the beginning it took me awhile to get used to the controls so my character wasn't very effective but my 2 companions were able to dispatch enemies on their own.Suggestions to make the game better:I would like more skills: hand to hand combat, computers, seduction, negotiating.  It would be nice to have more activities not related to specific missions:  gambling, brothels, holodeck, hunting, contests or tournaments.  How about a training area set up in a cargo bay where you could practice against your crewmates using laser stun guns?The interaction with the other characters could be more complex.  For instance, in the game Jack and Miranda didn't like each other.  What if you selected those two to accompany you on a mission (which I tried) and in the course of events they overcame their differences and learned to get along (which they didn't)?  Why not allow your character to give gifts to crewmates?  Flirt or tease options?Overall, the game is a stunning achievement.  Though not a full fledged rpg in the manner of Oblivion, for instance, the character customization, growth, relationships, and choices of action make it a fun, engrossing game for any fan of the rpg genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"If you liked the movie L.A. Confidential, you will LOVE this game.","reviewText":"PROS:+ Immersive storyline+ Each case is interesting+ Interrogating suspects is the most enjoyable part of the game+ AMAZING character models with MotionScan technologyCONS:- Story advances regardless of high or low rankings- Boring side missions- Abrupt ending (NO SPOILERS)PLOT:It's 1947, and the City of the Angels is in jeopardy of being taken over by corruption, greed, and crime. Enter our WWII hero, Cole Phelps, a police officer who is eager to clean up the streets. Starting out as a beat cop, Cole proves his worth to his fellow officers and advances up the ranks with his fierce dedication and \"by-the-book\" method of following police procedures.GAMEPLAY:I'll start off by saying this game is _NOT_ Grand Theft Auto set in the 1940's. GTA was a very open-ended sandbox world where the main character could be as ruthless as he liked with few consequences (unless he blew up a helicopter, of course). L.A. Noire is quite different because the storyline is very linear...we play the role of a police officer who follows the rules. Causing property damage or hurting pedestrians will hurt your ranking at the end of each case.I'm amazed how fully this game immersed me into a 1940's mindset. When I started playing, I said things like \"I can't BELIEVE this guy is picking things up without crime scene gloves!\" but I reminded myself that CSI techniques were very primitive back then. After playing for a few days, I felt like a gumshoe in a dime novel.There are driving stages, where we attempt to apprehend suspects. There are hostage situations where we need to have a steady shooting hand. There are clues to find and examine in crime scene locations. Cole is able to advance his police rank by correctly interrogating suspects, solving street crimes, and so forth. Advancing our rank can unlock hidden cars, new outfits, and earn Intuition Points.While these elements are fun, the most enjoyable and memorable part of this game is interrogating suspects - we need to ask the right questions and get them to spill the beans. If we get stuck during an interrogation, Intuition Points can be used. These points can be exchanged to remove an incorrect answer, to ask the online community what they chose, or to show all clues.What sets this game apart? The technology called MotionScan.WHAT'S MOTIONSCAN?This is where the actors are recorded by 32 different cameras at the same time. It captures their facial expressions from every possible angle, and this is an integral part of the game. When our character interrogates someone, we try to determine if the suspect is telling the truth, or lying like a cheap rug. Body language, facial tics, head bobs, avoiding eye contact, it's all there. The level of detail is absolutely breathtaking, and you'll remember this part of the game more than anything else.TROPHIES:There are 40 trophies to earn in L.A. Noire, with an additional 20 if you purchase the 4 downloadable cases. Several of the trophies can be earned during the first play through, while others will take some dedication to unlock (such as 100% game completion, driving more than 194.7 miles, finding all the landmark locations, etc.).It's a good balance for the casual player or the dedicated trophy hound.CONS:I was disappointed to see that the main plot advanced whether my character finished a case with a high rank or not. I was thrown for a loop on one case and got a very low final score, but I was promoted to the next division right away. I was fully expecting to see a screen pop saying \"You need to work on your investigative skills if you expect to be promoted!\" or something to that effect.The side missions were not very interesting in L.A. Noire. There are 40 street crimes and they ranged from bank shootouts to suicide calls to peeping tom cases, but all of them were extremely short and break down to shooting someone, stopping someone from fleeing in a car chase, etc.While I enjoyed searching for hidden cars all over the city, I didn't feel much pull to hunt for the Golden Reels...it reminded me of searching for the 200 pigeons in GTA IV. Side missions like going bowling or playing darts or playing pool or choosing music on a 1940's radio would have been more enjoyable.Finally, I thought the ending was very jarring for this game. Once you see it, you can draw your own conclusions. Thankfully, there are a few downloadable cases that make this game last a bit longer before the end.FINAL THOUGHTS:Despite those shortcomings, I thought L.A. Noire was a great game. The haunting music, the high level of interactivity in each level, the superb interrogations, the gathering of clues, and facial animations which looked like they could leap out of the tv screen.  This game didn't pull any punches - there was open racism, full frontal nudity, drug use, cursing and violence...so this game was rated M for good reason.As I said in the title of this review, if you liked the movie L.A. Confidential, you will LOVE this game. I'd highly recommend a purchase, and I would also recommend the additional downloadable cases.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2011"}

I bought my copy from Game Crazy 2 days ago (release day) and it's amazing! Don't let the stupid bad reviews hinder you from getting this! Everything is great about this. The Konquest mode is very entertaining and challenging and fun! You can unlock things from the Krypt in Konquest, find currency, and more! You can now fight people in the actuall game a la Shaolin Monks. It's not as deep as SM but it's very simple and fun. The Krpyt now only contains about 300 items or so and the game only uses one type of currency instead of many. The Krypt even tells you what's inside each lock which is nice.This sports 60 characters and 4 are unlockable when you collect a certain amount of relic items in Konquest. There are 2 fighting styles but be glad for this. It makes the game faster and a bit more fun. The aerial combat is awesome and super fast and flashy. The Kreat-a-Fatality system is VERY fun and rewarding yet is very deep. There are set moves you have to do such as Forward Chains then there are Transitions like putting the oppenent on his knees then finishers for that or transitions from that. Each part is a certain combo, and bosses have their own sets. You also have sword combos but only characters with long single bladed swords can do this. Check GameFaqs for a full list of these combos.Lastly, Kreate-a-Fighter is VERY fun and deep and is just so customizable. You can even type up a biography! Motor Kombat is a bit of a let down. The tracks are very short and after a few races it gets boring but it's better with human oppenents. The Premium Edition is what deserves the 9 here because of UMK3 and the whole packaging thing just adds a lot of coolness to it. Bottom line: Get this game it is THE best 3D fighter to date. You won't regret it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"\"sk8er630\"","summary":"Kingdom Hearts rules Disney OK...","reviewText":"I really loved this game.

It was fun for me to be able to play the games on the TV because I've always had difficulty seeing small details that can be lethal on the small screen. I also got annoyed by having to constantly replace batteries, and never was willing to front the cash to buy an ac adaptor for it. The Super GameBoy was a solution to many problems for me in the handheld arena, but I was really upset when I found out that the GameBoy Color games didn't work on it.Nintendo has brought us an updated version of the Super GameBoy in the form of the GameBoy Player. I was afraid of what the GBA and older games would look like on the big screen as with the Super GameBoy the games looked horrid, but now I am in awe of the GameBoy Advance as a whole. I had no idea that these games looked as good as they do. Some of the games (Metroid Fusion, Tactics Ogre, and Castlevania Aria of Sorrow in particular) are absolutely breathtaking on the big screen! It's like having a Super NES all over again. The nostalgia has overwhelmed me and I can't help but want to shake hands with Nintendo and thank them for this device. Not only did they succeed in bringing GameBoy Advance to the big screen, they found a way to do it and make the games look not just good, but great. Granted some games don't transition quite so well.

When there are a lot of enemies chasing you, you are able to shoot or fight fluidly.  Also when there are enemies far away you are able to shoot from cover well.  I would compare this to heavenly sword with the world and puzzles and bulletstorm also with the world and combat, minus all of the crazy combos in bulletstorm.  This game gets pretty hetic though just like the 2 games I mentioned.Also as a single player I have been the female elf and the male character has saved me various times as well as draws a lot of enemies.  I think it is the best computer controlled companion I have played with so far.Also there is magic for your bow and your melee.Also the graphics in my opinion look great.  The characters are large and the world is huge and varied.  I am only on the second level but have already been through a town and a lot of dungeons.  The levels are huge.  It took me about 6hrs into the second level.  Also it is challenging and I have died a few times.The characters are very cool to me too.  I always like playing mercs.  The story is good to me too so far.I have not finished the game but will update as needed.I read all of the player and pro reviews and feel that this game delivered as promised.  The negative remarks in most reviews I have read are not very significant or are subjective or I have not even noticed the problem.Oh yah the game reminds me of a better champions of norrath also.All in all the game is fun and just like a good movie I am not watching the clock while playing it.If you are interested but not playing because of some of the fair reviews at least rent it and decide for yourself.  I think some that will like it may never play it otherwise.KevinUpdateJuly 7, 2011Finished the game and had a lot of fun.  Don't want to spoil the ending but I am going to play through again I have a feeling there are 2 endings.  Anyway fun game lots of different enemies, some huge cool bosses, and a whole lot of varied and long, long levels.  I played as the archer female and at times it felt a little like borderlands.  Using her it is a very fun shooter.  I had one of my save games ruined, but I am not sure that is the games fault.  It happened after I did a ps3 system update.  No other bugs encountered.  I think maybe it froze once.  Pretty solid game though.  I recommend it, especially at the lower price.  I love the elf character she was super hot and cool.  A lot like the female character from Mercs 2.Also tried a lot of the puzzles that are kind of like side quests to find weapons and stuff.  Didn't finish any of them.  I was never good at puzzles.  I read that the puzzles were easy, but not for me.  Anyway, it is cool.  You can choose to do the side quest puzzles or just stay on the main quest.  The reviews say this is a linear game, but I have to say that I used the L3 button a lot to show me where to go.  The levels are huge and there are some places to go off of the path.Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"M. burns","summary":"Prince of Castlevania","reviewText":"To start, if you have played Prince of Persia, Uncharted, or God of War, you have already played this game and you have already played a better version of this game.  Now I know that a lot of games already have this formula, and these were not necessarily the first to do it, and that it is not necessarily a bad thing, its just that Castlevania seems to have literally reskinned these game's levels and called it Castlevania.  The game also adds nothing to the genre.  In fact, it blantantly plagerizes scenes and dialog from Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Uncharted, Prince of Persia, and so on.Graphics: The game is definitely beautiful.  The backdrops are beautiful and give the game a sense of grandeur.  The character and monster models, with the exception of 2, are also visually outstanding.  My only complaint here is that during cutscenes, the characters are poorly animated.Sound: Awful.  Castlevania's most longstanding trait is its score.  There is no score here.  In fact, most of the time the music just cuts out.  Sound effects are bare minimum here.  The dialog, being bad in and of itself, is poorly voice acted.  Patrick Steward narrates almost all of the game and seems to be phoning in the standard overdramatic fantasy voice.Replay / Value:  High.  The game takes about 20hrs to complete just going through and not going too out of your way to find things.  There is also added value if you are a trophy hunter and want to collect everything and replay the levels with various challenges called trials which range from don't get hit, finish in x time, kill so many using this technque, etc.  The only problem is that a lot of the levels consist of boring jumping around levels a la Prince of Persia so there is questions concerning if you even want to replay them if they were not that fun the first time.Gameplay:  Mixed bag.  50% of the game consists of jumping around landscapes and crumbling buildings, 15% solving puzzles, and 35% combat.  I am not sure about everyone else, but I was done with jumping around after Uncharted and Prince of Persia.  To dedicate so much time of this game just to jump around kind of killed it for me.  The puzzles are actually pretty good.  Combat is questionable.  There are a lot of combos and secondary weapons and so forth but they all are more of the you have to go out of your way to use them variety.  I literally got through the entire game with the strike, strike, roll combo for every encounter and every boss.Presentation:  The game is put together pretty well.  I think the game is broken up a little to much but nothing that kills the game.  The story is a mess and is basically a big plothole, not to mention that I though the story sucked.  There is little here to earn the title Castlevania.  Yeah, I know, its a reboot; but that doesn't mean you can throw out everything that defined Castlevania except for a few stray pieces here and there.In summary, don't go into this game expecting \"Castlevania\", a compelling story, or anything that you haven't seen already in numerous other games.  Probably better off waiting for the $20 price tag.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

Dark Athena is really two games: the original Escape from Butcher bay remastered with a  new graphics engine, and Dark Athena. The voice acting is actually quite excellent. Vin Diesel's lines are short but effective. Cole Hauser, Michelle Forbes (Ro Laren from Star Trek The Next Generation, or Admiral Cain from Battlestar Galactica), and Dwight Schultz (Murdock from the original A-team, or Lt. Reginald Barclay from Star Trek The Next Generation) lend their voices to the games. The graphics are pretty decent for a 2009 release and ran fine with my HD 4870 on full graphics settings.The game play is pretty simple. It is a first person shooter, although you don't always get a gun to shoot. You have to rely on your fists or weapons for much of the game, occasionally using a dead drone's weapon or relying on stealth and night vision to silently take out your prey. There are elements of Thief (relying on shadows and stealth) as well as Portal (using the SCAR gun at the end of Dark Athena to move boxes around). The enemy AI is quarky. They will easily spot you which I didn't like, or they're really easy to take down. It's never a consistent flavor.The controls are exceptional and very intuitive, so you won't waste time trying to perform stunts or tasks. I didn't experience any crashes through both games. The only complaint I have is the menu is very awkward to use. The buttons for the menu settings aren't mapped properly so you have to click on a certain part of the large boxes.Pros: Easy to play, excellent visuals and audio, immersive story, intuitive controlsCons: Inconsistent enemy AI, too short, very linear gameplay.Overall: 4/5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2010"}

I wanted to very badly, but no matter how much I tried I failed in the end. Thankfully NG2 is a bit more forgiving on the easy setting, but new comers will never make it past the first level. The game's story is nothing special and feels like a rehash at best. You have to save the world from the Arch Fiends taking over the world and destroying so you have to hunt them down one by one. The game play is essentially the same as NG1. You have light and heavy attacks along with projectile weapons that you can charge. The game has many more weapons and Ninpo scrolls to use. Weapons range from scythes, tonfas, flails, and even staffs. All the weapons are great and you can upgrade them for up to three levels and after the enemies get too strong for that weapon you'll never use it again.The Ninpo magic is useful for enemies, but useless on bosses since it doesn't do any damage. The can be used to cripple enemies and finish them off with a finishing move. There are a lot of new moves in the game yet they are repeated far too often. You can hack enemies apart into a bunch of pieces and continue to hack them up for overkill bonuses. While you rack up your Karma score you can also buy items from the Masamusa shops which are generously spread throughout the levels and the same goes for save points. I never found the game unfair with checkpoints or saves. Once you die at a boss you start right there in front of the boss again so this makes things less frustrating. Another cool element is being able to run on top of water. You can fight enemies this way as well and just adds to the awesome ninja feel to the game. I also found the controls less responsive than the first game and also a bit sluggish. You'll try to hit an enemy, but they'll back away and hit you but you're stuck in an animation that you can't back out of. This isn't a huge issue but it's still there. Another problem is the camera which is terrible. Instead of following Ryu it'll always stay in one spot so enemies are coming at you blindly. While this also isn't a huge issue it doesn't make things better.Throughout each level is a Test of Valor portal which has you killing as many enemies in the room as you can and rewarding you. These get extremely hard then super easy. The game also looks amazing. While it's not Assassin's Creed or Gears of War amazing it looks astounding with awesome lighting, high res textures, realistic physics and what have you. Another problem is that the game is insanely linear with literally only one straight path to go on. this makes fighting a bit cramped sometimes, but overall isn't a huge issue. A lot of people will have the biggest problem with the difficulty. While it's tolerable on easy you'll never beat normal or, god forbid, hard.What makes the game so hard are the limited healing items, some cheap enemies, and the sluggish controls. You never really feel powerful enough no matter what weapons you get. I really hated this and is the most disappointing part of the game. There are also times where the frame rate will chug when there are tons of enemies on-screen. This makes those sections even more annoying.The game has lots of gore, sexy women, cool weapons and magic, a long campaign, leaderboards, amazing visuals, but it falls down some with sluggish controls, a bad camera and insane difficulty. If you loved NG1 you're going to have a blast here, but if the first game made you feel standoffish then pick NG2 up because you'll be able to at least beat the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

And that's not necessarily a bad thing, because the platforming genre had by this time been hammered down to a few absolutely key elements that are necessary for such a title to be successful. At a glance, the game presents nothing all that noteworthy; a gratingly bubbly cartoonish cast, a story pulled right out of a coloring book, bright and shiny graphics to match, the existence of an occasional power-up, and a large cluster of bottomless pits. Make no mistake, if you cringe at the thought of spending a few days in front of a game that looks and speaks like something you'd expect to see on a Saturday morning cartoon, this is absolutely not the game for you. If you share a house with more than just a pet or two, your roommate(s), spouse(s) or family member(s) will be making fun of you. If you're at a point, spiritually and emotionally, where you can deal with that... there's a somewhat enjoyable little game buried underneath it all.The storyline is easy to establish, short on dialogue and heavy on gameplay, and that's just about the extent of the good things I can say about it. The story is bare bones at best, establishing the good guys and the bad guys right off the bat, (the bad guys are the ones with tusks) introducing a conflict (the guys with tusks want to unleash chaos on the world) and a motivation, (Jak's buddy Daxter falls into a pit of mystery goo, transforming him into a furry critter) eventually unleashing you out onto the world to fight evil or some such nonsense. The characters themselves are just paper-thin and almost completely devoid of emotion or appeal.Jak, the main character, (naturally) is conspicuous in his silence throughout the tale, leaving the majority of the speaking parts to the green sage (an elderly wizard who grants you a miniature nugget of motivation at the outset of each level) and Daxter, (the aforementioned furry sidekick, equipped with enough cheesy one liners to make Rodney Dangerfield spin wildly in his grave) both of whom are way, way over the top in the \"flamboyant personality\" department. Once in a while, the sage's daughter will pop in to share a new bit of technology or something, and as you visit new towns you'll meet a new character or two, but for the most part it's Daxter and the sage bouncing off of one another and Jak standing around to make confused or frustrated faces.If you've played any of the post-SNES three dimensional platformers that preceded it, you've probably got a good handle on how Jak and Daxter feels. You've got an overhead camera dangling just behind you at all times, a couple very basic attacks, and the vital ability to jump. As you progress through the game, you'll discover different variations upon Jak's abilities as they're necessitated, such as the ability to somersault, to crouch, to double-jump and to long jump. What's cool is that these abilities aren't something you need to unlock... they're available right from the get-go, so there's a process of experimental discovery that makes you feel directly involved in Jak's progression as a character. On the other hand, the existence of these abilities and instructions on their use are never truly explained, so if you haven't discovered the long jump by the time Jak needs to clear a large canyon by his lonesome, you're in for a long, painful series of trials and errors.Despite the occasional difficulty in explaining its own controls, the actual gameplay of Jak is largely a lot of fun. Obstacles are challenging without being frustrating, most of the puzzles are just difficult enough to whir your gears without forcing you to seek out a walkthrough in a moment of fury, and the boss fights are wholly entertaining. It makes good use of the power-ups, staggering them early to get you used to their intentions and then introducing them at just the right times as they become more and more important later in the game. It does have a few small hiccups that will continually bother a refined gamer by failing to function as designed at critical moments. For example, Jak doesn't always latch onto the corner of a ledge, Prince of Persia-style, like he's supposed to. Nine times out of ten, he'll perform the brave feat without hesitation, but it seems like the most important jumps are usually where he has the most trouble, slamming into the edge of a platform and then awkwardly vibrating for a moment before falling to his death. Likewise, the extremely touchy nature of the double-jump system also provides for its share of headaches.Although I complained a bit earlier about the game's hesitancy to fully explain its control scheme, once you've experimented enough to actually discover all of the characters' possible actions, the full control scheme is really very basic and easy to grasp. The way some games map out their button setups, I wonder if they're expecting players to have an extra arm installed to make some certain actions possible (the Xbox release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas springs to mind.) Jak overcomes this potential flaw by keeping things extremely simple and never requiring the use of more than two or maybe three buttons at the same time, analog stick included. By limiting themselves to the R1 button, the four main control buttons (X,O,Triangle and Square) and the analogs, they ensure you never need to move a finger into an awkward position and allow you to really envelop yourself in the game.I think I was expecting a bit more out of the graphics, since this was an early title for the PS2 and that's usually when developers are frothing at the mouth over the new hardware and going out of their way to show off everything it can do. The visuals of Jak and Daxter just feel like a marginal improvement over the visuals of Naughty Dog's PSone titles, and certainly didn't age well in the almost five years since it was released. Part of that is due to the cartoony direction taken by the art, but you can't blame the lumpy renderings of the sage's face when speaking or the distractingly simplistic appearance of most of the game's enemies on artistic decision. Some things, such as the distant skylines in the forest and the radiating glow of eco matter in the wild, are very well executed, but on the large this is no showpiece for the PS2's visual capabilities. Bluntly, if you're looking for an exceptional early graphical display on the PS2, keep looking.Voice acting aside, I can't say much nicer things about the audio. I suppose it's of a higher quality than the tunes found on the old PSone, albeit not by much, but the compositions themselves are so aggravatingly bouncy, joyful and happy that if you aren't, in actuality, a Care Bear, you'll want to rip your hair out by the roots. While I'm not sure something like heavy metal or R&B; would suit the feel of the game much better, I was expecting something a little more contemporary and interesting, considering the marketing that announced the game's launch (remember the commercials with the title characters reclining, poolside, with a cluster of bikini-clad young ladies? Yeah, I don't think they were aiming those at the 7-10 year old market.) The voice acting is sound, for the most part, with a few performances standing out above the others. The dark sage's voice perfectly matches his demeanor and appearance, while the green sage really feels like an old man tired of the world that surrounds him, but determined to aid in its resuscitation, all the same. On the other side of the coin, bad voice acting isn't exactly missing, either, and the dialog is so bad that even the competent actors have trouble making their lines come to life.When stripped down to its very basics, Jak and Daxter is an entertaining play. While there isn't anything the actual gameplay does badly, nit-picky flaws aside, there's also nothing that it really excels at. It's a good next-gen translation of an already-enjoyable system of mechanics, controls and direction, basically reading the map drawn by its forefathers and following it to the gold buried at the end. If it weren't for the abysmal storytelling, the hot and cold voice acting and the sub par graphics and sound, this would probably be deserving of a score well above average, that map is so well-drawn. Unfortunately, I can't honestly say that those factors don't affect my opinion of the disc itself, and they drag my score down by quite a bit. If you can shut your brain off or go to make a sandwich during the speaking parts and accept the visuals for what they are, you'll really enjoy this one. For those of us looking for a complete package, prepare to be somewhat disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2005"}

And the day it dropped one of my closest homies (who was also a co-worker) called in sick that day. GTA 3 originally was exclusive to PS2. Which pissed me off, cause I had a Dreacast (& GTA2 among my games). This game was the reason why I bougt a PS2 shortly after this game dropped....Playing DVD's was fine. But GTA3 was thee S**t!!! The game was revolutonairy for it's open world enviornment. The games world actually mimmicked real world....It'd go from day to night. It'd get rainy or foggy. People (AI) walking down streets would just randomly mug other AI's or jack them for their car! You could pick up \"street walkers\", carry a variety of weapons. Ranging from bats,pistols,shot guns,sniper rifles,fully automatics,flame thrower,molotove,gernades, & RPG's! You could sniperPeople, rob people, do missions (including vigilante missions). Or my favorite....Just mess around in an open world. You could drive various cars, trucks, buses, ambulance, cop car, fire truck, a tank, & even a ride w/ hydrollics!!! Sure the game isn't as awesome now in comparissum to it's sequals & some other new games. But for it's time it was the new standard for gaming!

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"Xina143","summary":"Game, video, internet - All in one.","reviewText":"First I will note that we bought this at a local store since almost every place was out of them at the time. We wanted a second PS3 for our bedroom, so we could watch our collection of BluRay discs and play games if desired. Having a second unit also allows the kids to play while not in the family room - so we can watch something and they can go hide and play.We have one of the original 60Gb PS3s and now the 120Gb slim. The original is quiet, shiny, and bulky. The slim is a bit loud, not so bulky, and the matte finish is great. In regards to looks, it looks 10x better. Function, it is nearly identical for our uses - play PS3 games, and watch BluRay movies. The new vibrating controller is cool. And of course, the bigger hard drive is a factor, but I doubt we will get near the threshold of either system any time soon. But as noted the new Slim unit is a bit louder. And being in the bedroom, that is an annoyance. The fan is louder - probably due to the smaller size. It is not overwhelming, but louder nonetheless. And the disc tray is much louder. Entering and ejecting a disc in the original PS3 is almost silent. Doing the same in a Slim is like using dial up internet. It lets out a loud, mechanical sound. Of course, these louder components do not deter from the quality of the product and the joy our family will get out of it.BluRay is great, the list of games is growing, and the quality of those games is expanding as well. Sony is even getting into some TV shows dedicated specifically for the PS3/PS Store like the reality show, The Tester. Of course, we would love for the PS3 to allow Hulu and some other online sources of shows, but it does play NetFlix.So for the price of consoles that only allow gaming, or only allow NetFlix, or only allow DVD, the PS3 is worth every penny. It allows an abundance of features all in one box. And to be honest, you can't really go wrong with the new Slim version or a refurbished original PS3. Neither one stands out above the other.One other note, the PS3 is definitely made for an HDTV. We only have an old SDTV in our bedroom. Playing games and watching BluRay on our HDTV in the family room is awe-inspiring. Doing the same on the SDTV is not so grand. In fact, subtitles in some movies and games is impossible to read on the SDTV. And brightness has to be adjusted quite a bit to be able to play some games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2010"}

Enjoy a total of seven Mega Man games with remixed soundtracks original and sketch art, plus many other cool features!","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Not as fun as MMAC, but close","reviewText":"A short while after releasing the solid Mega Man Anniversary Collection, Capcom wisely heeds the call of its fans for the re-release of the blue bomber's older, tougher, future self in Mega Man X Collection. Bringing another heaping portion of the finest 2D platforming around in six yummy courses, it even throws in a racing game and some extra goodies for dessert.The X series debuted in the early 90's on the SNES with a darker, more mature feel designed to expand on the tried and true formula of the original NES titles. The main difference lies in the progressive, overarching plot dealing with human/reploid (fancy word for robot) conflict and some very grown-up ideas about this self-proclaimed 'race' of androids seeking freedom and realizing their dream of a robotopia. That's pretty intense for a side-scroller.As far as gameplay evolution, the X games focus on collecting various ability upgrades and health extensions in addition to the old \"kill the bosses and get their special powers\" mechanic of the classic Mega Man. New actions like charge shots, dashing and hovering add a deeper set of variables to the equation and really flesh out the experience. Gone are Cut-Man and Dust-Man, as the baddies in X get wacky animal-based monikers like Spark Mandrill, Morph Moth and my personal favorite, Duff McWhalen.Mega Man X through X6 are included in this fairly robust package, covering three SNES and three PSOne titles released over an eight-year period, and each game adds variation and depth to the experience. X3 introduces the mysterious, androgynous, light-sabering Zero as a partially playable character (think Proto-Man with a ponytail), and X4 tops that by giving Zero his own playable storyline. Things start to take a turn for the worse in X5 and X6, however, where the heavy plotlines and vast amount of upgrades start to buckle under their own weight. Ultimately, the bells and whistles of the PS titles hasten the slow decline from the series' original greatness by adding a bit too much drama and cheesy gameplay tactics.All the games share the same sweet, distinctive art style of cartoonish robo-animals and colorful, interactive levels. The emulation is rock solid, and unlike the Mega Man Anniversary Collection, you can now configure your controller however you see fit. There's no noticeable difference between the PS2 and Gamecube versions, although the PS2's controller is better suited for hours upon hours of holding that charge shot while trying to dash-jump off walls.Barring a strange audio loop plaguing the SNES games, the sound is spot-on, too. Nice, catchy tunes carry you through the whole shebang. The sound effects are faithful as well, although the PS titles tie annoying 'Yeah!' and 'Hah!' sound effects to every jump and attack, and I guarantee your ears will ring with the sound of a held charge shot after a few hours.Password support is still in working order for X, X2 and X3, so feel free to skip to the end, but you're also able to simply save your progress to a memory card like the PS games. The incentive to bust through the first three titles lies in the fact that once completed, you'll unlock Mega Man Battle and Chase, which is a Mario Kart-esque racer that was only released in Japan. It's nice to see such a rarity, but why they buried it beneath three other games is mystifying. As you plow through the other games, you'll also unlock various art galleries and soundtracks to fawn over, if you're the type.And it's hard not to be at this price - thirty bucks for seven games ain't too shabby, even if a few of them aren't terrific. While the Mega Man Anniversary Collection contained more meat, there's simply a ton of robots to blast, dozens of armor capsules to grab, and really no good reason not to let ol' Blue back in your life once again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVYE","description":"Sequel to the popular Legend of Zelda game, by Nintendo, for the original NES console.","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"The Mark of The Triforce!","reviewText":"What can be said about Zelda II? Some fans of the series hate this game because it's not like the others. It's certainly different, but Zelda II is still a good game. It's exploration style isn't as good as the original, but it more than makes up for that with nonstop action.Story: It's Sleeping Beauty with elves and magic triangles. Link turns 16, which point he develops a strange crest with triangles on his hand. Impa, Zelda's handmaiden, tells him this means he must awaken Princess Zelda -- not the Impa's Zelda, a different earlier Princess Zelda. (The English version of the game never really clarifies that point.) To accomplish this, Link needs to place six crystals in well-guarded places. Doing this will not only awaken the Princess, but usher in an age of prosperity for all Hyrule (if I recall correctly). So, Link sets off on his most adventuresome journey yet.Gameplay: Unlike the original Legend of Zelda's four-directional overhead gameplay, most of the actual gameplay takes place in a side-scrolling environment. There is an overworld map, but it's only used to reach the side-scrolling areas. WHile your walking through the overworld, enemies spawn and chase you. If they catch you, a battle scene appears, making you fight through to continue your walk through the overworld.Music: Zelda II's soundtrack is a vast improvement over the original Legend of Zelda. It rocks, my friend. It's geared for action and slicing down thousands of the late Ganon's minions. You've your got standard \"Oh, we're in a town!\" music, but main draws are the dungeon, Great Palace, and battle-scene themes. Also, the title theme is pretty nice, and the overworld theme is a nice remix of the classic Zelda theme.Difficulty: It's quite a commitment to finish this game. It starts off with an average difficulty, and then it quickly goes from hard to unbelievably hard. So many of the enemies deal incredible amounts of damage, and many will hit you multiple times if you're not careful. Good reflexes coupled with the good sense to level up are requirements. You only have three lives, and a game over starts you back at the beginning of the map.And if you're playing this game on original hardware, there are multiple things which bring it from hard to nigh unbeatable: The NES games with internal batteries are terrible about abruptly erasing their data if you don't hold down the reset button... or you hold it the wrong way. This is even more true if your NES' pin connector is dying, which causes the system to repeatedly reset and triggers something in game's battery. Find a top-loader NES if you want to play it on original hardware. Otherwise, you might do well to just buy one of the game's several ports.At the time of this writing, modern Zelda games in the style of the original are routinely criticized as being the same game over and over again. One can only wonder what kind of reception a follow-up to the completely unique side-scrolling Zelda II might get. I'd play that, and if you like an enjoyable yet frustrating challenge, you should play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest.

Things are explained but not in depth. Short little cutscenes here and there to keep the story going. I'm sure the hidden documents collected throughout provide some additional information but I never bothered to stop and read those.The graphics aren't all that great especially from looking at all the pretty pictures and trailers all over the Internet prior to release. Things looked so clean and clear in those but during gameplay not always the case. Also I didn't see a bright/dark setting within the game options, because the game is dark in several areas/levels. I was a bit disappointed the graphics weren't always high quality (muddy and blurry low res textures), but it is still a very enjoyable and entertaining game. Time just passed by when playing. I was quite immerse in the experience. Awesome 10-12 hours campaign.Multi-player is also very enjoyable and much easier to get into unlike CoD4 where you start with nothing but the lamest, weakest and slowest guns requiring you to grind for levels just to unlock a decent primary gun. which leads to the point of where is the fun in that. Can't take anyone down, can't earn XP which R2 is the opposite. Earn XP regardless by connecting shots. Making some progess regardless if you ever get an assist or kill. I was able to stay competitive even though I wasn't familiar with the maps because majority of the guns are available from start. Pick the gun for your play style and shoot away. It was hard to find ranked matches but situation has slightly improved, somewhat over the past few days. A lot of custom maps, but rank matches are so few. I really think Insomniac needs to lock the custom map feature until after level 10 or so. This will force people to play ranked matches which from my observation is not much different from custom maps other than actually gaining some real XP towards unlocking things. I think the match making system is awful as well. From what I have observed people can't join into ranked matches once it has started which is quite lame. I recall CoD4 allowed this. Awful idea, especially for the team that has fewer people which always seemed to be the team I was on (Blue). Yesterdays typical match ups were 4v5, 3v5, 8v10, one time it was 10v1 because Red team players all dropped but one guy who I must give credit to for continuing the battle solo even though it was hopeless. Outside of typical 10 player max Death Match the team base matches weren't ever full. This is one flaw I think must be addressed.Also the four-player split screen isn't present anymore, which makes no sense what so ever. I wasn't too fond of R:FoM's split screen but the changes in R2 would have made split screen more enjoyable. I can't compete against my brothers and nephew anymore as they don't own a PS3 which is quite lame. Makes owning 4 PS3 controllers pointless which doesn't help Sony at all. I guess CoD4 will remain my primary split screen MP FPS game.If you enjoy FPS in general this game is a must own. I bought this and LBP at the same time and both have been entertaining and well worth the money spent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Unrivaled Pacing and Astounding Design Skyrockets Resistance 3 to Unrecognizable Heights - A Single Player Campaign Review","reviewText":"- A Single Player Campaign Review using Dualshock 3.  Does Not Cover Move Controls or Multiplayer.Although borrowing elements from both its predecessors, the machinations of Resistance 3 storm through the failings of former titles.  It is not an understatement to say that from the ashes of Resistance 2, this 3rd installment rises like a phoenix.  Resistance 3 not only succeeds in recreating the mythos of an apocalyptic alien-infested 1950s America, but in crafting the most enjoyable FPS campaign experience I have had to date.I own an extensive collection of shooters for the PS3 (Call of Duty entries, Call of Juarez, Battlefield 1 & 2, Bioshock 1 & 2, Singularity, Killzone 2 & 3, Crysis 2, Orange Box, FEAR 1 & 2, Resistance 1 & 2) and the Resistance series has always felt like it came up a little short.  Resistance 1 had an interesting premise and a neat selection of weaponry, but the characters and storyline felt dry and gameplay was very by-the-numbers.  Resistance 2 integrated boss fights, but removed the weapon wheel while adding the overused regenerating health feature.  Levels for Resistance 2 became more constricted, and several enemy choices were poorly designed (i.e. swarm, invisible chimera).  Every sequence or boss was foreshadowed by weapon placement, and was neither difficult nor exciting.  Insomniac decided to take an extra year in development to integrate feedback from the community, and it was a WISE decision.  Resistance 3 was not a game I had planned on purchasing, but is now my favorite FPS of all time.From Resistance 1: ARSENAL, HEALTH BARResistance 3 features a clock like weapon wheel wherein each number possesses a masterfully crafted weapon (12 total).  All of the older weapons have been retuned or redesigned and new favorites like the Atomizer, Cryogun or Mutator offer an astounding diversity of gameplay options.  Sound effects for old favorites like the Marksman are PHENOMENAL and visceral.  Secondary fire modes feature extremely useful abilities (i.e. Atomizer's black hole grenades) and all guns are leveled up as they are used to acquire more enticing attributes.  Shotguns gain incendiary fire and Bullseye bullets shatter on impact.  The best part about the arsenal in Resistance 3 is that all upgrades apply to NORMAL fire.  You do not have to find different ammo types, or select between modes.  Your arsenal only gets more efficient and deadly as you progress.Ammo is relatively plentiful, and I often found myself smiling while deciding which weapon I wanted to use at any given moment. Enemies also feature new weaknesses to exploit with accurate shots.  Shooting a hybrid in the cooling tank will cause it to short circuit and explode.  Blasting limbs can also dismember non-boss chimera.  Coupled with unprecedented level design, the finely tuned elaborate weaponry of Resistance 3 keeps every shootout fresh and riveting.  This is the FIRST FPS I have played where I hold every single weapon in the same high regard.  Even the Bullseye (which I loathed in 1 & 2) is now an absolute riot to use.The non-regenerating health bar makes its return to great effect in Resistance 3.  Shootouts become more intense as you scramble across the field or dash into a shed to find a health booster.  Insomniac has found a way to delicately balance your life bar, the amount of health pickups dropped or scattered, and the number or difficulty of enemies.  MAN is it refreshing!  The sound effects are spot-on and even the color spectrum makes things easily visible during chaotic firefights.From Resistance 2: LOCATION DIVERSITY, BOSS FIGHTSResistance 3 takes place in America once again.  The difference is that every location is unique and multilayered featuring incredible backgrounds and open battlefields.  One level pays homage to Chronicles of Riddick (the pit below the prison), but accentuates the atmosphere while maximizing the ability to utilize environment to your advantage.  Battling a gorilla-like Brawler in a ghost town as winds bend trees backwards and debris swirls around your head captivated me like no game since Killzone 2.  From stampeding Widowmakers on a train to foggy mountainous sniper missions, Resistance 3 portrays America on a whole new level than Resistance 2.  The story moves between a multitude of different states, but each features its own agenda, history and design. NOTHING is cookie cutter in this game.Boss fights are equally impressive, as are the moments leading up to them.  Resistance 3 doesn't simply throw a boss out into the mix.  Rather, it features elaborately crafted moments that lead up to them.  Even old enemies like the Widowmakers have been redesigned for epic firefights.  These prodigious behemoths now feature target zones, and feel more like Dead Space than anything found in most FPS games.  Does a shootout with a tunneling monstrosity named Satan on a runaway mine cart sound EPIC?  Well, I assure you...it is nothing short of breathtaking.New to Resistance:  LEVEL DESIGN, SET-PIECE SEQUENCES, STORYResistance 3 radiates entropic atmosphere.  Music, color-palettes, enemy design, setting and lighting constantly fire on all cylinders.  Beyond every claustrophobic tunnel lies a vast network of areas to traverse. Choice on the battlefield was clearly a major conscious decision by developers.  Snipe from a window, zip-line to a Steelhead and trample him with a shotgun, jump beyond a pile of rubble and deploy an auger shield as you take out a troop of hybrids.  From high to low, East to West - Resistance 3's levels give you the tools to unleash vengeance from every weapon you own.  More shockingly is that I NEVER ran into one of those invisible walls so prominent in other games.  Each and every level was crafted with the same amount of energy and thought.  This is only complemented further by the OUTSTANDING sense of pace within the storyline and gameplay.Joseph Capelli is a much stronger character than Nathan Hale.  He wears the desperation of humanity's bleak existence and the pride of a rebel's defiance through his visage and voice.  He fights for a stronger cause than Nathan (the survival of his family), against more overwhelming odds, in more desolate times.  The story does a fantastic job of providing continuity between different states by using CGI sequences.  Each level carries directly into a CGI movie that returns you to the environment exactly where it leaves off.  I was very impressed with how well the development team was able to lead the player from PA coal mines to a level 1 prison to the icy tundras of former NY.  High-intensity shootouts are juxtaposed with slower moments of exploration dripping with ambiance.  A slow boat ride through a flooded city is erupted by the bird-like screams of a long-legs Chimera.  A reprieve at an underground rebel shelter ushers heightened levels of relief after a chaotic chase amongst a crumbling city to secure an explosive battery.Enemies are unique and representative of their environment, actors are well voiced, and sound effects are impeccable.  FINALLY we have a sound mixer who can mix everything to appropriate volumes at default levels. I had no issues hearing music, voices, enemy death-growls or weapon effects layered one upon the other.  Enemies are divided into 3 main categories: Regular Chimera, Feral Chimera, and Marauder-like Humans.  Journal entries provide insight into each main category of enemies, as well as behavioral differences and weaknesses of the individual enemy types contained therein.  A handful of survivor audio logs (similar to Bioshock or Singularity) lie scattered about various levels, and notes provide detailed schematics of weapons as well as explanations of primary and secondary fire. Diary entries are on-par with the illustrations of Uncharted 2.  Each and every one is beautifully penned with layers of hand-scribed notes!  I was extremely impressed with the fact that everything in this game can be read.  Chalk writing, spray paint, handwritten letters -  everything looks natural and can be read without accessing the overlaying text font.I must disclose that not EVERYHING is perfect in Resistance 3.  NPC human models have an odd glow to them, and do not look cutting edge.  Other graphical oddities (non-background) such as the cross-eyed dog in the first base also present themselves from time to time.  The graphics and animations for any humans actually look a LOT like Singularity rather than AAA titles like Killzone 3.  Animations can be stiff (especially ladder climbing), and faces have a glossed texture.  It feels slightly jarring at times considering enemies and backgrounds often look stunning.  In fact, the only time I was ever disappointed with the scenery and enemy placement was during the final level.  Resistance 3 pays homage to both Resistance 1 and 2 by returning to a futuristic setting within a Chimeran base.  Although it works within the context of the narrative, I was really hoping the last level would exhibit the pinnacle of American architecture in decay.  With so many imaginative set-piece sequences throughout the 10 hour journey, I also lusted for one last epic showdown against a unique Chimeran Hellhound.  The finale does break up the action well, but feels slightly diminished compared to earlier events.I also ran into a few odd glitches during the game.  I once \"fell\" (clipped) into the roof of a decrepit house while being chased by grims, but the \"attic\" was clearly not part of the playing field.  I eventually jumped and ran against the far corner of the building until I popped back on top of the roof.  Another time I lifted a wooden beam so that a NPC could proceed through a cave.  My character went through, but the NPC was running against a rock.  Re-lifting the beam and trying to push him away from the rock would not trigger him to pass through the area.  I eventually just let an enemy kill me and had him follow more closely.  Fortunately check points are very plentiful here.Despite those few slight grievances, Resistance 3 is absolutely AMAZING to play. The Arsenal is Fantastic, the Levels are Expansive and Varied, the Enemies are Intelligent and Aggressive, and the Narrative is Unpredicatable. Resistance 3 is a tightly woven mix of atmosphere, gameplay and story - and IT IS SPECTACULAR!  (9.2/10)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

This, though, is on a whole other level. Skyrim has a good combat system, the main storyline is interesting, and the characters are intriguing. The graphics are good-not-great, and there are bugs throughout.But the beauty of this game doesn't come from any of that. The beauty is that this, more than any other game, feels like a complete and believable world full of things to explore and do. You can start up the game, pick a direction, and aimlessly wander and you will find something captivating to do. You might stumble across a group of giants, herding their mammoths, and have to sneak around them. You might stumble across a town just in time to see a dragon swoop down and start shooting flames at the townsfolk, who desperately need your help. You might get in a drinking contest in a tavern, blackout, and have to retrace your steps. You can just sit in the house and read one of the hundreds of books you found on your adventure and learn more about Skyrim's people, politics and religions. You might read a book that mentions a warrior's long lost magical battleaxe, and then set off to find this treasure. You could join a thieves guild, become a werewolf, buy the perfect horse, get married, or rob people blind.Basically, lots of hours of your real life are going to disappear as you enjoy your new life as the Dragonborn, savior of Skyrim.If you like RPG's, get this.

{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A phenomenal FPS that does pretty much everything right","reviewText":"Far Cry 3 is one of those special games that doesn't come around very often. It combines many ingredients from other games together into a delicious dish that should satisfy pretty much any gamer out there.Far Cry 3's gameworld is the major highlight, as it's one of the most fully realized, dynamic game worlds to ever be created. You are not only contending with your enemies, but with nature itself. The secrets tucked around every corner challenge you to try to explore every inch of the game's island, yet you can never underestimate your environments, as there are predatory creatures and environmental hazards everywhere that always keep you on your toes.  Conflict is the name of the game here - man vs. nature, man vs. man, nature vs. nature, and man vs. himself. It all plays out around you, sometimes by your own hand, and sometimes by complete coincidence.The game plays extremely well. The shooting feels great, and the stealth mechanic works fantastic as well. You'll find yourself in some nerve-wracking yet enjoyable platforming challenges, piloting distinct, well-handling vehicles, and even heading underwater for a dive. The swimming/diving controls in Far Cry 3 deserve a special mention - Far Cry 3 handles water navigation better than any other 3D game I've ever played. In most games, when you approach a body of water, it is usually accompanied by a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, as you know that awkward and usually clumsy controls are soon to follow. Not so here. Water controls feel just as natural as on-land controls, and that is really saying something.Aside from shooting and swimming, you also participate in meaningful hunting and gathering. I use the word \"meaningful\" because so many other games that have used hunting and gathering have never managed to make it feel like such a core part of the experience. Usually it's done to accomplish some kind of challenge/achievement, or to give you some sort of secondary item. Hunting and gathering in Far Cry 3 is not only necessary, but extremely fulfilling.Also scattered throughout the world are dozens of side quests, hidden artifacts that when searching for them often give the game a feeling similar to the Uncharted series, and lots and lots secrets to uncover. This is a game that causes the gamer to be easily distracted from the main mission, and being distracted ends up being incredibly rewarding. The main story is very decent, and although it leaves quite a few things unexplained, it delivers a narrative you won't soon forget. Some of the best characters to appear in a game this generation appear in Far Cry 3, with the villainous, insane pirate Vaas easily taking the cake. Character models vividly capture emotional facial expressions, and the voice acting is top notch all around.Far Cry 3 is a winner. Easily one of 2012's top games, it's a game that will keep you busy for a long time, and will leave you with your own stories to tell - stories that are most likely to be different from anyone else's, thanks to the wonderful, dynamic game world that you inhabit for the 25-30 hours that completing this game should take you. If you like good shooters, big, open game worlds with secrets and thrills everywhere, and engrossing narrative, don't miss this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

After going through the story mode and completing the game with a couple characters I can honestly say that this is still a great series and my first impressions were presumptuous. The fighting is great; it really feels like they took the best of the old stuff and revitalized it correctly. It was the story that had me shaking my head at first but the story was always meant to be kinda silly I think. In this game they gave it a more serious tone and that was actually my initial gripe. It still manages to have that dark humor put in there but it just seemed like the Armageddon installment was loaded with it and this one....well it's got some. It would probably be a four star but I just had to give it a five because they included the option for 3D which I hope at some point it time becomes standard.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2013"}

Three other players are with the team, and they can be controlled by the computer or by others for co-op play, which is fun if you want to get a real feel for the campaign while enjoying the game with your friends.The weapons have weight to them and feel powerful. Shooting from behind cover, one of the hallmarks of the franchise, is required as enemies appear from nearly every angle. You'll want to keep your head down.Teamwork is key. Not only will a mate come to your rescue when you are down, they can also set up opportunities to flank your opponents and end battles quicker. It all flows naturally (much like the copious amounts of blood spilled in the battles) and is well-paced, with plenty of ammo and weapons to be scavenged and used.The game helps new players along with a casual mode that highlights enemies and objectives for easier play. There is an \"aim-assist\" mode that will line up enemies if you have trouble getting those pesky Locusts in your crosshairs.MULTIPLAYERSix modes of multiplayer action offer all kinds of mission objectives beyond just killing the other team. Whether it's capturing and holding an enemy leader (while defending your own) or playing as one of the monsters against human opponents, variety will keep players entertained.Dedicated servers around the world, which will host the multiplayer games, also will be available, fulfilling a common player desire from previous \"Gears of War\" games. Developers said this should eliminate the perception that players hosting multiplayer matches had an advantage over other players.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2011"}

The game is already great but going in with 3D brought me into the world of gears...the depth, the clarity was mind blowing.  I spent a good 40 mintues just walking around in the game just see the textures and the way the ground had depth and feel and the characters looked at a distance, the airships really looked like they were flying, the bullet impacts had depth to them and could see them impacting the ground as I walked them into the enemy.  Grenades looked like they were really flying...you get the picture...if you have the setup by all means give it a shot...if your on the fence about buying a 3D starter pack for your TV, GOW 3 IS THE REASON TO DO IT...simply AMAZING...and to think this was not a dedicated 3D game, but EPIC did an oustanding job....I have played all three gears over the years and so far this one is the best imo.  I was kinda worried at first as it started very slow kinda dragging it out but I guess that was to get the newbies going with the controls and feel.  However, by Chapter I Act III it started heating up and has not let up since.  I really enjoy the movie episodes it really brings the campaign together.  The amount of detail is amazing and all the medals and ribbons one can earn is great.  I really enjoy the Horde game, but my son is into the Beast and all are very fun, and the bosses are crazy tough.  Many have wrote very detailed reviews on this game, all im going to say is if your on the fence or have never tried Gears Of War then jump in you will not be dissapointed.  Although you can start with GOW3 to completely emerse yourself in the gears world you should pick up GOW 1 and 2 and when you get to 3 you will feel a part of the COG and then see how much effort was put into 3 to make it the best of all three!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"Another Great PS2 classic BUT not as good as Going Commando","reviewText":"Ratchet and Clank UYA brings the return of Sonys Platform mascots and this time they're badder then ever!

But to save them, you would also have the physical act of killing a small child on your conscience. And without Hitler, someone else would have risen up, maybe not as bad, maybe somehow worse, but there's no real guarantee.It shouldn't really be a tough question to answer. One life vs tens of millions. At that ratio, I'd wager that Hitler himself would think it was a worthy tradeoff.So Bioshock is back in the year 2013. The first game was pretty groundbreaking for its combination of state of the art graphics and a strong narrative with high-minded concepts backing it up. Bioshock Infinity continues that, although for the time I don't find the graphics as impressive as the original Bioshock. The graphics are improved, but not five-years improved, and several of the faces are actually pretty lackluster compared to even older games like Half Life 2.It does feel better thought-out though. The story is unfolded in a superior manner, map layouts are better, gameplay is more fun. The guns have a louder bang to them than most any game out there, feeling like wild gun-powder based weapons and not squirt guns like many games. You can also shoot \"magic\" at any time. Some of the abilities are akin to a grenade throw. Others clearly show the influence of Mass Effect, especially Bioshock's version of the biotic charge. Me being a fan of the Vanguard class, this is a big plus.New is the addition of a speed rail system that you can slide on while in combat, moving you quickly around the map. You can also summon more powerful objects, like combat robots, turrets, and health. however, only two can be active at a time, and you have to focus for a few seconds in summoning them.The new additions make for very fast-paced combat, with lots of movement, lots of strategic decisions. It is the best FPS combat system I've ever played.The maps, however, seem a little cramped. I blame this on the aging memory limitations of the PS3 and Xbox 360. Thus, the backdrops are simple...background, and they aren't something you can really reach. in contrast, a game like World of Warcraft, one of the wonders is that if you see something in the horizon, you can probably reach and touch it.The story I found to be engaging, though at first it is pretty ham-fisted. the great sin of America is slavery, and yet why is it perpetuated in a city in the sky filled with marvelous technology? Younger players might find it a lot more mind-blowing than I.So yeah, it's a good game worth playing. The only wish I really have is that they had developed for the next gen PS4 platform, which could do a city in the sky better justice.Last note: PCGamer advocates playing the game on hard.Don't. Hard is too hard. You will die a lot, preventing you from buying upgrades. It's frustrating, takes away lots of the fun. Play on medium.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

I was looking for a great game at a great prize. So because of the prize and great reviews from amazon and magazines, I decided to buy this game.After played this game several hours I decided to publish a review. Just awesome! this is more than I expected, I'm having great fun with this. This game remains me my childhood (batman animated series) I can't play it too much time but when I'm in it, no way to sent me off from my sit. Batman feels great, a great thing about this game is the feeling that you get that you inspire fear and it's feels like you are invincible. All characters, features, moves etc are great, the grafics disapointed me a little, doesn't matter, great purchase to my collection.Now I'm just waiting until Batman Arkham City get sheapper to take it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Baseball \"Johnny\"","summary":"Best Game For PlayStation 2","reviewText":"This is my favorite game for the PlayStation 2. Rockstar has really improved this game from GTA: Vice City. I really like this game because now it's rated M for good reasons. They actually sware a lot now. You can't go a second with someone not dropping the \"s\" word or the \"f\" bomb. It's really cool that you can ride on bikes too. You can do all kinds of tricks like bunnyhops. The missions are pretty hard and it took me sometime to beat some of them. I really like the characters in the game too. I think that they were designed well. Even in your house you can play video games. There is a video game console in front of the TV so Carl Johnson is playing a game while you are playing him. It's really cool and even more violent. Lots of parents are banning this game for their children because it's extremely violent, has sex, and profanity. I wouldn't buy this game for my children until they turn 15 or 16 years old. But some good aspects of this game and other \"true-life\" games is that it shows your son or daughter what the world is really like. People do shoot and kill people all the time and if you hold off from your son or daughter from seeing that they will have a hard time when they become older. This game is no doubt the best PS2 game and I would buy it right away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Nearly Perfect","reviewText":"While previous Grand Theft titles flirted with greatness, this one finally crosses the threshold. Everything that succeeds in the previous games (a large cast, realistic gameplay, engaging missions) has been expanded on here, with the addition of extra goodies: a much larger world, more side missions, more plot twists, a character that can be customized, cars that can be modded as well as stolen, a larger, more diverse soundtrack, cool cheat codes, and a heck of a lot more. In the older titles, if you weren't playing through a mission, you didn't have a lot of other options: maybe compete in a race, or steal a wanted car, or complete a rampage, or find a hidden \"package.\" And in any case, you somehow felt outside of the world while you were doing these things, or just passing the time until you felt like trying a \"real mission.\" But here there are plenty of fun things to do between missions: play pool, basketball, date, gamble, take over rival gang territory, even work out at the local gym to mod your character's body. It feels more like a real world than any of the other GTA titles. You can even burglarize homes for a little extra cash, for God's sake.This game also perfects the system of opening up the world in stages, rather than all at once, so that you always have something to look forward to, and each time you \"unlock\" a new area (by completing a certain main mission), it feels a lot like a whole new game is opening up. Before, in the Liberty City worlds, it was just frustrating not to be able to cross the bridge -- mostly because, once you finally got there? Not much different from the other side. But in San Andreas, you really feel like a new part of the story is unfolding.The screenplay is undoubtedly Rockstar's best ever. A somewhat-reformed gangbanger named CJ returns home after a long prison stint only to confront crooked cops (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson, or all people, and the late Chris Penn, among others), rival gangs, and the spreading influence of drugs in his old neighborhood. It's up to him, and you, to turn things around. Lots of social commentary and tongue-in-cheek humor, and plenty of links to the Rodney King/LA Riots situations. In other words, instead of Goodfellas, think modern-day, inner-city, African American gangsters. And plenty of Latinos with power and pride, as well.The final mission is thrilling, a true treasure to play. I was sorry to finish it, but it had to be finished. Without spoiling the surprise, just think plenty of gunfire, explosions, car chases, and good old fashioned street justice.Other missions are just as notable: you can help CJ steal a \"Rocketman\"-like jet pack from the military, rob a casino, or assassinate a major hip-hop mogul, among other things.The combat system is also much improved. Aim and fire almost effortlessly. Find yourself outgunned? No problem -- in this one, you can call friends to your aid to assist in the fight.GTA 4 disappoints in many respects -- you can't mod your character as much, there are no skill levels, no bicycles, and the story returns to Liberty City, which we have already seen too much of. Enough, Rockstar! Do a new city! Even a foreign city! Or if you want to return to a city, return to Vice City.But San Andreas has nearly everything in its place -- it's really hard to think of how this game could be any better. The soundtrack, for example? Just plain awesome, from top to bottom.But there are a couple issues: 1. the modding of cars, while tantalizing, is mostly pointless. You need a good modded car to compete in the races -- but then again, do you really? Can't you just as easily steal a fast car? You can. And frequently you will find that when you leave your modded car in your garage, you return to discover some of the changes (particularly paint jobs) have been inexplicably discarded. 2. It's not fun to have to stop whatever you're doing because CJ's starving, getting thinner and thinner (and so weaker and weaker). The cheats help, but still. It doesn't have to be that realistic; it doesn't have to remind us of the old rpg games, for example, where if you didn't carry adequate food on your person, your party would starve to death. CJ should be able to eat, but he shouldn't HAVE to eat, just like he shouldn't have to go to the bathroom. Realism should only be taken so far. 3. CJ needs to have backup that stays with him if he wants, and lots of it. But these partners get shaken off too easily. The Saints Row series has set a good example: they should stick to him until he dismisses them, or they die. 4. Vice City Stories had it right: we want to be able to take over all businesses, buy out everybody if we have the cash, not just select places. With associated perks. 5. Let's not have, in future games, a plot twist that equates to the whole territory you spent hours earning in the beginning stages of the games being taken away from you, with you not able to do a thing about it, other than start over.Bottom line? This game, obviously, is not as graphically advanced as PS3's GTA 4 (or its add-on titles). But guess what? It's a lot, lot more fun to play. Destined to be a huge bestseller once they release it on the Playstation Network.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HIMI","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"NBA 2K12 Review","reviewText":"It is yet another season for basketball, and for fans out there this game went from a simulation of the real thing to a simulation of a fantasy. With the NBA lock out still going at the time of this review this game, in my mind, should be noted as strictly a fantasy. The selling point of this game was the different covers that could be found for it. You have Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and my favorite, Larry Bird. The unfortunate thing is that this is truly the highlight of the game.Graphically this game isn't going to blow many away. I don't feel like they tried to push the graphics to what they could have been on the PlayStation 3. The other thing is that they did very strange things to NBA players' likenesses. Kevin Durant appears to be just entering the nursing home, and for another example Jason Collins, from the Atlanta Hawks, who in real life is always smiling, appears to have a permanent attitude problem. They have put a focus box around the court, so when they take shots of fans on the first row they look fine until the sit back in their chairs and then all of a sudden they are completely blurry.The sounds of the game are going to grate on your nerves. The music selection is ok, though there are some fans out there that are going to find muting the TV during all the menus is the only course of action. There also seems to be a very limited amount of voices when it comes to the building your own player mode.The controls are an issue. They don't feel right at all, there's no way that there should be so many shot fake buttons in the default setup. There's also the issue of the passing, it doesn't feel right. Finally the shooting mechanics with trying to time your release feels off.This game has issues, and maybe just like the actual NBA, this game should have taken a season off. The graphics were sub-par to what I expect from a sports game, there were serious glitches in the load screens. There were too many load screens for a sports game. The menu layout didn't feel right. The quick game should ALWAYS have your favorite selected team as one of the opponents, and when it is, it should be the home team. To actually start playing the game you have to fill out this lengthy informational piece so that you can play online. Well I hate to break it to 2K Sports but not everyone is dying to play online, so that screen should have been optional, or introduced when someone actually tries to play online. The biggest thing that ticked me off though was the fact that when you get to create your own player. The camera angles felt wrong, the gameplay made it feel like a recreational league, not a game of All-Star talent, and if you're going to allow for selection of college schools that your player comes from, have all the school names recorded. Winthrop University is NOT nor will it ever be South Carolina. Yes, they are in the state of South Carolina, but that's just some lazy moves on 2K's part.If you're looking for a game that you can display with a picture of one of the greats, get this game, and seal it in a box. If you want to play a professional basketball game, go find another game. I am really disappointed in the lack of awesomeness in this game, this is more mediocre then anything else, and I'm usually the one who will readily jump on the 2K band wagon. This game gets a 4.3 out of 10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000GE7O9K","description":"Oblivion is the most richly detailed and vibrant game-world ever created. This new chapter uses next-generation technologies to create a fully immersive gaming adventure.","reviewerName":"barbre","summary":"Not the typical xbox splatterfest","reviewText":"I've only had my xbox360 for a few months now, but I'm already a little discouraged when I read game reviews in magazines that determine if a game is good or not by how much blood and gore there is.  I'm also a little disappointed in the available titles for kids.What does that have to do with Oblivion?  I must set my focus so you know where I'm coming from.  I'm middle aged and grew up with paper/pencil RPGs.  I like games that have a lot to them, and I'd like my kids to have some fun games to play.Oblivion is a RPG.  Plain and simple.Some reviews claim it is too complex...well, compared to some xbox titles i've seen that is true.  Compared to your typical PC RPG it is right on par.Some say it is big and boring.  It is big, that is for sure.  They crammed a lot into this game.  Boring?  Not for me.  I found myself being lulled into a bit of boredom, and then *whack* something would happen to bring the game back into focus.Some say the NPCs \"suck\".  Yeah, I concede that.  This is a typical Morrowind game where the NPCs have some little story and you get to choose one of several responses.  It doesn't really matter which ones you choose because you will want to choose them all to make sure you didn't miss something.  I found myself not even reading or listening to their talk...I just clicked through it to see if a quest appeared.Terrain is something that is both impressive and a little silly.  I loved the way the terrain looked, the contours, and elevations.  Many times I'd get to the top of a mountain and just watch the view for a while.  On the other hand, there are plants all over and I found myself thinking that they took all the plants out of a landscaping software package and through them in.The one aspect of the game that was most annoying deals with theft.  If you steal something you end up with a bounty on you almost instantly and regardless where you go the whole world knows you are a crook.  I stole a horse and rode it across the map and then ditched it.  Went to a city and was immediately attacked by the guards.  Worse, when you go to click on someone to talk to them if you aren't positioned right you might steal something instead of talk...and it is off to jail with you!Even with the problems (which included locking up my system a couple of times) this game is big, it is an RPG, and it is cheap.  Given the current titles on the xbox360, this is a winning combination for anyone who loves games that spent more time on the game and less on blood and guts graphics.Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Psychic Cypher","summary":"Best Game I've Ever Played!","reviewText":"Sorry in advance for a long review, but every once in a while something comes along that is well worth the extra words, and this is one such item.This game is, simply put, a masterpiece.I'm an avid gamer. I play a lot of games...a lot. I try to play a wide variety of games: different genres, different systems, some casual, some \"hardcore\", and most in-between. Gaming is my favorite way to relax. All that being said, this is--by far--my favorite game of all time. Truly.Let me start by saying that I had never played any of the Metal Gear Solid games previously. I barely knew anything about them. When I first got a PS3, and saw how many excellent reviews MGS4 got, I decided to give it a shot.Boy, am I glad I did.For the next month or so, every spare moment I had (which, at the time, came in fits and starts) was spent engrossed in this incredible world. The amazing thing about this game is that it does everything well. There are no weak aspects of the game. How many games can say that? Not many.Some games have great graphics, some have a great story, some have a cool environment/world, some have great characters, some have great action, great shooting, great exploring, etc. Some have great hidden items to find, great secrets or unlockables; some have great cut-scenes, animations, and so forth. But rarely does a game do all of these things well. Most often, games only do one or two of these things well.This game does everything well.Gameplay - Although every aspect of this game is phenomenal, the gameplay is where it really shines. What's incredible is that you can approach every situation however you choose. You can sneak stealthily; you can go in with guns blazing and take out everyone; you can blast through groups of enemies, or take them out one by one.There are multiple paths to each destination; you can take direct routes, use roundabout approaches, or find secret passages that are scattered throughout the game. The missions are varied, as is the gameplay itself.There are many different weapons, most of which can be upgraded in various ways. The enemies are varied...I love the mix of human soldiers, robots, and \"hybrids\", all of which are truly remarkable and believable (rather than being poorly done or cheesy, as is so often the case). The bosses are of particular note, as they are quite varied (and some are notably tough), and each has their own identity and means of attacking. Awesome.Plot/Story - I came into this game not knowing anything about the Metal Gear Solid universe, characters, or plotlines. I've heard a lot of people say that they found this story to be confusing. I didn't think it was confusing in itself, though I did feel that I would have benefited from having played the earlier games in the series.The game does include an encyclopedia (of sorts) that outlines much of the earlier stories, but who wants to read through all of that tedium? Not me. I just experienced the game on its own, and it's a very good story.This isn't fluffy, shallow stuff either; it deals with themes of freedom vs. slavery (a different kind, but slavery just the same), family relationships, the nature of love, good vs. evil...even dealing with getting old (the idea of playing as an old man didn't appeal to me at all beforehand, but he turned out to be one of the most memorable and remarkable characters I can remember in a game). Great stuff.Much ado has been made about the lengthy cut-scenes. Some people hate them. And yes, there are a number of them that are quite long (longer than in any other game I've ever played, I think). It didn't bother me at all...for me, it was all part of the larger experience.If you're an ADD gamer and just want action, action, action, then this game may not be for you. But if you see gaming as an art form and want to experience the full beauty of this game, then don't fight the cut-scenes. Accept that they are part of the whole masterpiece, and experience the game as one incredible piece of art. Just be prepared to sit through some pretty long scenes. You might be tempted to skip through them (and, for the most part, you can), but you'll miss out on a lot of the story, and the experience...plus there are a number of cool hidden things you can do during the cut-scenes. Very cool.Graphics - This is still one of the best looking games on any console, ever. It really showcases the power of the PS3. Environments are rich and deep. The small details are what make the world really live: smoke effects, dust particles floating around, light shafts breaking through the sky. Just amazing.The characters look fantastic. They look very realistic without that \"creepy\" thing going on that so many games have. When most games attempt realistic-looking faces, they just end up looking weird and slightly \"off\". Not so here. The character animations aren't perfect, but they're among the best I've yet seen...even with some of the very recent developments in this area, a few years after this game's release.The environments are varied and lush...from dry dusty deserts to snowy mountains, lush jungles, and urban sprawl. Really well done.Sound - The sound is excellent. Music that builds suspense, weapon effects that really make you feel like you're using them, and great voice acting. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack, necessarily, but the music is just about perfect for this game, and I did download all of the extra and unlockable tracks that I could. There are even podcasts that you can listen to on your in-game iPod while moving through the game. So cool.Bang For Your Buck - This is a long game, and that is by no means a bad thing. Some games you just think, \"I wish this would end already.\" Other games, you feel ripped off because they're so short. Then there are games that either feel like they are the perfect length, or you feel like you could continue playing for a long time after but are by no means upset that the game is over because the length and the whole experience were so satisfying. This is one of the latter types of games.Even more rare for me is to have the desire to replay a game. Some games I don't even finish the first time, and I can count on one hand the number of games I've played completely through more than once. I just started on my fourth time through this game. While I've started a second play-through on a few games, it's very rare for me to finish on the second go-round. I also have a lot of other games in my \"queue\" that I'm waiting to get through, yet I still come back to play this one frequently. That says a lot.Yes, there are a lot of lengthy cut-scenes, but even if you skip through them, the game is quite long. This is a meaty, engrossing game, and well worth the investment. You won't want it to end!Fun Factor - Simply put, this is the most fun I've ever had with a game. I'm not real big on the \"stealth\" kinds of games, which I usually find incredibly boring...skulking around and trying to sneak past enemies quietly instead of blowing them up or shooting them in the face...and this series is known for being all about stealth.But because you can play it any way you want, I had an absolute ball. Even the places where I chose to approach things using stealth instead of brute force, I actually had fun. I never felt forced into that approach, and I was never bored.There is just so much to do, so many ways to do it. I actually cared what happened to the characters, and the upgrades, unlocks, and all the secret/hidden stuff just add icing to the cake. An absolute blast.This is not a lighthearted, frivolous fun kind of game...this is an experience you want to savor and sink your teeth into.Gameplay - 10/10Plot/Story - 9.5/10Graphics - 10/10Sound - 9.5/10Bang For Your Buck - 10/10Fun Factor - 10/10Overall - 10/10 (not an average)Verdict: My absolute favorite game of all time.

Local & Online.","reviewText":"Even now, years after its release, this game is one of the most pleasing, fun racing games available. It's simplicity, yet well done design, can't be beat. It is probably the only racing game that is aimed at family fun more than at trophies. Having Nintendo's classic characters as drivers is something that gamers of all ages enjoy. I have been a gamer since the days of Atari, that's how old I am, well, not that old really, but it shows how Mario Kart acomplish what other games don't, it brings not only memories back, but it manages to make the racing experience a unique one that brings players of all ages together.The controls are tight and easy to learn. I recommend buying extra wheel, but I would stick to the official, original Nintendo brand, I tried with cheaper versions, but none compared. Learning to control the karts with the wheel is easy and in no time you'll be dropping banana peels and throwing shells at your oponents. Even my wife, who is not a gamer by any means, was able to pick this up and enjoy it, she even beat me and the kids a couple of times.Graphics are good, of course, it is the Wii, so don't expect Gran Turismo or Forza. Still, the tracks look good and the overall graphics are not only well made, but also fun too look at; with bits of different Nintendo licences put together, expect to race through jungles, pipes, etc. Plus, you get to be Mario and his friends. What more can you ask for? The numerous tracks keep this game from becoming stale and boring. Also, the ability to drop shells, banana peels, etc. make this a unique experience that guarantees every player will have a blast.Multiplayer, both locally and online are quite good, better than I had expected. In fact, playing online is A LOT faster than XBox Live or PSN, take it from a core gamer. I was actually surprised to see how the Wii was able to connect me with players from around the world (Japan, Spain, Canada, etc) and all WITHOUT lag, I mean, none whatsoever. The entire online experience was smooth and may I add, quite addicting, I played for hours, I simply could not stop, it is that much fun.All in all. Mario Kart is classic and will remain a classic for years to come. If you want a more relaxed, fun experience, play this game, and do it with family and friends, they will all enjoy it.I own all consoles, I love eye candy, graphics are always a plus for me, but I have to be honest, Mario Kart for the Wii exceeded my expectations, it looks a lot better than I thought and quite honestly, when I play Mario Kart, it does something that none of my other games do when I play...the kid in me comes out and it puts a smile on my face.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle.  The action is almost always intense.  However I do have a few complaints about the game.1: Character Diversity.  On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe (Donkey Kong, Yoshi, MArio) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter.  So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked (a royal pain in the ***) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.2: Story Mode: Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights, one on one, an army of characters, tag team, handicap, so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a (What you thought I was going to spoil the ending).So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2003"}

During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses.

Edwards!","summary":"Pretty fun but it's beating a dead horse at this point.","reviewText":"From the second I playedCastlevania: Symphony of the NightI knew that I strongly desired a sequel to the game.  I had really wanted something with top notch 2D work likeGuilty Gear Isuka for PlayStation 2and for it to be on a console but I suppose my hunger was sated by the various Gameboy titles.  I've had mixed feelings about the series since Symphony of the Night, some of the titles seem to get close to being as good and others totally missed the mark but the fact stands that none of the additions are on par with Symphony of the Night yet.  This game is no different.You play with two characters which you can use individually, simultaneously, and you can switch around on the fly.  This works rather well and adds some depth and strategy to your character set ups.  I found the girl to be kind of boring on her own though.  She only gets one weapon type and it's rather ineffective.  Her spells can be pretty cool but they aren't particularly great for dispatching enemies and remaining mobile.  The cool thing here though is that I didn't have to use her.  I could use the male character and simply spam the girl for spells when the mood struck me.  You can leave both characters out and the one you aren't controlling will attack automatically but if they get hit your magic bar is depleted much like your health would be.  The bad news here is that eventually the dual character system begins to strike you as very gimmicky.  I would much rather have had one character with all of those abilities rather than having to drag along a second character simply for the occasional puzzle.  It starts off as a cool idea but eventually just becomes annoying and you'll most likely stick with one as the game goes on.Both of the DS games have gone artistically downhill since Ayami Kojima (the character designer for many of the games) didn't work on them.  Maybe some kids got spooked by the slightly dark theme to the games and they had to brighten it up but everything seems a little softer to me.  The enemies aren't as demented.  The environments are more colorful.  The blood is toned down, long gone are the days of gushing zombie soldiers.  Maybe some people appreciate this but I think it sucks.  The ambiance of the series is something I always enjoyed and it's just not here anymore.The level design is alright, they kind of pulled an upside-down castle move by repeating previous levels only slightly different.  That is one of my only complaints with Symphony of the Night and it remains true here, flipping and barely altering a level is lazy.  If it wasn't for different enemies you would be bored to tears.  It's kind of neat that you go to some different corners of the world but I really don't feel that they belong in this game.  It's CASTLEvania, not TRAVELvania.The music is tinny, cliche, and certainly more upbeat than other Castlevania games.  It ultimately doesn't fit well for me.  The Symphony of the Night, and Curse of Darkness soundtrack are worth owning regardless of how good the games are.  I know the DS is capable of playing good music becuaseMeteosandNanostrayhave some jams in them, but the quality is pretty junky here.  I guess since you go to some different locations it probably makes sense but, again, it just doesn't feel right to be in a Castlevania game.The game presents plenty of the replay value that the newer titles are known for along with plenty to do in a single play through.  Things like this keep the game fun regardless of its shortcomings.The addition of Wifi is really nice but I have yet to really do a whole lot with it.  The game isn't hard enough to do co-op and you can get all the items yourself easy enough without having to buy them off of people.  Still it stands as a cool addition especially if they choose to develop it a bit more in the future.In summary, I think it's the bettter of the DS Castlevanias, but Aria Of Sorrow is still the best of the Gameboy entries.  Symphony of the Night is still king.  At the end of the day though I think this game is a little weak, fun, but nothing super special about it.  I think they need to focus on making one killer Castlevania game rather than churning out Symphony of the Night clones ever other year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Lots of Fun, but the Action Becomes Tired by the End","reviewText":"This was a good game, and there's a lot to like about it, but overall I just didn't love it. The graphics here are pretty amazing, especially if you remember the previous Max Payne games. The bullet time third person gun-play can be insanely fun, but I really don't think it's enough to sell the entire game. I love that every slow jump is controlled by you, leading to either hilarious failures or glorious successes when you kill everyone in your jump. However, the fact that there really aren't any ways to modify the bullet-time jumps, leads to them eventually being very repetitive and boring. I would love different jumps, like maybe a slide, or something else to add a different flavor to the combat. Also, this game relies a lot more on cover based shooting if you want to survive, but it is a little different from the normal Gears of War style. I must say that the AI is pretty intelligent. However it becomes annoying when they stay hidden and invulnerable behind cover for very long periods of time, yet you will be shot/killed many times when you're shooting from cover or even hiding behind it. My other biggest problem with the combat is that it feels a little wooden at times, and Max is like an old man getting up and moving around (when not in bullet-time). After a dive, you are completely screwed if any of your enemies are alive while you slowly come to your feet. Related to this, if you are \"killed\" when you have painkillers you will automatically enter bullet-time with a chance to kill the person who shot you. There are multiple problems here, where sometimes the enemy can't be shot where they are, but the biggest problem is that if you succeed no matter where you were before you wake up lying on the ground. With how long Max takes to get up combined with the fact that you cannot go right into cover, you have to stand up fully before you regain control, I usually took so much damage that I was right again in danger of dying. It was also incredibly annoying with how much damage the enemies can take, as over and over I would unload into them and turn to continue the fight and then be killed by the guys I thought I'd finished. Sometimes the characters would fall down and get back up, but most of the time they would just absorb multiple bursts from an assault rifle and not flinch.Now on to other parts of the game. The campaign is relatively long, but it is completely linear with no possible variation (and no reason to replay it) with multiple jumps along the timeline. It was kind of nice to have different versions of Max, but since they didn't control any differently they just made the story more convoluted. I think I would have liked to play the game missions in order, it wouldn't have improved the story itself at all, but I think it could have helped a little bit. The story is idiotic, there's a gigantic plot hole I won't spoil as it's supposed to be the big twist, but it really makes the whole set up of the story incomprehensible. I also wish Max wasn't such a bitchy whiner in this game, he's always bashing himself without realizing all of the bad ass things he'd done (I mean I killed thousands of paramilitary forces/gangsters/dirty police while flying through the air!). I think the biggest problem with the story is that there's no higher purpose for what you're aiming to do. There are parts where it's kind of a rescue the princess deal, but the princess isn't likeable and will always die anyway. Then there's a bit of revenge is best served cold storyline, but the villains are all interchangeable and the game never gave you a chance to like the people you're avenging. I just didn't care about the story other than wanting to kill everyone (which they prevented you from doing in the very end, even though the guy dies off camera in the epilogue).For the multiplayer, I tried it but personally I just didn't really like it. It just felt too wooden and the best parts of the single player game have to be mostly eliminated to play against/with others. Other people might find a lot of hours of fun here, but for me I played it for a night and was done with it.So overall, I enjoyed the game but by the end I was just left disappointed by what it offered. This isn't a bad game, but I don't think I would readily highly recommend it to anyone.Edit: I increased my rating to 4 stars because I did enjoy the game, and I haven't liked some of the other games I've played lately.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2012"}

First let me start with the things I didn't like. I didn't like only being able to carry 3 weapons at a time. In the other games you could carry as many as you wanted with plenty of ammo to mop up the bad guys. This game only let you carry 3 at a time and towards the end of the game like the last 4 chapters I found myself out of ammo just waiting to be slaughter by some num nuts who would randomly pop out of nowhere and blow my top off. I am a huge fan of the DE gun and I could never find any ammo for it no matter how hard I looked. Even though they had a chapter or two with him fighting against mobsters like the max payne we are use to I felt kinda annoyed that most of the gangsters he was fighting hardly spoke any English. What I mean by that is that I didn't know if they were yelling for one to flank me from the side or just saying a line about how they were going to kill or even cracking a joke. That I guess is my problem for not paying much attention to learning my spanish back in school lol.What I liked about this game was the fact you still kept the bullet time and even when you had no health you still had a chance to save yourself by killing the last guy who shot you. I found that the bad guys were plenty and I never felt a shortage in that area. I thought the new cast of characters were ok but were missing something that makes the max payne characters so interesting or even funny. I did find the story interesting and not knowing completely who I could trust or who was the villain until the final few chapters of the game. I enjoyed the combat being able to target and shot was easy and I loved the way the screen does a small flash when you kill someone to let you know you did. I do have to say one of my favorite parts was max having a flash back when he was in new york and was getting hassled by these goons that looked and sounded like the guys from that show \"jersey shore\" Of course you can guess how it turns out with them and I know I am wrong for saying this but I actually felt some satisfaction emptying a clip into those look alikes LOL. Anyway please don't take that the wrong way I was just joking about that =)All in all I didn't like the game at the start due to the fact it didn't completely feel like max payne but towards the end of the game when the destruction began I started to love it. The storyline was ok the new characters as well as the setting were average and the combat was great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

A. Theisen","summary":"A great design a decade ago, and still great","reviewText":"The original PSone dualshock controller was practically revolutionary when it was first introduced. The series, 1, 2 and 3, have never offered anything particularly new or unique, but they've all managed to package great functionality into a good package, and the DualShock 3 continues the delightful trend.The good? Same familiar feel and layout that most everyone can hold comfortably, same pressure sensitive (analog input) buttons across the board, same rumble package. New here are separated L2 and R2 trigger buttons that easily allow for progressive input, which I find especially great in racing games. Wireless connection is via Bluetooth, with a rechargeable onboard battery. Sony added it's in-house 'SIXAXIS' controls, which is something of a cousin to a Wii controller. The battery life is quite surprisingly good, giving me at least 12 hours of any game with full and frequent rumble. It's also nearly indestructible and refuses to die-- I've bought additional units, but my original that was packaged in with the PS3 well over 2 years ago is still 100% reliable and functional.More on the 'SIXAXIS' feature... it's not particularly meant to track movement (this is the territory of the Playstation Move add-on), but rather to be used as a floating motion sensor. Few games support it, but those that do (Heavy Rain does it very well) include down or upward snaps as actions, a tilting camera view based on your tilting, and generally natural-feeling motions that would otherwise be done with the hand such as opening a sliding door, twisting a key in a lock, etc. ...Honestly, it's hit-or-miss and doesn't really add much value to the device, but since you're not particularly paying any extra for it, there's no harm in it being available.The bad? Ergonomics could use an upgrade, to be honest. For particular hand sizes/shapes extended use will give stiff fingers, and any kind of extended use with a very firm hold (in my case, running into this while concentrating my hardest to push in the racers Gran Tourismo and F1 2010) may well end in some pain on finger bones. This \"should\" lower my review score, but I freely confess this is my own problem that I could correct by better controlling my grip or taking more small breaks. 95%+ of users will never run into this, and it is preventable. I can't fault Sony for not making the device comfortable to play with for an indefinite length of continuous play!More than anything, I'm shocked how incredibly light the thing is and feels almost weightless when held firmly. I have no clue how Sony managed to pack in all it offers, especially the battery life. The bluetooth connection means third party controllers will probably never happen (or be any less expensive), but thankfully Sony doesn't leave the window open for anyone else to ever offer additional features or alternate designs that would work any better.

In fact it's probably got the best graphics, gameplay, variety, sound and realism out of any Tactical FPS out there.  If you enjoyed BFBC2, BF2, ArmA 2, etc. give this a try.  If you think this game is slow paced kids, take your ritalin and go back to MW2.5 because real war is not for you.This is a great game.  I've been playing it since midnight launch and my first match online was rush on caspian border. Jets did low flying passes over us, bombs blowing up left and right, fog clogging the once beautiful fields of the map, tracers everywhere, people screaming.It was a very intense multiplayer war experience in HD with 7.1 Surround sound.  Not only this but the HD texture pack makes the game look simply fantastic, it's hard to believe a 6 year old console can still deliver visuals that are top of the line quality.  Sure the graphics can have those dull parts but Crysis 2 had very many dull parts visually and still was hailed as the prettiest console game around.I'm getting off subject but I'll keep it simple: If you like Military games, buy this.  If you like guns, buy this.  If you like Base jumps, tanks, jets, miniguns, bombs, Intense multiplayer battles with nonstop gunfire/action, realism, quality games, or just want a good game to play till you waste your money on the next regurgitated COD go ahead and buy this, you're probably good for my KD ;)Update: I took one star off just because of hiccups and technical issues here and there.

Big, but not as big or powerful as a Big Rig, Monster Trucks are surprisingly fast for their size and are able to roll over most other classes of vehicle and virtually any vegetation they encounter.The game's list of playable tracks has also been doubled to 16 and are categorized along the lines of the elements and the different environmental zones are found on the island. These zones are:The Air Zone- Tracks high up in the mountain and featuring lots of big jumps.The Fire Zone- Track oozing with new land and pools of lava that come from the island's resident volcano.The Water Zone- Here players will find courses laid out along the the beaches and other water sources of the island.The Earth Zone- The typical rough, rocky mud-filled off-road courses similar to the tracks found in the original game.Multiplayer ModesIn addition to the wild, anything goes singleplayer festival mode players of the originalMotorstormgame will remember and relish,Motorstorm Pacific Riftalso provides addictive multiplayer modes for both online and local play.

MS:PR is one of my favorite arcade racers.  The jungle setting is rendered outstandingly. From mud-filled gorges to volcanic craters spewing lava, to spiky mountain peaks, and sunny beaches, this game has variety. Since it's an outdoor rally game, the vehicles are more suited to the terrain; ATVs, motorbikes, monster trucks, etc.  The feeling of speed is wonderful & activating the boost gives a palpable rush, not unlike the old sitdown model of Hydro Thunder with the rumble seat.Like Hydro Thunder or the Burnout games, it's all about the boost, and knowing when to use it and when not to.If there's place I can fault the game it's that there are some unforgiving bottlenecks on the tracks, where the slightest loss of control can mean slamming into a fence or tree and losing 3 or 4 places in the race.  Obviously, since the terrain is choppy, this can happen alot, so studying the tracks and understanding the limitations of each vehicle is key... As well as understanding that the other racers will do Kamikaze attacks on you, sending both of you tumbling off a cliff, for example.  The AI is definitely suicidal, here.But that's part of the charm ,too.  It's loud, it's muddy, it's crazy, it's fast, it looks beautiful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2009"}

I have to admit, it's not my favorite genre of gameplay (run, jump, shoot everything, repeat).  This game goes above and beyond what this genre can be.Half-Life 2 comes across as a living breathing world, a world where extra-dimensional aliens have taken the Earth, and the remaining humans are living in internment camp/cities or joining the resistance.  The character designs and voice-acting are top-notch, the controls are fluid and easy, and the Havok engine means you get to interact with almost every random object on the screen.  I loved using the 'gravity gun' to hurl a can of paint at a head-hugger zombie, and having the paint make a nice splatter that remained on its torso while it pursued me, for example.  Little real world details abound, from birds overhead, combine officers chatting off-camera, civilians muttering about their plights, trains in the distance, combine propaganda posters covered with graffiti, etc.Don't expect enemies that expose themselves and just stand there, either.  These enemies DO use cover, and WILL attempt to flank you.Valve's Steam server is also a great addition if you're an avid gamer, BTW.  They own a lot of great older titles (Deus Ex, The Longest Journey, Pirates!, to name a few) that you can download, and the server usually does a PC scan to optimize your graphics settings for the best gameplay. Plus you can delete them for space and re-download them anytime.I used to use a NVidia 7300 LE graphics card, which is pretty basic, and this game still ran great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2007"}

{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","reviewerName":"Neoncloudff","summary":"An Instant Classic; Charming, Entertaining, and Timeless","reviewText":"Ever since I saw My Neighbor Totoro as a kid back in the early 1990's, I had wanted to see what would happen when Studio Ghibli combines their efforts with another developer to create a video game.  Now that we have the end result, I couldn't be more satisfied.  P.S., this is going to be one heck of a bias review.Ni No Kuni is one of the best JRPG'S I have ever played.  Combining Studio Ghibli's incredible imagination with Level 5's polished and fun gameplay mechanics, Ni No Kuni feels like the JRPG'S of old while revitalizing a dying genre.  It feels like Dragon Quest VIII (a personal favorite), mixing elements of Tales, Star Ocean, and Pokemon into one pot of pure bliss.  And man, how I've missed an overworld!The story and world sucks you in right quick, creating a sense of charm and wonder right from the get go.  The opening is a tear-jerker, creating a sense of desperation and sympathy for our hero, Oliver.  More than anything, Studio Ghibli's incredible ability to create such unique and real emotion in such with their animation is one of their strengths, and combining that with Level 5's sincere approach to the story, it works like magic.  Right away, you meet Drippy, one of the most incredibly charismatic and lovable characters to ever grace a video game.  The writing and script is top notch, filled with hilarious dialogue and wonderful characters (that feature some of the best English Dubs of any JRPG translation that I've played).Battles play out like a synthesis of Tales meets Pokemon.  You gain control of familiars, small creates that have attributes (sword and shield, tank, fire, etc.) that do your fighting in battles.  You can also take control of Oliver to command him to use various tools such as the ability to use items, heal, and run.  Battles begin fairly simple with you fighting one to two monsters, but the progression exponentially increases and by no time battles become chaotic affairs that will test your wit and reflexes.  The combat is incredibly addicting, rewarding constant interaction and movement on the battlefield.  One of the best features is the real time aspect of the battle system.  If you command your familiars to attack, defend, and use tricks (or special abilities) at the right time HP and MP orbs fall from your enemies, offering a quick heal.  It sounds like a simple mechanic, but it keeps you constantly engaged while in combat, offering a fun, fast paced and exciting tug of war against your enemies.Story telling is, to put it simply, reminiscent of Studio Ghibli.  A hero going on an epic adventure to save his kingdom, healing the people of the land of their broken-heartedness, all while trying to save your mother sounds, walks, and talks just a Ghibli presentation shoud.  NNK can be enjoyed by a younger audience, but the elements here are consistently dark and mature, which comes as a major relief.  Keeping it spoiler free, the game engages you quite well.  It's a simple yet emotionally effective story that grabs you right away.Also of note is Joe Hisaishi's majestic, sweeping, and beautiful original score.  Frequent collaborator with Studio Ghibli, Joe was (gladly) offered to compose the score, and man is it incredible.  The overworld theme is still reverberating in my head as I write this.  It captures the moods with gorgeous melodies and memorable themes.  It allows you to explore and enjoy an already tremendous achievement all the more.  They seriously need to release the PS3 soundtrack, because this is as good as JRPG and video game scores get.And speaking of outside influence, Studio Ghibli made a significant contribution in the art department.  There are original animated cut scenes produced by Ghibli themselves (namely Momose)which are wonderful (especially in HD!), the monsters are original and cute, and the gorgeous colors used in the backdrops provoke the imagination.  Everything is here, and it feels like Ghibli production combined with Level 5's JRPG mastery in full force.If there are any complaints (and these are minor grievances) it's that the draw distance is nothing to write home about.  On the world map you'll see mountains \"peel\" in in the distance, and foliage in more graphically intensive areas obviously pops in as you walk through the areas.  This is such a minor complaint though, honestly, as it comes from years of playing games and eventually noticing technical \"tricks\" that developers use to cut corners.Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is sincere, wholesome, and most importantly FUN entertainment that might just be the last push the JRPG genre needs to get its legs again in a predominantly \"bald-space-dude-marine-bro\" controlled market.  Some may ask \"why is the title stupid?\" or say \"it looks like a game for ten year olds!,\" which at that point I would say that Ni No Kuni game isn't appropriate for them.  If you aren't willing to give the game a shot, you'll be missing out.  Ni No Kuni takes skill, dedication, and maturity to play and enjoy this long and challenging adventure; it dares to be different from just about every JRPG out there, straying from the spiky-hair-big-sword cliches that have plagued the genre for years, and succeeds so incredibly well at doing so.And in case you just looked to the end to see the score or closing comments, here they are:  Ni No Kuni Wrath of the White Witch is one of the best JRPG's ever made, and it rightfully deserves the praise it is receiving.  Part homage to JRPG's and part fan service for Studio Ghibli lovers, it's hard not to like Ni No Kuni. If you love RPG's/JRPG's, this is a no brainer.  If you love Studio Ghibli, this is a no brainer.  If you've been looking to jump into the genre, you won't get a better chance.  Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is a steroid shot to the imagination, giving players freedom to explore one of the best adventures this console generation.  It's a masterpiece that won't soon be forgotten.It's not every day we are given such an incredible gem.  Just leaving here with one comment:  Thank you Level-5 for the incredible adventure and Studio Ghibli for continuing to create entertainment that is both wholesome and enjoyable.So what are you waiting for?  Go play Ni No Kuni for flippen sake!Afterthoughts:  Just completed the game!  My opinions from the beginning couple hours have not changed.  I love Ni No Kuni even more now.  The ending tied up and explained all of the mysteries and loose ends (without being stupid, farfetched, or cliche), the characters came full circle and were developed so well, and Oliver really grows up into a hero, and a quite likable one at that.  There seems to be plenty of post game challenges left, so consider me excited to continue exploring this world.Total play time for story run: 51:14:06.Final score: 10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2013"}

I was going to purchase one for the sole purpose of some Mario Kart with my girlfriend. I ended up waiting and purchasing a Wii U. We've had some good fun with the Mario Karts but it's nothing the original Wii couldn't do. Now for the review. I'd say this game is great for this exact situation and so in my personal opinion the game is 4 stars because it's pretty solid and it sets itself apart from Mario Kart with it's only flair and style. The game is interesting because you can play using the both the gamepads screen and the tv and then the tv can have split screen going. There's flying, boating, and regular car racing. The power ups are okay but different so it still feels fun when comparing it with any of the Mario Karts.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2013"}

With your trusty horse at your side, explore the spacious lands and unearth each Colossi. Armed with your wits, a sword, and a bow, use cunning and strategy to topple each behemoth.From the original developers of the critically acclaimed ICO, comes a masterpiece of an adventure.","reviewerName":"Charles B Valentino","summary":"Epic and INSANE","reviewText":".It's hard for video games to thrill me these days. Sure, plenty of them are amusing. Plenty have those \"Hey, now there's a good idea!\" moments. Very few of them instill a sense of awe in me. Even then, none of them really provoke a strong sense of catharsis throughout the course of the game.This game does both. Oh, and it's also a ton of fun.You are Wander, a man who has brought your dead lover's sacrificed body countless miles to an ancient and hidden land in hopes that a mysterious entity rumored to control the spirits of the dead, can bring her back to life. The spirit instructs you to roam the land in search of 16 fearsome colossi which you must defeat in order to resurrect her. You must ride, climb, and puzzle to bring about success in this game. The danger is real though. Many of the creatures are aggressive and even swift. It may be a challenge to simply not get flattened, much less bring one of these behemoths down.Your adversaries are tremendous. I'm talking Empire State Building TREMENDOUS. Though several beasts fit the traditional mold of being slow lumbering giants, others will provide you with challenges you may not expect. For example, how does one manage to get close to a colossus that remains entirely airborne? If you're lucky enough to get on the sucker, what the heck do you do now??? This game can be considered a puzzle game as much as an action/fantasy adventure. Part of the fun of it is figuring stuff out on your own. I was quite pleased with myself after completing the game with no cheats or spoilers helping me. You will be too.The game runs high on emotion at times. As you overcome a particularly difficult obstacle in the course of a battle, the music will swell and raise the excitement level even higher. The visuals gave me this amazing sense of feeling ant-like insignificance. Oh sure, standing next to a colossus who's pinky toe weighs tons more than you will do that; but the magnitude of the game's vast and varied landscapes will affect that feeling as well. From gorgeous canyons and cascades that drop thousands of feet, to majestic cities cut into the sides of mountains, you will feel small and completely alone. There are literally miles upon miles of unpopulated landscape to explore. It kind of reminded me of a highly embellished version of Sedona, Yellowstone, and Machu Picchu rolled into one.No petty minions clutter up the game anywhere. Though you will catch sight of the occasional bird or lizard hiding amongst the rocks, your only companion is your reliable horse Agro. Luckily, he's a mighty good companion to have, and will save your life on several occasions. The horse is beautifully animated and programmed. Mastering the use of Agro will prove vital in your success with some of these monsters.I liked that feeling of being able to explore the wilderness and ancient ruins throughout this abandoned world. You tend to imagine what happened to all the people that used to live here. Why did they go away? What brought these Colossi here in the first place and who created them? You may even sympathize with the creatures as you bring them down one by one. After all, they were minding their own business until you came along and many of them don't attack you unless you actively provoke them. The end of the game raises more questions than it answers about these mysteries. If you play it through, I think you might draw your own conclusions as to why noone lives here anymore.Overall, the visuals are stunning. The game is an EXPERIENCE in the grandest sense of the word. Sure, some might complain it's too short. I would argue that all the best movies, books, albums, and yes even video games leave you wanting more. I think the game wisely ends at the right length. Extending the challenges any further might run the risk of even making the game's concepts seem repetitive. So I have no complaints about the length. I was completely entertained throughout.Concerning the technical details, I have read complaints of frame rates slowing down during more fast paced moments of play. I have a newer PS2 and did not notice any such problems. If any frame skipping or slowing occurred, then it was certainly not an issue that affected my ability to successfully complete and enjoy the game.Play control was not a problem for me either. When you're climbing all over a 3 dimensional creature the size of a skyscraper that has moving and rotating appendages, figuring out which way to push the analog stick can be a challenge sometimes. Is that an error? No, it's simply part of the challenge you have when finding a way to conquer these beasts. The camera can be tough at times, but again, when you're clinging near the underarm of a gigantic colossus, the arm could potentially get in the way of your most ideal viewing angle. Is this an error? No again, it's simply an unavoidable circumstance. Is the play control perfect? No, but I didn't think there was anything really bad about it either.In conclusion, I think this game will be considered historic in how it's really focused in on provoking these emotions in the player. If there was a genre for this, I would dub it \"Concept Gaming.\" Ambiguous, yet it's a clear indication that the designers were really trying to create a unique gaming experience. If you're up for a memorable adventure, you'd be foolish to miss this game. Now that it has been released under Sony's \"Greatest Hits\" line with a $20 pricetag, there's no excuse not to grab it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00007LVJD","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"space_hamster\"","summary":"A polished (and final) entry in the C&C series","reviewText":"This latest entry in the Command and Conquer series will, unfortunately, probably be the very last as Westwood was just recently amalgamated into Electronic Arts.In accordance with this amalgamation, the plotline for this game is radically different from its predecessors. The Brotherhood of Nod have been replaced with the GLA, while the US and Chinese armies have taken the place of the GDI.The storyline for Generals is an uncomfortable reflection of real life events, with GLA terrorists invading middle eastern nations like Baghdad and Afghanistan. Naturally, the Chinese and the US are out to stop them. The parallels are a little too close to reality, and this does remove some of the fun and campiness from the game that were often present in its predecessors. Red Alert 2 was a delightful example of this.This is also the first C&C; game that contains more than 2 sides, which makes for some rather entertaining skirmish and campaign missions.The US uses a combination of air power and ground forces to crush their opponents, with very little emphasis on \"weapons of mass destruction\". Instead, the player would be wise to use precision airstrikes and artillery to crush their opponents.The GLA have units very similar to NOD, in that they are fast, light and mobile. This makes them very useful for ambushes, but they become expendable in prolonged skirmishes. Their greatest strength lies in the effective use of suicide bombers and toxic bio-weapons. The GLA is a good side for those who use stealth to defeat their opponents.The Chinese use overwhelming numbers and firepower to defeat their enemies. Fans of the old \"tank rush\" strategy will love playing as the Chinese, especially as Chinese tanks get attack bonuses if they are grouped in large enough numbers.The graphics in Generals are easily the most impressive of any entry in the C&C; series. The game makes excellent use of 3D-accelerated graphics to render huge maps consisting of mountains and flowing rivers. Tanks will raise clouds of dust as they move across desert terrain. Jet fighters will execute tight banking turns as they engage a target. Most impressive are the super-weapons, like the Chinese Nuclear missile, or the GLA Scud Missiles.The most glaring downsides to this game are the portrayal of the GLA as your stereotypical Arab terrorist. This may be particularly offensive to members of the Arab community, withits (hopefully) unintended racial stereotyping. The apocalyptic end cutscene of the GLA campaign will certainly not help matters.In addition, some users have reported compatiblity problems while running Generals on their PC's. Please check the internet to ensure that your PC is compatible with the game. Also, be warned that this game does require an extremely fast PC. I have an Athlon 2000+ XP with 512MB RAM and a 64MB GEForce4 videocard, and I can run the game in 1024x768 on high detail. Anything less than this, and you may have problems.Other than this, Generals is an excellent game. Yes, other than the updated graphics it doesn't present any revolutionary innovations to the RTS genre. However, for those of us who enjoy the fast pace that the C&C; games provide, this is a perfect addition to the series.Although the impact of Generals will not be as great as the original Tiberian Dawn or Red Alert, Generals is still one of the most polished entries in the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2003"}

Dont make my mistake","reviewText":"Ok so with over 300 hrs logged in on a monk and DH, and a full month played I can safely and without a second thought, tell anyone who's thinking of buying this game?: DONT.Diablo 3 is essentially Blizzard's Real Money Auction House (RMAH) with a hack/slash/loot game built around it. Now, you may be telling yourself 'well I dont plan on using it, so no problem' ok that's fine. In fact, the game itself is fine for the 1st 3 levels of difficulty. Normal, Nightmare and Hell version of D3 work basically as intended: you fight, you level up, you loot. Everything is great, you feel powerful when you kill Diablo in Hell and now it's time for endgame: Inferno. 2 problems here.#1- The first 3 difficulties dont include the ONE factor that all but leave your characters 'broken' until you TOTALLY re-gear them (or quit in the frustration, more on that later), and this is: Resistances. There are many different types in the game, none of them you'll really feel until Inferno, where you WILL be greeted with one-shots. Many of them. Dozens of them.Now since the new patch that has GREATLY increased repair costs, you'll quickly find you have two options in inferno:1- Go back to Hell and farm until nauseous (which no one wants to do naturally)for appropriate gear, by aquiring 5 buff stacks for finding loot and then trying to find something in the ridiculously low drop rate of Hell... or(and how convenient)#2 go to the RMAH. The RMAH is where all the farmers in the game go to sell their items for outrageously high gold prices or for an equivalent cash value in USD. I'm not a complete idiot so Im not paying real cash for a fake sword or staff or whatever, so the route those who are still around on the server take is to simply do farming runs for cash and hope something drops in the process.This process can take days to find a decent piece of Inferno quality gear, farming for hours. 3 weeks in, my guys are still stuck in Act 1(inferno).There are many rumors about Blizz intentionally lowering the drop rate on level 61+ (Inferno level) gear, putting many into a 'pay or quit' scenario as the loot needed to progress simply isnt as available as it was in the 3 easier levels.There are also rumors of Blizz reps padding the AH with items only they can generate to sweeten the RMAH.Im glad I waited before writing this because before you hit Inferno, the game is fun. Well, fun enough to make you want a bit more and would have recieved 5s all around, but the frustration you'll face with the lack of resistances going into inferno, the one shots, the ever-looming repair bill over your head, the almost non-existence of upgradable loot at end game - and if Im not getting loot, why the hell am I playing this game- and the blatant RMAH always in your face, the honeymoon with this game ends real fast. A shame, it seems the last of the great AAA title makers has decided to put profit before their consumers once again.Dont buy.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2012"}

All-new dungeons and dialogue scenes to challenge and thrill gamers","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Pretty nice","reviewText":"These two games were pretty nice. They weren't revoloutionary, but they provided me with several hours of good fun. Square did a good job in modernizing them, too. I never played these games in their original era, so I don't have the same nostalgia that others do. Anyway, here's my summary of these games...Final Fantasy I was okay. Nice graphics, a big world to explore, not too challenging. I liked the save-anywhere feature. However, the game was a bit mindless, and was very light on story. Also, the improved dialogue removed a lot of the in-game hints, so I had to use an online strategy guide. The new, randomized dungeons that were added to this version were very confusing and not fun at all, so I chose not to do them. I would give this part of the package three stars.Final Fantasy II was much better. The story was more involved; the characters had more personality. Thanks to the innovative method of finding information, I was able to get through the entire game without help. I was very happy with this part of the set, and would give it 4 1/2 stars. But the added content for this part is even worse than Final Fantasy I's new dungeons. It's supposed to be an extended storyline with the characters who perished in the main game, but it is way too difficult to get anywhere on. For this reason, I opted out of the extended storyline and stuck to the main one.Overall, I liked this game. It is worth buying if you're either extremely nostalgic, or were born after the NES era and are curious about Final Fantasy's roots.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2005"}

I cant believe the high quality of the full motion videos in this game. I didnt think a Gameboy was capable of this quality.And this aint no short romp through the enchanted lands of Disney. The main story took me 18 fun hours to get through. Plus there is a second complete game, with a new character and abilities, once you beat the main story.And this second game is full with a new story and dialogue. This is pretty much unheard of...Thoguh i must admit that some of the boss battles in this game will have you ripping your hair out. While the card battles and card collecting is addictive and fun, it can be annoying when some bosses have stacks of the best cards in the game...All in all this game is a pure gem from its quality packaging and to its superb graphics and gameplay.

If you are expecting a fun pick-up-and-go adventure, you've come to the right game. If you are expected a game that will re-define video games forever and perhaps change your life, wait for &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; to come out.Starfox Adventures plays almost like an action RPG, with full cinematics and lots of dialogue. You assume the role of Fox McCloud, back on active duty, who must save Dinosaur planet from the bloodthirsty General Scales, who is a tyrant in every sense of the word. Along the way, you aquire weapons, magic, and meet a host of interesting characters. The most noticeable change in this Starfox game is that a lot of the gameplay takes place outside the Arwing. You are on the ground doing hand to hand combat with a variety of enemies. The flight missions are still here, but most of the good stuff takes place on the ground.Enough cannot be said for the graphics, which are amazing in every way. The animation is fluid and colorful, the scenery is rich and well-detailed. It excells equally well in the sound department. For anyone who has played the earlier Starfox games, the controls will be second nature. The ground combat plays a lot like a Zelda game. Starfox Adventures poses a medium challenge to gamers, but is tons of fun.Along with Super Mario Sunshine, this is another must-have Gamecube title, and one that will hopefully appease those whiny people spouting &quot;There are no good games for the Gamecube&quot;.

Like the aforementioned game, Vice City Stories is a near perfect emulation of the portable title, and like that game as well, this is good and bad.  The first thing you'll notice is the graphical transition from the PSP to the PS2, which is far from the prettiest thing you'll ever see.  Now I know the GTA series has never been reknowned for it's graphics, but Vice City Stories has possibly the muddiest and blurriest graphics of the series.  That being said, just about everything else from there on is pretty much fine.  Playing as Vic Vance (brother of Lance, who you'll remember from the original Vice City game), you perform the kind of missions that you'd expect to play in a GTA game.  The open world setting may be getting old these days, but it's nice to make a return to Vice City, which is pretty much how you remember it.  The game also pretty much controls the same way too, although there are some noticeable issues with the gunplay and driving mechanics.  That aside, the overall package of Vice City Stories is nicely rounded thanks to an awesome soundtrack, and engaging story, longer missions, and a great voice cast that features many returning actors like Philip Michael Thomas, Gary Busey, and Luis Guzman.  All in all, there may be nothing in Vice City Stories that we haven't seen before, but with the budget price and the tried but true gameplay that GTA made famous, you can't really go wrong here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2007"}

A lot of the graphical hiccups have been adjusted as well. The game looks and plays very well, but not great - no wear near the level of a game like God of War III. The force powers have been upgraded, dual lightsabers look great and sith fury is just awesome. The targeting system has been vastly upgraded, so there is less blasting plants or walls when you are trying to hit an enemy. At the same time, you still get trapped in your animations and can be carried away from enemies or off of ledges. Even with those gripes, there is far more polish here than on the original.Unfortunately, the story is sadly lacking. Where I was compelled to see what happened, excited to see familiar faces and square off with The Emperor; here it was just kind of...meh.Many of the reviews claim the game can be completed in 5-6 hours. That is true, on easy, not completing many of the \"tasks\" to fully complete the game. That said; if you're not into trophy collections and collecting various items for your costume, combos, etc., Force Unleashed II is probably a rental. If you enjoy playing through several times to get every last dime out of your purchase and don't mind waiting for the inevitable DLC or must own all things Star Wars, than this is a nice addition to the catalogue. Good, not great, wholly unremarkable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"My opinion about The Last of Us","reviewText":"(edit 7/21, ~15 hours in)The story telling within this game is just plain phenomenal. I am changing my 4 star review to a 5 start just because Naughty Dog really did do a good job at making this game. Yes the dumb AI is still widely apparent, it doesn't take away that -much- of the game. This is becoming one of my top 3 favorite games of the generation. Behind RDR and Skyrim of course ;).Naughty Dog (developer) is the critically acclaimed developers of the Uncharted and Jak series. Uncharted 2 is one of my top rated games of all time, mainly due to the story telling and the fantastic movie-like cinematic game play experiences. Having said that, I went into The Last of Us with high expectations - which you should have on a major developer. Below is going to be some Pros/Cons on why I think this game is a 4/5 stars and not 5/5 stars. Again, this is my opinion...Obviously this game deserves to be in the category of \"best game ever\". I have NOT played multi-player.Pros:+ Fantastic story-telling (as usual)+ Outstanding graphics for a console that is so outdated+ Great setting, Naughty Dog really puts you in the post-apocalyptic setting we all love+ They do a GREAT job at NOT making this a typical zombie shooter+ Crafting is easy and can be funCons:- AI is beyond dumb- Your followers blow your cover- Shooting is sub-par- The game can definitely drag in the beginning for the first 2 hours or so- You can't exit a strangling attempt while other infected/clickers maul you to deathNaughty Dog did a great job, but it has it's flaws. This is one of the best (if not the best) PS3 exclusive to come out in a long time. A couple things bother me big time in this game. One of which is Naughty Dog's terrible AI return (pretty much the same thing they had in the Uncharted series). It's horrible, the soldiers are beyond dumb, the clickers don't really do their job of \"hearing you when you're crouched\", and the infected can see you in the pitch dark when you are sitting still? These are only three examples when it comes to AI that I had a problem with. Secondly, your followers blow your cover constantly, or they can run right past a clicker and the clicker does nothing, there's nothing in the middle. When Joel is crouched, they should be too at ALL times. I don't know why they chose to run sometimes when you're crouched. Then in other moments, your follower(s) can run right past an entire infected/clicker area and the enemies have no idea or react -way- late. It can get quite annoying to complete an entire sequence then somebody to stand up and attract enemies. I am a big shooter FPS/TPS fan, if your game is a shooter - you better have good shooting mechanics. Uncharted definitely doesn't do well is this category, and The Last of Us is basically a copy and paste job from that. So without going on and on, let's just say they made no improvement in shooting from previous games.All in all, I am have A LOT of fun with this game. This is to date the best post-apocalyptic game on the market (Borderlands 1/2 is in my opinion in a different category, it being a RPG FPS after all)as of right now and is one of the few games out there actually worth a 59.99 price tag.(Edit:7/17/2013)So I put a good 5 more hours into this game last night. The story and action definitely pick up more.!!!!(Semi-spoiler)!!!!Once your followers are gone and its just you and Ellie, it becomes a MUCH better game. I don't know why naughty dog chose to have other followers in the game besides you two. The AI doesn't really get any better though.Thanks for viewing,JJ","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}

I'm not a fan of playing shooters online so I went the rental route with this game, finished the game in a few hours, and was only out 2 bucks. The campaign picks up pretty much right after MW2's story and you play out the ending of the Modern Warfare trilogy. The story as a whole going back to the first MW to the end of MW3 is pretty good overall. The norm for Call of Duty titles is more often than not relying on fast paced over the top gunfights. Which in the shooter genre is what I prefer. It may not be ultra realistic but it's exciting, and that's what I play a shooter for. The gameplay is somewhat simple enough to where it won't take too long to get used to things if you're new to these games. It's mainly a matter of knowing when to go in guns blazing, and when to stay more in cover and pick enemies off more slowly. The AI isn't overly frustrating, depending on the difficulty you play. If you're playing on the standard difficulty and you're a competent gamer when it comes to shooters, you'll make it through without any significant trouble. The ending isn't bad, there's somewhat of an attempt to have that dramatic finale, and it does feel like there was a good enough pay off. Out of the 3, I have to say that I enjoyed the campaign of MW2 the most, but this installment is still well done. Also, if you're like me and want to play out the story and aren't as big on multiplayer, then renting should be on your mind also. The game is fun, but it's not worth all the money if you don't plan on jumping online very often.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2012"}

I paid $400 with 2 free games. The PROBLEM is I didn't keep my receipt... lost it when cleaning out my bedroom and rearranging stuff... and the TV just started going black for no reason, at first I thought it was my Mac mouse cursor hitting my hot corner randomly and going into sleep mode but no, it just does it on it's own for no reason at all and now I'm stuck with it. SURE, while the TV functions it's quite great, movies looks good, 3D is kind of dark but movies like TRON look amazing etc. I also bought the Sony PS3 remote which works decent enough. I'm just stuck with a TV that will probably die soon for NO REASON and I'm not sending it off for warranty repair unless they have a definite fix and can state the problem directly to we the consumers. I like Sony but forget their TV's and this is from a rare double dip pissed of original 60GB PS3 YLOD after 14 months owner, I bought a 40GB and it's still going though.JUST FORGET BUYING THIS, it's not worth the malfunctioning potential death worry... spend your money on a good Toshiba, or Sharp I've never had a bad tv from those makers and I'm probably going to get another Sharp if I can find they make a decently priced active 3D HDTV.EDIT April 19th 2012, WELL it's still working... it SEEMS that the random black screen mainly happens when using it as a monitor for my Mac via HDMI, SO perhaps it's a signal aberration which is telling the TV that it's switching off when it reality it's only switching applications on my Mac? could be, I've yet to notice the screen turning black while running anything on my PS3, games, movies etc... so I have no conclusive idea that there is a technical problem with this TV via PS3 usage... which would concern most would be buyers.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"The Treasure Chest","reviewText":"Some gaming enthusiasts see video games as a near parallel to movies. While many games see upgraded graphics as the key to the uncanny valley, Uncharted 2's use of scale, story and characters blurs the line more than any game has before.Organically Grand is the phrase that would sum up Uncharted 2. The story and characters are deep and rich to a point that it really does feel like you are watching a summer blockbuster action film. Deep in the Himalyan Mountains, Nathan Drake finds himself racing agianst merciless war ciminals to recover the lost treasure of Marco Polo. The passion that Naughty Dog puts into the story of Uncharted is something that is just unseen in games, so far as to rival an Indiana Jones flick. The dialouge is organic. All improved by the actors, who really place their heart into the voice acting. Nothing is forced, but flows naturally and is witty and exicuted wounderfully.Just looking at the details is enough to glaze your eyes. Vista points in this series is one of the most glorious points in video game visuals. Every part of the wilderness in Uncharted may as well came out of a Robert Frost poem. Detailed to the T, you can stare at the games elegancy for hours. From the small enscriptions in the temples, to the snowy mountains in the distance, even to the cuts, wrinkles, and indiviual hairs of the characters, their is so much beauty in Uncharted you can appriciate (even though most players can whiz right past, never viewing the gorgousness this game has to offer).On the player interaction side of U2 is where the grandness takes place. The combat and platforming returns in all its glory, but improved greatly. Not by the mechanics, but the setpieces. The cover shooting is the same from before, but landscape is so detailed and monutentous that it adds so much depth to each conflict.draw Much like the platforming; the mechanics are the same, but Drake will scale more impressive and detailed obsticles. With the cinematic camera, each climb is all the more awe-inspiring. Each one of these scenes where so striking, in comparision, most games would only give you one or two memorable spots of such caliber. U2 has at least one in every chapter.The multiplayeris far more than a tacked add-on. Levels (whether it's one of the three co-op modes, death match, capture the flag, horde, and many others) are all vertical, giving each match the same feel as the campaign. With three different stories where the action can be taking place, the multiplayer is more than a standard run-and gun death arena. Fully packed with medals, ranking and varied enviroments and modes, the multiplayer deffinitly has legs long enough to carry players for many months (possibly even divert attention away from CoD MW 2).Uncharted 2 is unlike any game that any system has seen. The franchise has set so many benchmarks for how action (or any) game are meant to be played. The characters are interesting and real, the story is superb, and the level disigns are breathtaking (the train sequence is one of the pinnacles of this generation, no lie). There is not enough blessings to be said about Ucharted 2. While their are notable grips (no split scrren, only 9 hrs long, semi lackluster city section) that hold U2 from the 5 star mantal, the potential Naughty Dog has set shows a shimmering future for video games.9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

Also don't try to figure out the plot as there's pretty much isn't one all you basically are doing is shooting the enemy and trying to stay alive. The controls are alright for the most part though the cover button or action seemed a little faulty as half the time you leave cover to shoot when you pushing to shoot from cover also the camera angle can sometimes be problematic in some levels and areas where you loose sight of your target or enemies.Getting the game for under $20 felt alright for the game but if you're still unsure try out a demo if possible or check out a few video clips online to see if this game is for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

Honestly, when I first played it, I couldn't comprehend the story. It all went over my head. But as I got older, I just fell in love with the series. Once I was old enough to understand the story, I just had to play every single game in the series. I even went so far as to play through the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 when they were released with subsistence. This marks the 4th time I purchase Metal Gear Solid 2, the 3rd time I purchase Metal Gear Solid 3, and the 2nd time I purchase Peace Walker. I would purchase them again if they were re-released. For fans of the series: do yourselves a favor. Don't hesitate! Purchase this set so you can play them in HD.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"evanjamesroskos \"ejr\"","summary":"very fun","reviewText":"this is the game lots of people point to when discussing whether video games can be \"art\". I would say that the art design and the story are quite unique and the weaponry is fun. It has been pointed out, though (most recently in an IGN article about the art topic) that despite the great story, the game is still just you running around shooting things. And, in fact, I felt at some points that the variety of weapons had not been justified. Even when I beat the final boss, I wasn't paying attention to the weapons I was supposed to use (it's one of those classic \"if the bad guy is fiery  then use ice to defeat him; if he's ice use fire.\" and yet, I just used whatever and still beat the game on Hard on the first try.Anyway, little complaints aside, this is a really fun game with a good list of achievements that are not ridiculous (though there is the seemingly required \"find a thousand hidden items that add to the story but are not necessary\". ah, game design.)If you're not a big fan of first person shooters, you might find BioShock a little dull.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Jack R. Tallent","summary":"A Beautiful and Ambitious Work of Art","reviewText":"When reviewing games of this sort, I often make reference to the legendary Deus Ex, which I have held up as the applicable gold standard. I was understandably excited, then, to play Bioshock, because it is more-or-less a decendant of that game, or perhaps the closely-related System Shock. Indeed, you can see in Bioshock MANY similarities in game design to these earlier iconic efforts.First of all, Bioshock scores 100% in terms of artistic vision, atmosphere, and visual execution. The extent to which the game designers went to immerse the gamer in its world is nothing less than awesome. The sheer ambition of the creative concept alone is amazing. Bioshock puts the player in an Art-Deco Objectivist Underwater Utopia Gone Horribly Wrong. If this strikes you as not-the-usual FPS setting, you are very correct. In short, there has never been anything like the world Bioshock presents, nor, dare I say, the level of immersion.  This includes everything, including art direction, architecture, voice acting, music, etc. The attention to detail is astounding, and it is clear that much effort was put into making everything a believable part of this bizarre environment.Why then only 4 stars? Well, I can tell you I hated not giving it 5, just because of what a work of art it is. It is true, however, that Bioshock DOES, to some degree, suffer in comparison to its legendary ancestors, specifically in the area of game play.You see, all the elements are there to recapture the kind of perfection you got with Deus Ex, but they didn't QUITE get the balance right. For example, the fascinating device of plasmids, which is central to the game, provides the vehicle through which character specialization occurs. Except you never quite get the feeling that there are a number of compelling alternate specialization paths you would like to take. Many of the choices seem irrelevant or redundant. While you're playing the game, you are not already thinking of how you will play it differently next time.The game also presents a number of other avenues you can spend time on, such as Invention and Research. In the end, though, one feels that these maybe aren't as important as the game designers intended them to be. In fact, invention seemed to be almost completely spurious. Hacking is another example; once you get some basic hacking ability, there doesn't seem much point in investing a lot of extra resources in it.There are some other odd quirks. For instance, the game REALLY wants you to kill all the Big Daddys and harvest all the Little Sisters, presumably because you need all that Adam. At the end, it didn't seem like I really did. Another thing is the wrench--the game designers, for some reason, REALLY want you to use that wrench.I don't want to give the wrong impression with all this analysis. You SHOULD play Bioshock, and you WILL enjoy the experience. It's just that a game of this pedegree has high expectations.So, definitely immerse yourself if this beautiful and strange world. The plot has many satisfying twists and turns that you will appreciate, and there are many wonderful things to see and kill!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

MacMahon","summary":"Like Toys in the Sandbox, Just Cause 2 is Insanely Fun","reviewText":"Just Cause was a love it or hate it game in my experience because despite being so adrenaline-fueled and fun, the mission structure was flawed, the missions themselves were somewhat boring and the visuals looked old for the time due to being developed around the Playstation 2.Just Cause 2 is... much the same, really, but a lot bigger, a lot more fun and a loooooot prettier.Seriously, do you like amazing graphics?  Do you love seeing detailed worlds with great view distance and stunning lighting effects?  Do you love seeing some skyscraper in the distance and knowing you can go climb it, all the while surrounded by a sky, ground and city that stands up there with the best visuals in the medium?  Well then my friend, you will love Just Cause 2's visual splendor.  While not as accomplished as Grand Theft Auto 4 in physics and detail, Just Cause 2 is easily the best looking open world game I have ever seen, and much better looking than the average game in the genre such as The Saboteur or Assassin's Creed.  On a purely visual level, Just Cause 2 is a 10 out of 10.Gameplay wise... well, it depends on what you like about games.Just Cause 2 is a sandbox in the purest sense, it recalls the days when you might have played with G.I. Joes in the back yard and pretended you could climb tanks, shoot dozens of dudes without pausing for a breath or fly through the sky at the speed of a toddlers arm.  On a purely videogame level it reminds me of the first days of Grand Theft Auto 3, the first 3D open-world game I remember playing where you could cause mass hysteria.  In GTA3 I spent dozens of hours early on just running around causing mayhem and blowing things up, and no open-world game has given me that raw thrill since because it had been done already, the surprise was over.  Just Cause 2 brings this feeling back, the explosions and chaos (an actual game currency) are the best in the genre since that time (perhaps tied with Mercenaries, which sadly never saw a PC release).What separates Just Cause 2 from other open-world shooters other than chaos?  Well, the grappling hook and parachute for one.  You can grapple on to anything and deploy your parachute whenever you are in the air, leading to aerial combo maneuvers that would shame an airplane stunt pilot.  While games like Red Faction Guerrilla had a particular mechanic like building destruction to separate them, Just Cause 2 uses the grapple and parachute dynamic in combination with the insane action to truly separate itself from the others in the genre.The downsides?  The actual missions and story are terrible.  Seriously, they're bad, do not buy this game if you like immersion in stories or innovative missions, they are not here.  Missions are all started by a terrible cut-scene with horrible voice acting and writing, then the game-play is tired open-world stuff like \"go here and kill him\" or \"go here and get this thing.\"  Also if you stick to only doing main story missions you can burn through the game rather fast... there are only seven, and while you need a certain amount of \"chaos\" to open them, it is not an amazingly high requirement.So why does Just Cause get a 4 out of 5 if the story and missions are tired and bad?  Because the game is such a fun sandbox.  If your priority is to run around an amazing looking world and cause extremely fun chaos, buy Just Cause 2.  If your priority is to experience an intense storyline and feel like you are really inside a foreign country as a spy, stay away from this one, it was not made for you.Note: Game requires Steam activation and tying your game to the Steam client service, which is a form of DRM which restricts resale or even giving the game to someone, as well as perhaps being hard or impossible to run without modification if the Steam platform ever shuts down.  The game also requires Windows Vista or 7.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

In Carbon your character from Most Wanted is back and the story continues from where Most Wanted left off. You also get a nice live action cut scene explaining what happened before Most Wanted took place, this is perfect for people who missed out on Most Wanted.Some noticeable changes from MW is drift races are now back, however they are much harder than before. Now if you hit a wall your drift is automatically finished, and you are encouraged (read: forced) to keep a drift VERY long in order to get a high enough multiplier to get enough points to win the drift. Cop chases have also been made more difficult in the later heats (3 and above) and can also be fun, yet frustrating if you get into a cop chase while in a race. New additions here are there are now Canyon Races that you have to do to beat the bosses, most of the time these races are easy but sometimes they can be a pain. You have to do the Canyon races in 2 parts, but say you fall off the canyon in the 2nd part, you have to restart from the beginning. The 2nd new addition is you now can take a Wingman into almost every race. You either get a drafter,scout,or blocker, but after about the halfway point the only useful one is a scout.The story in Carbon is about the main character coming back to his hometown and clearing his name because of some events that forced him from his town 2 years ago. The cut-scenes are well done and are not too hilarious this time around. The ending is kind of daft and seems like a bad closer for a game the spanned a sequel. I can't say much more about the story because I'll probably give away some spoilers.The graphics in Carbon aren't anything worth mentioning, there PS2-like but do the job for an arcade racer-no complaints from me. Racing in Carbon is the EXACT same as MW no changes at all.If you haven't played Carbon yet, pick it up. Its very enjoyable!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXVK8","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"6 stars out of 5","reviewText":"I wanted to play Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta because I played and enjoyed God of War 3. At first, I was going to review these games separately, but I changed my mind at the last minute. I'd prefer to go the 'compare and contrast' route, I'm sure you guys won't mind. Both of these games are perfection, and they'll forever change how I judge action games.I thoroughly enjoyed fighting in both of these. But, I'll give the edge to GOS for one reason, or perhaps two reasons..Reason number one: Thera's Bane. I'm nowhere close to being a God of War expert, so I'll do the best I can when explaining some of this stuff. If you're at all familiar with God of War, you probably know that Kratos' standard weapon is the Blade of Chaos Sword (at least that's the case with the GOW games I've played, haven't played the first two) Thera's Bane just adds fire to the swords, but I love it!!!! With the added fire, you can set enemies on fire after you slice them, and you can penetrate armor, how is that not awesome? In GOS, you also acquire a shield and a spear, which probably are my favorite weaponry to date. I could easily use some awesome combo to make short work of an enemy, but I'd much rather chuck my spear at him just for the heck of it. There are other cool combos you can pull of with the shield and spear, but I'll let you find out when you play ;)I'm not a big fan of using the Magic stuff in God of War games, but the nod goes to Chains of Olympus over Ghost of Sparta. The Magic if GOS never really caught my attention, I wasn't really impressed with any of it, and I rarely used it. But, in COO, I used this one Magic attack time and time again, even if I didn't need it. The best way I can describe it would be a giant genie looking thing that was made of fire and pounds on the ground engulfing everything around it in flames, so freakin cool! Hmmm, Thera's Bane, Fire genie thing, maybe I just like fire, who knew...Okay, the weaponry edge went to GOS, while the Magic went in favor of COO. So this could only mean one thing...This paragraph MUST be the tie breaker! For me, enemies and boss battles usually make or break a game. The enemies in both games were well balanced and well thought out. They were never too easy, but at the same time, they were never extremely hard or unnecessarily difficult *COUGHS prototype COUGHS* sorry, I have spring time allergies. There was also a nice variety of enemies in both of these games which meant I never got bored of fighting the same enemy types over and over again. The boss battles were as fun and epic as you would expect from a God of War game, no disappointment there. Since this is the tie breaker, I have to decide which game gave me the most enjoyment when it came to enemies/boss battles. My vote goes to....GOS. Don't get me wrong, COO had some epic battles, but I made this decision based on who COO DIDN'T have...Erinys. I know to some, Erinys is a non-factor in the God of War series, but she's my second favorite character in the entire franchise; second only to Hercules, so don't judge lol. If there are any other Erinys fans out there, you'll have an EPIC battle with her in GOS!I apologize for not mentioning graphics, story, etc. But that stuff is not super important to me, I just love these two games. If Amazon forced me to say something negative about the God of War Collection, I would come up empty. I usually have at least one slightly negative thing to say in the rest of my 5 star reviews, but this time guys, I have nothing. If you've played these games, you understand where I'm coming from. If you have not played these games, be careful because once you play them, you will have a higher standard set for any other action game you play afterwards.

There are some decent games to check out but there are so few of them and furthermore a pretty rigid lack of individual genres and types if you find yourself gravitating towards particular mobile games.  When the unit works, which isn't always and not quite 100% even when it does, it's a pretty decent controller.  Playing Dungeon Hunter with this is certainly better than not having a controller.  At the end of the day there are very few games, even lists of games combined, that the MOGA supports which I'm willing to pay for.On the other hand there are third party apps which supposedly unlock this as a more open controller.  I saw them, downloaded them, and tried to get them working for things like SNESDroid but alas I had no luck getting them to work.  I'm not including this for or against the unit's rating since it isn't really its intended use but it would certainly make me appreciate it more if I had a working (perhaps just easier to figure out) app that allowed me to generically map the MOGA as I see fit.

The best label for the gameplay is a cocktail that blends Pilotwings with Gran Turismo's license tests: Hurtling along preset paths, you must guide a vehicle through a precise series of jumps, swerves, and other hair-raising maneuvers. The requirements for success are unforgiving and demanding; if you lag behind even slightly or deviate from the path in the smallest way, it's stunt over, and you have to start again from the beginning (apparently, the directors of these films don't edit). As a result, this game is truly very hard, and the absence of difficulty levels or even checkpoints means no mercy for less-hardcore gamers looking for a break. Basically, Stuntman is about being perfect-and incessantly repeating a stunt until, at long last, you get it exactly right. Adding to the frustration, the game's physics sometimes feel wrong: Your car will often wreck in goofy, weird ways; fences that break in some places are impenetrable barriers in others; and the like.  If all that doesn't turn you off, bump the Fun Factor up to 4.0 because Stuntman deserves major props for its unique concept and thrilling stunts. The buzz of jumping a car over a moving train, whipping it past exploding gas stations, and then burning nitro to soar over a river just can't be denied. When you complete all the stunts for a film, you're rewarded with the trailer, which is a series of cinematics spliced with the stunts you performed-and that's just way cool. The game also supplies an awesome stunt constructor, which lets you create the craziest set of ramps, barriers, and obstacles you can conjure up, then attempt to survive it in the cars you've unlocked. Instead of that mode, though, what Stuntman badly needs is a practice mode where you could take your time and master the stunts. After all, don't real-life stuntman get to practice-or at least get a peek at a map-before the cameras roll? In the absence of those aids, your frustration will rapidly boil over as you struggle more to learn than to execute. In a delicious bit of irony, at one point a cinematic tells you that supercomputers have been used to model the precise speed you should hit a jump...but that speed is never revealed to you!  If you're the sort who likes to crack a tough nut, Stuntman has a pair cast in titanium. It's definitely not for everyone, but for the right gamer who can tolerate its flaws and appreciate its rigorous challenges, it's gold. If that's not you, rent it for a quick spin and check out its cool Driver 3 trailer.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2003"}

It is a basic yet refined RPG with enough twists and turns to keep you hooked. The character development is great and the games difficulty is just right.

{"product_name":"B00004UE0V","description":"Lewis Carroll's 19th-century fantasy has been reinvented many times, most famously by Walt Disney. And now American McGee, one of the designers behind theQuakeandDoomseries, issues his addition to the Looking Glass legends withAmerican McGee's Alice. Players take on the role of a wiser, more industrious heroine who sets out in this third-person 3-D action game to free Wonderland from the tyranny of the Queen of Hearts. Alice will confront a host of weird creatures in surreal settings and solve numerous puzzles through more than 15 levels of gameplay.","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"Wonders and Terrors","reviewText":"Poor, poor Alice. Your parents killed in a fire, you are now trapped in an insane asylum with only your madness to keep you company. Even your dreams of Wonderland have become corrupted by a fractured mind, old friends becoming terrifying menaces and familiar places now dank and mysterious. What was once a place of wonder now becomes a life-threatening journey into your own psychosis.Clever, wicked Alice, filled with malice, to bring all your new toys into Wonderland with you. From the simple knife (for hacking or throwing) to a lethal deck of cards to an explosive Jack-in-the-Box to the devastating Blunderbuss, the array of toys with which you defend yourself is simply delightful, in a dangerous sort of way. Your foes are many, and of a wide variety, including the brutish Card Guards, malevolent chess pieces, frightful Imps, a giant Mad Hatter, the twisted Jabberwock, and even the Red Queen herself. It's a good thing that you came to this new Wonderland prepared for some deadly play. There is much of it to be had.But, dear Alice, don't you know that all your old friends are here as well? There's the old Rabbit, of course, as obsessed as ever with his pocket watch and his tardiness. And the Caterpillar, who seems to have descended further into his own addictions. And even the dear Cheshire Cat is here, accompanying you on your journey always ready to offer his toothsome grin and a word of wry advice. Your friends may be a little more twisted, a little more frightening than before, but they're all still here. At first, anyway.This isn't the Wonderland you once knew, Alice. It has become beautiful and terrible in your absence. Once-peaceful landscapes are now frightening and treacherous, slightly maddening in their off-kilter perspective. Voices, once comforting and friendly, are now laced with a tone of threat and malice. Music, once sprightly, is strange and otherwordly. You must be constantly aware of your surroundings, as you can be suddenly attacked from almost anywhere.This is a fight for your sanity, Alice.  For your very life.  Be careful, be strong, be brave... and you may just escape this strange new Wonderland with your mind intact.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2004"}

The gameplay is bursting with innovation, which is very noticable after you play a while. The random battles are toned down from the original, making it easier to play through. The battle system is like no other RPG, but the learning cuvre is a little steep at times. Graphically, it is nice, although a little more detail would have helped. Framerate and animation are pretty good however. If you ever gets frustrated with typical RPGs (FINAL FANTASY X), you should try it. Even if you already own this on Dreamcast, the journey is magical enough to take again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Yemaya A.","summary":"Best Pokemon yet","reviewText":"Pokemon X&Y; is most definitely the best Pokemon game released to date. The amount of improvement: regarding graphics, content, IV training/breeding, and models & animations is incredible; especially after playing the Pokemon series since Generation I. New features, such as the revamped Exp. Share and the introduction of Mega-evolution (something I'd thought would be very stupid and gimmicky, but actually turned out to be a lot of fun) just make the game a great play-through.A big flaw that kept me from giving a 5-star rating is the game's terrible framerate issues. Even without 3D on, the animations in battle suffer from very choppy movement. Actually turning 3D on renders an almost unplayable framerate. Another minor (but very annoying) gripe I had is that the new mode for fast traveling--rollerskates--cannot be turned off and are automatically used whenever you use the circle pad to move.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2013"}
