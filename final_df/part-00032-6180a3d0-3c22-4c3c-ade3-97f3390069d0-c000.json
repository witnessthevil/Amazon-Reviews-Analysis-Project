Vanilla Levels","reviewText":"I completely agree with the previous reviewers point, where is Las Vegas in this game? My favorite levels in R6V1 were the casino levels, without that you would have just your typical generic shooter terrain and this is what we have in R6V2, there's absolutely no reason to have Vegas in the name. If you're going to have a \"sequel\" to an amazingly beautiful game like the first one don't let us all down in the same way GRAW2 really blew it with a short storyline and the generic terrain. I played the first one through many times, this one I don't see playing through more than twice so the value is just not there; like most sequels they get you with the first one and phone it in after that, don't pay full price for this game, you can get the first one for five dollars and get a much better game.The controls are the same as the first one, which worked so well so why change it?For me the customization is meaningless as I play single player only and to me seems a little tedious with the colors, etc. The weapons are all pretty much the same, one thing I didn't like was the locked weapons and the stupid points system to unlock them, please do this for online only where it makes sense.But what is with that, if you are a 3 man team saving the world you'll have any weapon you want from the start. It would make more sense to have the advanced weapons available at the more advanced difficulty settings and leave the points crap.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2008"}

{"product_name":"B006QRNKOO","description":"One of the most storied franchises in history soars to new heights. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword shakes up the tried-and-true adventure game formula and marks a turning point for the series. Link embarks on a sprawling adventure through the skies and across the continent when his childhood friend Zelda falls from their floating home in the sky beneath the clouds to the mysterious continent below. The introduction of full motion controls enabled by Wii MotionPlus technology synchronizes player movements with Link's actions while offering the most intuitive play control of any game in the series to date.","reviewerName":"Classic GameFan1991","summary":"An Otherwise Great Game Bombarded with Frustrating Motion Controls","reviewText":"Just like many other reviewers state the fact that they have been long time Zelda fans, I have also been a long time fan of the Zelda franchise for over 11 years, starting with the critically acclaimed Ocarina of Time title and have played nearly every Zelda game in the series from the original NES Zelda to Twilight Princess, and while I do like this game, I found the motion controls to be frustrating to say the least. Half the time when I swing the Wii Motion Plus remote one way, the sword either does not respond, or swings a different direction instead. Never once have I encountered such a frustrating problem with Nintendo's games, and I found the steps to configure the Wii Motion Plus remote to be very excessive just to play one game. If it asked for the remote to be configured once, and never have to do that again would be one thing, but of course that is not nearly as frustrating as having to consistently center the remote during gameplay when using the Beetle or dowsing tools.Yes, I understand that the above criticisms may be trivial to many, but I cannot see myself enjoying the game completely if I must spend half the time trying to correct technical errors that come across either from the lack of recognition when swinging the sword one direction, or the perception of the center being broken when using either the Beetle or the Dowsing tools. Sure, many people can prove that it works, but it is not always the case. I have also seen comments in reviews that disapprove of these types of reviews, but please do NOT misunderstand. I do not hate or even dislike this game by any means, I would certainly not take it to the extreme of being the \"worst\" Zelda game, because there are redeeming qualities such as save statues being conveniently placed after certain points, making it easy to return to that particular location when shutting off the game as opposed to starting from the entrance of the dungeon and being given a head start with six hearts, as opposed to the standard three.  I will say, however that one of my other minor gripes are that the main villain does not seem as intimidating as I would like for him to be, but of course that is merely a minor gripe, nothing to be incredibly disappointed about. One thing that bothers me, however are the rather disposable nature of the shields offered in the game. I cannot myself completely enjoying a Zelda game where you must either repair or replace your shields when they are hit enough.The story, of course is quite different from the other games, which I must bestow credit for, since a chance of pace once in a while is desirable.If one had curiosity about how the legend has begun, this game answers it, so that definitely settles the uncertainty of it. Overall, while I do exhibit great frustration over motion controls, having to constantly reconfigure it, and being greeted with a couple of \"Game Over\" screens due to the lack of response from the Wii Motion Plus remote I would still recommend trying this game for a different experience. I may not like this game as much as the earlier entries in the series, but it does have some redeeming qualities here and there, and Nintendo at least tried to provide a different experience, even though it could have been done better. I understand that many will strongly disagree with this review, but I am merely throwing my two cents in, and I apologize if I have offended any of my fellow Zelda fans in advance, and have a great day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2013"}

I figured we'd see a whole slew of 2-D fighters, like Street Fighter-Guilty Gear and the like, swamp the system as it's geared toward 2-D gameplay because of it's processing limitations. When I saw Tekken Advance in action, I was simply amazed. I don't know how Namco managed to do it but they produced a game that looks and plays like Tekken and I love it. Sure, the control scheme is a bit different and the move sets have been scaled down a bit but this game is, definitely, Tekken. This game, for better or worse, is a scaled down version of Tekken 3. While notables like Eddy and Lei are absent, the rest of the cast is there. In this version, Heihachi serves as the game's boss. Aside from the arcade mode, the game also features a link-cable versus, time attack, survival, tag battle, versus tag battle, and practice mode.My only gripes with the game is that there is only one unlockable character in the game and, once you finish the game, there's no ending story, pictures or nothing.

One of the games didn't stand out much for the fact that not very many copies were sold, but it quickly rose to become a cult classic.  It was among the first of its kind and generated sequels and spin-offs that would please many gamers around the world.  His name: Mega Man.THE GOODThe graphics were ahead of their time and this is one of the few instances where an early game reaches the potential of the system.  The music was also very well written and many of the tunes stood out including Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman.  This was one of the first games to define the \"platform\" genre (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was around the same time as well).  Of course, it's fun.  I noticed many Mega Man gamers tend to dismiss this one because \"it was raw\" and/or \"it was too hard.\"  Bah.  I enjoyed the difficulty level and I like this game over Mega Mans 5-8 anyhow (not that they were terrible, mind you).  The ending was also pretty good considering no dialogue is spoken.THE BADIn this game, when you're flashing and you hit spikes, you still die.  This was changed in later entries.  Also, there is no password system to save your game, so you'd have to start from scratch every time.  Oh, and did you remember the game box's cover?  Weird.  Still, this is Mega Man in its raw form and should be reviewed lightly.OVERALLWhat can I say?  The Mega Man series is a great one and this is the one that started the whole thing.  I loved the old school feeling this game has and the fact that it's among the hardest in the series.  This is a hidden gem, folks; it's rare, but I highly suggest you hunting down this game for your NES.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2003"}

I didn't begin playing it until around December so I'll tell you my experiences since then.  Everyone can agree that while the single player mode is EPIC, it is definitely \"short\" by a lot of standards.  While the storylines are a lot more ridiculous than the first COD MW, I thought it was much more exciting, challenging, and more fun to play this time around.  If you're one of those people who are afraid to play online for fear of being dominated by \"kids with voice changers\", then do yourself a favor and simply rent the game and play the story mode one time through.  The cost of admission for this game really is the multiplayer mode which is the DEFINITIVE experience............. if you're playing on XBOX 360.  Anybody who's played the multiplayer mode on PS3 knows how it goes; laggy matches, problems connecting, and always getting dropped. This is because PSN and IW fail to get any \"dedicated servers\" to accommodate the enormous demand for this game.  They hired a third party company to run the multiplayer mode on PS3, which has been a complete failure thus far.  This is a direct contrast to the XBOX 360 experience as Microsoft runs their own servers A LA Xbox Live. While you have to pay to play on Xbox Live, it's definitely worth it as Microsoft seems to run a better ship when it comes to online play than PSN which is free and is lacking as a result. My advice is if you're a serious FPS multiplayer, your best bet is the XBOX 360 edition and definitely not the PS3. If you insist on playing with a PS3, like me, make sure you're pluged into a hard ethernet connection and NOT wireless, make sure you have adquate internet (High speed Cable preferably), and don't get your hopes up too much.The game itself really is amazing; IW did a great job with the detail, graphics, attention to detail, voice acting, story, etc.  Although I don't think you need me to tell you that, so let my review be mainly about the online play.The times I have been able to play without fail, I had a BLAST.SUMMARY:1) The single player is epic, but short.2) Buy this game only if you want to play Multiplayer3) Remember the PS3 edition has NO dedicated servers and your online experience will suffer as a result4) Hard ethernet connection + High Speed internet required for online play5) The online play is A LOT better on XBOX 360, even though you must pay.6) Do not buy the game thinking you'll be able to play online whenever you please, as you will undoubtedly run into problems with this edition.7) Worth the money ONLY if you can get an adequate online experience as it is definitely worth the money when things are working flawlessly.8) Don't get your hopes up that IW and PSN will fix things anytime soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2010"}

For one the visuals are quite out dated, this game was being developed back when they were still making PS2 games, and was suppose to be released for it but was cancelled. You can clearly see why. It's almost as if the game has been sitting somewhere for the last 5 years and they just now said ok, lets release it. The voice acting is very bad, and they try to hard to emulate Bill Paxton, and Michael Beihn, and overall the dialogue is well, just very corny. The controls are a mess, like a lot of SEGA games, and doesn't play nearly as well as games like Condemned 1 and 2. The atmosphere is pretty good, but overall the scares are minimal and the aliens just seem to go through the motions and not be very smart. Late last night i rented this from the Red Box, i was pretty shocked to see it in there, but then again this game was never really hyped that much, because i think people knew it would be a bad game. Aiming is also a mess and there is more recoil than any of the MW or Battlefield games, not accurate at all. And even on easy the game is very tough. At first years ago after hearing about the game i welcomed it, because i loved the second Aliens film. Well if you want more thrills just go back and watch the movie. Which this game attempts to mimic, but not very well at all. That's all i have to say about it. You'll find out after playing for just a few short hours.

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Stylish and Disgustingly brutal","reviewText":"I played Call of Duty 2 and was given a great WWII game in the same general vein as Medal of Honor---that is, a PG-13/Moderate R type war with an emphasis on glory and America Eff Yeah glory.World at War is far more like a pulp comic take on it, but without the sleaze associated with such genres.Gore is a major factor now, including such heinously realistic things as mounted machine guns severing limbs, blood is up in your face, and stuff gets sickeningly real very quickly all around.My main disappointment with the storyline was variety.  As usual, you're Americans and you're Russians.  That's it.  That's pretty much how it's always been in Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, everything.  Lack of variety is more than made up for with sheer depth, grit, and style executed in the campaigns.The American campaign does something never really done in any WW2 FPS game I've played---the Japanese.  The entire campaign involves the Pacific Campaign, so you can go back to Call of Duty 2 if you want to M1 Garand Nazis instead of Imperials.The Nazis were pretty sick in terms of warfare ability, but the Japanese bring a whole new level of warfare to this game that makes it less \"AMERICA EFF YEAH!\" gloryhounding like we're used to in old games, and more \"If I hear 'BANZAI' one more time, I'm going to throw all my grenades all around me and shoot everythign that moves before I totally lose my mind!\"This is in no way a bad thing, implying certain aspects are overused---it's simply a display that these methods are so gorgeously executed---to be walking into an area of tall-grass, hear the shout \"BANZAAAAIII!\" and see three or four Japanese in perfect camouflage emerge and rush at you and your comrades.  And this is no triggered spawning---they are lying in wait from the very start.  I've had one instance where my stupidity lead me along an odd path, and I ended up right behind a Japanese soldier just laying there.  I decided it would be a good idea to shoot him with my pistol, ended up completely missing, and he got up and lunged at me.Fighting the Japanese is a horrifyingly brutal ordeal, not merely where \"Banzai\" forces will appear so frequently, but where snipers will climb up into trees and fire at you, or emerge from trap-doors right beneath you, or any number of guerrilla-type tactics.  One long-winded mission segment is entirely just clearing out ONE tunnel complex at Iwo Jima, which goes along perfectly with movies like \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\", and is total hell upon the psyche.As was the case with Call of Duty 4, and which I think I may have mentioned in my review for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, this game has a big moment within it, a \"HOLY S***\" moment that really changes the scope of the game.  For this game, they are likely a matter of opinion, but for me each campaign had at least one.  The biggest one in the American campaign was playing as a gunner for a fighter plane/bomber thing.  Your mission is essentially solely reconnaissance, then engaging a trade fleet that reveals itself as Japanese, then you must answer a distress call, where an American naval detachment is attacked by Japanese ships and air units.There's interactive sequences where you must shoot Japanese gunboats and destroy them, in order to reach out and pull American sailors and soldiers out of the water onto your plane.  The HS moment comes when Kamikaze planes begin attacking, and Zeroes attack your plane---and you run out of ammo.  And in a perfectly placed slow-motion moment, where a wing of Japanese planes prepare to strafe you, and your gun clicks empty, American Corsairs arrive at just that moment to shoot them down and save you.  Tears were in my eyes.Then there's the Soviet campaign.  Maybe there's a difference between this and the campaign in Call of Duty 2, or maybe it was just Gary Oldman's epic scenery-chewing Hamming of Sergeant Reznov, but this campaign, for its moment in time, made me a cold-blooded, Nazi-hating Soviet.I hated the introduction, which was a complete and total 99% ripoff of \"Enemy at the Gates\", where Danilov meets Vassili in the dry fountain, hiding among Soviet bodies, trying to avoid being shot by Nazis shooting the corpses to ensure they're dead, then using the cover of Luftwaffe planes flying overhead to mask your sniper shots, and even an overly-long, gamebreaking duel with a German sniper, which due to my playing on Veteran mode, got me killed several dozen times due to its sheer facepalming, wallbanging difficulty that went beyond \"Boy that was a challenge\" and into the realm of throwing controllers into television screens.The rest of the campaign goes from escaping Nazi attacks in the Battle of Stalingrad, then quickly jumping ahead a few years, and taking the war into Germany itself.  I would absolutely never condone this in a video game already so grittily real, but I still at least feel relieved that there is no depiction or even mention of the sheer violence perpetrated by Soviet soldiers on German civilians, along with the huge amount of raping of German women.  Same way around with German soldiers on Russian civilians.The HS moment for the Soviet campaign, for me, was emerging from a complex in Germany, running out into the open, and fighting our way down a street with dozens of Soviet soldiers and a tank plowing through ranks of Nazis.  The thunderous, bleak metal soundtrack with the braying shouts of Sergeant Reznov were simply overwhelming, and the very real depiction and realization of literally fighting for every yard of ground coming into place was a massacre on the senses in the best possible way.To my delight and pleasure, each mission is preceded by an animation in the exact same style as the introductory animation in the movie \"The Kingdom\" briefly detailing the history of Saudi Arabia.  It is beautiful and brilliant, but they clearly run out of ideas later on as rather than nifty transitions and transformations, we merely get pictures and video clips.For the rest of the game, the multiplayer is satisfying, but ultimately merely a clone of Call of Duty 4's multiplayer, with WW2 weapons attached, and a few new neat perks and additions to the system.  The most disappointing aspect here was that, just like CoD4, there were standardized weapon classes and customizable ones, in which EVERY WEAPONS is available, or ready upon being unlocked.  This means a battle between Japanese and Americans would be utterly indistinguishable as Japanese soldiers use Soviet machine guns, Nazi rifles, and American grenades, while American soldiers... use exactly the same things, mixed up arbitrarily.But the game creators brilliantly came up with something to keep people coming back to it, even as they move on to Modern Warfare 2---Zombies!!!Unless you buy new maps, you only get one Zombie map, though.  It's great fun, and something that must be experienced.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2009"}

However, this has to be the best gaming peripheral I have ever owned. I will go into detail about the niggly little things later on. For now lets cover how incredible this wheel system is for driving games.I have used this on a PS3 slim. Prior to this I had only drivenDirt 2&Need for Speed: Shiftby using myPlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller. This often had me tapping the turn motion on one of the joysticks. This left alot to be desired if you were doing a slow left or right turn at speed it often caused the rear end to break loose and eventually I lost momentum or worse wrecked.I am no stranger to the motto right tool for the right job. Back in the 80's I used to do flight sims on my pc with the keyboard. I dont know of too many pilots that fly that way so eventually I purchased a Yolk or joystick for fighter games. I knew a wheel would improve my driving because we drive that way it is a natural movement for us to achieve. I have used countless plastic wheels for driving games in the past. I had not however, used on on my PS3 because I just got it in September.Now, just with everything quality counts. You can get a flimsy plastic wheel that will probably perform very close to this setup. You will not however get the amazing force feedback or leather covered wheel, tight shifter and more that makes this wheel stand hands above any I have ever used.Force Feedback rocks:I used to have one of the old Force Feedback joysticks from Microsoft back in the 90's. I could always out-strength it whenever I was pulling some maneuver somewhere. What is so awesome about the feedback here is it is really sensitive,yet at the same time very strong. Ill give you an example. When going into a turn it fights you like a real car will, ok I expected that. What I didnt expect is when airborne in a corner (like in Dirt 2) the wheel goes limp, like the wheels are actually off the ground and I have no resistance to turn. THAT IS FANTASTIC!When playing with the standard controller I always played from a car down view like I was driving a remote controlled car. Now I always play in cockpit view. It has totally reinvigorated the way I play my driving games.Now to the naggy stuff;Cords- 4 to be exact that need to be run somewhere and often get all mixed up.USB only, I really wish this had Bluetooth built in, might be worth a few more bucks to not have to sit on top of my television due to the shortish USB cord.Dont see the point in the manual shifter, but it is a nice addition for if you like to shift that way. Most of the games I play don't use it so I wish I could ignore it all together but all of the PS3 buttons are on it.Tips for ownership:I am only reviewing this for PS3, The buttons above the shifter are (your X triangle and so on) the buttons below are your left side D pad buttons. The red buttons underneath are your start- select.I have not found out what all the little ones on the steering wheel are for.IMPORTANT: Do not have any controller set to #1 when you plug this in. The PS3 will assign it to number 2 and it will not work in any game. To be honest I often restarted the PS3 to get it to take the wheel as controller 1.Pros:>> Very high quality>> Accurate Feel>> Adaptive force feedback>> Brings old driving games back to lifeCons:&lt;&lt; Cords - too many and the one that you need most is too short (USB)&lt;&lt; USB only (Fine for PC but annoying for PS3).&lt;&lt; Complicated to move once its in place. Might have to buy a table specifically built for it.Summary:Overall this is a TOP NOTCH accessory for your driving games. It will bring new life into all of your driving games. I recommend restarting them all at the beginning because you will suck once you start over with this new toy.Thank you for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2009"}

It was a big disappointment then when I found it nearly impossible to connect to an online game of any kind.  Motorstorm, Resistance, both work fine with my internet connect and router, but this game had some major compatibility issues.It doesn't affect everyone, but there are quite a few people with these problems, if the Playstation forums are any indication.  Fixing it may require tinkering with a number of router settings, or there may be no fix at all, depending on which version of the PS3 you have.Personally, I'll be exchanging this game as soon as I've beat the single player.

{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Solid game could use some polishing","reviewText":"I'm only about ten or twelve hours into this game but its great fun so far. The setting is a great idea and a very nice twist on a WWII game and on a sandbox game. Its great fun. There is a LOT to do and you'll have a blast doing it--literally.Since the fun parts are probably detailed elsewhere, I will mention a few of the drawbacks that could use some polishing.1. Climbing. Its nice that you can climb virtually anything in the game, but after being spoiled with Assassin's Creed 2, I was hoping for a smoother system in the Saboteur. Although you can climb anything, its slow and clumsy because you have to keep pushing the A button each time you grab another handhold. So you can't just grab onto a wall and climb up quickly, there is a lot of button pushing to do it.2. Brawling. There are a lot of nice options for hand to hand combat for a sandbox game, but they can be pretty clunky. A lot of times when you go for a stealth kill, it never gives you the cue to activate it and the guard will turn around and see you. There is also no targeting system for hand to hand combat, so its hard to pick a specific enemy, should you need to.3. The driving controls, although solid, do feel a little dated.But don't let any of these things put you off, this is a great game. There is something to blow up on almost every street corner, and that is no joke. Earning money can be a bit slow at first, but there is a fantastic variety of stuff to spend you hard earned cash on, so get in there and give it to those Nazis!!!

{"product_name":"B003S2OOC2","description":"","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"Surprisingly deep combat, unsiprisngly shallow everything else","reviewText":"I'm an old school wrestling fan. I was pre-teen during Hulkamania and had lost touch with wrestling until the late 90's during the Rock/Stone Cold era. Since their retirement, I haven't watched much at all. WWF All Stars (it's always going to be WWF for me) reminded my of the arcade cabinets back in the late 80's and doesn't dissapoint in delivering and awesome arcade experience.\"Path of Champions\" mode is a simple 10 match story mode with 3 different versions. In theory, you can play all three modes with one character and unlock 3 costumes (among other things).  \"Fantasy Warfare\" challenges are awesome. Not so much for the matches, but the video mash ups that pit a legend against a current performer. Watching these videos, even if just for the nostalgia are really great. There is also online, that I haven't really got into and local multiplayer for up to 4 people that is very fun.The graphics are cartoony, in fact better animated than the cartoon show back in the 80's. It's definately a comic book approach and it animates and runs flawlessly. This is a total arcade brawler with absurd moves and stunts. It's a great looking game for sure.The mechanics are surprisingly deep, but easy to pick up. There are reversals and counter reversals that frankly, I could never pull off in other wrestling games, but are simpler here. There are two attack and two grapple buttons. Once you've grappled, you can hit any face button to perform a move. Super moves are easily executed (and blocked if timed poorly) and finishers are also simple to pull off (and also easily blocked). Button smashing will get things done, but there are a lot of moves that can be accomplished depending on your class type or postioning in the ring. It really feels like an arcade style fighter with wrestling characters, easy to play, difficult to master.There are some negatives. There is no video library in extras to watch the videos you've unlocked in Fantasy Warfare, which is dissapointing. The create a wrestler feature is okay, but not great. There is no story or career mode, so even after you create a character, there's really no reason to use him except against friends or online opponents. And even then, you're just assigning a move set. There is no XP or points spent in different catagories. Just \"brawler\" with HHH's move set and the Rock's finisher. There are also a lot of recent WWF stars missing (due to contracts with other brands no doubt). It would have been nice to see Rick Flair in his prime, Kurt Angle, some of the ECW guys that have all drifted to TNA recently. Even still, the roster is awesome and the DLC character list is deep (hopefully not too expensive).From a technical standpoint. Get ready for a lot of load times. When you boot up, the game \"caches memory\" for 3-5 minutes. You're then treated to a loading screen for another 1-2 minutes. If you back out from the main menu to the total screen, you inexplicably get the loading screen for 1-2 minutes again. On path of champions, it loads to start, you get a cut scene, loads again, you get ring entrances and loads again into the match. Terrible. An install option would have been nice to streamline some of that. Fortunately matches are 5+ minutes most of the time, so once you're in game, you play for a while.There are a lot of characters that all have varying move sets (some are repeated) and it will take a bit of time to unlock everything. At the same time, like any fighter, unless you are going to play with friends and online a lot, the replay is limited. Even with those issues, it is still a terrific game if you're not a hardcore wrestling GAME fanatic and are just looking for a pick up and play brawler that takes you down Nostalgia Lane.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"R.Suarez \"R-Suarez-\"","summary":"Almost impeccable","reviewText":"The new Prince of Persia arrives for the next-gen consoles in an almost impeccable release.In my opinion, the team from Ubisoft made the right move when deciding to give the series a fresh start; this is a new story for a new prince. The plot however is in the same grounds as the ones for the previous works, there's a demon that has been set loose and the prince gets involved and has to help Elika to put him back to rest. The story, as it unfolds with Elika's flashbacks, only gets more interesting as you advance in the game, as usual with the PoP games, expect an epic story with twists and a surprising ending. I am already looking forward for the sequel!The graphics are stunning; actually all the cinema displays were made using the in game graphics, which gives you an idea of the quality of them. The \"artistic style\" Ubisoft developed is beautiful, every scene of the game looks as if you were watching the artistic concepts for the game.  Playability is also great, if you've played Ninja Gaiden Sigma, well the acrobatics that were added to the prince made me feel like controlling Ryu Hayabusa, which is definitely a good thing. While I had my doubts about the Elika character I ended up liking her a lot, she is indeed a great addition to the saga and the playability of the game, many of the new challenges in this game come from using her ability to control the color plates and combining them to reach further levels, the fact that you can talk to her at any time during the game is also great; you can learn from her, from the story or even joke around. She is definitely one of the best A.I. characters I've seen in a video game. On the other hand, as much as I fell in love with Elika, the fact that she helps you so you cannot die takes away some of the difficulty in the game, to give you a better idea, think of Elika as the dagger of time on steroids... you actually cannot die during the game.The boss battles are just as promised, you don't fight  groups of enemies but fight them on a one by one basis, the cinemas and action during the fights are incredible, even though you have to face the same enemy in their lairs several times, each fight is unique and the difficulty level and their abilities increase every time.Replay Value?Unless you are the kind of gamer who likes to collect all the trophies you can get on a game, there is little replay value. During the game you have to collect `light seeds', there is a total of 1001 so there's a challenge. Important to note that if you complete the game and start a new one you start from scratch, `light seeds' from a completed game do not carry into a new one.Finishing the game unlocks an extra skin for Elika. The limited edition also allows you to unblock 2 more skins from the \"Sands of time\" game; though this is not exclusive to the limited edition as the codes are already on the web and can be used on any copy.Limited EditionOn a side note, I preordered the game and got the so called `limited edition' which is basically the regular game in a carton box with a different cover that includes a BD with an 11 minute documentary on the making of the game (you read correctly, 11 min.) The hint and art books included are digital and have to be viewed as a BD; the same goes for the soundtrack, which is pretty lame as if you want to listen to it you have to stare at a screen cap on screen while the music plays. I expected a separate CD with the soundtrack so this was a little bit disappointing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2008"}

Yes, it's been thatlong.  So far after playing this for about a week, it almost feels like this is the system we should have gotten last generation and that could be a good thing or a bad thing.Setting it upAside from the lengthy download and patch that you have todo to get it functioning, setup was done in a relativelyshort time.  It's a shame however that Nintendodidn't include a demo disk to give us something to tideover after plunking down between 300 to 350 bucks for thesystem and the one or 2 games for it. Syncing the GamePadwas a breeze and getting on the internet was no problem butagain, it's that patch that you have to do that will takethe air out of your sails. My advice is this, if you want toplay and not pressed about playing online, start thedownload when you are planning on going to sleep or doingsomething else.Graphically speaking...how is it?This is the question that when time goes on is going toreally make or break this system. Nintendo as always hasdone its own thing and not since the 16 bit wars has itreally `tried' to keep up with the Joneses as far astechnology and graphics.  The Wii's claim to fame wasthe motion control and the ease of use it allowed casual andnew users which is why it sold like gangbusters for the past5 or so years. But the biggest hindrance that hardcoregamers complained about was that it was graphically inferiorto Microsoft's and Sony's offerings.  But with thissystem, it's now catching up so to speak but at what cost?With both Microsoft and Sony having yet to make any officialannouncement about what they plan on introducing it's notelling if the Wii U will either lead of fall behind oncethey introduce their new game systems.  For nowhowever, most of the games I have either played or seendemoed are on par or just slightly ahead ofwhat's already out and part of that has to do with thefact that many of the launch games are ports of games thatare on other systems.  FIFA 13 runs a bit smoother andless jaggy on the Wii U, Assassin's Creed III is prettygood but sometimes suffers from framerate loss however,there is a way to play it in 3D on the gamepad. New SuperMario Brothers looks very good for a platformer but thenwhat do you expect? Graphically speaking, the Wii U is onpar with what's out now but because this is updatedhardware, the question on everybody's mind will be how farcan they push it and stay in competition?Is the GamePad really innovative?Your miles may vary with this one. The GamePad is what willsell people on whether or not they should get the Wii U. TheGamePad in some games acts as a HUD or extra inventoryscreen and it's gimmicky for some games and very intuitivefor others. But the big seller is the idea of being able toplay games on the GamePad and not always have to be on theTV.  It's really great in executionprovided a few caveats.  One is that you can onlytravel so far from the system itself because the systemworks off of Bluetooth technology so your range depending onyour home and the amount of interference can range between15 to 50 feet. After doing some rearranging around in myhouse, I can place the Wii U in the basement and play in mybedroom on the 2nd floor with zero lag. The other caveat isthat there are no original Wii games that are playable onthe GamePad, especially if those games required the motioncontrols so for anyone that thought about playing thelast Wii Zelda game, nope...you are SOL.  The lastcaveat is the battery life.  You will be lucky to getbetween 2 to 3 hours on it so I would advise keeping thecharger nearby.  Overall, the GamePad is a greatinnovation and in many ways is giving gamers what theythought they were going to get from the PS3 and the PS Vitain Remote play possibilities. Also let's not forget thatyou can watch Hulu Plus and Netflix on the screen as well asuse this pad as a TV remoteWhat about launch titles?If you are a Mario fan then New Super Mario Brothers is a nobrainer, Batman fans who already finished Arkham City onother consoles may want to pass on this but may still wantto check out Assassin's Creed III.  Call of DutyBlack Ops I hear is good but servers are relativelyempty,  FIFA 13 is good only if you haven't picked itup on the other consoles where as this version I wouldstrongly suggest that you pass on.  As it has a niceManager mode lite added in the game, it's really missing alot of what is making 13 such a big buy.  But right now, Assasin's Creed III and Darksiders II are the games to get.What is on your wishlist?So far, the Wii U is off to a good start.  Not greatjust good.  A few good ports and a Mario game will really help sell the system this season but as far as later down the road, I am hoping that Nintendo gets something as epic and expensive as Skyrim to take advantage of the GamePad.  The other item I am looking forward to is hopefully being ableto play some backwards compatible games on the GamePad as well. I am also curious as to how far Nintendo can expand on the remote play aspect of the GamePad. While it's only limited by distance right now, I wonder if there is a possibility of being able to take it with you on trips away from home?  Also looking at some of the launch titles such as ZombieU and Assassins' Creed III tells me that Nintendo is looking to cash in on all audiences and I am hoping that this keeps up as well since games like GTA V and Bioshock Infinite are set to be released in the near future.So overall...The Wii U has a lot of potential that hopefully getsrealized sooner than later.  One can't help butwonder if Nintendo is opening the salvo for the next gen ofconsole gaming or extending the current one as Microsoft norSony are not showing their hand yet.  If you are likeme and haven't bought a Nintendo machine in a while thismay be worth looking into especially for the GamePad.Some of the games are worth getting if you haven't playedthem already but the biggest selling point of course is theremote play, so if you get lucky and can find one forChristmas, you aren't making a bad purchase just hope thatNintendo supports this system in a far better way than Sonysupported the PS Vita","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}

Best part here is most of these powers are upgradable giving this game an RPG type characteristics and promoting the player to complete more missions and get more pointsACCESS TO WEAPONS AND VEHICLES: Other than powers described above, you also have access to military weapons such as rifles and rocket launchers and vehicles such as armored tank and fighter chopper. Like your powers, you can also upgrade your skills to use these weapons and vehicles effectively.CUTSCENES ARE SPECTACULAR: I can't say much without spoiling here, but cutscenes are nicely designed and are fun to watch.DECENT VARIETY IN MISSIONS: Different missions will require you to use different powers and skills differently making them interesting. Majority (~60%) of the story missions are well designed and will keep you engaged.GREAT FREE ROAMING EXPERIENCE: I love how you can roam around the town and massacre enemies with different powers. For such experience, I can't think of any other game.CONS.STORY IS RATHER WEAK: You get to see most of the story by completing main missions and remainder of the story by absorbing targeted individuals. While it has some shocking suspense, the story is portrayed rather abruptly and if you don't absorb some people at the right time, you can be really confused what the hell is going on.ABSORBING ENEMIES IS PAIN IN THE A$$: At first it feels cool, but after 2 hours, it becomes horribly redundant. The major way you can replenish your energy is by absorbing enemies and by the time you finish the game, you will hate absorbing the enemies over and over and over again. Also for some reason, every time you die, it only replenish half of your health, the rest you have to gain by absorbing a single enemy at a time.ENEMIES LACK VARIETY: Your enemies are military personals and vehicles; infected humans and superhumans. While it is initially fun massacring them, after about 4-6 hours, it becomes terribly boring face them over and over and over again.BOSSES ARE HORRIBLE: This is my biggest complain. They give you so many awesome powers; however, other than one particular boss, I found rest of the boss fights really dull. A lot of these bosses will have you fight the same enemies over and over again. JUST TERRIBLE.SOME MISSIONS ARE JUST HORRIBLE: Later on in the game, there are few missions that will make this experience very miserable. A good example is you have to destroy certain machines in later on mission. These machines are in an area covered with deadly gas and under strict military surveillance. It took me a long while just to distinguish these machines from other structures in the area and afterwards it took me a while to destroy them thanks to aiming system in this game. There are other missions similar to this that will get you confused.THE LOCK ON SYSTEM IN POORLY DESIGNED: Using different military vehicles is great; however, it is difficult to lock on certain targets with these vehicles thanks to poor lock on system in this game. Right analogue stick is used for both changing targets and changing camera view making lock on very difficult. A good example is the mission I described in the above con.THE GAME HAS GLITCHES: It truly breaks my heart to say this, but I encountered terrible glitches. You are capable of using one offensive and one defensive power at the same time. I am fighting the final boss and what happens?? I can't first use any of them. I die. Afterwards I can only use one power (either offensive or defensive) at a time. And when I use defensive power, I can't use the offensive one. I tried turning on/off system, restarting from previous check point, nothing fixed the glitch. While I was still able to finish the game with this glitch, it made things terribly difficult. JUST TERRIBLE.All and all for what this game allows you to do (powers and vehicles), it is a great game; however, its flaws prevents it from being enjoyable at times. I think they had great concept in mind, but failed to execute it properly. However, if you are bored and feel like just free roaming in an open world and massacring enemies, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.As for Prototype vs Infamous, INFAMOUS ALL THE WAY. Why?

{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"Alex Gomez","summary":"Seller shipped it in a timely manner.

We last saw Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 2 - a rookie cop in Raccoon City, fighting to stay alive. That was six years ago. Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","summary":"One of the Greatest Hits of Resident Evil","reviewText":"Okay, I did not play the Gamecube version, the PS2 version was my first interaction with this game. Before this title in the series, I had played the first three games in reverse order. 3, 2, 1... And after that, I still prefer Resident Evil 2. But this game is really, really good. Now for people that played the first 3, this is very different. In fact, it made me mad at first.Gone are zombies. No zombies in this Spanish village. These are head-tentical-crab-brain folk, possessed by an ancient parasite. So... it has VERY little to do with the old games. But we get a return by Resident Evil 2 star, Leon S. Kenedy. Sure he looks like he's in a boy band, and maybe swallowing pills by the look of those circles under his eyes, but he's a government agent now, and they do that stuff...But I digress. The PS2 version, I hear, is graphically inferior to the Gamecube version. I would not know. I played the Xbox 360 version recently and compared the two. There are some big differences, but the only thing I was telling myself was \"Wow, they did a good job on the PS2 version!\" The PS2 version cut corners, the hardware would not support the software, but it did so beautifully. If you don't have a 360 and have a PS2, then this is worth the ten bucks for a used copy. YOu don't have to worry about pesky DLC, additional levels, multiplayer jerks, or any of that garbage drawn in the latest generation consoles.As much as I rip on it, the game is good on it's own merit. No, I do not consider Resident Evil 4 or 5 part of the Resident Evil series. They went in a completely different direction, albeit refreshing, and changed the game completely. But this is rich with content, unlockables, and an intricate story. It's not the best story, but it is more involved than most. The enemies are diverse, the weapons are plenty, and the combat is smooth once you get used to it.But if you like killing zombies, the slow moving groaning dead, then you are out of luck. If you want zombies, go get a newer generation console and play Left 4 Dead, Dead Rising, or Dead Island. If you want this fun game, play this. This is a golden title in my collection that was unfortunate enough to have to compare to the greatness of Resident Evil 2. Is it as good as RE2? In my humble opinion, no. To many, this game is a slice of pizza flavored gold and worth every penny.Me, I'm sticking to my zombie games. This was fun in 2005-6, and worth the money spent for the HOURS of entertainment, but now I tire of it. I purchased the HD remake for Xbox 360 because my brother loved it and wanted a nostalgic playthrough, he ended up plugging the old PS2 up and playing it with that controller instead... go figure...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

This isn't the \"wrist\" motion tennis that you get from the wii or the laggy kinect. This is accurate and realistic motion! When I use this controller with Sports Champions, the 1:1 motion with games like table tennis is amazing and feels like I am actually playing real table tennis. I was completely shocked how well this motion controller reacted with the game. And with shooting games like House of the Dead: Overkill Extended Edition, it works perfectly. Calibrating is very easy to do. And if people are having aiming issues, they aren't calibrating it correctly or they have moved away from the calibrated point (for example... they may have accidentally moved a couple feet to the side during gameplay). With Sports Champions, you literally have to take steps forward and back so it is ok to move all around. However with shooting games, it is less forgiving as you can't move around too much from the calibrated point. It also has nice vibration and feels comfortable in the hand and feels like high quality like ps3 dual shock controller. No cheap plastic feeling at all. I do recommend the playstation move and this motion controller. And there are plenty of move games coming out soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2012"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"ice grizzly \"Grrrrrr\"","summary":"Lara is back in glorious HD","reviewText":"If you have played Legend on PS2 and loved it... this one is all for you.

Lara is now casted by a different British model and all the animations are motion captured. The game difficulty is perfect this time. So far I liked how well it is paced. Lara also carries a PDA that can be used to solve puzzles. No random color matching puzzles, every thing is very organic. The game mainly stress on puzzles and platforming. Combat is mainly there as a diversion. You can always get away with a slow motion head shot.The game does lack the level of polish. There are frame rate issues, my main complaint is the camera. The textures and polygons doesnt map one to one in some tricky locations. Technically it could have used some time more backing time. But what we have is amazing. If you like adventure, puzzles atleast give it a rent. It is very entertaining.This game is a eye candy for sure with south Asian beaches and snowy artic caves.

The inventive story lines, the diverse environments, and engaging characters made this one of the most compelling offerings on the PS3.That said, I was somewhat disappointed with this iteration. The story is just as magical, and the character backstory adds a level of richness to an already strong plotline. And the humor flows strong and well, with a lot of it centered around references to events in previous games.However this time around the game plays almost by autopilot. Most of the story is told via cutscenes, and the gamer contolled bits feel almost like interruptions in this world. This, IMHO, is the biggest pity.Another downside is that the boss villain is nowhere as vicious and menacing as before, with barely a role even in the climactic sequence.

Once again the production values will blow you away.  This is definitely more of the same great gameplay that we've come to expect from the series, which is a good thing in my opinion.  The story is very good overall, but I don't think that it was told as well as it could have been told.  The first third of the game was a little boring and very weird to me.  But then the game picks up after that and there you will see the greatest moments of the entire series.  Also, I guarantee that when you see the graphics of the desert part until the end, they will be the best looking graphics you have ever seen in a video game.As for the multiplayer, it is as great as Uncharted 2's.  I put about 40-50 hours into Uncharted 2's multiplayer, even though I thought that it was sort of tacked on.  Despite that, I still found it immensely fun even though I'm not a huge multiplayer fan.  In Uncharted 3, there are the same great mechanics of U2's, but there is so much more customization and production values put into it this time.  I especially loved the maps where you start off on moving trains or cars, then the map changes into the traditional map midway through.  Overall, Uncharted 3's MP is awesome!I had no doubts that Naughty Dog would overdeliver, and that's what Uncharted 3 did.  I really think that it's pointless to compare it to the predecessors or to pick which one is the best, because they are all so amazing.  Why not just enjoy each game for what it is?

I like this Halo quite a bit, although I have to admit that i found the first 2 chapters somewhat boring. It takes off and gets pretty exciting by the time you hit chapter 3 or 4.Their are even more weapon and vehicle options than the previous Halo's.  You can team up with AI which can also be killed by the Covenant.Their are no Flood enemies in this game, as it takes place chronologically before the Halo trilogy.I personally have been having trouble joining a xbox live coop campaign game, and when I say trouble I mean I have not been able to do this at all. I did read online that people who own the 4g console have this issue for some reason, although I'm not sure why.  I did buy a HD and it is in my Xbox.If I had any criticisms it would be the cartoonish art. It is not overly so, but it does not compare to Gears of War 3, or Modern Warefare 3 in terms of art.  It is still very good however, especially the background and landscapes which are beautifull.This is a game you won't regret buying if you like sci-fi's, shooters, or both. I see around 100k people playing it online still.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2012"}

I usage only use a joystick for flight sims, etc. But I happied to have a olf FX Hammerhead game pad giving to me that happened to have the USB gameport adapter on it and played around with it and found I liked it. It has more buttons on it but the basic layout is the same. I noted that a lot of newer games used the X-Box type interface and I decided to give it a try. It's great. About the only thing I've run into is that there isn't a more complete layout of some of the things that just aren't noticed at first glance. As an example, I had a game the has a sword fighting mode and a gun shoting mode. Now on the KB you press the \"F\" key to get to shooting mode but the gamepad only showed a small symbol wiith an TS on it. I spent about 30 minutes trying to figure what this meant until I happened to press the right direction stick and discovered that it had a puch button that took you into shoot mode. This item normally controls the point of view.  I've got a couple of other items I'll have to get use to, but having all you controls in one place is really handy and lets me sort of sit back and not be tied to the KB and mouse. As if any controller, there are some games I still like the KB mouse combo and joystick is still my choice for flight sims, but I really think having a gamepad gives you another way to go. Installing the drivers was no problem. Make sure to install the software first! It goes easier that way. After that, just plug it in and your ready to go.

Abraham \"Abe\"","summary":"I Am Serious.........And Don't Call Me Shirly...","reviewText":"Opening Statement....It has been a long time since I have written a review. So I thought I would come back strong. So before I review one of the most anticipated games of the year, I thought I would review the two that we released before the newest one. This is a game that I picked up because it got a lot of hype. So I thought I would give it a shot. I wasn't sure what I was getting because I was always a fan of the Ghost Recon series. But this game proved to me that I could like first person shooters again....Graphics....Well this game does the graphic part pretty well. I really can't find a lot of flaws. I think a little more blood would be nice considering this is a war based game so you can't have a war game without blood kind of weird. I think the looks of the guns and other players and the towns and such look pretty good. This does a good job with graphics... I give this category a 4.9/5Audio...The games audio is very good in my opinion. I think the sounds of the guns firing, the background music is epic and the sounds of people getting shot and dying are also very good. Some of the music that gets played while doing missions is just awesome gives you the hero feeling really. Everything in this department is fantastic. I rate this category a 5/5Game play....The game play is good very easy to pick up if you are new to the Call of Duty franchise like I was when I picked up this game. Not too many combinations of buttons do you have to push. Everything is pretty much self explanatory press a button and it does what you want. Farley easy to pick up and play. Good part of this is that everything is well explained if you need it to be. I rate this category a 5/5Story...The story itself is pretty good but I have a hard time following it because you move around to different characters way to much in the game, that is a huge thing to me because I like to have a storyline to follow and know why I'm killing the people I am. So this is a huge downfall of the game they really don't tell you whets going on they just throw you in there to fight. This is a huge setback to me but others might enjoy it more than I do. I rate this category a 3/5Presentation...The overall look of the game is good, you can navigate around the menus pretty easily which is a good thing, even the multiplayer menus are self explanatory. Therefore I think the whole look of the game is well set up. I rate this category a 5/5Final Thought...This game was the start of something huge for me, I never thought I could get into a first person shooter after I started playing the ghost Recon series but this game kicks some major butt in that department. This is also a game that has a multiplayer so addicting you can find yourself playing it for hours on end. I love the multiplayer. The overall campaign isn't that great I can't see myself ever playing the campaign again so I don't like that part. Over all not a bad game. My final rating on this one would be a 4.5/5...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"What's wrong with your faaaaaaaace?","reviewText":"I have played expansion packs from downloadable content in other games that were longer than this. It's so unfortunate that such a fun game to play is so flawed in terms of story and logic that they are actually bigger complaints to me than the length of the game. The length, to be clear, was about three hours for me. If I hadn't read reviews that talked about how short it was, I would never have believed it. I bought it anyways though, because it was on sale and because I really enjoyed the first game.Instead of laying out the entire story for you all and then explaining what happens and why it doesn't make any sense, I will just say that if you replay the game, or if you haven't yet but are going to, pay attention to the order of events and ask questions in your mind about how this would actually play out. Or how it should. Just to give a brief example, at the beginning of the game when you escape from the Kamino cloning facility in Vader's TIE Fighter, you fly straight to the planet where the leader of the Rebels is being held prisoner. Upon arrival, you're greeted by the ruler of at least the city you're landing in. He is surprised, however, when it's you, and not Vader that steps out of the Fighter. But, okay now stay with me here...when you escape, Vader watches you fly off, so like...he knows you left, and he knows where you're going, since he was the one who told you where the rebel prisoner was being held. So couldn't he have just gotten out like his iPhone 13 or whatever and texted the guy to say like, I dunno... \"lol aprentis excaypt b reddy 4 him.\" Orsomethinglikethat. And then, when you step out of the fighter and are talking to this evil mercenary lord, the camera slides around him to reveal he's palming a laser pistol. So even though he acts surprised to see you he's still got a gun behind his back? Wait what? So does that mean he would have had the gun behind his back if Vader had stepped off the Fighter? Um yeah PROBABLY NOT because he'd have probably been afraid Vader was gonna lay the smack down on him. AND NOT ONLY THAT, but in the first cut scene we are witness to, Vader explains that you are going to be travelling to the planet you end up on anyways, to execute this rebel leader. So shouldn't this lord still not be surprised to see you there? It just makes no sense, and instead of feeling connected to the story, I was literally giggling at how little sense the plot made.And aside from that, you're told that you are a clone of the character from the first game. Because why, exactly? If the first one was such a pain the butt for Vader, why the hell would he CLONE him? That seems just about as idiotic as Vader was in the prequels though, so maybe it actually makes perfect sense and I'm just not dumb enough to be okay with simple-minded crap. Just seems like after the first clone failed him it would have been easier to find some young force sensitive youngling and raise him to be his apprentice. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW RIGHT, I'M NOT A ROCKET SURGEON OR ANYTHING.So I dunno. The force powers, graphics and saber fights are all really fun, if repetitive. But I just couldn't get past how stupid the story was even when it was making sense. Don't pay more than $10 for this game and you won't regret buying it.Probably.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2011"}

Detailed environments, detailed weopons, human and Covenant designs, vehicle designs, and cinematic scenes all blow you away.SOUND:From the music(which will at least give you goosebumps) to the sound of death and guns everywhere, the sound was phenominally done. Voices are incredible and the death screams for humans and Covenant are both realistic and satisfying. The vehicles sound great as well.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay flows realisticly. You can only carry two guns at a time and there is no alt. fire for weapons. You can melee when the Covenant get up in your grill and try to kill you. You can jump, crouch, fly, drive, shoot, run, and blast your way to victory. Each of the 10 levels(except the first)is at least an hour long but the ability to save last checkpoint and exit is a lifesaver. Checkpoints appear frequntly which is good and are placed very well.Now go out and buy the game for yourself.It won't dissapoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Enter, The Second Banana","reviewText":"When the Maro Brothers series was introduced in the 1980's, it has been declared as one of the greatest video game series of all time. The feel of the fantasy world has been absolutely supurb and the simpleness of the games make it all worth the while. While everything always has to be around Mario, this prime example focuses in on Mario's brother, Luigi. Still, this is just the 2nd game Luigi has actually starred in, the first one was Mario Is Missing!, but this game is also like it. It was a big move for Nintendo to finally start the Gamecube platform games off with Mario's Brother, and boy is it compelling.Luigi's Mansion, the debut platform game for the Nintendo Gamecube, focuses in on Luigi, getting an flyer claiming he won a contest he didn't enter, and now he finds out that he has to hunt down the infamous King Boo, and all of his ghoulish pals to stop Luigi from rescuing Mario. The game has well over 60 rooms to choose from, with a whole number of details awaiting in the process, including puzzles, and the feel of the game. The graphics on this one are a bit similar to what you see on the Nintendo 64 platform, but the game is really fast upon the CD-ROM gaming. I truly must say, it is one of the most frightening games ever. Even I was nervous from all the vulgar ghosts and goblins in it. Still, it might be challenging for new gamers, but many of them may want Super Mario Sunshine in their actual Gamecube game collection instead.However, the only way you actually can play this one, is to find a strategy guide for Luigi's Mansion, which is very difficult to find bow that a lot of stores don't really have the game in stock anymore. Still, if you can't find it, you will be wasting almost twenty dollars for this game that is actually exciting. Luigi's Mansion is actually one of the most compelling games out there right now, and it is worth the waiting in gold.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2004"}

With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the original adventures, LEGO Indiana Jones follows Dr. Jones escapades through the jungles of South America to the mountaintops of India. Fans can build, battle and brawl their way through their favorite cinematic moments, from Indy&rsquo;s entanglements with snakes to his dashing boulder run.Of course, pop culture&rsquo;s most iconic archaeologist will whip through all the classic moments with the help of a host of supporting characters including Marion Ravenwood and Short Round. Players can also mix and match the body parts of more than 60 playable characters to create new heroes just as they could in the best-selling LEGO Star Wars games.Key FeaturesEveryone&rsquo;s favorite fedora wearing hero returns to theaters this May in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and families can celebrate the humor and excitement of the original films with LEGO Indiana Jones.Tongue-in-cheek humor presents The Original Adventures in a manner only LEGO can whip up, with comical reinterpretations of classic Indiana Jones scenes and elements.Use Indy&rsquo;s signature whip as a multi-purpose tool to attack, disarm, swing across gaps, activate levers and interact with a world of LEGO objects and puzzles.For the first time, LEGO Indy characters are fully immersed in their environment; swim, climb, shimmy across rock ledges and pick up and carry objects.Use a variety of weapons from the environment to fight enemies (e.g., chairs, guns, swords, bottles).Unlock more than 60 playable characters, including villains and supporting characters (Marion Ravenwood, Short Round, Rene Belloq, Willie Scott, Marcus Brody, Jones Senior and Mola Ram).Character specific abilities include excavation by Satipo, an umbrella slide by Marcus Brody, and monkey access by Marion Ravenwood.Create unique playable characters like Sallah Scott or Mola Round by mixing and matching the LEGO body parts of all playable characters.Explore the globe and solve puzzles that encourage creative thinking through the use of teamwork and unique building situations only possible in a LEGO world.Cooperative gameplay encourages parents to share the legacy of Indiana Jones with their children in a fun and humorous way.Experience the Adventure as Indiana JonesView ImageSignature moments from the filmsView image","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"It's better than a pit full of snakes... much better.","reviewText":"For anyone who has played the LEGO Star Wars games, you already know what to expect with LEGO Indiana Jones and you know already whether or not you like the game.  It's more of the same with a different theme, which is good as far as I'm concerned.  The big difference is there is more platforming and puzzle solving and slightly less combat.  The difficulty level has also been ratcheted up a notch or two, which I also see as a good thing.For everyone else who hasn't played the previous LEGO adventure games, here's the scoop.  The game has three adventures based off of each of the original three Indiana Jones films.  Except everything is made with LEGOs instead.  Each adventure has six levels.  Gameplay primarily consists of platforming and puzzle solving with a fair mix of beat-up-style combat to spice things up.  The game supports one or two players who can play in co-op mode at any time.  All that needs to happen is a second player picks up the controller and jumps into the action.  Players have an infinite number of lives, so it's pretty easy to slog through the game even if you aren't that good at it.  That isn't to say that the game isn't challenging because there are some tough puzzles and jumps gamers are expected to make, but you'll eventually get through everything without seeing a GAME OVER message because you can keep trying over and over until you succeed.  This makes it a perfect family game where younger children can play alongside an adult without experiencing much frustration.  In one-player mode, the computer takes control of the other character, which the player can switch to at any time.The Good:* Intuitive gameplay.  Pretty much anybody can pick the controls up and adventure like a pro within minutes.* Drop-in Co-op Gameplay* Lots of unlockables.  The replay value is very high with over 60 unlockable characters and nifty features and modes to unlock.* Clever and entertaining cut scenes that parallel the movies.  Fans of the movies will likely enjoy the humor and the character's personalities have been portrayed very well.The Bad:* It's a fairly short story (8-10 hours to complete) if you don't care about unlockable content.  Gameplay extends much longer if you try to unlock all the hidden content.* Enemies frequently have projectiles and you're left with your fists.  Expect to get shot when you bring a whip to gunfight.* The water effects on the Wii version are downright bland for no good reason because the rest of the graphics in the game are pretty solid.  The Wii hardware is capable of producing better looking water effects and it's been done before.  A minor complaint, but still valid.* Multi-player camera control is kind of wonky and it's easy to die in some areas because the camera will favor one player over the other.  But you since everyone has infinite lives so it isn't much of a problem.Overall, I highly recommend LEGO Indiana Jones.  It's a good family game, fans of the movies should like it, and it's a must-have title if you have enjoyed the other LEGO adventure games.  If you have an XBox 360 or a PS3 in your home, you may want to consider buying it for one of those other consoles for the better graphics.  Otherwise the gameplay on each of the consoles feels pretty much identical based off my experience with the first few levels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2008"}

A direct port of Super Mario Brothers 2 from the original Nintendo Entertainment System, \"Super Mario Advance\" provides entertaining gameplay for those with fondness for the days of the 8-bit gaming environment.  Playing as one of four characters (Mario, Luigi, Toad, or the Princess), the player travels through land of dreams to battle an evil foe who wishes give everyone an unpleasant night's sleep.As a part of the Super Mario series of games, Super Mario Brothers 2 is probably the least of the entire series.  This version for GameBoy Advance does little to enhance the original.  Aside from slightly better graphics and sound, it's still basically the same game.  There is a little side challenge of trying to collect these coins on each level, but, in truth, the only reward for that is knowing that you found them all.  There are no bonuses or special screens otherwise.  It is still a fun game, though, and worth playing for those who have found memories of the old NES days.

The reason why midnoght club 2 has less graphical quality is because the game had to render not only the cars but the entire city, that takes alot of computing power. need for speed underground, doesn't have entire citys to render therefore it has more attention to detail. I love the cinematic camera reminds me alot of Burnout 2 except there *IS* no damage, I know you'll say oh these are real car brands they can't do reall damage on the car the automakers would get po'ed well let me tell you something. The need for speed series starting having damage appear on cars in NFS:HS what cars did the damage first appear on, lets see; camaro, firebird, MERCEDES, ferrari, Porsche, *McLaren f1* i mean the list goes on, not to mention that porsche had a game entirely devoted to them will full damage modeling. And the last game, NFS:hp2 for ps2, had damage modeling, and that game had all of the super expensive car makers. Why would they not have damage modeling in this one, makes me think that the automakers are trying to hide something, like horrible crash tests or something; also i would think that actually having a damage modeling system in the game would deter people from street racing, since they would see the ugly side affects to smashing into somthing. the damage modeling is my only bif. the rest of the game is challenging , fun, and the ps2 vs. PC is GENIOUS i mean, next thing you know they'll release a Ps2 vs. gamecube vs. Xbox vs. PC, it could be done, if the only differences between the games is the graphics, then everyone will be all set, it would be the ultimate competition of the systems.I bought this game for my ps2 and reviewed it for the ps2, because the pc version ran choppy in the demo, and i just bought a new video card so i'm not going to upgrade again anytime soon. the ps2 version is just as good, except the game doesn't have the choice of different resolutions.Great game, kudos to the developers on this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2003"}

Pikmin 3 is not this game.Pikmin 3 is a fairly well-made exploration/puzzle game, but not the engrossing kind of game that you look forward to playing after a hard day of work.  I started playing Pikmin in between releases of other games I've been looking forward to.  After those newer and more interesting games were released, I never felt the itch to go back to Pikmin.  To me, Pikmin is kind of like an iPhone/Android game.  It's a fairly entertaining diversion when there's nothing else to do.  But there's usually something more interesting to play.The game involves controlling an army of pikmin of different types and specialties.  You leverage these different species of pikmin to solve various puzzles, such as using rock pikmin to smash glass and using yellow pikmin to conduct electricity.  The objective is usually finding your squadmate, finding parts of your ship, or finding other clues to progress the game.  The game imposes a non-threatening time limit to nudge you along: if you run out of fruit juice, it's game over.  So along the way you have to find enough fruit to sustain your crew.  However, it's not hard to stockpile fruit to stay comfortably ahead of this time limit.Controls are imprecise but workable.  When using the gamepad, aiming your Pikmin can sometimes be a chore since you are moving a cursor in two dimensions in a game world that is rendered in three dimensions.  Sometimes, if objects are in the foreground (like a flying enemy or a location on higher ground), you have to rotate your camera to get a good angle at where you are trying to aim.  Luckily, the game's difficulty takes the imprecise controls into account and you don't have to be hyperprecise or super quick with the controls.The game's easygoing nature can sometimes get in the way.  The gameplay is divided in days, which provides a useful breaking/saving point in a game that wouldn't otherwise have such subdivisions.  However, the end of each day involves watching your pikmin load up into their onion, shoot into space, and watch a long-winded review of your progress for that day which involves overly long animations for the fruit you've collected, the pikmin you've gained and lost, as well as a captain's log type narrative that is sometimes charming but other times can be an annoying time waster in between you and the next day of gameplay.  Some of these scenes can be skipped, but even with the skipping the amount of time spent reviewing stuff in between days is overly long.The game is beautifully rendered with tilt-shift camera effects to reinforce the idea of you being a tiny stranded survivor in a giant world full of stuff to explore.  Enemy design is interesting, but encounters can feel repetitive since there are only so many variations of the \"throw-pikmin-at-target\" theme.I bought the game used at a fraction of MSRP and I'm still not sure if it was worth it.  In the past few weeks, I've played Plants vs. Zombies 2 about as much as I've played Pikmin.  Part of me feels like a game on a phone should be able to compete with a game on a dedicated console.  So for me, I'll still be waiting for the one game that justifies my Wii U purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2013"}

I started getting frustrated with the series with GT4.  The sounds were terrible in that game with all the cars sounding like vaccuum cleaners.  It's something GT has never been able to get right and that trend continues with GT5.  I'm amazed that they can't get the sound of an American V8 right.This game was supposed to be some graphical masterpiece but I think it falls short.  Sure, the premium cars look great but the standard cars look like something from the PS2.  Nevermind the fact that they actually have premium and standard cars, that's a whole nother argument.  GT5 looks no better and in some ways, worse than other console races out now.  The tracks aren't really that great looking either and for some reason, the game's brightness seems to be off.  If you adjust the brightness in game, it makes any sort of light effect in game wash out with white light.  Speaking of tracks.  Why isn't the Top Gear test track available in GT Arcade?  Why can't we run time trials on the track to see how we stack up against The Stig?The cars.....Yes, GT5 has a lot of cars.  A LOT.  I think they've gone overboard though.  Do we really need 16 different versions of a Honda Civic or Acura Integra?  No.  The lack of American cars in this game disappoints me.  There are multiple variations of some econo box Japanese car but some of the best cars in America and other countries don't even make an appearance in this game.  It's clear that Polyphony Digital is biased towards Japanese cars since they're a Japanese company but one would think if you're want to sell a large quantity of this game in the USA, you might want to put some more American cars in there so the buyers have something to relate to.I'm still trying to figure out how this game was released without an online leaderboard.  That's one of the most basic pieces of any racing game and for some reason, GT5 doesn't have it.The one thing that they did get right in GT5 is the physics.  That's always been something that GT has been ahead of the game on.  It just seems that with GT5, they skimped on a lot stuff to get the physics dead on.Overall, I feel that this game is not worth the wait as it seems like it's unfinished.  I'm not sure how they managed that since this game was constantly delayed over the last 2 years.  My advice is that if you have a PS3 and an XBOX360 and you want to buy a racing game, get Forza 3 because it's the better game by a large margin.UPDATE: 12/30/10I felt that I should do a follow up review since I've had the game for over a month now.  My overall feelings on the game have not changed but I don't enjoy the game as much as I did at first.  I find myself getting more frustrated with the game as I progress through the career and special events.  Some of the special events are insanely difficult.  The Top Gear events especially.  I've lost a lot of interest in the game because of being frustrated with certain aspects of the game and I can't help but feel that the game doesn't live up to the hype that was built up over the last 5 years.  I haven't played the game in over a week and I might not play it again before it get's traded to Amazon.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

I tried.  Spent several hours trying to get a handle on the controls, the feel and feedback of the setup, and while I appreciate the thought that has clearly gone into GT5 (its slick as hell, no doubt about it), its just not very much....fun.Maybe I'm less of a realistic racer guy, and perhaps my abilities lean more towards games with a little easier learning curve.  So take that into consideration, but if you are like me and want to pick up a game and be able to at least feel competent within a relatively short amount of time (and if too easy, adjust difficulty), then GT5 may not be for you.I'm a car lover, and a car history lover, so for that, 3 stars is there, and it deserves all three and more.  But for gameplay that took the fun out of it for me rather quickly, I can't recommend this racer to you.

Batman is wide open to be hurt in this game, going against guys with semi-automatic rifles, but he doesn't even carry a handgun?I got tired of this unrealistic and silly aspect of the game. Bumping the heads of your foes against one another to knock them unconcious is a little too vanilla flavor for me.Another thing I didn't like is the \"stealth\" of batman which is ridiculous. He can walk right past a foe and they won't even notice him.They could have gone the way of Enslaved: Oddysey to the West, which is not gory at all, yet the melee battles are realistic and fun.

Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Lesson Learned: Don't P***-Off Kratos","reviewText":"The Good, Bad, and Ugly Breakdown of the third installment of the God of War Series (not counting the PSP Chains of Olympus).This being the first time Kratos has graced the PS3 (not counting remakes of course! I'm talking about straight to PS3), it was a very welcome change. The first two were such fun on the PS2 and when GOWII came out it was amazing what the designers were able to do to maximize the look & feel of the game. And when GOWIII came to the PS3, it did not disappoint.__The Good__The visuals/graphics, the gameplay, the moving story and the timing of the flow of the story as it unfolds. The creators had a lot of fun showing your placement in retrospect of where you are. If you're on Mt. Olympus, they'll zoom into show Gaia scaling its walls, and zoom in even further to show Kratos hanging on to her forearm, battling hordes of enemies that have been thrown there.The weapons are a lot of fun and I found myself actually needing to use them at times, and each weapon has a corresponding power. I like the way this was done. When you have the \"Blades of Exile\" (upgraded from your Athena's Blades from GOWII), you can call upon your Spartan breathren to aid you, and the other weapons have associated powers that can only be used while they are selected.For me, normal difficulty was just right for a first go through. Took around 10 hours or so. And the optional challenges at the end aren't too bad at all, definitely do-able.__The Bad__Won't ruin the story or reveal any spoilers here, but there was an \"odd\" part in the game towards the end that took a loooong time to traverse. While it is visually interesting/appealing, and the game artists probably thought it would add something to the game to have Kratos swim and swim and swim while in this \"different\" medium, it took a long time and didn't add anything to the game. Could have truncated the sequence by a couple of minutes and still had the desired artistic/dramatic effect I think.Also, made me wish there were more \"fun\" trophies to obtain. Most of them you gain just by playing through once and are story related. However, I am playing through again to get the \"Nice Tan\" trophy (Blind 100 enemies)__The Ugly__There are some very ugly creatures in the game, and Kratos definitely gets to meet all of them... and kill them. Pretty much everything dies due to this Spartan's revenge/wrath.There was a comment uttered while watching Kratos on his path, \"Wow, this guy sure is a d**k.\" There are some jabs at his cruelty in the game, it gets to be quite comical, especially while reading some notes left behind by previous \"acquaintances\" of Kratos.__Summary__All in all, a very fun game. Very gory (I achieved the \"buckets of blood\" trophy VERY quickly) and some of the puzzles while playing through can be somewhat challenging, might take a little thinking outside of the box to be able to solve, but most are pretty straight forward with the standard, turn crank / beat the clock. The Labyrinth in particular is full of interesting challenges, including groups of enemies that you have to employ different tactics to be able to defeat.Definitely would recommend this game. But also would recommend playing GOW, and GOWII before playing this game to get the full effect and the inside jokes/running gags.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"Winston Fraser \"Arcade Bee\"","summary":"i personally think that PS2 should have built-in memory!!!!","reviewText":"Acessories for PS2 may cost you more than you bargained for!!!!!

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"Thouroghly Entertaining!","reviewText":"I openly admit that this was a game that I had very little interest in playing initially. I dont know why, It just wasn't high on my list of games I wanted to play. Well, that all changed when the original Crysis came to Xbox Live On Demand. I was in the mood for some FPS action when I saw that Crysis had been put up on Xbox On Demand so I purchased it. Well, to make a long story short, I ended up putting the game down like 14 hours later, after finishing the game on both Hard and Delta difficulty. In short, I loved it. So I simply had to buy the sequel.I was a bit disappointed at first as I really didn't want to play as a new character. I wanted to pick up where I left of with Nomad in Crysis especially considering I jumped from Crysis to Crysis 2 in the same week. Don't get me wrong, I understand why they went this route as it makes it so console gamers can play it without having to know what happened in game 1. It was still disappointing as I really liked Nomad and that is who I was expecting to play as in Crysis 2. I think he was a great character and the voice acting was top notch in Crysis. I also liked Psycho and was bummed he wasn't involved as well. Overall I think it would have been a better game had they stuck with Nomad and kept the supporting characters in the sequel. Yes, Prophet is involved but that doesn't really make up for the lack of Nomad and Psycho and Nomad's role is small in this game. I eventually came to accept these changes but Alcatraz just wasn't as interesting of a character and even at the end of the game I was wishing they would have stuck with Nomad.I was also a bit disappointed with the story as it really felt separate from Crysis. Even tho they are connected, it just felt like it was a different game altogether. The aliens were completely different and all of the sudden you dealing with a virus, something that wasn't even mentioned in the first game. New characters, new location, new aliens, new virus etc.. Short of the name and the Nano-suit, it really just felt like a completely different game series altogether and I found this disappointing as again I wanted to pick up where I left from Crysis. Don't get me wrong, the story in this game is top notch and very entertaining, it just doesn't feel like a sequel to Crysis. It felt like a completely new series altogether. Again I understand why they did it, I just dont like that they did it. They could have done something like Bioware did with Mass Effect to bring people up to date with the story.As for the good parts of this game, there are many!1 - It has a lengthy campaign, something that is becoming rare these days. Overall it took me roughly 12 hour to finish the game and there are plenty of reasons to play through this game multiple times.2 - The graphics are top notch, one of the best looking games I have seen yet. The art design is really stunning. Overall, IMO, its one of the best cities ever produced in a videogame.3 - The overall design of the levels is outstanding. Most battles have at least 3-4 unique approaches. The best way I can describe it is its like little mini sand box battles wrapped up in a game with linear progression. This alone adds significantly to the games re-playability.4 - Huge assortment of weapons. I wish you could carry more than 2 but that just adds to the games strategy. The guns you choose can make all the difference in the world especially when you factor in all the different approaches one can take to the battles.5 - A great story. Even tho Nomad and Pycho were left out of this game, it still has a great story and was highly entertaining to proceed through.6 - Highly entertaining combat system. The suits cloaking and armor ability makes the combat extremely unique and highly entertaining.7 - One of the best gaming soundtracks I have heard yet. Han Zimmer is one of my favorite composers and his work on Crysis 2 really takes the game to a whole new level. In particular, the music that plays during big battle stages, its outstanding and really adds to the excitement. Its brilliant and is easily one of the best soundtracks we have seen yet in gaming.Bottom line - Crysis 2 is an amazing game. Easily one of the best FPS I have played on consoles yet. My only complaint is in regards to the story and the characters. Ultimately this game would have been just that much better had they chosen to stick with Nomad and some of the other supporting characters from Crysis. Then again this isn't even an issue for people that haven't played Crysis, which I am sure is the case with a lot of console gamers (at least before they released it on Xbox Live On Demand). Hopefully we will see a Crysis game that focuses on the whereabouts of Nomad and Psycho. That's personally where I would like to see the series go.Overall an amazing game!5 stars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

The first thing that struck me about the unit was how much it reminded me of the Neo Geo Pocket Colour which was available in this country for the last year. Unfortunately SNK choose to withdraw the Neo Geo from the Western market and it leaves a clear path for Nintendo to continue its domination of handhelds.Nintendo have opted for a silver colour for the body, rather than the usual bright plastic toy colours it has been using on the Colour unit for the past year. Like the Neo Geo the machine is now horizontal with a 'widescreen' TFT LCD panel providing a very crisp display in the middle of the unit. Buttons haven't changed much sine the original Gameboy: below the screen there's the start and select button, to the left hand side is the 8 direction joypad (as with the Gameboy this just isn't responsive or subtle enough), to the right are the A and B buttons and two new additions are here in the form of a left and right shoulder button.ECTS had 4 games on show, but due to the popularity of the stand I didn't get much chance to play them. The game I did have a go at was a fun puzzler currently going by the name of Kuru Kuru Kururin. The object is to guide a rotating bar around a narrow maze, never allowing it to touch the edges. The game is suprisingly tough, requiring accurate timing and skilled control to keep your bar safe. It's also highly addictive and will be a title sure to appeal to any fans of games like Bust-a-move. The most popular game on show had to be Mario Kart Advanced, which was so crowded that I never got a chance to play. It was set up to show the 4 player capabilities of the unit, when connected using it's link cable. Graphically the games impressive, graphics are smooth sharp and detailed and it really shows the potential in the system. If its popularity was anything to go by it's sure to be a success.Though not shown here there's future promise for internet connectivity though how that will work out for the UK will remain to be seen (Bandai were showing off their Wonderswan with internet connectivity, but when I asked admited that there was no plans of a UK release for the machine). It'll be cpable of hooking up with the gamecube, much as the Neo Geo Pocket can connect to the DC allowing trading between King of Fighter's data on the two platforms. Battery life is a respectable 15 hours, which isn't bad for a handheld and there's the handy option of a rechargable battery unit to save on cost. Powered by a 32bit RISC CPU the machine stocks a lot more power than it's predecessor and any other handheld currently available. There's speculation that it may have some rudimentary 3D capabilities, perhaps at the level of Starfox on the SNES.With no challenging handheld device in the Western market now the Gameboy Advanced seems sure to win. I'm guessing the pricing point will be around 90 as the dollar price is expected to be at that price. Nintendo's main challenge will be pursuading gamers to upgrade, but games like Mario Kart Advanced seem a sure fire way of achieving this. Screenshots from games in development at the moment all look colourful and imaginative so the unit has much promise. I think there's a lot to be said for describing this as the SNES of the handheld world.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2003"}

Johnson","summary":"Durable and responsive; but poor design.","reviewText":"I had been using the original Rock Band Drum kit for Rock Band and Guitar Hero until they started messing up.  The pads would not register hits making playing even the easiest sections extremely frustrating.  Of course the drum pads were out of warranty so unless I fixed them myself, I would have buy another drum set.  I figured I'd do without because frankly I'm tired of having to shoddy peripherals fail every few months.  So I stopped playing drums in this game altogether and went back to playing the guitar 100% of the time.I recently received this drum set from Logitech and I figured if the quality was anything like the Logitech Guitar controller, then I'd be quite satisfied.  For the most part these drums are much better than the standard controllers that come with these games (as least the original rock band drum kit), but there is one issue that makes this set sort of a disappointment.Keep in mind this is only my second drum kit, so the only one I can really compare it to is the drum set that came with the original Rock Band; and when comparing, I'm really only comparing the durability and the responsiveness of the drums.The Good.Comparing this to my original drum controller, this kit looks much better, the drum pads are much bigger, the pedal seems looks a lot better and amore sturdy and the after setting it up for the first time, you can easily fold it down and stow it away instead of being a permanent fixture in your gaming area.  The simplistic yet effective design of the stand makes it quite easy to adjust the height of the drum pads to suite your taste.The responsiveness of this kit is much better than the Rock Band kit.  Drum hits are properly registered, and if you hit the correct drum pad at the correct time you are guaranteed that the hit will register in the game itself so no more blurting out \"BUT I HIT THAT NOTE!\" while playing your game.  The drum pedal, in addition to being seemingly more sturdy than the rock band pedal it is also benefits from being 100% responsive.  This responsiveness translates to a more enjoyable drumming experience.The BadWhile the drums hits are accurately registered during game play, there is one glaring issue that is sure to cause some frustration especially during intensive drumming songs.  Many of the songs in GH:WT for example, rely on heavy use of the yellow cymbal drum pad.  Because of this you will almost certainly notice that your cymbal will start to wander to the right or left, (right in my case) during play.  Because you are mainly concentrating on the screen and not the drum kit itself, the only way you will realize that this is happening is when you use your drum stick to hit the cymbal only to hit nothing but air.  You glance down and notice that your cymbal has shifted out of its normal position forcing you to make an-in game adjustment to the cymbal itself to move it back in position or changing your drumming technique to compensate for the shift.  Either way this messes up any streak you may have going.  Adding to this sometimes the entire cymbal pole may even move DOWN as if you are hammering a nail into a piece of wood; again forcing you have to adjust your technique mid play or pausing the game to move it back up.This movement occurs because the knobs used to tighten each pole can never be tightened enough to restrict movement altogether.  Even the regular drum pads (red, blue, green) will rotate slightly (though not as much as the cymbals) during game play.  This problem can probably be fixed with a little masking tape to make the shaft of these drums a much tighter fit, but at this price you would think these drums wouldn't have any kind of problem; particularly not one that affects usability.  I thought I was one of the only ones experiencing this issue, and perhaps I didn't set them up properly, but many others have voiced my same concern leading me to believe that this is a design flaw that wasn't addressed during the development of this kit.  Simply play testing this kit with Guitar Hero:WT would have exposed the issue before it was released to the public.  Even the problem with the cymbal wandering to the left or right would not even be noticed at all if they were actual circles instead of fan shaped.Other than this one issue there is nothing else wrong with this kit and if it weren't for the design flaw of wandering cymbals or rotating drum pads, then I really would have no problem with this functionality wise.  While I don't play the drums enough in these games to warrant personally spending this kind of money on them, if you are the type that absolutely love the drums in this game then I don't see why I couldn't recommend them; but ONLY if the cymbals were designed better.  However as it stands, I cannot recommend this kit.  Instead, I would look into other kits (particularly the ION kit) if you are going to spend this kind of money anyway.  Sure the ION may be more expensive, but maybe at the more expensive price you'll get something that's designed a little better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004Q8L46G","description":"","reviewerName":"Geekdomo \"GeekDomo\"","summary":"DiRT 3 - its better than standing on the rally circuit in a European country and getting hit by a flipping car!","reviewText":"I played the heck out of Dirt2. Currently I got into the genre due to owning aLogitech G27 Racing Wheel. All of the games I had played on it up to the point I got Dirt2 were, lets say too basic. I wanted a simulated driving game that was also great to look at and sounded real. I then rented Dirt2 from an online game rental place and decided to keep it for good. Where Dirt 2 left some holes in the game, Dirt3 fills. There are many new features to talk about, lets get to it.Casual, Intermediate, Expert?:First off this is a racing simulation with a casual mode that helps you out. Basically the 3 modes allow for you to turn on features that help you drive. Expert mode will allow you to do tail kick-out turns whereas casual helps you make the turns more efficiently. Casual mode is for the person that just wants to play and doesn't care about the \"realness\" of the game. Expert will allow you to tweak the cars feel to your exact requirements. So its basically up to you to pick one you can stick with. If a track requires drifting I will put it on intermediate, if not its pretty hard to compete that way and for some races I will go casual. This is after me nailing Expert on Dirt 2. So its a much more realistic game. Problem is Intermediate is a bit too hard and casual is almost a joke too easy so I have had to go into the sub menu and adjust the settings a bit to make my own level somewhere in-between.Graphics:Dirt2 had the most realistic graphics I had ever seen in a driving game to date. Dirt3 somehow improves this by even more details. The dust, the rocks, the scenery. It all pops on the screen. What really blows my mind is how blazingly fast it flys by and yet still has that detail. You really feel like you are driving down some narrow canyon road and having rock walls inches from your bumper.Hey Joe:Back is the cool feature that lets you pick your name from about 500 name database (guessing). This seems like a trite feature but it does let you feel more immersed into the game. Your mechanic and pep girl can get a tad annoying though.Music:Oh yea its back with a vengeance. Most of the bands on Dirt2 I had never heard of, and by the end of me playing it heavily I had fallen in love with about 2 bands and downloaded 6 of the songs to my iTunes. Same thing here with Dirt3, cool music that most I have not heard of and will most assuredly dig by the end of my time with this game.Sound:The engine sounds are spot on. They even have a faint whine from the radio that you hear when watching WRC rally races on HDTheater. The engines roar and scream as you fly passed whistling trees and branches. Hit a puddle and mud flys up on the car with a splat. Its all very realistic. You will hear fans yelling at you in their native languages as you fly by. In Africa they bang cow bells! Guess what? I got a fever! And the only prescription.. is more cowbell!Co-Driver:I never checked Dirt2 but on Dirt3 you can now tell your co-driver to use appropriate lingo for the course. In Dirt 2 and even by default in Dirt3 you get the \"medium left, hard right\" whereas real rally co-drivers say \"left 3, right 2\" indicating the suggested gear. Its just another tip of the hat to Codemasters for adding more realism.Career Mode:I am just starting the game and will comment more on the career as I get farther in, but the game seems to have taken more of a rally turn which is perfect. If I wanted to drive around Daytona I would pick a different game than Dirt. I want rally racing and this game seems to be pushing more in that direction. You will visit actual WRC event locations ( which is very cool if you watch it on TV). You have to do well to unlock the new maps but its nothing new if your familiar with this genre.Cars (& trucks):This part I love. You of course can drive the new WRC cars but also you can go back and drive some of the old Lancias and early rally cars. I always wanted to own a Lancia and in this game I can at least simulate driving one down a narrow road in Norway. There are achievements that you can unlock by driving some cars such as \"The Self Preservation Society\" if you get that reference you will know which car unlocks that achievement. There are buggies and trucks also.Controls:Dont even bother playing this with anything other than a driving wheel. You can play it with a dualshock controller but its just about impossible to make a smooth turn with a joystick. It wants to jerk the nose of the car every time you push the stick even a bit. At high speed the rear end may jump out and youll be fishtailing down a straight.Weather:Wow...just amazing detail. The same track can be covered in rain or snow and change the whole race. The snow sticks to the cars like it does in real life. The rain pools in low spots and cause you to hydroplane. The sunset over the desert is just awesome. Matter of fact in some forest stages it can be a beautiful sunny day and the trees block enough sunlight to keep you in the dark in a corner. Its pretty realistic and very cool.Gymkhana:I started playing paintball back in the late 80s. Back then we played capture the flag in the woods. Eventually it started merging into a stadium sport. The reason it became more like that is people can watch it in a closed location. Gymkhana is to Rally as stadium ball is to paintball.  Rally purists may not appreciate the Gymkhana portions of Dirt3. I do because it is a great way to build your drifting, jumping and turning skills on someplace other than a track. My only complaint is to complete a season you must perfect the gymkhana level. I wish it it was more a fun place to play when not racing and not tied into the game so much. In season 2 you do get a place to just goof off. It is the future of rally racing so might as well embrace it.Overall:This game is a must have in your PS3 arsenal. It shows off the power of the PS3 in a fantastic way. It is a must have if you love rally racing. It is a more improved simulation from Dirt2 and even is better in many ways than the venerable:Richard Burns Rally,(yes I just compared it to a game made in 2004, but that game is the gold standard for rally games IMHO). So if you love Rally games and want a kick butt one then by all means grab Dirt3!Thank you for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2011"}

Horrible.Anyway, if you like the Arcade sequences of games from ~15 years or so ago, you might enjoy this. Other than that I do not have much to say. I debated on whether or not to even review this. I was going to give this a 3, but some may find it playable.Overall, it is playable, but lacks finishing polish of today's games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}

Does it really have to be linear? The atmosphere is also way to gloomy in the single player.

The majority is spent underground. It is also a little too shortGraphics are very good, character models are excelent, environments are very detailed, and HDR Lightning can be run with anti-aliasing. The best thing is that the graphics take almost no toll on my PC. There is hardly any lag during the single player mode (same is not true for multiplayer). I run Dark Messiah on a 1280 x 1024 resolution with hightest detail settings and 8x AA and 16x anisotropic texture filtering and I have never experienced any lag during single player.Gameplay is also great, the combat system is so realistic you will constantly have to remind yourself that this is a game. The artifical intelligence in this game is great, enemies will constantly engage in conversations, when they have not seen you. They also use strategies such as trying to surround you or pin you against a wall or cliff.Sound is mediocre, no more to be said.The story itself is not really that intrieging. Your basic fantasy with dragons, swords, orcs, and goulsMultiplayer is probably the part of the game you will spend most time on, in multiplayer, you chose from five classes, in seven maps, with four modes. The unique feature of this game is the mode Crussade. In crussade, the teams (Undead and Human) battle it out to take control of a series of maps, until they are at the other army's stronghold. One complaint here is that there are only seven maps. Yet, those seven maps are well designed and very fun to play on.One more thing, this game has very long load times.

What a great series!  This game has Professor Layton and Luke traveling by train to solve the mystery of the Elysian Box.....which is believed to kill any who open it.* The puzzles are challenging....the music is great....the story line is intriguing.* The mini-games in this one are even better than Curious Village. The hamster maze challenge is my favorite.  There is also a tea challenge. As you go through the game,  different tea ingredients are unlocked.  Some people in the game will want a specific cup of tea (to rejuvenate them, relax them, etc.).  You have to experiment with the tea pot to find the right mix of ingredients to complete the request.  There is also a photo challenge where you are given 2 photographs and you need to try to spot the differences.  Sounds easy....buuuuuttt,  it's not.  Not all of them anyway.* Just as in Curious Village....this game has bonus puzzles that are unlocked as you progress through the game.* Additional weekly puzzles available through Wi-Fi.This game is fantastic!!!

The problem is, is that it gets very repetitive after a few missions and if you have a short attention span, you won't like it after playing for a bit.The idea is simple where you search for hidden items in the picture and that allows you to progress through the game. Objects are listed and cleverly hidden---sometimes you have to find the word rather than the object or it's the definition of the object and you have to find out what it is like \"knock-knock\" which means a door-knocker---and the picture scrolls so it's easy on the eyes.This game is likeMystery Case Files: MillionHeir, but that game has a variety of ways to search for objects. AMAZING ADVENTURES... is more straight forward.After finding the items at each mission site, players play one of several mini-games that are either: Memory, Mah-Jongg, Jig-Saw Puzzle, or Find the Difference. The mini-games are pretty easy and I've been playing for an hour or so every other day, for about two weeks, with the timer turned off and I've never been frustrated by any part of it.I'm on level 18-mission 5, and I'm finding that the game is getting repetitive. The mini-games like the puzzles are repeating and many of the objects are also starting to repeat. This started happening around mission 11 and although the objects are hidden in different places, they're the same items.But it still has an addictive play quality to it, likeBrain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, where even though you know what to expect you can't help but play, which is why I say four-stars for fun.However, like I said before people who are easily bored won't like this game past the first hour or so and that's why I only give 3-stars overall.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

Still, this game is quite fun to play and features newly re-mixed video.The Wachowski Brothers personally worked on this game, and recombined video segments from the movies to build new sequences for the game. It really helps to have seen the movies, because while the game does move along with a plot, the montages of video clips would probably be very confusing if you didn't have the basic idea of what was going on.So what IS going on. You're Neo, and you are given the choice of a red pill or blue pill. Amusingly, if you take the blue pill, you're sent back through your alarm clock and wake up as if out of a dream. Take the red pill, and you start on your path to Being the One. First it's a tutorial-like step by step guide to escaping the office building, with a far more convoluted path than seen in the movie.Soon you're in a training arena, poking fun at a variety of video games. Then you move along through the storyline, with a wide variety of focus abilities and world-changing powers.The graphics are reasonably good. At this point in time you really don't look to a PS2 for cutting edge graphics - the XBox has such amazing titles out, and the XBox 360 is just SO sweet, that you accept what you get from the PS2. That being said, I really found the movements of the characters to be quite impressive. Some of the martial arts moves were very smooth and realistic looking.The sound is OK for an adventure game. Some of the little audio snippets get annoying VERY quickly, but that's the way it goes. The music in general was in the Matrix theme and helped you feel like you were a part of the movie.If you're a fan of the trilogy, then it's great to get back into that world and to be able to choose your own path - and find a new ending - to the storyline in a way endorsed and written by the creators. You can replay the game a few times, on increasing levels of difficulty, to extend your gameplay enjoyment. That being said, this is a lot shorter start-to-end then most games I own, which is a bit frustrating.Well recommended for Matrix fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2005"}

Now, a good system is nothing without good games, and fortunately the Xbox 360 has plenty.  I could write a list of all the great games for 360, but since I don't really have the time, I'll just list the top 5: Halo 3, Gears of War, BioShock, Guitar Hero II, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.  But this isn't a review of the games, so here're my thoughts on the system.The 120 GB Hard Drive is the most notable difference from the Pro console.  With the 6X larger HD, it makes it easier to download lots of content from Xbox Live, like Live Arcade games, game demos, videos, etc.  The downloads themselves aren't easier, but if like me you like to download stuff all the time, you don't have to worry about deleting old content to make room for the new content.The next new feature is the HDMI cable support.  If you're using the Pro console, your only option for High Definition cables were the HD component cables, or perhaps the VGA cables.  Both provide a great picture, but with the HDMI cables, you get a 100% perfect digital signal directly to your HDTV, and only through HDMI cables can you use the full 1080p resolution (if your HDTV supports 1080p).  If you're a hardcore gamer or a technophile, this is perfect for you, but the average person can't really tell the difference between 1080i and 1080p.Besides the larger 120GB Hard Drive and the HDMI cable, the only other difference is the DVD playback upscaling.  Standard DVDs play in 480p, but the Elite can upscale the image to 720p, making certain DVDs (mainly THX certified and Superbit DVDs) look better.The rest of the changes to the Elite are purely cosmetic and don't enhance performance in any way.If you're reading this, you must be interested in the Elite, so let me tell you, you won't be disapointed.  The added features are worth the extra money.  You should buy the Xbox 360 Elite.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00432O4VM","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Shadows of the Damned Review","reviewText":"Suda 51 is back with his latest creation. This time the game has found its way on the XBOX360 and will have you playing the part of Garcia Hotspur, Demon Hunter. After another successful outing Hotspur comes home to his hot girlfriend only to find that the current bad-ass in Hell, Fleming, has decided that he's had enough with Hotspur's murders and steals away the girlfriend. This leaves Hotspur with only one choice, he must journey into hell and rescue her. The problem is that there's going to be a lot of really pissed off demons between him and Fleming. As you play the game, however, I think you'll find that Garcia Hotspur doesn't mind having to mow down hundreds of demons.Graphically this game looks good. It kind of has this old Transylvanian feel to it, and it really works for the game. There's also the darkness mechanic which gives you a difference perspective, while you're trying to survive, and introduces a vital puzzle piece to the game play. The different demons that you have to face off against are spot on for what I'd envisioned walked around in hell. The best character design though has to go to the bosses that will crop up from time to time to really give you a challenge. The in between levels load screen reminds me of a Castlevania-esque approach. You'll see the level and you'll see your character walk from one area into the next on a map, which for some reason just screams Castlevania to me.Now the sound is where there might be a problem for some people. The dialogue is not for everyone, and sometimes its a bit over the top. There are some parts where you just have to shake your head, and there are other parts that might just have you laughing your ass off. The music keeps with the theme of the world and doesn't really blow you away, but it definitely adds something to the game.As you go through the game you're going to find that your controller is going to be able to do more and more. That's the wonders of unlocking gameplay at a pace so that the gamer can get comfortable with the other controls first. I will tell you this, the light shot is your friend, so don't forget about it, that is all.So you are the bad-ass Garcia Hotspur. You've got a chip on your shoulder because this punk demon has taken your girl, and now its time to bash some heads. This to me definitely got me hooked and I had to know where the game would go, and did it go. The overall game was solid, sure there was a couple of hiccups here and there, such as a bit of lag when trying to save the game while you're running around, but overall there wasn't too much to complain about. I will say that it took me a bit to figure out how to take out some of the stronger demons, but once I found out what the universal weak spot was, that became just a bit easier to handle. Now let's take a second to talk about the guns. Your main gun shoots bones, and so to keep things simple the gun is called the Boner. You'll soon find that you'll be adding a machine gun to your arsenal that shoots teeth, and that will be called the Teether. Now the real interesting thing about the weapon system is the fact that you're not having to tote around those weapons and having to reach into a bag to switch them out. Your good old floating skull, ex-demon, Johnson actually changes into all the weapons that you'll be using. To make like a bit easier every gun you'll have will be color coded. So if you check the color of Johnson's \"glow\" you'll figure out real quick what gun you have equipped.There's some puzzle aspects to this game that kind of remind me of trying to find the red key to get into the next room in Doom. You'll have to keep your eyes peeled for an eyeball, a brain, and a strawberry. There will be doors that will require one of these items to open up, sometimes its required to get through the level, other times you'll just want to use them to unlock ammo stashes or the wonderful red gem (which allows for upgrades). There's also another puzzle mechanic, though, this one deals with having to be in the darkness to destroy a \"sensor\" that will open up a door, which is usually described as covered in demon pubes.This game definitely is for the more matured, and maybe slightly demented, but this game is good. I really enjoyed playing this game from end to end, and I think there's room for a second game in the series. Sure there was moments where I had to wonder why I was playing this with some of the over the top parts, but overall I just couldn't put the controller down long enough to really contemplate that kind of thing. If you like what Suda 51 has done in the past you're not going to be disappointed with this game. I have to give this game a 9.3 out of 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Decent action game, terrible survival horror game","reviewText":"Not every game can be a paradigm-shifting masterpiece.  After years of trying to perfect Resident Evil 4 (including at least two completely scrapped attempts), it hit the Gamecube like a storm and completely changed how people viewed the venerable survival horror series.  It was as perfect a game as I've seen recently, with amazing pacing, the perfect meaty length, intense action sequences and enough horror to still call it a horror game.  In an ironic twist, Gears of War took inspiration from Resident Evil 4 and now Capcom returns the favor by taking some inspiration from Gears of War for Resident Evil 5.  Unfortunately, they didn't take it far enough.If I had to sum up my Resident Evil 5 experience in a few words, I'd say it was frustrating, exciting, annoying, action-packed, thrilling and ultimately a little bit unsatisfying.  If RE4 threw out the entire kitchen but kept the sink (the horror), RE5 ditches the sink entirely.  And that's where my problems come in.Before I get too far ahead, the story is probably the weakest part, unfortunately.  As convoluted and B-grade as it is, part of my love for the RE series stems from the stories.  Here we have Chris Redford and his partner Sheva, members of the BSAA, who are in Africa trying to track down a man named Irving.  Of course, the area they go into is swarming with a new form of Plagas-infected townspeople and Chris has ulterior motives in going to Africa that ties into his backstory.  The story is kind of a mess and is easily the weakest in the series.  The best part comes at the end as it brings closure to some story fragments started way back in 1998.A lot of people complain about the controls.  While the emphasis on action seems counter-balanced by the stiff controls, its the same control scheme used in RE4.  And that's fine with me, for the most part.  The further reliance on action does tend to add some aggravating moments but I honestly didn't realize there was a control problem through most of the game.  The action sequences run from very good to just decent, with a few set pieces that really deserve attention.  And of course the boss fights are hugely over-the-top and add some of the best moments of the game in terms of variety.No, my biggest grief with the game is that it feels like a strange alien copy of a series I've loved for over 10 years.  Where's the horror, I kept asking myself.  Where are the scares?  I would have been satisifed with a cheap window-shattering scare by the time the game was over.  Everything just felt so...run of the mill.  Most of the great parts of Resident Evil 4 were recycled.  The beginning sequence where you're chased around for a time, moving quietly to avoid detection, QTEs, fights against giant rejects from Lord of the Rings...it all felt so familiar.  And it doesn't do much much to push the genre forward.If anything, it takes a few steps back.  I love co-op as much as the next gamer, but horror is based about feelings of isolation and it's hard to have that feeling when not only is there another person with you, but it seems as if at any time, the cavalry can arrive to shoot missiles and provide backup.  Playing through the game with a real person is a fine and fun experience, but a lot of people will be forced to play with the sometimes good A.I. partner and that's a shame.Sheva, as controlled by the computer, does an adequate job most of the time.  She's a rapid healer and isn't selfish with ammo.  But she also is guided by AI principles and does some absolutely stupid things at the worst possible time.  Like jumping off a cliff and running back, through the final boss who insta-kills her (and ends your game).  Try having that happen to you three or four times.  I have never been so frustrated at a game, but when death is sometimes predetermined based on the whims of your partner and not actual skill, my frustration meter goes through the roof.Overall, I enjoyed my ten (definitely not the 17 of RE4) hours spent in Resident Evil 5's twisted world.  It provided enough variety and fun to warrant a couple play throughs, especially with a human partner.  However, I never got the giddy feeling I felt playing Resident Evil, RE2 or RE4.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a go because it does offer some great moments toward the end of the story and surprised me with how it ended, but don't go in with the same expectations of RE4.  Here's hoping that Resident Evil 6, with its proposed \"complete reboot,\" puts the kitchen sink back in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2009"}

True to its name and following the lead of its predecessor,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it places players in modern combat settings, as opposed to the WWII environments of the earlierCall of Dutygames. This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Best Military Combat Game Ever!!!","reviewText":"CoDMW-2 isn't perfect, but it's the best military combat game to date!  Here's why:Concept: 10/10CoDMW-2 puts you in the heat of battle as a US Marine and a British Special Forces Operative.  You'll be planting explosives, sniping, firing gatling guns, rescuing hostages, stealthily wiping out enemy bases, and using the most sophisticated military weaponry available.  As in the first Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the action is fast and furious.  It only takes a second to take out an enemy soldier, but it only takes a second for them to take you out as well.  To make matters worse, bullets can go through wooden walls, so you really need to be careful about where you take cover.  You can also use this to your advantage, and shoot enemies through some of the walls as well.  CoDMW-2 offers a fairly short campaign with 4 difficulty levels, a wide range of stand-alone missions that you can play single player or two player through Xbox Live or Split Screen with 2 Controllers.  CoDMW-2 also has a bunch of multi-player games for 6-16 Players - Free-For-All, Search & Destroy, Demolition, Domination, Team Deathmatch, and Capture The Flag.  It's amazing how much gameplay fits into such a little box!!!Graphics:  10/10One of the greatest looking games of all time!!!  From the levels, to the detailed character models, to the explosions, to the visual effects...  This game looks fantastic!Story:  3/10The story is told through cutscenes and in game dialogue during the missions.  The cutscenes look great and the voice acting is Hollywood Blockbuster Quality.  However, when Infinity Ward was making this game, they made the levels first, and then tried to tie them all together... and it shows.  Although the cutscenes are great, what happens throughout the game is ridiculous.  It makes about as much sense as the latest GI JOE or Transformers 2 movies.  Although, the story looks and sounds great, it will leave you scratching your head thinking, \"I'm supposed to believe what?!?!\"Gameplay:  9/10CoDMW-2 keeps the action intense by allowing the characters to die quickly.  But the game also assists you with your aim.  You use the right analog stick to look around and when you are close, you hit the Left Trigger to snap to the nearest enemy.  This eliminates the frustration of trying to put a cursor on a moving target with an analog stick, and makes you feel like some kind of Delta Force Hero.  All of the guns are fun to use and fun to shoot, and it feels great to wipe out a bunch of enemies.  There are some vehicles in this game, but if you use one, you're either on a rail or driving on a fairly narrow track.  This isn't Halo where you can jump into a Warthog and attack the map creatively.  Nor is this Red Faction Guerilla where you can jump into a tank and level buildings.  Instead, CoDMW-2 uses vehicles to break up the levels and inject a different kind of excitement into them.  It's a good change of pace, but definitely feels like there is something missing.Levels:  9/10Most of the levels are fantastic and some are just plain good.  Graphically they're all amazing and varied.  From the streets of Brazil, to the caverns of Afghanistan, to the streets of the USA, to the snow covered mountains of Kazakhstan... this game delivers!  The visuals are phenomenal and the action is top notch!Multiplayer:  10/10There are loads of maps for the multiplayer modes and a wide variety of mission objectives ranging from Free-For-All, to Team Deathmatch, to Capture the Flag...  What sets multiplayer apart from the other shooters out there is its reward system otherwise known as PERKS.  When you start playing Multiplayer, you're pretty weak.  After a while, you can customize your own Character Classes.  You can create 5 unique Classes and you can select the following.  A Primary Weapon (sniper rifle, assault rifle, riot shield...), A secondary Weapon (sub-machine gun, pistol, shotgun...) Equipment (grenade, throwing knife, claymore), Secondary Grenades (flashbang, stun grenade...), and PERKS (fast reload, faster run speed, higher accuracy...)  You unlock more gear and upgrades like a laser sight or a grenade launcher by collecting experience points.  You can unlock Perks by earning Experience Points and completing Challenges.  There is so much customization, you can create any type of character that you can imagine.  Specialize in Stealth, Speed, Damage, Explosives... etc.  You are also given additional rewards for killing 3,4,5... enemies in a row and the rewards are great!  Locate enemies on the radar, place your own sentry gun, call in your own airstrike from a Predator Drone...  If you're new at shooters, that's ok too!  The game also gives you special abilities if you die a few times without killing any enemies.  You can respawn with extra health, you can even \"borrow\" the powerful gear from the guy that killed you for a life.  If you die a few times and eventually kill a guy, the game rewards you with extra experience for turning your death streak around, so even sub-par players can advance rapidly.Sound:  10/10The vehicles, gunfire, and explosions are Hollywood Blockbuster Quality!Maturity:  There's shooting, blood, intense violence, and foul language. (Because Marines don't say, \"Awww Shucks\" or \"Oh Fudge!\" so use parental discretion with kids.)Overall:  9.5/10Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is not perfect, but it delivers hours and hours of pulse pounding action!  The level of polish on the graphics and gameplay is outstanding!  The game is fun and if you take advantage of the Multi-Player Modes, you can be entertained for over 100+ hours... easy.Buy it if you want an intense military shooter and you have Xbox Live or a friend that can play the Coop Missions with you 'Split Screen Style.'Rent it if you just want to finish the campaign.  You can get through it in about 6 hours.Avoid it if you don't like Intense Action, Military Battles, or Mature Games.If you liked this game, you should try Halo 3, Gears of War 2, Red Faction Guerilla, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced  Warfighter 2, or the Battlefield games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}

You're Alicia, a black-wearing witch of the future who is humanity's only hope for survival. The city landscape has been overrun with gigantic demons.I'm always thrilled when they have females as main characters, especially in traditionally male-dominated areas such as shooters. You do have to deal with the fact that these females are usually busty and very skimpily clad, but progress doesn't always come quickly. In this case, the belly-dancer-garbed witch carries gigantic swords and uses magic. She's up against nasty looking, gigantic demons which stomp around a dark, grafitti-filled city. Think the future of Terminator, but with demons instead of robots.These maps are very large, dark, and nicely detailed. On the other hand, there often is no directional indicator - so you're wandering for long periods of time around a huge map, with no idea of where to go next. It can get frustrating. Now, while I thought for example that the brickwork and detail of the sewers was of good quality, my boyfriend's comment at this point was \"the game starts stupid-looking, and slowly advances to mediocre\".The enemy demons are a mixed bag. Sometimes they show reasonable AI, hiding from your shots, strafing you and so on. At other times, you can just sit behind a wall while they come at you one by one, getting \"stuck\" on the corner and letting you plink at them like a shooting gallery.The sound is reasonably nice, changing from throbbing battle-music to more low key skulking-through-the-sewers songs. Voice acting isn't high end, but it's not awful either.My main complaint with the game is that it is rather short. I suppose you could say it takes a while because of the lack of a map, but once you actually know where you're going, the game has little gameplay. Games on the XBox 360 often stretch on for weeks and weeks, providing very enjoyable gameplay all along. With Bullet Witch, you can probably end the game in a day of playing without all that much effort. That's just not enough enjoyment for the price of a game - or for the investment of your energy to learn the button scheme and connect with the characters. It's like getting fond of a new TV series, and learning who all the individuals are - and then having it get cancelled only a few shows in. You were expecting much more.A great idea, but I think the game needed a few more months in development to flesh out the AI and add on more storyline / maps to fully complete it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2007"}

Blob does that by jumping on color inks and then using that ink to touch other things, buildings, billboards, citizens called Graydians and all other objects within their world. Blob rolls and jumps and as he colors his world, a kind f fusion funk jazz plays and changes depending on the color being used.The levels are timed but you can earn extra time by completing tasks and freeing Graydians from their dull, colorless buildings.

The plot involves bringing color back to a city where evil beings have turned everything monochrome.De Blob is literally a blob of paint.  The player paints things by simply hitting into them.  Three basic colors are available - blue, yellow, and red.  These can be mixed to create purple, brown, orange and green.  I wish a greater variety of hues and tones could be created, but for simplicity's sake the game sticks to the basics.As de Blob rolls around the city, he has the option of taking up various challenges - such as painting a block a specific color or gathering enough paint to free prisoners from jail.  The challenges are optional for the most part, so if a player finds a challenge too difficult it can be skipped.The game can be as difficult or easy as a player wants.  Side missions include things like painting all of the billboards or trees in a given area.  It can become quite challenging to complete all of the side missions.  Again, that is completely up to the player.I am very picky when it comes to the ability to control a character and de Blob is quite easy to control.  Sometimes jumping can get a little annoying, but overall the game's controls work well.I only have a couple of complaints.  The first is that players can not save while in a level.  I enjoy completing everything in one level at once.  This can take two or more hours at a time, so I wish I could save my progress.  Also, the music can get incredibly monotonous and irritating unless you love jazz.  I wish players could use their own mp3's for the background music.Overall, this game is a lot of fun and can be played by almost anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Evil has indeed evolved","reviewText":"Every once in a while a game comes out that blows us away with its innovation and every once in a while that innovative title is a huge hit. This was the case of the original Resident Evil. Sadly RE suffered the fate of every other big hit. Sequeled and special editioned to death until those innovations are erased from our minds.Talk to every Nintendo Gamer and they'll tell you, we loved the graphics of RE and RE0 but the control style was terrible. The games did respectably well (both selling over a million units) but nowhere near what was expected. The RE spin-offs on the Playstation meanwhile have also not fared well, (RE Dead Aim bombed, while RE Outbreak has only sold through some 500,000 copies). The reason for this is simple. The mechanics of the RE series have remained virtually unchanged since the very original 1996 Resident Evil for PS1, and Playstationites were growing tired of the tried and true mechanics. Nintendans in the mean time were used to free roaming analogue control (akin to the Marios and Zeldas, and Eternal Darkness games) and didn't like the mechanics at all.But PS2 and GCN do have one thing in common. Despite our complaints about the repetitive, stagnate, and stale game play of previous entries we've all had our eyes on RE 4, especially since RE4 will undoubtedly look the best on the GCN. Later this year the game will hit PS2 with extra costumes, and a couple of extra cut scenes, but Ps2 does 1 texture per pass, GCN does 8. The GCN is also capable of many more more polygons per second than the PS2. The weaker graphic capabilities of the PS2 will severely hurt the presentation, where as with the GCN version you have a game that is simply put the best looking console game of this generation. More over, the game promised a new game play experience. Capcom delivered and then some. While it's a bit more action focused than previous RE games it's frantic pace will keep your heart racing and you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire game. This game holds no bars. It is hard, it is frantic, and it's also a good 20-30 hours long. Much longer than previous RE outings. Additionally, to the naysayers, keep in mind that the GCN will have this game exclusively for at least another 10 months, and unless there's an Xbox version no amount of PS2 extras will stop the GCN version from having the best presentation. Don't believe me? Do you have a wide screen HDTV that can zoom in while in Progressive Scan mode? Well, if you do play this game in Progressive scan, zoom in and be prepared to be wowed in a way that no other game this generation will EVER wow you. And be prepared to loose a massive amount of detail if you hold out for the PS2 version.Thank you Capcom. On a percentage scale you get a 98% (because animals needed fur rendering and didn't get it. It is literally my only complaint). Your innovation shines through in this amazing update to a long stale franchise.Nintendans go get this game!PS2 fans buy a GCN and then go get this game!Update: Reliable sources are reporting that the PS2 version will be severly scaled back. IE Leon's 10,000 polygon model will be cut down to 5,000, and the texture work will be scaled back severely. Characters on screen will also be reduced. Sadly this should come as a suprise for no one. Look at viewtiful Joe. Even with the extras the PS2 version is still visually and auraly inferior to the GameCube original. What are you waiting for? If you don't have a Game Cube go get one! Its worth it for this game alone!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2005"}

In the past the game has prided itself on realistic martial arts battles as opposed to Street Fighter where you basically have two dudes tossing fireballs at each other all day. Tekken's slogan was \"The burning in your chest is from your broken ribs, not from some fireball.\" True that the game featured occasional forays into the supernatural, like Devil, who, unfairly, had a laser beam while you of course didn't. Seems to me that Ogre in Tekken 3 didn't though. Its been a while since I've played it, but Ogre was beatable, shoot even True Ogre went down if you applied the right combos. Heihatchi was the boss of part 4, and he too was beatable (though the overall Tekken 4 experience wasn't as good as it should have been.)Then part 5 something horrible happened. The end guy was a super powered mega-demon with all kinds of fireballs and other super-powers which made him extremely difficult, verging on impossible for a casual fan such as myself to beat. As if a collective cry of anger from franchise fans went out to make that boss battle more fair Namco/Bandi released Tekken Dark Resurrection for PSP, PS3 Network, and arcades, and the end boss was significantly easier. To give you an idea, I have everything unlocked in Dark Resurrection, all endings, etc. I could only get a few for the original version of Tekken 5.Tekken 6 has a lot wrong with it, as much as I'd like to love it. Its fighting engine is the same old same old, the arcade mode features no story elements, which is an area where part 4 and 5 nailed it. Instead the game forces you to go through the games scenario mode in order to see the beginnings and endings for each character that should be a natural part of the arcade experience.The game's scenario mode makes several mistakes. Level designs could have been done two generations ago. They're repetitive, unimpressive, and uninspiring. The combat itself is clumsy, as it takes an engine designed for an arcade one on one fighter and crams it into a brawler which needs a more custom tailored engine. My biggest problem was the fact that there's simply no effective lock on mechanism so you often find yourself overshooting your target and exposing yourself for painful retaliation. Many of your opponents will block excessively with no penalties to them and because of the way the combat engine is set up the throw commands just don't work very often, whereas in arcade mode they work fine. It's a terrible frustration. The scenario mode also experiences a dramatic increase in difficulty toward the end of it, and it's sudden. The games bonus levels are also virtually Impossible.Then there's the coliseum, which is where you have to unlock the individual character's back stories and endings. This means fighting Azazael, the end boss, and like Jinpachi before him he comes with all kinds of tricks that you don't get. You don't get fire balls, he breast crystal pellets. You don't get to teleport, he does, you don't get magic hand, he gets magic claws, oh and did I mention he's got an optic blast? An optic blast! I hear you have to fight the NANCY robot too at some point, and that it's even worse.Tekken, what happened to you. You used to mock the fireball fighters, now you put your players at a nightmarish disadvantage by pitting them against characters who are loaded with supernatural powers. I mean we didn't mind Devil, or True Ogre because they were at least balanced enough to be beatable in a couple of tries... Not so much with the original Jinpachi, and Azazael is far, far worse than Jinpachi was... except, oddly in scenario mode where he goes down in a flash... But not in the coliseum, and not in arcade mode where he is an all but unstoppable force of evil... Like the Democrats!The sound is alright, par for the course, really, but there's too many dialogue boxes which need to be read and not enough voice work, which would have been fine last generation, but for this one is inexcusable laziness. Furthermore, most of what dialogue there is, is in Japanese, which is fine for those who want it. But I am no fan of reading subtitles and would have preferred to have an English language option, especially since some characters DO speak English and receive responses in Japanese. It's an odd choice, and one that doesn't work that well. What voices are done in English are not done well, which is especially sad because Tekken, as a series, is a game with a convoluted storyline which could benefit from some decent voice work.Speaking of convoluted stories... What the heck just happened? I got some key elements of the story, but most of it is just gibberish. I get that Lars is actually the half-brother of Kazuya, and that he's out to stop Jin from unleashing evil on the world... apparently there's a world  war between two corporations... cause the free market's always the bad guys and governments are never ever responsible for wars, right? Right? Yeah, an ounce or two of left wing paranoid stupidity makes its way into what little discernable plot there is. Someday they'll figure out that its governments that get us into wars not corporations... but until they do we'll humor them. The story moves painfully slow, and the scenes are shot poorly. In a nutshell there's too many shots where there is nothing going on but the characters standing their with their mouths hung open, and these shots go on, and on, and on.The graphics are the biggest disappointment. When PS2 came out Tekken Tag Tournament was right there to push the fighting game industry forward with jaw dropping graphics. Tekken 4 stepped it up again, and Tekken 5 almost looked (in its day) like it was a Next Gen title. It was awe inspiring for its time, especially for the weak PS2 hardware. This game may have looked good had it been a PS2 or Xbox game. On today's hardware, and given that it's been around three years in development, the overall package feels dated, and not worth $60.00 Some of the texture work for the characters looks decent, but after we've had Resident Evil 5, Metal Gear Solid 4, the recent Call of Duties, and even the surprisingly good looking (albeit poorly animated lip synching) Silent Hill Homecoming it just looks dated. Tekken 6 should have been a launch title for the new systems. By current standards it just doesn't even compare, especially when up against the drop dead gorgeous and highly stylized Street Fighter IV.On the plus side the game features 40 characters, the largest roster of the series yet. It even has a character as big as I am that is handled respectfully and is quite a bruiser too! That's a nice juxtaposition to SFIV's idiot fat guy Rufus, or of course the reason fat martial artists never get taken seriously, Beverly Hill's Ninja... Go ahead underestimate me, but if this game were played by motion captures, Azazael would prove no match for my Tiger Claw...All in all a decent two player head to head, but a scenario mode which leaves much to be desired, and a cheap and nearly unbeatable final boss in arcade mode and the coliseum which leaves the player frustrated. This game feels rushed and incomplete, which is inexcusable for how long it's taken them to get the game done. Three years should be plenty. Add to it disappointing graphics and uninspired sound and too much text, and a useless customization mode with over priced clothing that does nothing for the character (unless you find the goods in scenario mode's treasure boxes) it's an awful lot to have to pay $60.00 for what ends up being the worst installment of this series. My hope is that they will make it up to us by selling DLC which will tone Azazael down.In all, with all its disappointments and frustrations its hard to justify giving this game more than 2 and  stars out of 5 if you are only examining the single player experience. I will give it a 3, however, in that its multiplayer is a blast, as always, but Tekken is moving down the path toward unplayablility for casual player such as myself,  I hope Namco/Bandi will pull back the difficulty in future installments, especially for those of us playing on easy. Remember, some of us have jobs. I don't have all day to memorize every little nuanced combo, and how to count the frames so I can land my attacks just so. Developers making fighter games need to factor that in. Easy mode is supposed to be for the casual player who doesn't have the time or desire to really master the game, which I think is... well most of us.A 3 out of 5, but that is me being very generous.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2009"}

This is the best part of the game next to arcade and scenario mode. i have spent hours upon hours conjuring new characters from my own ideas and a few iconic characters:Dante from Devil May Cry,Rambo,Snake Plissken,The Terminator,Soultaker,Kenshiro,Snake Eyes,Bionic Commando,Bruce Lee,etc.what's cool is that the weapons like bryan's gatling gun or miguel's pistola are not just for show, you can actually use them by pressing three buttons simutaniously.The Bad: Poor camera during scenario mode,Lagging during some online matches (however Namco is working on an updated patch that should  fix that problem.) and the only way to see the ending of each character is through scenario mode.The music is kinda weak although the yodolling song is cute.Thank god for xbox's custom soundtrack option. (NuMetal Band Disturb's song Decadance is perfect for the final boss round.)The Ugly: Bob!  online players who rely too heavly on cheap/desperate moves.and speaking of cheesy, the last boss Azazel is a pain in the ass. For those who refuse to Man up, try easy mode.Overall, Tekken 6 is a contender for fighting GoTY and a great diversion from all the FPS as of late.When compared to SFIV, I would give tekken the edge as there are more characters to choose from, more moves,bonus ingame and customization with more colors and features that don't require shelling out MS points. *Cough*Street Fighter 4*Cough* Great game at a great price.You can't go wrong with this gem.Four Stars!

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"Excellent Action RPG!","reviewText":"Don't avoid Kingdom Hearts because of the Disney characters and locales. Regardless of whether you love Disney or loathe them, this game is fun for any fan of RPG's (or even action games). The story is a little bit less convulted and complicated than Final Fantasy. Still, I was surprised at the complexity of the story. The combat is action oriented, with the player atacking by pressing X (like Zelda) and scrolling through a menu to use items/ magic etc. (like Final Fantasy). I found the battle system to be quite satisfying and very well thought out.The best part of the game was the worlds which you must rid of evil. They are from the world of Disney, and Square really brings the Worlds alive. All of the worlds are populated with various characters from Disney movies as well. However, the beauty of these worlds is that they are amazing even if you are not a fan of Disney. You can truely appreciate Sqaure's genius, regardless of your stance on Disney. And there are plenty of cool cameos from various Final Fantasy games that Square fans will absolutely love (Tidus, Yuffie, and many more I'll let you discover yourself...)Unfortunately the game does have some shortcomings. 1st of all, the main mini game, the Gummi Ship builder, just plain sucks. It is boring, impossible to &quot;play&quot;, and an all around waste of time. The second problem is the camera during battles. Sometimes it swings out of control wildly, leaving you unable to see your party on screen.Overall, for 20 dollars, Kingdom Hearts is well worth your time.Disney or no Disney, this is one game RPG gamers will not want to miss. If you are a Disney fan, I highly recomend picking this up, just to see all your favorite Disney characters running around, and for all the inside jokes. All I know is that I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 2!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2004"}

The nameless lead character is introduced to us as a young boy, enjoying the last few days of his innocence, when a surprise bandit raid results in the senseless slaughter of every living soul in his hometown. And, just as the bandits are about to finish the deed by wiping our young narrator from the face of the planet, he's saved at the last moment by a powerful warrior who takes the boy under his wing and trains him at his nationally-recognized \"hero school.\" I'm sure you can imagine where the story leads from there... a never-ending hunt for clues about the fate of his family, and a bloodthirsty search for revenge. Well... maybe \"bloodthirsty\" is a bit too strong of a word for this uncharismatic main character, since the limits of his emotional range seem to be mild annoyance and very slight pleasure.There's no connection whatsoever between the main character and the main villain (which is, generally speaking, supposed to be the story's \"home run\" relationship) so their ultimate collision means next to nothing. Avoiding all the sidequests, the main plot itself is really quite short and despite all the emphasis on your decisions throughout the game affecting its outcome, the one single decision that makes a difference doesn't arrive until after you've laid the finishing touches on the end boss.In about as short a terms as I can define it, this game plays like a mixture of Onimusha, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Obviously, with the storyline's central focus being the main character's constant struggle between darkness and light, (and the way his everyday decisions affect that status) the comparisons to KOTOR almost write themselves. Your appearance slowly changes from everyday to angelic to demonic, depending on your decisions, and is gradual enough to keep the player from noticing straight away. Likewise, by increasing your attributes in the strength or magic departments, you either slowly grow in size and stature or whither away into a shriveled, powerful magician.Like Onimusha, you don't receive the experience from your battles until you've chased down the little glowing green bubble that bursts out of the bodies of your fallen opponents. The EXP will fade away if you don't get to it in time, but you can give it a little tug in your direction by holding the \"R\" button. Accumulated experience can be spent on different abilities, (such as additional strength, the capacity to take more damage, better aim with your bow and arrow, more spells to cast in the heat of a battle, extra speed, etc.) as though you were merely shopping for items.And, like all of Zelda's post-N64 titles, the actual hackin' and slashin' is both challenging and enjoyable. You'll occasionally run into trouble trying to target a specific enemy in a horde, or maintaining a lock on your target while dodging arrows and blades, but that's acceptable and actually quite a ways more realistic than most of the competition. Plus, the battle system itself is loose enough to make correcting for these quirks a snap. You can choose between fighting close range with a blade, short or long range with a bow and arrow, or any distance with your magic, with each method offering unique pros and cons.As you make your way through the game, you retrieve your main quests from the \"Hero School\". Apparently, a big part of the school's (and your character's) funding comes from the completion of various tasks, missions and requests as proposed by the world's citizens in need. Your quests range from \"help the merchant through the dark, scary woods\" to \"hunt down and decapitate the bandit mastermind,\" and are all over the board in terms of difficulty, length and reward. Gameplay is a dream come true.The graphics are tough to classify. On one hand, they don't even compare to the photorealism of some of their contemporaries, but on the other... they don't really aim to. There's a visual flair to the graphics of Fable, a distinct style that alludes to photorealism but retains the kind of personality, emotion and, for lack of a better word, humanity, that's missing from most games. While they don't look exactly like the kind of people you'd see walking down the dirt roads of the local renaissance festival, they've got just as much emotion in their expressions, reactions and personal flair.The audio is a home run. The villagers have almost thousands of different expressions, reactions, quips, comments and responses to fit any situation. The easily-identifiable British accent of every character in the game helps Fable stand apart from the pack, and solidifies its timeframe somewhere in the middle ages. The villagers even borrow a few lines from Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail, and while that's one of the most wrongfully-quoted movies of all time, it's used sparingly and effectively here and feels more like a funny side joke than an annoying, forced homage. The musical score is minimal, and the occasionally-necessary transition from the \"wandering alone in the forest\" theme to the \"ambushed by thieves\" theme is quick, seamless and effortless. It does its job.Basically, in Fable you've got a game that looks great, sounds great, plays like a dream, incorporates some unique new gameplay elements, features some outstanding voice acting, attempts to perfect on some tried-and-true existing mechanics, and simply lacks any sort of mentionable storyline. If you can live with making that one sacrifice to enjoy all the greatness that surrounds it, you'll really enjoy yourself with this. The big problem here wasn't necessarily in the game itself, but in all the hype and delays that cornered the title before it could even hit the market and the lack of focus on a clear, interesting story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2004"}

It did not feel right to me for some reason. Maybe it was because I was so used to the guns, gameplay in MW2, or maybe it was the cold war era setting that made me compare the price of the game vs time to think I just paid $10 at the ticket entrance in 2010 to watch Rambo first blood part 2.... After a few days playing the campaign and spending crazy amount of hours in the multiplayer, I have to say, this is my favorite game online right now. It has so many game modes online being barebones, hardcore, domination, free for all, classic free for all. .... etc. It has Zombie 4 co-op multiplayer, the weapons are in between MW1 era and after WAW. so I think they are pretty balanced overall. The campaign was the longest of the series, or at least it felt that way. The maps!! I really like the maps. The are closed quarters, and has open field areas. They feel just right specially Cracked (my favorite) and Summitt. I think if you give this game a chance, play it for a few days it will start growing on you. Also, I think this game has one of the best graphics out there too, so I'm not sure why a lot of people said the graphics were horrible. Overall, I will definitely be playing this game like I did MW2 in which it never came out of my ps3. Now I feel like I would if I paid $10 to go see Rambo FBp2 today at the movies but the movie is in THX sound with HD video with deleated scenes and on 3D :) if that makes sense.

A simple story, yet this game is loads of fun.  You begin with a wooden sword, but can upgrade twice to a more powerful sword (the White Sword, and the Master Sword).  As you progress in the game, you acquire various items (a raft, whistle, candle, boomerang) that will held you conquer later dungeons.  The idea behind this game is so basic, but it has produced some of the best games on any system (Zelda: A Link to the Past, Zelda: Ocarina of Time).  Even considering how good some of the later games are, this one remains my favorite to play.  When you conquer the game once, there is still a second world for you to play through.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"It Was Fun For a Few Hours","reviewText":"I'll admit from the start that I'm more a fan of real-time strategy games.  But since RTS games on consoles still haven't measured up to PC performance, I decided to give this game a rent.  I'm glad I only spent $8 instead of $60!It's a GOOD game - I had fun playing it... ...the first few times.  After that it became very repetitive and I felt it growing old very quickly.  In just one week of renting the game, I beat a game with every civilization (there are 16 if I recall) and won a game via every available method - Conquest, Technological, Financial, and Cultural.  I finally reverted to the \"lightning round\" scenario games which only lasted about 15 minutes each.I found that the maps - essentially a globe - were often very tight spaces and made expansion difficult to control.  It was often challenging enough to find ROOM to place a city, nevermind finding good placement for producing various resources.  This wasn't always an issue, but seemed to be the case more often than not.The gibberish from the \"assistants\" quickly became annoying.  I don't understand how, with gaming as advanced as it is today, characters can't TALK to us.  My car talks to me, for crying out loud.The end of each game is where things became the most frustrating.  Often times I would simply be riding from turn to turn, trying to let every possible \"great person\" appear before time ran out.  I would have 10-15 cities, each with every possible building upgrade.  Yet every turn, I would be asked \"What do you want to build in [city name.]\"  I didn't want to build anything!  And to make matters worse, if you would start building a unit, there was no way to end production of that unit.  The only option was to build a wonder, which would then complete the game.  Furthermore, if the city builds a building and then you give it no additional item to build, it will store your production credits.  Later, when you decide you want ONE military unit, it'll use all of it's stored production credits and build as many units as those credits will allow.  One time, I tried to build ONE spy in a city that had been dormant for many turns - it built 57 of them!!  This forced me to sit for a few minutes selling 56 of them back for gold credits.The biggest downfall to Civ-Rev is a limited range of reuse.  Yes there are 4 methods to victory and 16 different civilizations.  There are also different scenarious that may place bigger emphasis on fighting Barbarians, or using naval strategy - even one that places you on a different planet and replaces Barbarians with Aliens.  These give you a different look to things, but the game still plays the same.  The only challenges left at that point are earning Xbox achievements, and some of them - such as winning each victory type in Deity difficulty (the hardest of 5 difficulties) can be downright impossible to some.Some other quick notes - you can scroll quicker using the right stick - select a unit, right-stick scroll to where you want it to move, then just use the left stick to select the specific \"tile\" you want it to travel to.  The lack of a better zoom in OR out was annoying.  Yes you can zoom out, but not by much, and it is tediously slow.  The ability to rush construction of units or buildings was helpful, as was the ability to cease production of a building and convert those credits to a unit.  That came in especially helpful when an army would show up at my door and I had no defending units.Give it a rent and have fun with it.  But only those desperate to conquer the world with a console controller in their hands should consider this a needed purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"A whole new Zelda...definitely worth the wait.","reviewText":"I first remember playing Zelda back in the late eighties, and have played every single installment since then. I still say that the series peaked at \"A Link to the Past\" for SNES, which has not been matched since, even by \"Ocarina of Time\". I have been playing \"The Wind Waker\" for a while now, and I am very pleased with it so far.Like \"Super Mario Sunshine\", the new Zelda title is totally removed from it's traditional setting. While \"Sunshine\" was removed from Bowser's Castle with koopas and buzzy beetles, \"The Wind Waker\" is the first in the series to take place outside of Hyrule. The game takes place on a series of islands, so you can expect plenty of beaches and oceans, with a lot of time spent sailing between them. It seems that the big Nintendo franchises like Mario and Zelda have taken tropical vacations. Personally, I like the new settings fine, although I can see how this will upset Zelda purists, who favor the huge, inter-connected world.The game took flack from the very beginning because of the new, cartoony look to it. It is actually an improvement, since the animation is fluid, and the characters are more expressive. The environments are beautifully drawn out, and the characters have unique facial expressions and personalities. The water stages are especially beautiful. But for the die-hards, there is still plenty of dungeon action. The music provides a hint of nastalgia for the older gamers, with classic zelda tunes aplenty, albeit remixed. The sound effects are also fantastic, but I strongly suggest hooking your gamecube up to your stereo for the full effect.While the look of the game goes against the grain, the gameplay is classic Zelda. The controls are easy to grasp for anyone who has played \"Ocarina of Time\" for any length, and many of the familiar moves are here. The learning curve is also very short, so gamers should have no trouble getting the feel of the game early on. Many of the classic items have also been included, so while the setting and dynamics of the game have changed, \"The Wind Waker\" is still true to it's roots.I will make this a point...This is not just a game for kids, despite the cartoony appearance. Adult gamers will have just as much fun, if not more considering the rich history of the franchise. For the first Zelda to be released in 128-bit, this is an amazing achievement. For those who early on slammed this game based on a few screenshots, play it and then see if you still hate the new look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2003"}

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Ben-Oni \"Darkness\"","summary":"Pokegone.","reviewText":"I bought this game so I could transfer my Pokemon from Heartgold to it and be ready for X and Y, I expected a bunch of awesome creatures for me to spend hours catching at almost any cost.  I dreamed of testing  code after code for my action replay card, and checking off  awesome creature after awesome creature. This game had it all when it came to awesomness: Updated bag,graphics that look slicker and cooler, awesome sounds and they even added a friendship element to the story to make it  extremely enjoyable. They only forgot one  detail....THE POKEMON!!!The Pokemon of the Unova region look like they were  designed  by an anhedonic  35 year old man who does nothing but sit in a cubicle all day. No creativity whatsoever!! NOT A SHRED!!!. Need examples? Alright then. There's &#34;Lilipup&#34; The Puppy Pokemon. Design? A Scottish Terrier.  That's it. A plain old Scottish Terrier.  Evolutions? Herderier. A scottish terrier with long black hair on its back and Stoutland: A Scottish terrier with a  gigantic mustache.Still not convinced?There's ducklett. Design? A duck. Not an interesting ;looking duck like Psyduck. It's quite literally a duck. The kind you see in ponds at the park. A DUCK.Cofagricus? A sarcophagus.Krookodile? Do I need to say it?Here's a fun one!Rogenrola. IT'S A ROCK!!!.Munna? I wish it looked like a moon but if you want me to be brutally honest? It looks like an infected kidney with pink blood  coming out of it.Aside from the starters it isn't worth trying to  catch any new pokemon. at all!!! I can't believe it but heartgold is way superior to this. All the new Pokemon are good for is making you want to get on your knees and thank God above when the main story (I'll get to that next.) is over  and you begin catching the old Pokemon.As previously stated, the friendship element added to the story  is really enjoyable. You'll find yourself battling your friends and interacting with them to some extent. Aside from that, the plot of this game is confusing. It's stated early on that Team Plasma believes that fighting Pokemon  is wrong and oppresses them. It is also clear that they want to liberate Pokemon by stealing them from trainers but the main antagonists were so bland and undeveloped that just how they were planning to do this got lost. I wasn't invested at all. By the time I reached the fourth town my only concern was getting  to the end of the awful game so I could use the transfer lab.Tips:If you can't get your DSI action replay card to work on this game (Mine is very old and came with a disk) and you can't update the firmware:1. click  on the top of DSI code manager(Make sure your AR is connected to the computer with  the usb)2. reset your  Action replay card. This will delete all of the codes on it but do not despair.3. Simply drag and drop the titles you want the codes for from the subscription menu and click save changes afterwards.This should resolve the problem. It worked for me.VERY IMPORTANTOnce you have your action replay working on this game be warned that if you use the &#34;Catch other trainer's Pokemon&#34; option  YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOSE THE BATTLE. In Heartgold you automatically won but that's not the case here.I  found an excellent Amazon seller who only charged me twelve bucks for this  utter disgrace, case and all. I don't  reccommend you  spend anymore than that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Great online, average campaign, all Battlefield","reviewText":"I in a sense had high hopes for Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and it really all came down to one game: the last Call of Duty. Quite frankly, I didn't like it and found myself incredibly disappointed with it so as far as looking for the next \"hardcore\" multiplayer game, the ones that popped up were Bioshock 2 and Aliens vs Predator and this. But whether you're the same way or this'll be your first Battlefield game but there is a bit of switch from Halo and Call of Duty type multiplayers but it's of course set up with the addictive qualities that makes these kind of multiplayer games fun. Not content to be entirely multiplayer driven, Dice did spend quite a bit of time to develop it's campaign more and have an actual story; or should I say try to since it's not really a great campaign so much as a serviceable one, one with quite a bit of issues that I had but Bad Company was the same way, multiplayer was the draw and single player was just that added thing you went to now and then. So how great is the online and to a lesser extent, the campaign? Read on.Story: The story still follows Sarge, Sweets, Haggard and you (Preston Marlowe) as you follow the trail of a secret weapon being developed and you trying to figure out what it does and who's behind it and...that's pretty much it. The twists you'll see coming, the setpieces are cool but have potentially been done better and your squad AI is generally lackluster. I can probably count the amount of kills each soldier had on one hand throughout a single chapter and I feel like I have to do most of the legwork. Couple that with enemies who for some reason have incredibly deadly aim even through thick sand gusts and windy snow areas (and who can apparently hit you extremely long distance with a shotgun of all things) and there was a couple of trial and error parts. One part had me going into a small tunnel only for the door to get breached and out came 3 guys who killed me dead with me not even aware they'd show up so 2nd time? Grenade chucking. Some have said the game is easy but I think the game will be easy generally on your 2nd playthrough but on first time through you'll find yourself going \"oh gee, would've been nice to know that was going to happen beforehand\".Graphics: Here's my one complaint about the graphics....they're kind of bright in that I mean really bright. It seems that Dice really wanted to capture that sun-drenched locale of the desert so much that snowy areas and desert areas has this almost overwhelming bloom effect that makes the environments almost look really high on contrast. Generally it's easy to understand but in one mission in the campaign I had to make my way to a base in the desert and shoot at some would-be ambushers however the sand gust was literally so bright that my entire sniper scoped-in was white and hard to wait for it to die down before I can shoot. I might be the only one or one of few that experienced this though so I don't know if it's a game problem or TV problem despite at least 5 calibrations to the game's brightness and contrast levels.That being said one thing that Dice knows is destruction and destruction in Bad Company 2 is very purty. Things actually seem to get demolished realistically and generally everything seems to be able to be blown apart though that's a sometimes thing since I found myself in campaign and online needing a quick get away only to find a wall couldn't even be blown apart despite the fact that I just blew a hole in one on the 2nd floor. Character models are quite good, one mission in the rain looked gorgeous even and pretty much everything got a nice upgrade from Bad Company 1. No slowdown or framerate issues that I saw either so kudos, Dice.Sound/Music: Dice hands down provides some of the best sound designs for guns, period. While I'm not sure if they're 100% accurate to their real life counterparts, these things just sound so beastly and just so LOUD that it's quite awesome to be in a firefight and have that gun actually sounding like it's a killer weapon. Sniper rifles indeed also have that loud clack, almost like lightning and there's this one sound effect reminiscent of the horns from the tripods in Spielberg's \"War of the Worlds\" that sounds almost terrifying. Voice acting is alright, nothing to get impressed by but you're not exactly laughing at the line readings either. Music is good but there wasn't really that one theme that I frequently hummed like Battlefield Heroes (listen to it and dare you not to start whistling) and the jazziness of the menus seemed to have been replaced by...nothing which is a shame.Gameplay: Pretty much like any other first-person shooter out there. You got your pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, LMG's, SMG's and rocket launchers but you also got some other stuff as well such as piloting tanks, controlling helicopters or a little hell-plane that can laser targets for missiles and firing on ground troops as well as calling in mortar strikes. But the destructible aspects mentioned above do play out in the gameplay since if a guy is hiding behind a wall, just RPG/n00b tube the wall and get him exposed though same tactic can be used against you as well. One thing that I did find cool as well as the supply drops where not only can you re-supply your ammo but you can switch out your guns though generally I always kept an assault rifle and sniper rifle, the latter of which made firefights ridiculously easy.Multiplayer is close to being the same as Bad Company though it's got a few upgrades and some good fun to be had. One change is the idea of what I'd call not a kill-cam but a \"killer-cam\" which shows you who last killed you where you can sort of use it to your advantage and go \"okay, he's hiding behind that rock so next time I can tell my squad to aim for him\". And I don't know if it's just me but the maps seem a bit more compacted but still high in combat and many times playing Rush or Conquest in this game I was constantly seeing action as opposed to Bad Company where I'd be like \"where is everybody...aannnd I got sniped, wonderful\". This part is further frustrated by the game's still apparent inability to put you in a squad, well least the times I played. See, being part of a squad means that you can help support your teammates if they're going for objectives or at the very least provide a 2nd gun in case they encounter someone but if you're not in a squad you either spawn alllll the way back at your base or at one of the capture points which is usually being captured by the other team at the time. And in another oddball move by EA that was first seen in Army of Two: the 40th Day, the \"Squad Rush\" mode is like Rush mode only there's only one thing to destroy which then requires the 2nd to be destroyed further into the map which results in game win however your tickets (how many times the attacking team can die before defending team wins) goes down from 100 to about 20. This however is a Gamestop exclusive pre-order which means if you want to play, had to have pre-ordered, got a spare code from a friend or bite the bullet like the rest of us and wait a month. Grr.One thing that I'm liking about this multiplayer over Modern Warfare 2's and even previous Call of Duty's is that for new players, starting from point zero doesn't automatically mean you can't do well. While hardcore CoD and Battlefield types tend to do really well in matches, for new players or just average players, it can get frustrating to be killed by something that you don't either have access to or don't have a counter for. While you unlock it eventually by getting points using that class specifically, it never feels like all the good stuff is further up the skill tree and your game suffers because of it. That being said there can be some frustrating moments where you wander around wondering whether everyone is only to get sniped or the fact that you can only communicate with whoever is in your squad and not the entire team. And although the game's literally not even 2 weeks old yet, the abundance of Recon classes (snipers) in a match can get absolutely crazy and as an Engineer player myself, it's incredibly annoying to have only 2 Assault classes, 6 Snipers, 3 Engineers and one Medic and not a single Assault class bothers to supply ammo drops so I can take out helicopters/tanks before I get killed by them. That's more of a community thing then a game thing but hopefully it balances out as time goes on.The game also adds a Hardcore mode which is like Call of Duty's in that there's no map and bullets do extra damage which of course leads to the other annoyance about Battlefield games: the amount of bullets it takes to kill someone. Get used to this scenario: come across a guy, decide to shoot him only to notice during shooting that his teammate comes right behind him so while you kill the other guy, you're practically out of bullets which prompts a quick switch to the pistol in hopes that you can down them. However adding hardcore makes it easier so if you can deal with the lack of the map, it should be easier to play.I don't know if I'll be playing Bad Company 2 for a long time. I am having fun with it mind you and it's way better than that other game I mentioned but the average campaign ends up being overshadowed by the multiplayer which you will either put ton of hours into or drop it when something new comes out (such as the Halo Reach beta, maybe) but still, it's the online that's worthy of a purchase though not necessarily the full game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide.

After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.","reviewerName":"P. Hardy","summary":"\"The name's Nilin, and this time, you'll REMEMBER ME...\" (Mild Spoilers)","reviewText":"Though the video gaming community would argue otherwise, 2013 hasn't exactly been a standout year for Video Games. With the exception of \"Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time\" and \"Tomb Raider\", nothing of note has stood out for me as I awaited \"The Last of Us\" to be released in June.Then I, no pun intended, remembered DONTNOD Entertainment's \"Remember Me\", a game I've been struggling to keep track of whenever it was mentioned either in passing or a new trailer was premiered. In a sea of top tier games lost in the mentality of complacency andshoddy game design, \"Remember Me\" (and by proxy, \"The Last of Us\") stands out as that one gulp of fresh air that reminded me old third person platformers that seem deader than the video gaming industry's business practices. And while the latter has yet to prove its mettle, \"Remember Me\" has and it proved it in spades.GAMEPLAY:Part platformer, part brawler, part \"stealth\", \"Remember Me\" combines the familiar trappings of third person action/adventure games into something that works for them. When in engaged in combat, Nilin uses a mechanic known as \"Pressens\"; the affect is something at akin to that of \"Batman Arkham City\" with a little more finesse and a fully customizable section known as the \"Combo Lab\"; the Combo lab allows you to create four combos for active use, tailored to your tastes. Enemies will surround you and it's up to you to create combos based in the style of button combinations you're comfortable with and knock your enemies down fast enough to keep up the momentum. The more momentum (the faster you fight), the music follows in tow, dropping in and out much like it would in EA's \"SSX3\" when a successful trick is pulled off.There is also an \"auto fill\" option for those who don't feel like messing about in the Combo Lab. As someone who is not ashamed to admit she is a glorified button masher (\"throw something at the wall and see what happens\"), nailing the fighting system was a pain the rear. The game's enemies can take a beating, which at times drags the game's fighting sequences out more than it should. The further along in the game you go, the tougher and more varied the enemies become; therefore smart combat is a must unless you want to be stuck in a particular for longer than you need to be.There's also the negative that if a combo is interrupted, the momentum of the fight is throw off immediately and the more clumsy aspects of the combat is revealed. I found myself getting pummeled because I lost the rhythm I grabbed onto early on in the fight. Being interrupted in combat with a prompt announcing a new move or tip was irksome as heck, no matter how informing/helpful it was. So, the combat can be fun, but like most third-person action games, it is by no means refined to the point of an actual one-on-one fighting game. The camera, as usual, is your worst enemy. It spins around the environment at the oddest times and chooses to zoom in on Nilin at the worst times (particular when she stops attacking and the enemy is rearing up to fight again). Again, it was like being thrown into the deep of \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\" and its succeeding games. Why on God's green Earth can't any developer get their camera to work with the player and not against them?Stealth sections (if you can avoiding insta-kill robots stealth sections) of the game tend to be bothersome, but the game does enough with the in-story feature known as the \"Rememrane\" (bits of memories that Nilin uses to navigate unfamiliar locations) that you won't find yourself running into the \"impossible stealth mission\" as though you were playing a \"Splinter Cell\" game. Platforming, is again, akin to that of \"Prince of Persia\", \"Tomb Raider\" and the recent \"Uncharted\" series; in concerns to the latter, there are even \"Uncharted 2\" moments in the earliest section of the game, what with breaking pipes, crumbling platforms and death defying jumps that require you to react the last second or die. Nilin moves fast enough across edges and pipes that there's no rear complaint outside of the stiff animation (and good lord are her animations stiff when she's not idle. And then she does this weird thing with her face wherein she makes little expressions within seconds of each other). Moveable objects in certain areas can help Nilin reach otherwise inaccessible locations and abilities gained (like a digital lockpick) also aid in the platforming and traversing the world around her.In regards to Nilin's unique ability to \"remix\" memories (the big sell of the game itself) --- basically she gets people to remember events how she chooses to manipulate them in their head using Sensen tech --- the segments are very few. There's a grand total of four or so in the overall game (one is the tutorial, the second if a flash back and the last two are primarily plot specific to Nilin's past, which I shall not utter here if you haven't seen the IGN.com videos already), all of them are central to moving the narrative forward.To find out this isn't an ability you can use willy-nilly is disappointing, but I can understand why it's been set up like that. Gameplay consists of moving objects and changing minor details within the environment of the memory enough that the subject doesn't remember the event has it originally happened; trial and error is the basis of this section, as you'll more than likely end up with different scenarios that result in the death of the subject or nothing major enough to change their minds at all. They aren't terribly tricky to figure (the triggers of your control facilitate the functions), but the mechanic itself takes some getting used to during the traverse of the first segment.STORY:The world of \"Remember Me\" is set in a futuristic Paris, France (now known as Neo-Paris); by the year 2084, a company known as Memoryeyes has created a technology (Sensen) wherein the memories of an individual can be shared between another or removed. If you only wanted to remember the good and none of the bad, they could help you achieve that. Clearly, nothing bad can come of this, right? But it does, and that's how it all begins. We're thrown into the tale of Nilin (a notorious \"Memory Hunter\" with the ability to manipulate memories to her whim) as she loses almost everything that makes her who she is.Yet, she clings to her name, which troubles her captors. As she stumbles toward the final process that would wipe the rest of her from the world, a voice comes from nowhere and guides her from the jaws of metaphorical death and into the fire of a dying revolution fighting against the erasure of memories, good and bad. Lost herself, Nilin is never sure who she's working with and if the things she does for them is indeed the right thing. The only thing she's quite certain of, however, is getting even with Memoryeyes and retrieving her memories no matter the cost.As far as conspiracy theory driven stories are concerned, \"Remember Me\"'s set up its pretty great. As Nilin relearns about the world around her, we're given an opportunity to really get to know her through her actions, both through gameplay and narrative. The idea of memories becoming a major financial and social movement that can be shared or removed is an interesting one. It tends to raise the question of the morality behind abusing the necessity of remembering the good, bad and mistakes; the things that are a part of what make a person a person and whether or not one corporation or person should have the power to gather memories wholesale.Yet, as much as I enjoyed the story, I think it gets lost somewhere between focusing on the malformed humans known as \"Leapers\" (how society created them with the Sensen technology if memory serves, and attempts to \"domesticate\" them by forcing them into societal roles without thought to their conditions); Nilin's long forgotten memories and the consequences that it holds for her in relation to the narrative's antagonists. Further hiccups include the motivation of one brief antagonist turned ally; why exactly were they going to dedicate the death of Nilin to their lover? Was Nilin responsible or was she just an easy target? Characters come and go in the narrative, perhaps never really being fully utilized in a way they could be. Nilin and Edge are your constant companions, driving the story forward to its ultimate climax. Effort put into the story of Nilin, however, is absolutely appreciated and I was left incredibly satisfied near the end of the game with Nilin's arc.As a protagonist, Nilin herself is incredibly likeable; as a protagonist she's one I connected to immediately. She avoids most of the expected or accepted \"action girl\" tropes personified in film in a manner that strips her of a personality, excluding death defying stunts and her fantastic circumstances, and is by no means one note. She's the most fun I've had in a long time with a female protagonist since I controlled Faith Connors in \"Mirror's Edge(2008)\" and Jade from \"Beyond Good & Evil(2003)\".Dialog has a tendency to be incredibly goofy and moreover, extravagant. Nilin narrates events of completed levels (from zero to eight, nine chapters in all) in a manner more befitting of a book or a period specific film, Edge speaks in highly poetic and wordy sentences that dance around explaining specifics. \"Remember you soon\" is a rather embarrassing bit of saying; and in a usual fashion, enemies say some of the most action-movie things to our hero, complete with fairy tale references to that bring to light, size, gender and strength differences. None of this is inherently a problem, but it tends to be as noticeable as the \"macho-man\" dialog in Ron Howard's \"Backdraft (1991)\" or the [unintentional] homoerotism in the late Tony Scott's \"Top Gun (1986)\".AESTHETIC:It goes without saying that \"Remember Me\" is one of the prettiest games I've played on the PlayStation 3 thus far. A lot of it is sci-fi, but sci-fi without losing the more familiar elements of the here and now. Sure, cars seem to fly across the highway, robots are objects of servitude and carry your bags, but most of the environment of the city still feels like something you could see every day in a mall without the holographic prompts. The environment feels and looks familiar at the same time it is entirely alien; the familiarity of environment is reinforced by the developers, not so much because they're French, but you can tell they've lived in the world that you are traversing and have exaggerated it for the purposes of the story.The sharp white, yellow and orange colors that pepper the world alongside the neon signs and little anecdotes that reveal two-for-one sales, 30% off sales, danger of broken electrical outlets, and authority notices, all do an incredible job to make the world feel lived in. Like \"Tomb Raider (2013)\", it creates a great open world illusion and while you cannot explore every angle and level of the city, what you are allowed to enter and see up close is amazing.Another great point about the design of the game is that the waypoints/navigation is integrated into the gameplay and environment. There is a great deal about this particular design that really reminds me of DICE's \"Mirror's Edge\" and 2004's \"I, Robot\", only with the first, you feel connected to the place you're moving around.VOICE ACTING:For the most part, the vocal performances from the core cast, with the exception of Headache Jonny, are great. Kezia Burrows breathes life into Nilin and personifies her vulnerability, strength and anger perfectly. She's especially great in the narrative segment wherein Nilin ruminates over her decisions. Kezia is without a doubt the strongest performer in the game. Edge's voice actor is particularly great as well, riding the edge of questionable and trust worthy every time Nilin begins to question his motives and objectives. Outside of that, there a few hiccups here and there from the more minor characters of no consequence and the dialog can feel clumsy coming from the performers. However, the decidedly half-in-half voice acting may be a result of French director, Jean-Max Moris, directing an dub that probably isn't his core language (I dunno). \"Heavy Rain\" experiences many of the same problems with its voice performance, but in a much grander and cringe-worthy scale.MUSIC:Another high point of \"Remember Me\" is undoubtedly its score; Olivier Deriviere has really created something wonderful that can stand on its own and brings to life the world of Neo-Paris through glitch-riddled notes that fall and rise on the beat of combat (how well you do) and the more emotionally driven aspects of the game alongside the scripted action sequences. Stand out themes include \"Neo Paris\", \"The Fight\", \"Memorize\" and \"Memory Reconstruction\". This definitely a score I would buy right alongside the game's artbook; I just wish it was available here on amazon.com.OVERALL:There's a lot that could be argued as to why \"Remember Me\" has received such a lukewarm reception where decidedly lesser games (\"Bioshock: Infinite\") with more problematic elements and holes than Swiss cheese are lathered in gold like the second coming of Christ. The obvious would be that it's different; the protagonist neither male nor white and doesn't quite fit into the comfortable little niche most have come to accept as the template for the \"Next Generation Consoles\" that premiered almost a seven years ago. Regardless, you owe it to yourself to check out \"Remember Me\". It's a fantastic game despite its flaws. [a 4 out of 5]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2013"}

Competitors will vie to be the first to the finish line in a made-for-TV city set rigged to blow with the ultimate goal of becoming the season champion.  Players in Split/Second don&#x2019;t just collide with other vehicles to knock them from the track, but can also trigger devastating events that drastically alter the dynamics of the race.  Players must use pinpoint timing to obliterate huge structures and towering TV set pieces to tactically alter the track or create entirely new routes.","reviewerName":"C. L. Hanson","summary":"Good (but not great) racer","reviewText":"Being a huge fan of the Burnout series (except Paradise), Midnight Club LA , as well as a serious Mario Kart maven since 1992, I felt compelled to buy the full version of Split Second after downloading the small demo on XBox Live. And while I am definitely not disappointed, I feel this game comes up short in comparison to these great racers.The big premise here is you trigger explosions and enviromental disasters to wreck your opponents, by building up your \"power play\" gauge (done by drafting behind your opponents and around corners). The AI system then automatically targets the cars you can wreck. But you've got to be careful who, when and where, because this can backfire on you in a big way.By not squandering your power play, you can fill the gauge entirely to trigger massive events. You are treated to eye candy such as a passenger plane on fire descending onto the track, exploding in a fiery mess of smoke, flame and debris which you must avoid, a building eerily similar to the Space Needle in Seattle collapsing in your way, and sides of mountains exploding sending plume and rock your way. Presentation-wise, you really are made to feel this is a real TV show (of course, the good folks at Disney had a hand in this). It is exhiliarating to take out your opponents in grand fashion, watch the event unfold, and zing past their smoldering wrecks to take the checkered flag. So here is where the game gets my 4 stars.Like most other racers, you start out with slower, poor-handling vehicles and work your way towards the elite vehicles. Like Burnout, you get ficticious but awesome looking cars. A word to the wise, spend plenty of time with the game in story mode and get the best possible vehicles before going online to race. I took my best car ranked as a \"4\" against cars ranked \"10\". Needless to say, I didn't fare well.So, why did I not give the game 5 stars? Not to compare, but in my humble opinion, Burnout Revenge is the holy grail of racers, to which all other racing games aspire. While this game makes no bones to compare to such a game, it would have been nice if when you hit your opponents car, they budge and take damage, instead of cruising along without losing MPH. The AI seems to play the game for you, in the way that events unfold at the same time, every time, with your only level of control being to gain and use power play as you attempt to place 1st. It compares a bit to the Midway re-issue of Spy Hunter for the PS2, where you basically steer around a pre-determined course and avoid taking damage.In this day and age of 1080p HD gaming, the actual gameplay can be lost amidst the graphics (Nintendo has been a massive success doing the exact opposite since 1980). I think the selling point of Split Second would be the massive and incredible explosions which take place around you, with the racing aspect a distant 2nd place.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

Experience the true horror and emotional impact of being a survivor of the undead apocalypse in a zombie game unlike any other. You will meet people and experience events that will impact the story of Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes, and you will be forced to make decisions that are not only tough, but that will have a direct effect on the story that you experience. The undead are everywhere, but they're not your only problem. Starvation, betrayal, heartbreak and more will challenge you as you attempt to survive in the world of The Walking Dead.","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Enter the World of The Walking Dead","reviewText":"Disclosure: Played as a PSN downloadIf you're thinking about getting this game, you're probably thinking some things like: Uh oh...a game based on a book/TV show?....That usually doesn't work. Or maybe you're thinking: Point and click?...Check please! Or maybe you didn't like some of Telltale's past titles?And you know what, some of your concerns may even be valid; it really depends on your expectations for this awesome release, so let me try to set some of those expectations. First of all, The Walking Dead game is for and will be loved by--and loved by is a guarantee, graphic novel readers--any true fan ofRobert Kirkman's source material.Anyone looking to run and gun down zombies will not get that out of this game. You certainly don't have to have read the book or seen the show to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience.The Walking Dead game is no Burn Zombie Burn or some other bash as many zombies' brains in as possible game. This game is a lot more of an RPG than a shooter.You start the game the day the zombie apocalypse begins concurrently from the start of the comic book series. You play as Lee, and just as in the book (and in the TV show)  where the main character Rick was initially thrown into a chaotic journey by himself to find other survivors...that's you as Lee in The Walking Dead game.There are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.The game does give you the option of \"rewinding\" back to a specific checkpoint, and you can go forward from there and choose a different option that overwrites your original decision if that's your style. But I didn't do that until I completed the entire series. I tried to make the main character call \"the right move\" when presented with choice; but there is a time limit when decision time comes, and sometimes you may regret a hasty decision. For example, you'll have to choose one life over another twice during just the first episode, and I'm not sure that I made the \"right\" choice in one of those moments. But I stuck with my decisions until after playing through the entire series just to \"keep it real.\" The game sure does get an A for replay value.Just as in the graphic novel (and the TV show), the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. But this time you don't just watch it unfold on paper or on your TV screen; in this game you're part of the story...you control your integrity, your morality and ultimately your destiny. And there's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead game combined with very believable scenarios. Color me a sissy, but I actually got a little misty over one of the decisions that \"I had to\" make.The Walking Dead game is excellent...especially for just a point and click. It's as gritty and graphic as the comic book, and it's very story-rich. If you read the comic as I do...you'll love it. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. I really do feel like I'm part of a different story arc in the freakin' book! Best 20 bucks I've spent all year...best game of 2012 for me. Plus anyone clamoring for a Platinum Trophy could get an easy one here; all the trophies are unmissable simply by finishing all the chapters in every episode.The Walking Dead game is a deep, personal and emotional adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2012"}

Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"High on entertainment but low on substance","reviewText":"Dead Rising is an entertaining video game due to its fun third-person controls and all the options you have to kill your undead foes, but the plot certainly leaves something to be desired.  If you aren't looking for any form of well-thought out story than you will enjkoy Dead Rising immensely as a bloody chop-til-you-drop game.Gameplay:  Very fun, easy to operate third-person controls that allow you to have fun and contain full control over your character.  There is a wide variety of weapons you can use in the mall ranging from stuffed animals, shotguns, and giant battle axes and there are different ways of using each of these weapons (naturally some are far better than others).  Also, you have your zombie essentials such as head shots being insta-kills.  It's also fun to change the clothes and appearance of your character in the various shops.Graphics:  The graphics are not bad, but could have been better, but for the most part they work incredibly well.  The cut scenes in this game are great.  Gore for zombie kills is over the top, as is to be suspected in ANY zombie game, but I have to say it is some of the most fake looking video game you'll ever see (depending on your stance regarding gore in video games this may be a good or bad thing).Story:  There are lots of characters, but they're really worthless other than the fact that if you follow the story directly (you have the option to do WHATEVER you want in the mall) you can fight more bosses by following the primary story plot.  No matter how far you stray from the game's central plot you're still going to get some boss battles in the form of random lunatics that happen to stroll the mall.  The best part of the game comes when you get to cut scenes involving some of the loonies you must take down.  I'd go so far as to say some of these mini-bosses provide the best, most chilling cut scenes in the entire game and they're still living!Entertainment:  The game is very entertaining, and will keep you glued to the screen for hours on end as you try to find new ways to get through the game, but you won't leave it feeling like you actually did anything.  So this is a game of little substance but BIG on entertainment value.My final verdict is that if you're feeling stressed out and feel that you need to batter and blast away countless numbers of living dead than there is no better game for you than Dead Rising for the Xbox 360...Actually, you don't even need to be stressed out!  If you have a slow afternoon pop this in and the time will just fly on by!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2009"}

Given That You Have The Hardware.","reviewText":"Before I start, I want to list my system specs to justify my review and the game's graphics.GTX570 (x2), Dominator 12GB, i7950, Rampage II Ext., 120Hz Monitor (60Hz 3D), Creative Fatality Pro, Logitech Z5500, Nvidia's 3D Vision (ver.1)Now, after reading a lot negative reviews, I was a bit hesitant to purchase this game, I'm the type of gamer that likes eye candy, specially since I have spent a lot of cash building my PC. So after this went on sale, I said \"why not?\", and I'm glad I did.Graphics:I ran this game with the hardware listed above at 120Hz and holy crap! This game looks amazing. I maxed everything running DX11. At Ultra settings, everything looks outstanding. Sunlight and shadows had me quite impressed. Water effects are also top notch. I spent a lot of time looking at the amazing detail given to weapons, everything from textures to written instructions were carefully done and can be seen clearly. I did encounter some rough edges, but mostly during cinematic cut scenes. I never really cared for those, I mainly pain attention to the areas where I actually take part of. (gameplay)Explosions show beautiful flames and particles, constant flames had a nice blue-ish to orange effect. I don't know what else to list, everything looks good. Dust, dirt, garbage, shadows, light,etc.3D:The default depth was pretty much balanced. I did increase it(F4) to look for ghosting and did see some; it wasn't as bad as L.A. Noire, but it was there. I'm glad to report though, that decreasing to about 75% took care of the ghosting. I saw some from time to time, but it wasn't bad at all. The brightness, just like with other titles, was dim and can't be adjusted on your monitor, only on the game's menu. You can always play with the contrast settings on you monitor's menu.Sound:Deep base, sharp highs and balanced mids. I enjoyed every bit of every explosion. Weapon sounds are as solid as ever. I was able to differentiate each weapon by its sound. Something I like about the sound is how balanced the mids are; I had no need to lower it. I hate it when the voice overly done. I ran everything with Dolby Digital and was blown away.Story: to sumarize and not to spoil. N.Y. is under attack, you are on a mission to rescue a scientist, get blown by the bad dudes, get rescued by a guy wearing the nano suit...the rest you'll have to see for yourself. I can say this though, I like the story and the different locations and enemies encountered. It is a nice mix of twists and turns. Some have said the story lacks exploration, which it does, but I didn't mind. Just like in Crysis 1, I never understood the point of it, if it didn't lead me to my objectives.Multiplayer:I'm glad they kept the original formula. No much to say, you all the good old modes. I had no prolem connecting to servers. I didn't experience any lag or chopiness.If you have the hardware to run this game at its max settings, then you are in for a treat. The default download does not include the files required to run the game at its max (Ultra) or with DX11, at the options menu, you'll see an option to download these files. The game will automatically take you to the likn and start loading them. You will have to repeat this, the game does it one at time, with a total of 2 downloads. After it is installed, you should be able to run it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2012"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the most frightening video games ever made","reviewText":"In terms of survival horror games, Resident Evil 4 had easily worn the crown in terms of scaring the crap out of you.  Key word there was had.  Dead Space is by and far one of the most frightening video games you will ever play, taking the idea of \"monsters on a space ship\" and upping the ante in nearly every department.  You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer dispatched to the ship Ishimura after contact has been lost.  It doesn't take long to learn that the crew of the Ishimura have been mutated into horrible creatures, and it's up to you to wreak bloody havoc upon them and learn what happened.  First and foremost, Dead Space features some of the most horiffic creature designs you'll catch in a video game.  These Necromorphs aren't all that easy to take down either, leading up to some just plain awesome boss battles to boot.  What Dead Space manages to accomplish in terms of innovation is also very much worth noting, as the traditional elements like a health meter are featured right on your character via a meter going down his spine, and telling how much ammo you have left can be seen when you raise your weapon into position.  Elements like these make Dead Space an all the more immersive gaming experience, and the game's enthralling story only adds to it.  Technically speaking, Dead Space is a marvel in terms of graphics and sound design, offering so many moments of brilliance amidst the horror.  The game is blood-curdlingly violent, and being able to improvise using your surroundings during battle adds to this as well.  The ship itself is wonderfully designed and gives off a feeling of claustrophobic dread; all of which helps add up to make Dead Space a brilliant and immersive survival horror experience.  If there's any flaws to be found, it's that the mission objectives can get repetitive, but other than that, Dead Space is nearly flawless.  All in all, you are unlikely to play any better, or scarier, survival horror games now or in the near future, and even if survival horror isn't really your thing, you should definitely check out Dead Space regardless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2008"}

In its current state, the headset will not connect to the PS4 via Bluetooth thus forcing you to use the 2.5mm to 3.5mm jack adapter that plugs into your controller.  While it works, it's still not wireless.Setup is somewhat cumbersome in that I needed to get ANOTHER fiber optic cable to hook into the wireless adapter (sorry, the supplied cable is thinner than angel hair and doesn't warrant a &#34;why not&#34; from me) which acts as a pass-through for your home receiver in addition to feeding your headset the sound it needs for Dolby Digital Surround production.And how is that production?  Well, I have mixed feelings on that front.  For $149, even with all of its &#34;wireless&#34; trappings, I would still expect bass reproduction to be on par with a $100 pair of headphones at least.  It's not.  It wasn't with the PX3s either and the Turtle Beach moniker has long worn out its welcome; the prestige that they once held in PC sound boards from long ago has left them quite some time ago.  My Afterglow's actually sound better than this set.  Chat is serviceable, but I wish that the game audio was better and had more punch.The microphone does have a welcome feature of being removable should you choose to use it strictly for listening to game audio and not disturbing the entire household.Another welcome and surprising feature was its ability to pair to 2 Bluetooth devices:  1) for the wireless sound transmitter and 2) for a phone.  Now you can actually answer a phone call while you're gaming and not miss a call as a result.  This is also welcome should you decided that you have a need to call a friend to see if they're having connectivity issues for a multiplayer session, etc.However, it's still missing quite a bit for me to say that it's worth a buy.  The wireless aspect from a PS4 standpoint is not completely on Turtle Beach's end, but my take on this is that you shouldn't release a product until it's truly ready for what it's intended for.  Also, the audio setup for the wireless connector is simply annoying and the supplied optical cable is laughable - I'm afraid that this thing is going to snap like a twig if I inadvertently grab it the wrong way.  Sound reproduction from a directionality standpoint is decent, but I want to FEEL explosions in Battlefield 4, not merely acknowledge that something happened on mid/high frequencies.  I'm hoping that Turtle Beach comes to their senses there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2013"}

Others have covered reviews of the system and game already so I have nothing to add really.I was on the fence about which system to buy between xbox one and ps4.  I love my ps3 and vita.  There two reasons why I prefer the competitors systems over sony systems.  Online and exclusive games. Sony has good ones but microsofts are just a lot better. I could have the ps4 and it would be pretty to look at. That's it. At least xbox one has 2 games that are must haves and another 2 that I will get when on sale.  Ps4 has no games in my book other than infamous. I still haven't played my copy of the second one. It's sitting on my shelf.  If Sony wants to sell me one they need to crank out some uncharted, last of us, little big planet or something good. Don't get me wrong, I like indie games but c'mon.  The second is the online experience. Sony just cannot cut it here.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

The combat was too easy at any difficulty level, your team AI was not great, and those offworld mission with the Mako were so incredibly poorly designed.  ME2 fixes several things while still leaving a few things that need obvious improvement.1. the combat now relied on \"gears of war\" hiding and firing.  It is indeed better than ME1's combat but it is still too easy to fire, hide, wait for shields and health to return, shoot again, repeat. You teammates still die and there's no real penalty about that.  They come right back to life after the battle ends.  In general the combat is fun but still too easy on any difficulty level. I just let my teammates die and continue fighting on my own.  They arent really needed to succeed in the battles.2. The story is arguably even better this time around and the characters even more varied.  The writers went to a lot of effort to flesh out this world and they did an excellent job.3.  The console graphics are still great at close up and then fuzz out pretty quickly.  It is not a game-breaker but it is unfortunate that the environments graphics often lack details that make them look real and vibrant.  Instead what we too often get is a room that is mostly one color with lots of barriers to hide behind when fighting (see #1 above).4. The RPG elements are still more simplified than I would like but that's a personal preference.  I want lots of choices about guns and armor and character abilities and while there are some choices, there are not enough for me.For anyone who likes a good story, ME2 is worth it, especially now that the price has gone down to twentybucks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2010"}

Sega should put a lot of time into Sonic Adventure 3 if there ever will be one.What I like the most about this game is that like Super Mario 64 before it Sonic Adventure is one of those games I never get tired of no matter how many times I beat it. The story is great and the cinema like sequences are awesome. Yes, the camera angles can get frustrating at times and the newer,slightly more graphically detailed Game Cube version with it's bonus Game Gear games may be a better buy according to many people but it doesn't match that special nostalgic quality you get from playing Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.Soul Calibur may be the greatest multiplayer game on the Dreamcast but Sonic Adventure is the best single player game for the Dreamcast and my choice for best overall Sega Dreamcast game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2002"}

And I wasn't dissappointed. To me, this was a combo of Diablo and Icewind Dale as it incorporated alot from each game while be different from both. It was also alot easier to play than Icewind Dale.And there is alot less management in this game. With the click of a button, your inventory is automatically rearranged so you don't have to try to make room for something else. Also, anything that is on the ground lights up so you know where it is to pick it up. Another nice feature is the potions. You only drink what you need and the rest is left in that bottle until you need it. While on your journey, you meet many new people who want to join you until you reach the max limit of 8. And trust me , you need them. Some of the levels and end bosses are very tough. There are plenty of weapons, armor, and spells to be bought here and plenty of monsters and bandits to kill. And this is a very large world. That is what amazed me the most, just how big this world was. And each new dungeon, town, and forest was very different from the next. The graphics are very good, the gameplay is fast, the sounds were excellent, and the challenge was very good. I believe this game had some of the best landscape views of any game I have ever played. And when you are in the woods hearing the wind blow and the bugs making their noises, you almost feel like you are there. It took me a little over 32 hours of actual gameplay time (not counting having reload when I died) to beat the singl player missions.I recommend this game for RPG fan and for anyone looking for a well put together and thought out game with excellent action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2002"}

The US government took them from me and promised my freedom if I helped this \"establish a civilization\" by catching the three crooks I used to ride with.The first thing I noticed after I got off the train was how beautiful the country looked. Rolling hills, trees, animals roaming wherever you look. People on stagecoaches and even the occasional train. How I learned this new \"civilization\" was very interesting and even would make a good story.Day 2After getting shot by Bill Williamson I met this lovely lady Bonnie MacFarlane and she helped me along the way. Riding horses with her was a good time and it doesn't seem to hard. If I kick it too hard with my spurs it will buck me off unless I bond with it first by riding it often. Keeping speed with her was easy since holding my speed kept me right next to her.Shooting on the horse was a little difficult and using my Dead Eye was almost necessary since everything went by so fast. Controlling a horse and a gun at the same time isn't very easy. When I focus enough everything seems to slow down and I can mark my targets with an X and blast away. I don't know where I got this trait from, but it sure is handy.She even showed me how to herd cattle by keeping pace behind the herd and making sure strays to leave. Taming horses was pretty easy since I just had to lasso them and keep my balance until they were broken. Today was a long day so I'm going to rest.Day 3I left Bonnie after helping her out on some errands. I just follow the yellow route line to my objective I put on my map and it ain't too hard from there. I can even mark waypoints and travel to them via stagecoach or when I make a camp off the road or away from water. This makes things handy since traveling this vast land can get tiresome.After shooting some thugs from the wanted poster I picked up I realized how each bullet effects every part of the body. Hit an arm and they drop their gun. Hit their leg and they limp away, hit their chest and they fall over and crawl away. I found this useful when having to catch criminals with my lasso. Shoot the sucker in the leg so he stops running!I went to the local market (there are many) and sold some herbs I picked and after I hunted some deer, wolves, a snake, and some birds I sold all those parts for some cash and bought me a new gun. I love my shotgun, sniper rifle, revolver, and other weapons, but I just needed something more powerful. I did buy a new horse as well as some tobacco for focus and some medicine. I'm beat for now so I'm going to go purchase some property in this town and rest.Day 7I've learned a lot lately and one of the biggest things I learned was not to shoot other people or even run over them on accident. I had the law come after me and I now have a bounty on my head. I can get a pardon letter or pay the bounty, but if I get my honor and fame up by doing good deeds maybe people won't be so hasty to tattle.I tried some gambling to ease my mind today such as Liar's Dice, Texas Hold `Em, Blackjack, Horse Shoes, Arm Wrestling and more. These games seemed pretty fun at first but after a few tries it bored me so I was off hunting again. After I caught my kill I noticed a Stranger needing help so I marked him as a question mark on my map and a purple circle on the area where I can find him later. I'll tell you partner these tales and these people were something else.There are so many things to do here I can't describe them all. This place is huge even with Mexico to the south. Everything here just looks so amazing and you can see so far it's stunning. Even when I got the the snow capped mountains and was hunting bears I felt like I couldn't get enough of the scenery. The world also sounds beautiful with birds chirping and the sound of crunching dirt under my feet. It's refreshing.Day 28Well I don't know what else to say. This world is so massive and expansive and gorgeous it's like nothing else. There is so much to do here that by the end of my journey I'll have felt satisfied, and even roaming around with friends can be pretty fun. So long partner and keep the West Wild and the Wild alive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B008AU4YEA","description":"","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Gives Mario a run for his money","reviewText":"While I grew up with Mario, I feel like the more recent 2-D games (not Galaxy) are getting a bit stale. The series really isn't showing any signs of innovation. The graphics are acceptable but seldom awe inspiriting. I'd thought that 2-D platforming had peaked and the glory days are over.Then I tried Rayman Legends. This game is quite simply the greatest 2-D platformer ever. Ubisoft got a lot right. This game is incredibly fun to play. The movement mechanics are very smooth but also different. Jumping feels a bit more \"floaty\" as the characters hang in the air for a bit. The game also finds ways to let you play fast and speed through levels, although not quite to the ridiculous extremes of Sonic.However, what I really want to stress is innovation. Ubisoft found ways to make platforming feel fresh. There are some great new ideas. One thing I like - and wish Mario would do - is the roster of playable characters. Each character has unique skills and different designs (so not just a green outfit). The game presents a variety of level designs, from timed levels to stages in which you have to clear a pathway for the main character. The most unique levels are the \"music levels\" where the entire level is timed to a song (such as Rocky's \"Eye of the Tiger\"). These levels are incredible. Every beat of the song is tied to something in the level, such as a jump or enemy attack. These levels engage players on multiple levels and I never tire of them.On top of all of that, the game is visually stunning. The game looks like a real cartoon. Rayman really takes advantage of the HD capabilities on the Wii U. You could put Rayman next to a high-budget animated film and not be ashamed.Rayman Legends has been getting a lot of good press, but surprisingly hasn't been selling as strongly as you'd expect given the quality. My guess is that if Nintendo has put something of this quality out it'd make the front pages of the New York Times. As it is, don't shy away from this game just because it's not a Nintendo exclusive or because it's cross-platform. If you like platformers, get it.I predict - and hope - this game will shoot Rayman up in the halls of video game greats. This type of innovation really deserves to be recognized. 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

It focuses on team-based action, with several character class that are used to support one-another. The multiplayer will make this game live on in imfamy and is alone enough to purchase it. The single player, however, falls short of a few elements that while don't bring it down entirely, they prevent it from being excellent.One thing is for sure: this game looks wonderful. Every detail is wonderfully captured with the quake 3 engine, and the flame effects are some of the best you have ever seen on your 16 inch monitor. It is ashame the developers didn't make the single-player game as wonderful as the graphicsThe most serious thing I think is the fact that the main character, B.J., doesn't say a frickin word in the whole thing. I didn't mind Gordon not saying a word, nor Lt. Powell, but that to let to immerse yourself in the game. B.J. has an attitude, but you rarely see it. It also seems that the developers did things to avoid him talking. Like instead of Rosevelt briefing him, he would tell some guy named Jack what he told B.J. to do. Why doesn't Jack do the frickin missions instead.The story is fine, but some of the cutscenes may make you fall asleep. This is cause of the fact that B.J. isn't in ANY of the briefings. They are just president Rosevelt talking to jack and 2 other guys, who wants to see that. This game is sopposed to borrow elements from &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot;, but I could watch a 6 minute cutscene from that game and listen to every bit of it. In this game a 1 minute cutscene seems to long.Everything else about the single player game is good (the mission design is exceptional) It still can only be considered a bonus for this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2002"}

For a game for that time, it is amazing. Even now, it should be considered a jewel in the gaming industry.First of all, the graphics are pretty good, and the soundtrack is amazing. It has an action/rpg element which works really well. The storyline is massive. You can take a paragon/benevolent character or a renegade/do everything by any means necessary. By taking a paragon or renegade way, people react differently to you, and your storyline is shaped completely different.Whenever you speak to people, you can choose what to ask or what to say. You can literally choose to be a jerk or be friendly and people will react accordingly. The characters within the game are really well done, and you will learn to like them and care for them enough that you do not want nothing bad to happen to them.It has huge replayability. Every time you play the game, you can choose a different class, paragon or renegade, and more choices within the game. Your experience for each playthrough will never be the same. More importantly, choices that you make are carried into Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. No other game has done something where the choices that you make carry some weight in the following games. It's beautifully done, and even relationships that you forge in this game are carried over. Whether they are friendships or love relationships, they are so well done that they do not feel corny, mushy, or over the top. You just learn to love them or hate them. They feel real not something made up.Overall, it is a great game with many rpg elements and action involved. Do realize that it does have shooter/action elements as well. So, if you do not like shooters, maybe try Dragon Age instead, but this game is really a game every gamer should try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Craig Juan","summary":"A shockingly exciting horror experience !","reviewText":"I've gotta admit that when the PS2 first launched its first titles, it didn't really come to amaze even me...that is until Konami's spine-tingling title, Silent Hill 2 creeps up to the PlayStation 2 with a whole lot of great features. Silent Hill 2 is the sequel to the best selling PlayStation game, Silent Hill. Silent Hill 2 really scared the heck out of me with its brilliantly detailed graphics with impressive character models, true action physics, and unbelieveably detailed enviroments. This is some great tasting eye-candy, even with that annoying fog and the weird looking creatures (uh...what's up with those table-like creatures ?). The camera angles are a little too twitchy but that's no problem. That doesn't screw up the experience. At least you will feel aware about where the monsters are, if you're used to the fog. Yep ! That's what I said ! Fog ! There's tons of it in Silent Hill 2, but unless you are used to it, you'll be fine. The controls are cool and they make sense. Some may say that the combat sequence is sluggish, but to me, this is controling a survival horror at its best. It's cool and it makes more sense. For example, if you have a huge knife, you won't be able to run around anymore. You will walk slowly, but still you'll be able to inflict more damage, despite of the delay. And when you're running around with a gun, you won't have any problems. The coolest aspect in the game is the heartbeating feature found in the PS2 Dual Shock control. When you feel there's a monster or if a monster is attacking you right now, you will feel a rough heartbeat on your controler. Wow ! Talk about your normal survival horror game. The sound appears to be cool. Although the voice acting is slightly horrible, the background music, creepy monster growls and groans, hallway voices, suspiciously loud knocking sounds, and realistic gunshots really gives the players an adrenaline rush. The English voice acting sounds cool, but sometimes the dialog will end up sounding stupid later on and then you'll feel like switching the language to Japanese (everyone always does this if they're disgusted with bad english voice acting). But hey, even with those flaws, it still rates a perfect score on my opinion. Expect Silent Hill 2 to come out on the Xbox in 2002 entitled &quot;Silent Hill 2X&quot;. Most people who already own this game will probably say it will not look good and that it would be a stupid idea to bring it to the Xbox. But actually this is a good thing. I guess Konami wants to make this game for the people who never played the PS2 original. And there is another Konami surprise coming to the Xbox as well. Can you say &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2X&quot; ? Yep ! I know you can. And I bet you guys who plan to own an Xbox are excitingly shocked by now. Metal Gear Solid 2X won't release until the original release of the superior PS2 version. Anyway lets drop the subject on Konami's Xbox titles. If you're in need of a survival horror game that will really scare your pants off badly, Silent Hill 2 is the game for you !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2001"}

Welcome to the world ofShadow Hearts.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Grows on You","reviewText":"Shadow Hearts is the story of Yuri Hyuga, a young man with the mysterious ability to fuse with the spirits of monsters he defeats.  He has been commanded by a mysterious voice to protect the life of Alice Elliot, who saw her father torn apart in Rouen, France and is now fleeing for her life across mainland China.  The world hangs in the balance as the great magicians of Earth vie for their powers.  Spies and magicians, young boys and vampires will fight at their side as this unexpectedly complex story unfolds for the player.  Set early in the Japanese invasion of China, just before World War I, the scene shifts from the mainland countryside to Shanghai, Prague, Rouen, and England.My initial reaction to the game was unenthusiastic.  While not disappointing, Shadow Hearts animation falls a bit short of what is currently state of the art for RPG's on the PS2.  It is a bit of a shock to switch from Xenosaga or Darkness Hearts to a more typical standard for mainstream RPG's.  In addition, the story and characters get off to a slow start, without the benefit if voiceover and cut-scene continuity.  The fighting system, which uses an object called a Judgment Ring to determine the success of a strike, takes a while to grow familiar.  But if the player stays with the game and waits out the initial reaction gameplay becomes increasingly pleasurable.Although gameplay is linear, the story itself is interesting, with settings as varied as vampire castles and space ships.  Each player has an array of special powers, from Feng Shui magic to bomb dropping planes as well as physical attacks.  Puzzles and mazes abound, which keeps leveling up entertaining for most of the game.  And gradually, animation and the use of cut scenes and voice picks up, so that the flow of the action becomes more and more engaging.One of the reasons I like this game is its appeal to both sides of the player.  The combat half of the game is fairly straightforward once you master what you can use and conquer the dreaded Judgment Ring.  The addition of a set of puzzles to be worked out is a great plus.  While these aren't up to FFX's level, they can keep your attention.  Finally, this isn't the kind of game that tries to destroy the ego of the play.  All the problems are surmountable with the application of persistence.  I have hear rumors of a possible sequel, and am looking forward to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001ELI4S4","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"The Console To End All Consoles","reviewText":"The PS3 was first released in November 2006, just one year after its competition, the XBOX 360. What can be said for the console since its release back on that amazing day in 2006? Well one thing is that it continues to evolve even to this day thanks to new releases with bigger hard drives and numerous software patches to be downloaded for free through the Playstation network (PSN). Sony are a company that listen to their fans and although upon first release the creators think they know what's best, they are more than willing to develop the interface and the experience through feedback from gamers.The XBOX 360 was released 1 year earlier than the PS3 because Microsoft wanted to get the jump on Sony by releasing their console for Christmas 2005 which presented absolutely no gaming competition. Good move from a business stand point, but this only hindered the XBOX experience with the numerous hardware faults including the dreaded red ring of death. Fans were angry and frustrated and certainly a lot of them felt robbed by Microsoft's shoddy hardware blunders. The PS3 was the saving grace as although we had to wait an additional year for it to be released, the wait was worth it.The look of the PS3 is something I want to talk about first. The external appearance is something we all notice first and it's definitely something that made me buy it. Next to hardware, the look of a console on the outside and in the interface is definitely something quite important I take into consideration when deciding a purchase. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is again something that looks very pretty and of course presents an easy to navigate interface. The PS3 GUI is known as the XrossMediaBar or the XMB. It is split into 9 categories. Users, Settings, Photo, Music, Video, Game, PSN, Network and Friends all make up an easy to find system when you're looking to perform a particular task within the operating system.I don't know much about hardware and the technical stuff, but they've all been touched upon in other reviews so I'm going to just talk about the little add ons that really make it a worthwhile experience to buy this console. The PSN is one of its best selling points for the PS3 as although the 7th generation of gaming has taken a more positive leap to internet gaming, the fact that joining the PSN and being able to play your friends online is free wins it many fans. The wireless controllers are again another fantastic addition. This may be considered reaching for complements but it's the small things that have the biggest impact. Bluetooth and built in wireless internet capability are just immense considering if you want stuff like this, you have to buy the extras for the XBOX 360 to allow for such freedomMy favourite thing to do with the console is to be able to plug in my external hard drive and watch any film I have stored on my PS3. It seems to have the ability to play any video format on the PS3 and although that may not be the case, I'm happy and as a gamer, that's all that matters. Thanks to recent updates, Sony has now introduced the very welcome Trophy system which is a way of matching Microsoft's achievement system. Some would say it's better, others would say it doesn't matter, but to me it makes the gaming experience that bit more worth it.The whole point of the PS3 is the gaming experience and that is the right approach to take which has worked wonders for Sony. No widespread hardware problems and no noise problems which were two of my main complaints about the PS3. It wasn't a rushed console and you can tell that from the start. It's an immense experience and just over two years on it has an impressive games catalogue that is guaranteed to get better and better. There's no doubting that even though it is just two years on, there's a PS4 at least at the discussion point of development and we probably won't see a finished article for about 4 or even 5 years.That being said, I hope Sony learn a lot from this console and understand where they went wrong and what they did right. At this point, with all the software updates and other such changes, the PS3 is near enough the perfect console. One thing that does bug me a little is the constant new releases with larger hard drives and better add ons such as PS2 backwards compatibility. When we do see a PS4 we should get a large hard drive to begin with but if upgrades of hard drive space are made available, then we should be given an easy way to upgrade the hard drive without having to be a techno type of guy and having to take apart the console.Just buy it, you won't regret it, I promise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2009"}

For one thing, I'm not really a racing game guy - the older I've gotten, the less tolerance I seem to have for the endless repetition and millisecond-shaving that seems endemic to the genre.  Second, I'm not an ATV guy by any stretch of the imagination.  I hate the outside, I dislike mud, and the closest I've been to one of these beasts is sincerely wanting to dismantle the ones that my neighbors up the street gave their idiot children to ride pretty much incessantly nine months out of the year.  Third, I'm not really a freestyle, trick gaming guy - I've never played an SSX or Tony Hawk game, and I can honestly say that I've never felt the urge to do so.  Imagine my shock, then, to have to admit now that Pure in no way sucks.  I wouldn't call the game a standout, and it suffers from a few annoying quirks, but on the whole, the game remains a solid, competent, enjoyable entry to the ATV/freestyle/racing genre, if such a thing exists.There's really not much to describe about the basic format of the game.  You take one of any number of utterly interchangeable characters, dress them up in some kind of futuristic space suit hermetically sealed against intrusion from mud, dirt, and apparently the harsh sting of a two hundred foot fall, and drive in circles.  There are three basic game formats you can play through:  Sprint - a basic short course race with minimal air and little opportunity for the game's trademark trick-making; Freestyle - a run around a long course with quite a lot of air where you attempt to accumulate the high score by performing strings of tricks; and Race - a combination of the two.  The Sprint and Freestyle modes both work well, allowing you to explore both of the major gameplay themes in the title.  The Race mode, however, is not such a rousing success.  The secret to winning races in Pure (and in most racing games these days) is a keen knowledge of the track and judicious use of boost, which in this game can only be accumulated by performing tricks.  The catch here is that performing tricks is a high-risk proposition, with failure usually resulting in your avatar's ragdall getting flung into the mud with his ATV on top of him and a loss of several positions in the race.  That's fine for Freestyle mode, where your position is largely irrelevant to your performance, but in Race mode, where you're still expected to come in first, in order to earn the boost that you need to win the race you must engage in activities contrary to that goal, which generally leads to long, boring runs around the track where you perform the same tricks repeatedly for a rapidly diminishing boost reward and try as hard as possible not to screw up.  That might be par for the course in the genre (as I said, I'm not a big racing game guy), but when you compare that to an alternative like the boost system in Burnout, where you are rewarded for performing risky actions that contribute to your winning the race, the Pure system ultimately drags on the action and makes Race format events feel conflicted and confusing.Outside of races, Pure presents a lot of customizability to the user - too much for me.  Before you can race at all you have to assemble an ATV.  You might think that an easy task if you don't know anything about the devices (like me), but roughly halfway into the over twenty individual choices you're forced to make to build your ride, you'll be disabused of that notion.  To put it in perspective, you have to select at one point what appears to me to be a single gear that has play ramifications.  I'm sure that this is an important gear to the machine, and I'm sure that if I cared even a tiny bit about how these things work that I would be very impressed with the fact that I could control such minutia, but as a practical matter, all that the level of detail led me to do was hold down the \"auto-build\" buttons that the game makes available to you and hope for the best.  That seems to be a valid strategy to me (I haven't had the time to get to 100% game completion), but the decisions that the computer makes when going through this automated process seem to be disturbingly inconsistent from execution to execution.  More than anything, I found myself wishing while I was configuring and reconfiguring my rides (and you will do that a LOT, as you are rewarded for your progress through the single-player campaign with parts that you pretty much have to integrate into your machine to win subsequent races) for some simple pre-configured designs that I could pick apart to see how they worked.  For what it's worth, though, all of the changes that you can make seem to have impact on your race performance, as I found even a minor tweak of a couple of points in handling and speed stats greatly affected my vehicle's performance on the track.I don't really do multiplayer, particularly on Live, so I don't feel very qualified to comment on that aspect of the game, save to say that the races feel like they would work reasonably well for the sixteen people the game supports.Taken on the whole - and believe me when I tell you I'm shocked to say this - Pure doesn't suck.  It didn't change my perception of ATVs or the world in general, but it has given me fifteen hours of enjoyable gameplay so far and promises to offer up more in the future if I want it.  It also game me some ugly blisters on my left thumb (I recommend finding a traction pad - you trick and steer on the same stick, and as a result you end up jerking it around a lot, which is what I suspect led to my condition), but I suppose that can be forgiven.  I can't say that I'd pay sixty dollars American for this, but as a discount purchase in the thirty to forty dollar range, I'd certainly give it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"One of the most underrated and under-appreciated games of all time","reviewText":"It was awhile ago I played this game, but remember it being surprisingly good as I wasn't expecting much from the mediocre reviews. It definitely took some notes from the Bioshock playbook especially with the audio logs randomly strewn throughout. It is basically a time-traveling Bioshock and it is definitely good enough to be in the same discussion as Bioshock. The biggest thing I remember is the story. It was one of the better ones this gen. You would enjoy this as well if you liked the Dead Space series.Just like other atmospheric FPS, you'll probably want to revisit it in a few years, but there isn't much else like a multiplayer that bring substantial value after you've beat it once.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2014"}

This game basically does for Transformers what Arkham Asylum did for Batman. It restores credibility to the franchise, for the video game medium in particular. Developer High Moon devilvers immersive G1 nostalgia, coupled with classy fan service. It became clear early on during my playing of this game, that the development team grew up on Transformers, and knew how to accruateley portray these characters, and craft an intriguing \"prequel\" of sorts that would please genuine Transformers fans, and not Michael Bay's misrepresentation of the source material.PROS:1. Beautiful visuals really immerse the player in the world of Cybertron.2. Voice acting and dialog are well performed, with few exceptions. There wasmuch of an emphasis placed on sound, and this carries over to all aspects of the game. From combat, voice overs, transformation, everything sounds as it should, very authentic.3. The transformation mechanic is well implemented. At the end of the day, this particular feature will decide if this is a good game or not. Obviously, transformation is a big part of Transformers. If this isn't properly handled, then the quality of this game will suffer to no end. Thankfully, this is the highlight of War for Cybertron. The player can transform at will, and the motion is seamless and intuitive, not to mention just plain cool. The levels are specifically designed to incorperate transformation as a means of progression, so this isn't just a cheap gimmick laced novelty that wears off. It undoubtedly adds a layer of dynamic gameplay, that seperates itself from typical shooters.4. Loyal fan service and proper character treatment make this a wonderful escape from the Michael Bay debacle.CONS1. This game offers no offline support outside of campaign mode. This is very disappointing, considering how plentiful online multiplayer is. There really should have been some \"couch co-op\", where you could play with your buddy in split screen. Instead, you are relegated to playing co-op with people you either don't know, or best case scenario... know but cannot play with them on the same system. This provides a far less intimate playing session, and ultimately less engaging. If there is a sequel, hopefully they can toss in at least one or two split screen modes! On a quick side note, there does seem to be a movement within the industry to focus solely on online multiplayer, and pretty much ignore offline. This really does suck, and i would like to go on record as saying so!2. The third person shooter mechanics are half baked and under realized. The generic gunplay and limited weapon selection is tolerable, but the lack of a proper cover system is a huge oversight in my opinion.3. While the levels are beautiful, the visuals can become rather repetitive, with little variation. I would have liked to have seen a more diverse color scheme. Although the character designs do redeem the \"visuals\" aspect of this game quite a bit.Bottom Line:If you are a gamer, and a Transformers fan. Then you should alreadly own this game, period.This is by far the best Transformers game ever made.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2010"}

The single player is short but really really fun. Especially for fans of transformers.  It's hard to find a good game that's based on a license of some sort whether it be a movie or comic or other but this one delivers. It's kind of like, this is to Transformers how Batman: Arkham Asylum is to Batman. Transforming is a seemless click of the button and transitions much like the on the fly transformations seen in the recent movies. The multiplayer is one of the better ones out there too.  The whole perks and rank system has been compared to Call of Duty but I think it's more like Bad Company 2 actually.  Instead of ranking up across the board, you rank up per class. Example, you can have like a level 4 soldier, level 5 leader, level 3 scientist, and so on. Definitely give it some time though. You may get online and wonder why you're dying so much quicker than everyone else and can't seem to kill them very easily but as you rank up you gain those perks such as extra melee damage or resistence to explosives and things like that. Stick to it and it pays off.  Love this game!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2010"}

I was only into 3rd persons, but now I've finally moved on and added another community to my gaming life if you will. One thing for sure is that I'm not a fanboy of anytype of game but a fan of just playing games. I know what I like and if it keeps me entertained, then its a purchase for me.When it comes to COD games, I enjoy the campaigns, and I just knew for sure I would enjoy BOPS 2 campaign. This campaign keeps you interested all the way thru. Not saying you will hope for a movie but its entertaining. Speaking of, its plenty of Hollywood actors in this game, voices, characters, etc. lol. I laughed when I saw Candy Man make an entrance. Anyways, there is a lot of action, equally paced, meaning fast when it needs to be and slow when it needs to be. Cool weapons, graphics and sound. Your also more involved beyond pressing A or B to complete the characters next move when in RPG mode. The main thing about the campaign, its not all over the place and its fun enough to maybe replay it 1 more time on a different level.The multiplayer:Obviously, this is the meat of the game and I'm sorry, but this is why I call it Hollywood OPS II as well because its just a trendy game to make money off. I mean even ESPN advertised it. The only good thing about the MP is that it has good crispy clear cartoonish graphics and oh, hearing people complain and name call when they get killed so I look fwd to youtube videos of Xbox Live trash talk fights.Why I will not buy this game, there is no strategy involved and the fact that you can't use the environment. It is a war game right? I mean its cool to run thru the buildings, but blowing up those buildings or the surrounding areas will chase campers and snipers away making it more fun and more realistic and not just run and shoot and I see why this draws more kids, which is ok, just not for me.I'm thankful for Redbox.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"The Grand Finale of the Solid Snake Saga","reviewText":"Funny how the original 'Stealth Espionage Action' game was born. Failed to create all-out action game due to the limited technology, video game auteur Hideo Kojima instead created a game where you avoid firefight and sneak around the enemy. Since the original inception of Metal Gear in 1987, the series have always represented the best of the best the gaming industry can offer.Although loosely linked, each iteration was stand-alone game that requires no knowledge of the previous games. It all changed in MGS4. If the past installments slowly build the background of one of the finest video game storyline, MGS4 not only creates an immensely excellent stand-alone plot, but also brings suddenly all previous story to the stratospherically mythological level. One must experience all past games to fully understand and appreciate the level of genius MGS4 provides. MGS4 interweaves all the story so clearly into one satisfying epic culmination and brings its story to a closure. In doing so, Kojima eradicated all the past shortcoming and confusion in the plotline of 'MGS2: Sons of Liberty', and making Raiden the coolest video game character you wish you could play as. (Never thought that was possible, did you?) The ultimate joke on us compliment of Sir Hideo Kojima and his far-out sense of humor for ridiculing him on MGS2 for so long.Close Quarter Combat (CQC) was improved upon MGS3, and not only you have free-camera, the 3rd person perspective is now over the shoulder instead of over the head, you have the 1st person-like accuracy. Furthermore, you now can shoot and move around in the 1st person perspective. All the movement and combat mechanics have been vastly improved and refined here compared to MGS3.MGS4 is a stealth action game first and foremost, but now you have freedom to choose how you go about your tactics. You can sneak around without killing, or you can sneak around killing everyone. But most of all, you can just go around killing everything that moves. With tons of high tech weaponry at your disposal, you no longer have to rely solely alone on stealth.  Improved upon camoflouge suit from MGS3, you now have octocamo suit. It adapts automatically to any environment you touch.  You also have 'snake eye' that replaced binocular and also works as infrared goggle.  You also have a useful aid from miniature metal gear called 'MK II' to survey the surrounding and even knock your enemy unconscious.  All these do not mean the dynamic of the gameplay changes into all-out action like gears of war.  You have to constantly monitor your psyche level.  Continuosly shooting your way around will decrease your psyche level that directly affects your efficiency in combat so stealth is still your best course of action.Metal Gear Solid (MGS) series always pushes the envelope to the very end of bleeding technology of its time. But here deploys Hideo Kojima a truly amazing in-game cutscenes generated by in-game engine to the CGI level seen from Final 'Fantasy VII: Advent Children'. All the staple camera techniques frequently seen in top Hollywood production is deployed here. They even use hand-held camera technique. We are talking about cutscenes directly generated by in-game engine itself, not pre-made cutscenes like CGI (computer-generated imagery). Truly beyond amazing achievement if you ask me. Natunally, the gameplay itself also looks outstanding. Possibly the best looking video game to date.All the good looking graphics and techniques will mean nothing without excellent voice-actings headed by David Hayter as Old Snake. The music composed by Harry Gregson Williams is another area MGS4 matches on par with the top Hollywood production. Voice-actings and music enhance the overall cinematic experience to another level.Level design is nothing short of excellent. His near perfectionist attention to details is shown in every single rubble in each level. Maps are very large, although devided by small section and loading screen. One fact that always bothers me no matter which game it is.  Loaging screen here is not as bothersome as ones in RPGs but bothersome nonetheless.There are so many hidden jokes, references to the previous games, and his usual far-out, often wierd sense of humors you need to find to fully appreciate how deep the game as whole truly is.Is this game perfect? No game ever is. But in this case, I am more disappointed for what it doesn't have.*****SPOILER WARNING*****First of all, the game is still too short for game of this magnitude. Gameplay itself last about 14-15 hours if you attack everything in linear fashion. Cutscenes are about 7-8 hours; total about 20 hours give or take a little.  'MGS3: Snake Eater' still stands as the longest game in the franchise.Next, Shadow Moses was a somewhat letdown gameplay-wise.  First time I enter Shadow Moses, and I hear 'Best is yet to come' from MGS1 in the background, it was a spine-tingling experience.  Then I run into Gekkos and suicide Gekkos.  In the plot sense, that was inarguably the best course, but I wanted to play more stealth action against soldiers and alarms and turrets as in MGS1. I can only hope in the inevitable 'Special Improved Edition' in the future, they give us a standalone mission set in Shadow Moses guarded by the FROGS, turrets, and alarms with boss fights at the end of each stage as bonus so they don't have to disturb the existing plotline.Next, we need cinema mode just like in MGS3: Subsistence so we can watch all the cutscenes and concentrate in story alone. Right now we can watch all the briefings cutscenes but we need to play the game again to watch the rest.Next, VR (Virtual Reality) Mission is something you could use to finetune your techniques just like in MGS1 and MGS2. Virtual Chamber in MGS4 just doesn't cut it. Give us VR Mission in the Special Edition.Finally, I would never thought I would say this. I want to play as Raiden. Give us Raiden, Kojima-San. Maybe Raiden's mission like Snake's Mission in MGS2. Better yet, how about the alternative path like 'Ada Wong' in Resident Evil 4 Director's cut so you can blend him in the existing plotline such as Battle with Vamp, etc. I humbly ask for your forgiveness for our ignorance of the past. Pretty Please with lots of sugar on top, Give us Raiden.Get the limited edition if you can by all means. It comes in excellent and cool-looking hardbound case. It contains the same original game disc in original Blu-ray case with artwork. But it also contains the second case that harbors two discs. One is Blu-ray disc contains about 150 minutes worth of documentaries from the history of MGS to the Making of MGS4. The other is soundtrack of MGS4. Must-have collector's item for the long time series fans.At last, Solid Snake's story comes to an immensely satisfying grand conclusion. This is one game that is meant to be thoroughly experienced; you invest your time in characters and storyline so much, you feel attached to the avatar in your actual gameplay. MGS4 is as close to Hideo Kojima's envisioned Magnus Opus since the inception of Metal Gear in 1987. At the end of the game (Be sure to wait and watch until the very end title shows), you will know you just experience the most cinematic video game ever created. The emotional resonance will ringer long after the end credit rolls. MGS4 is man's game like 'Dirty Dozen', not a cheek flick like 'An Affair to remember'. Just like all the previous MGS games, your heart will be filled up with such emotion that makes even grown men cry. Go ahead! Stand attention. Give this soldier a proper respect and one last salute. He really deserves it with all your heart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2008"}

As blocks drop down on the lower screen, you must use the DS's stylus to match up blocks of the same color. Once you have enough blocks connected, they'll shoot back up into the sky to form planets on the upper screen.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"like Tetris with a dash of Lumines","reviewText":"If you're a fan of puzzle games like Tetris, then you should certainly give Meteos for the Nintendo DS a try. It's rather like Tetris with a dash of Lumines thrown in.For those who somehow missed out on Tetris and Lumines, both are falling-block style puzzle games. Tetris is famous for being the first, and Lumines has recently garnered praise for its gorgeous soundtracks and style themes. Meteos doesn't have quite the graphic flair of Lumines, but it does come close.In essence the \"story\" involves you launching attacks in space. The blocks fall down from the top of the screen, as usual in these games. Instead of trying to rotate the blocks though, they fall singly and you can then only drag a block up or down in its column to form rows or columns of matching colors. You can do this with the buttons but it is FAR faster and easier to use the stylus to do the dragging.The Lumines-style themes for background and block type start out with only a few options, but as you work your way through the game you unlock more and more. Some are simple, with classic single-colored blocks that look vaguely gem-like. Others are really wild, with little squiggly characters in each block. I find it really makes a big difference in how quickly I can get through a level, depending on which block set I use. Some are easy to see color combinations with, while others can make it quite a challenge.Once you get three of a color to line up, they don't vanish as in other Tetris style games. Instead, they \"blast upwards\", pushing up any blocks that happen to be higher in the stack. That is, if you have three full stacks of blocks and cause the bottommost three blocks to all be green, those three full stacks will start moving up off the screen. Sometimes they go right off - but sometimes they are sluggish and start to fall back downwards. You must then match up other threesomes in that stack to give the rockets extra \"energy\" to continue leaving the playing area. Once you get enough rocket blasts launched, you move on to the next stage.For Tetris addicts, it takes some practice to get the hang of only sliding blocks up and down, never left or right. Your mind keeps seeing patterns that you simply can't make. However, once you get your brain re-trained to think in up and down movements only, it really is quite fun.Part of a frustration factor for some people is going to be the controls. Pointing to the exact block you need with your stylus - and dragging it up or down to the exact right position - isn't always easy. Trying to use the controls instead is simply too slow. The game really rewards the dexterous, but will be quite annoying for those who don't have fine motor control.That being said, I really did have a lot of fun with Meteos, and am glad I got it!Rating: 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2010"}

This game wasn't the overall slam dunk I had thought it would be. There are some things I absolutely loved and some I absolutely hated.First, we shall start with the positives. The environments are by far the best I have played in a game. It looks, feels real and alive. There were no shortcuts into making these environments. They are so detailed that it was the first time I was stunned looking at the environments since Halo: Combat Evolved about ten years ago. Also, the writing is of course top notch. Sound fits the mood perfectly. Story is decent. Overall it is a pretty fun game.Now, the negatives. The first thing was the overall feel. It just didn't feel like Max Payne. I don't want to spoil the game, but there are a few chapters that nail the old Max Payne feel, while the rest almost get there, but it creates a feeling of a nostalgic hole of what Max Payne 3 could have been. I miss going to the secret 'underground' warehouses and run-down hotels in NY and basically flying around in bullet time spraying bullets everywhere. Next issue is the controls/gameplay. This Max Payne's bullet time is ruined with the cover system. The cover system basically makes it unnecessary to do the bullet time leaps (my favorite thing of the Max Payne games). Furthermore, controls and aiming just don't seem nearly as fluid as the previous two. While you could just keep bullet time leaping all over the place, it is impracticable when you can use the cover. Next, is the Noir storytelling of the games. This also just doesn't seem to cut it. There are not nearly as many of the storybook scenes, but instead we get an outrageous amount of (lengthy) cutscenes. This is a perfect example of how a game does not need cutscenes to be great.Lastly, The previous Max Payne's are far superior. Had this game not had the Max Payne title, it would be an easy 5 stars. I have not played the multiplayer nor do I really intend do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

In many cases, and in many video games, that's correct. But what I've often found with great video games is that the sequel often makes improvements in storytelling, mechanics and graphics that make it a more immersive and impressive experience than the original, and for the most part, that is true with DEAD SPACE 2. The gameplay and mechanics are smoother, more involving and more dynamic. This is particularly true with the Zero-G sequences and a definite improvement on the kinesis. The graphics and particularly the sound design are much more inspired than the original. The character design especially with the necromorphs is more bizarre and more frightening. All around, this is a satisfying gaming experience.However, what I'm the biggest fan of in a video game is its ability to tell a smart, involving and entertaining story, and while DS2 starts out with something extraordinary, that falls to the wayside in favor of telling a safer story. Once again, you are engineer Isaac Clarke (an obvious homage to writers Asimov and Arthur C.), and you are one of the only survivors of the Ishimura and the influence that The Marker had on its crew. You struggled through the last game to find your lady love Nicole, and as it sadly turned out, she was already dead. You barely make it out alive yourself (EA made the last game somewhat open-ended, but it really seemed like you were shuffling off the mortal coil) and at the beginning of this game, you wake up and find yourself three years later in an insane asylum on The Sprawl, a space station just off Saturn. Of course, as soon as you wake up, everyone around you is turning into or being killed by necromorphs. As you escape that opening sequence, you encounter a potential helper who is also informing you that you're experiencing a very unique kind of dementia. The reason for this being that, since you're one of the last survivors of the experience with the first Marker, your brain has been picked around in to create a new Marker for purposes unknown. At that point on, you get into your RIG, get your weapons ready and are ready to brutally kill a lot of necromorphs. Throughout the game, you see Nicole in your mind as an apparent part of your dementia, and she continually berates you for allowing her to die, and for suggesting she take work aboard The Ishimura in the first place. You come across lots of necromorphs, some government jackboots and their thug of a leader, a loon, some Unitologists, and a sexy pilot. Some are friends but most are foes. Eventually, you have to go back to the scene of the first crime on the Ishimura, which is a pretty bravura sequence. There are definitely some sequences you'll never un-see, and those are the game's greatest strengths, but the one thing that I was hoping for is something that was somewhat teased as being a major plot point: Is any of what's happening real? Visceral Games and EA had a real opportunity to create one major mind-bender of a game, but decided to play it a lot safer, with the exception of one EXTREMELY tense scene that involves some seriously unnerving self-surgery. The other thing that is both a positive and a negative is that Isaac is a much more fleshed-out character in this game. You get a sense of his own point of view and you finally get to hear him speak and interact with other characters, but this also unfortunately takes away from some of the mystery and silence from the first game that helped to make that game perhaps even more frightening at times. Sometimes, you just can't have your cake and eat it too.I literally have nothing to say about the multiplayer because I only play the FPS's on Multiplayer.Overall though, DEAD SPACE 2 isn't a terribly dramatic improvement over the first game, and I think it's already been announced that there will be a third one, but for fans of this franchise, you're in for some really great scares and some really terrific gameplay.4.5 out of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2012"}

I suppose they'd be one and the same.You play as Jack, a young troublemaker who finds himself in deep with the mob. In the opening scene you escape a car compactor and flee the gangsters who are out to kill you. Right away you are enrolled in a West-to-East coast cross-country race (sort of a reverse Turbo OutRun) for a grand prize that will settle your debts with said mobsters. That's it as far as story goes, not that it matters since some of the best racing games have virtually zero story.It's unlikely that you'll actually enjoy this trip from the Big Orange to the Big Apple as you'll spend half the time struggling to keep your car under control. The handling on all vehicles is simply terrible and anything/everything will make you fishtail. You'll cling to every guard rail, be they concrete or steel, like magnet. If you clip another car even gently, even by the wing mirror, you'll be thrown off the road. Rival drivers are capable of impossible physics and miracles. You are not. Are you enjoying that 1-second burst of speed? Well don't, because you're getting thrown right into a right-angle turn. Do you want a level where you can enjoy going fast? Well tough, because the next one, and the one after that, is mountain-based meaning lots and lots of switchbacks, and the road is wet too so if you even think about having even the slightest control over it then you will be disappointed. Winning any race is based on chance not skill.And there lies the worst problem of this game - if you go off the road by just a single freakin' INCH the game resets to the last check point, even if you have not past any checkpoints it will send you back to the beginning of the race and you'll still lose a reset point. When going off course, be it merely TOUCHING a grass verge or going off a cliff there is no destruction animation, the game just fades out. I swear it will make you so mad you'll chuck your controller through the TV and go out looking for a fight. Where the programmers complete idiots or cruel sadists?There's no installation either, and you know what that means, kiddies - loooooooooong loading times. I remember when I had Turbo OutRun for my Commodore 64 way back in 1991. It was a multi-load tape and would load each level one a time. I thought this was a chore even back then. Nothing has changed in 20 years.After playing it through to the end, because I hate myself, I only unlocked 36% of the trophies. Many of them are based on online play, which is a barren after 3 years of being released. As I have said before, online-based trophies should not count towards a Platinum.I cannot think of any reason to recommend this garbage to you. There are so many, many good driving games out there from Burnout to Motorstorm and Ridge Racer as well as all of the retro titles such as Daytona and OutRun. This is the second time I have been disappointed by the Need for Speed franchise and I will not be returning no matter what it promises.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2014"}

It was pretty cool at the time. And I was quiet excided to see what Nintendo would bring fourth with this system? Well, Nintendo did what they typically have done in the past.....Made some great games that are known for being Nintendo only titles. Such as Mario,Mario Kart,Zelda,Metroid,F-Zero,ect....And then they made some games that we're mediocre. What I liked about the Gamecube when it first came out, was that they focused on being a video game system. I bought a Xbox & PS2 aswell. But around the time these systems dropped, it was a huge selling point for Xbox & PS2 being DVD players too! That was cool, however, I buy game systems cause I wanna play games!!!! So that was cool to see Nintendo stand out on that aspect. Also, I like & recommend buying the Wavebird controllers. They we're the first well made & accurate wireless controller. The 8bit Nintendo (NES) had a wireless controller years ago too. But that was in the 80's. And the technology just wasn't properly implemented into the manufacuring of those wireless controllers. The Wavebird controller is light,accurate,wireless (of course), and has a good range to react with the Gamecube. Another cool thing Nintendo made for the Gamecube is the adapter that allows you to play Gameboy Advance games on your Gamecube, on your TV. The Gamcube came in various colors, such as black,indigo,platinum. And had four player ports on the console. This system isnot HD. It has AV inputs. In my opinion, the Gamecube is a overall pretty cool system. The controller layout at times needs some getting used to with some games. Not the best system (in my opinion) but a good one none the less...Some of the best games for this system are:Resident Evil ( I think Extinction...It has Jill on the cover w/ a zombie)Resident Evil 2 (graphics are still the same as the N64 & PS version)Super Mario SunshineMario Kart Double DashF-ZeroGodzilla Destroy All The MonstersSuper Monkey Ball 1 & 2007NBA Street 1 & 2Super Smash Bros.Dead 2 Rights (graphics are choppy, but the game was fun)There are many other titles that range between great-fairly good for this system.

And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle.

Fortunately for the folks at Guerrilla Games - and for us - Killzone 2 lived up to the hype in almost every regard, delivering one of the best first-person shooter experiences out there and effectively raising the bar for shooters to come.Killzone 2 puts you in the shoes of Sev, a member of the four-man Alpha Team. After repelling the Helghast attack on their home planet of Vekta, the ISA decided to launch a counterattack, bringing the fight to the desolate and volatile world of Helghan. The ISA hoped to quickly remove Emperor Visari, believing Helghast morale was at a low; instead, they're met with heavy resistance, which Alpha Team has to take care of along with the rest of the ISA forces. While not a groundbreaking narrative, the story works better than it does in most shooters and the characters as a whole aren't bad, despite the testosterone-heavy dialogue riddled with expletives. The story is at its best in moving the campaign forward, which grabs hold of you from the onset and refuses to let you go through the remarkably intense, adrenaline-pumping, and immersive action.The immersion and spectacle is due in part to the spectacular presentation of the game, which does well to make you feel as if you were really dropped in the middle of a war zone. As opposed to many games these days, the most exhilarating edge-of-your-seat moments happen in-game, and not during cutscenes. The game is a technical masterpiece that all shooters will be compared to from now on. Visually, it's a stunner. The lighting effects are particularly impressive, as everything in the game casts some amount of light, from the flash of a smoking barrel to the eerie glow of a Helghast helmet. Particle effects are also implemented beautifully as items lit on fire burn to a floating ash and dust is often kicked up into the air, temporarily obscuring your vision. The environments are also incredibly detailed and diverse, but more importantly, they're often destructible adding another layer of immersion and realism to the battlefield while also adding the fear of your cover breaking down around you, leaving you vulnerable. All of the ambient and chaotic noises are also done masterfully in 7.1 sound, not only adding yet another layer of realism, but mixing with an excellent soundtrack.As remarkable as the game is, there are a few technical hiccups that will occur. However, the only reason they are even noticeable is because they stick out in a game that is otherwise perfect on a technical scale. Most notable is the occasional pause in the action as the game loads the next segment, as the game forgoes the install at the beginning. Of course, the trivial nature of such technical complaints should only prove to illustrate how much of a powerhouse the game truly is.The single player campaign only clocks in at about 8-10 hours, but provides plenty of replay value with increased difficulty levels and trophies. The gameplay itself should be similar to what most players with FPS experience are accustom to, though Killzone 2 is a bit more of a tactical shooter than most, utilizing a unique cover system. Going in guns blazing might work partially well for the lowest difficulty, but properly utilizing the cover system becomes absolutely necessary for the increased difficulties because of the excellent enemy AI. Thankfully, your squadmates' AI is just as advanced; as opposed to just being meat shields, they'll often take out enemies you might have missed or alert you to enemies you weren't aware of. You're given one primary weapon, two types of grenades, and a secondary weapon, which is always a pistol, but incredibly useful as it has unlimited ammo. The primary options range from the expected, such as machine guns and assault rifles, to a few unique and fun weapons such as the flamethrower, bolt gun, and another particularly fun weapon that you're allowed access to only in one of the later levels. In addition to those options and melee kills, you also have a combat knife, which can slice through enemies with brutal efficiency.Once you've completed the enthralling single-player campaign, there is an incredibly deep and incredibly fun multiplayer component awaiting you. The two options available are \"Skirmish\" and \"Warzone\". Skirmish allows different gamemodes offline with bots, while Warzone is the actual online multiplayer component. Skirmish is fun, it can help new players learn the maps, and the bots' AI acts fairly similar to actual players, but the lack of local multiplayer in Skirmish was a bit of a letdown, because killing bots can only stay fresh for so long without the trash-talking and camaraderie of actual players. In fact, the lack of co-op - local or online - in the single-player campaign as well was another decision that left me scratching my head, as the squad-based gameplay is ideal for cooperative play.Warzone is a blast and the depth it holds is sure to keep players playing for months as well as drag players away from other popular online games. It features all of the standard game modes and a few new ones, such as Assassination. Furthermore, objectives change on the fly when you select a full Warzone game that will switch between the five game modes. Matchmaking is a breeze and the online maps are designed perfectly for hectic fragfests, which can hold as many as 32 players. While Guerrilla forgoes the options of customizable skins for your fighters, there's plenty of customization in the form of character classes and the application of badges, which offer various abilities and help create characters of unique skill sets.Killzone 2 may not do much to bring new players into the genre, but it gives shooter fans a great reason to keep playing them. If you're a fan of shooters or even just remarkably impressive technology, Killzone 2 is a must buy, without a doubt. The campaign offers a wide variety of challenge, unlockables, and ridiculously fun chaos. The multiplayer takes the game a step further with incredibly depth that's sure to keep people playing into the foreseeable future. Gamers wanted to know whether Killzone 2 would be the huge, great system-seller they all thought it would be. The answer is a loud, unequivocal \"yes\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"Alan Duquette","summary":"EA won't support this game anymore","reviewText":"Game has had a fatal flaw since over a year ago that was never and will never be addressed.  Does not happen to everyone but if it happens to you your game will not be able to progress.  I am referring to the infamous \"Silence Falls\" dilemma.  If you break a crystal without first having started the quest you will not be able to ever break the 3rd and final crystal.  Even if you regress to an earlier save where the crystal was not ever broken, the game will not forget.  The 3rd crystal will still be unavailable.  If those at EA are wondering why their sales of DLC are poor for this game, they are even dumber than the programmers.  No more EA games for me.  All they had to do was at least admit the fault but they chose to delete any references to this flaw from their site.  Can anyone say \"bad for business\"?  They can not delete the web though.  This flaw is permanent there, if you do a web search.Another flaw is, the game will allow you salvage the \"engraved Virani daggers\" which are necessary for the \"uprising mission.  This results in a quest failure.Another major quest flaw is if you leave the \"aster inheritance\" quest after you have the key, you can loose the strongboxes for ever and not be able to finish the quest.  I have 4 out of five but the fifth is lost now.  No chests on the map and definitely no yellow circle.  Update:  You can get the chests to appear if you look at the map in your inventory but they appear only until you interact with something. and then you have to look at the map again.I just found another flaw that stops progress.  If you user the lever to shut the door in one cave (can't remember which) you will not be able to open it again and you can not exit the cave because to get there you had to jump down.  This was my final straw.  I give up on this (yet another)flawed piece of crap that is not being patched yet download content still available.  All take and no give EA.Speaking of yellow circles.

I was amazed by the graphics that simply was perfect to watch, playing or just standing idol to admire the creation. Second, the gameplay. I haven't seen a more faster, in depth gameplay since Devil May Cry. Every aspect of the gameplay is what got me addicited. Third, the story. It may be basic, just another vengence title, no...it's more than that. I like the fact that you get to play a somewhat villianous character who at times seem like the hero. Well, he is the hero of the game and kicks a whole lot of a$$, but there is more to it. The story and character essence here is  ideal and hey, if you are playing the renegade spratan warrior Kratos, might as well kill a few innocent civilians. This isn't the first game where you get to kill innocent people, but it seems more consciously better as you will always be the relentless slayer of beasts and gods.The levels featured here are robust and richly detailed, from the ground to the mountains. The puzzles and mental tests found in each level is what makes this game more staid and professional. I mean if this game took three years in the making, it sure did come out great. There's even bonus features that are unlocked every time you beat a challenge. Costume designs and hidden items are few of the rewards to gain if you successfully slay some of the most hardest opponents including gods, beasts aand other mytical creatures.God of War play well. From the first time i bought it and took it for a rip on the Play Station 2, to the ending movies, special features and detailed lineament i've experieced. Playing this game really got me looking forward to more adventure titles that'll be released on PS2 and PS3. Everything you know about adventure games, PS2 and Greek Myth will be put to the test in this excellently fabricated game. The PS2 never released anything this good since Metal Gear Solid, Devil May Cry and Final Fantasy, so i suggest anyone over the R rating to play this game. It doesn't matter if you're a sports entusiast, stratagist or FPS die hard fan, God of War can connect to any PS2 player because it porvides excellent gaming and fun that makes the word 'game' relevant. It's a great title and i reccomend it to anyone over the age of 18.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2005"}

Well what can I say about this except, this game totally blew me away.  I'm going to start with the Campaign Mode this offers two unique stories and levels.  I like Decepticon side because, I like being the bad  guy trying to takeover, or you can be the usual good guy (Autobots) trying to save everything.  But you don't have to be good or bad on your own, you can team up with 2 friends online and be good or bad together and destroy some really cool bosses.  It takes place on their home planet Cybertron (a stunning mechanical-futuristic place) of course and the best part about it you're no longer big bulky semi-trucks, camaros and normal earth vehicles Autos and Decepts are Cybertronian vehicles which are the same as earth's except they look way better, cooler, meaner and tougher.  Now for the best part of the game Multi-Player, this offers a variety of modes Escalation- constant groups of robots attack until the players are defeated, Free-for-All- is every robot for himself, and my favorite Deathmatch-is just like with other shooters two teams go head-to-head to get the most kills.  The others are Power Struggle, Code of Power, Countdown to Extinction and Conquest, I won't spoil these for you but I think you'll enjoy them.  The character customizing is absolutely awesome, players must make their own Transformer based on the 4 classes, which determines their vehicle form Scout (car), Scientist (jet), Leader (truck), and Soldier (tank) each vehicle functions the same except Scientists can fly.  Each allows you two weapons, two abilities, and three upgrades each class has their own set of kill streak rewards, available weapons, and  abilities and last but not least you choose the color scheme of your robot. Now for my review GAMEPLAY 5stars controls are great, very engaging and fast paced not for casual gamers, STORYLINE 5stars finally we get the Autos and Decepts history, GRAPHICS 5stars it sounds and looks great, MULTIPLAYER 5stars.

I do miss the scares and puzzles in the earlier titles but looking back now they really were only fun the first and second run through. Theres much more gunplay, crowds of enemies and intense moments in RE5 making use of all the weapons available (and to upgrade). Gameplay is very similar to RE4 but I like the environment and enemies better in this one. If I were to try to explain it, RE4 felt a bit more mystical whereas RE5 feels more tactical, focusing more on firepower because of faster, more lethal enemies. The new inventory system felt a bit iffy to me at first but is pretty good once you get the hang of it, I definitely like the quick weapon switching. My only real complaint is that it is shorter than RE4 but again there is a good amount of replay value considering all the unlockables, weapon upgrades and difficulty settings. Also I just recently started getting into the mercenaries mode which is incredibly fun and addictive, nothing like chain blasting hordes of zombies with the magnum and shotguns. Graphics and cutscenes are beautiful as well, one of the best looking games Ive seen. In conclusion, this is the one game I felt was worth the full retail price. If you liked the new direction RE4 took then I think you will enjoy this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

Bully takes the Rockstar formula of gameplay and inserts it into a different setting this time: a crooked boarding school.  You play as Jimmy Hopkins, a very mischevious kid who gets dumped at Bullworth Academy by his mother and is left to fend for himself and deal with the clueless staff, and ruthless fellow students.  As an outcast of the school, Jimmy must attend classes, learn to fight bullies, and tricking and antagonizing the different cliques that run the school.  What makes Bully stand above and beyond the rest of the pack is that the game makes the most of it's setting with well done cut-scenes, great voice acting and music, and a storyline that manages to be mature without throwing in a bunch of cursing and sex, yet still manages to draw enough controversey because of it's content.  The graphics engine isn't the most attractive, but it does the job, while the rest of Bully is superbly done.  Offering challenging and innovative gameplay and a lengthy story, Bully is a real treat for PS2 owners looking to get something great out of their aging system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2006"}

What Portal 2 brings is a fun puzzle game loaded with a great sense of humor, fun yet challenging puzzles and lots and lots of gameplay!  Not only does portal 2 manage to emulate the original Portal, it improves on many aspects of the original which makes Portal 2 a fantastic and must have game for any puzzle lover or fan of the original game.GAMEPLAYThe meat and potatoes of the title, this is what Portal 2 is all about.  If you played portal then you will be quite familiar with the game mechanics and know what to expect, but for the newcomer to portal; The game involves solving puzzles using a portal gun which creates two inter-linked portals.  Though a bit of interesting storyline twists and turns you find yourself thrown into various testing chambers and situations ranging from small rooms to large warehouse sized areas.  Using your trusty portal gun you create portals and move about the room solving the various tests all in the name of advancing science!  There is a single-player campaign which contains the bulk of the simple storyline, and a co-op mode allowing you to play with friends or random people online in specifically designed co-op tests to help further the advancement of science!What makes the gameplay so enjoyable is smooth controls, virtually no bugs (unless you really try to break the rules with the portal gun), and a great sense of humor the characters have.  The personalities and dialogue add some spunk into the gameplay to keep things lively.  Each puzzle area provides a slow increase in difficulty, and despite some fairly long gameplay the puzzles do not feel repetitive at all.GRAPHICSWhile this is not the games strong point, nor does it need to be, the graphics are fairly nice on the PS3.  The game looks sharp and crisp.  I did not experience any slow downs during gameplay or graphical bugs.  To be honest there really isn't much to talk about when it comes to the graphics of Portal 2 since there is more of a focus on the gameplay/puzzle element.  The game does look really good though!SOUND/STORYA shining spot in the game is the sound effects and voice acting.  Top notch in my book.  The characters you will bump into on this crazy journey are great and voiced perfectly.  The dialogue is funny in a nice subtle way that hits you with a joke right out of left field when you least expect it.  There was a ton of effort put into the audio and sound effects of the game and it shows big time.  As for the story, this is a simple aspect of the game.  There is an underlying storyline here that plays out through the short dialogue segments while playing.  For the most part the storyline is there to lead you through the game while providing some minor background and insight into the background of Aperture Science (company that made the portal gun)REPLAY/LENGTHWhen it comes to the game length.. I completed portal 2  Single-Player in around 6-8 hours.  It could be shorter or longer depending on how good you are at puzzle solving, as well as how much time you spend trying to find hidden areas.  Replay wise, once you solve the puzzle there is no mystery to the room anymore unless you want to figure out alternative solutions to the puzzle or go trophy hunting.  The game also contains Co-Op mode which technically could have infinite replay value depending on your friends and just how crazy you two want to get with two sets of portal guns.  If you love the game it should have high replay value, as there is always room to find hidden objectives or find some hidden tricks in the various rooms.OVERALL A-/A ... 92%Portal 2 is a great successor to the original game.  It expands the puzzle nature of the game from simple rooms into large scale areas while throwing in some really comical humor and dialogue.  While similar to Portal in many ways, this game manages to subtly take itself to the next level.  By the time you are done with the game you will be smiling and really feel as if you spend your money well.  While Portal 2 is not a perfect game, it is a game worth owning and playing through multiple times, always leaving you satisfied in the end.NOTE: The PS3 edition of the game grants you a free copy of the PC edition as long as you have a steam account. (A steam account is free to create)NOTE: Portal 2 Co-Op is cross platform between PC and PS3 users.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2011"}

With that said, games like Haze occasionally try to mix things up a little, and while the idea is good, the execution ends up dragging it down a lot.The underlying plot of the game, both single-player and multiplayer, is that, in the future, a company/organization called Mantel uses a drug called Nectar to produce a generation of drugged-up super soldiers to fight for them in the third world. Multiplayer battles consist of skirmishes between Mantel troopers and rebels, while in singleplayer you start as a trooper and switch sides later on.The two sides have the same basic first-person gameplay, with some key abilities that are different. Mantel troopers inject themselves with Nectar, which enhances their perception (scopes can zoom in farther, enemies are rendered as glowing objects) and strength (soldiers move faster, hit harder, and regenerate health) as well as providing a hallucinogenic \"high\". There is a limited supply of Nectar that each soldier has, but it regenerates over time; the supply is counted in \"shots\" or \"injections\". Holding the L2 button down injects Nectar into your bloodstream, represented by a gauge. Release the button too soon, and you won't feel the effects of it for long. If you hold it down for too long, though, you can overdose, which renders you unable to tell between friend and foe. In many cases, when you are overdosed, you are unable to control yourself even to the point of randomly firing weapons or arming grenades (which you must shake the controller to throw away before it detonates). If you run out of Nectar, you are highly vulnerable; for this reason, you can usually siphon Nectar off of one of your teammates, if they have enough.On the other side, the rebels are as weak in combat as a Mantel trooper without his nectar. They make up for this with various ingenious techniques. Some rebel weapons are coated with Nectar, specifically knives and grenades that are made from Nectar-packs taken from dead troopers. Both of these weapons can cause Nectar overloads in enemies, causing the aforementioned self-damaging effects. Playing off of Nectar's effect of making dead bodies \"invisible\" (bodies fade almost instantly when playing as a trooper, but remain for a long time when playing as a rebel), rebel soldiers can \"play dead\" when hit, and then \"revive\" after the troopers have left. Rebels can also do various mechanical improvisations, such as taking ammo from dropped weapons and converting it to ammo for the weapon they are currently using, as well as turning grenades into proximity mines. Finally, they're generally faster and more agile than their trooper counterparts, capable of dodging and in some cases stealing an enemy's weapon.The single-player storyline is laughable, for the most part, with some interesting parts. You play as Shane Carpenter, wide-eyed idealist youth, who joins Mantel to make a difference and stop the unspecified mass murders and ethnic cleansings that the rebels are carrying out. The story starts on a carrier, where Carpenter meets his teammates - gung-ho, drug-fueled murderers in the finest traditions of sci-fi and war movies everywhere. Only, the difference here is that it makes sense - it's plain to see that Nectar screws with your mind just by the effects that show up when you use it in-game; the blurring, the sudden shifts of motion, and so on.  Carpenter's injection system malfunctions several times, which (a) leaves the player unable to use Nectar's beneficial effects, and (b) causes Carpenter to see things that his fellow troopers don't see; a dying comrade, screams of pain, massive piles of bodies, and so on. Carpenter questions his mission more and more, eventually leading to his switch to the rebel side midway through the game. Most of the story is ham-handed dialogue, though there are some good atmospheric moments; walking through one burnt-down village, or trying to find your way through a swamp, for example. These moments tend to only use dialogue as background noise - the heavy-handed boasting of the Mantel troopers contrasts against the quiet of the jungle's ambient noises. The use of camera in cutscenes is interesting, but not really new; the view is always from Carpenter's first-person perspective, though in some scenes his visor will slide away so that the HUD doesn't block your view. In most cutscenes, you can look around but not move, lending at least some feeling of interactivity to the scenes.As a whole, the gameplay - as mentioned - tries some interesting things, but ultimately falls short. A lot of it makes sense as a Mantel trooper - the poor control, for example, or the lack of solid feeling to movement and aiming - but when you're a rebel and you're supposed to be free of the hallucinatory drug, it's just bad. The guns are the most generic first-person guns ever - a pistol, an assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a chaingun, a flamethrower, and a rocket launcher. None of them handle well, and none of them are particularly fun or interesting, either. Grenades are pretty much worthless, and even in single player I've never managed to kill a person with one even when it exploded right underneath him. The vehicles handle incredibly poorly, often flipping with little to no provocation. On that note, your AI buddies  all have roughly the same abilities as yourself, but if they die they are gone forever, and finding new allies is incredibly rare. With that said, most of the times I had allies die (counting times I reloaded afterwards) was in vehicle crashes, when I'd take too much of an angle, my buggy would flip, and my gunner would die. Other than that, the AI soldiers are reasonably helpful, though the troopers and their Nectar injections are much tougher and more helpful than the rebel allies, who lack both the strength of the troopers and the ingenuity of the player and are left with pretty much nothing.The graphics are nice in some ways and terrible in others. For example, they load slowly, leading to that awkward phase where you watch a person's resolution increase in front of you. In other places, animation is jerky, or edges are jagged, or some other flaw exists that prevents the on-the-surface good graphics from actually being good. Furthermore, the designs are both silly and generic, especially the Mantel vehicles and their bright yellow glass. The voice acting is generic, too; not bad, but by no means actually good, and the ridiculousness of the lines makes up for whatever points good voice acting might have gained.This game has some good ideas, but the underlying genre of futuristic first-person shooter and the incredibly poor execution of graphics and gameplay render this game unbearable. For PS3 shooters, Resistance was better; for shooters in general, pretty much anything is better. This game doesn't deserve anything higher than a 4/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2008"}

It was a little slow to get started just like the Fallout 3, but I still enjoyed it.Pros: You have an option to be a good guy or a bad guy. You also get to choose your allies. I love the variety of guns and the card game they teach you. You can follow the main plot line or you can just explore and do various side missions. I like that it's a longer game instead of being over way too quickly.Cons: The game isn't different enough for me from the Fallout 3. Although I loved Fallout 3, I think they needed more changes. In addition, it freezes often and there are other glitches like your companions just disappearing suddenly. My suggestion is create new saved files often instead of writing over the same one all the time (the auto-save does this). That way if you hit a glitch you can recover more quickly.I agree with the other reviews in that you should wait a while for the price to come down on this game and for more patches to be released.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"A Clumsy Improvement","reviewText":"It was probably a mistake to label this game \"Dragon Age 2\" on account of everything that the \"2\" implies. To me, it said: direct sequel, and sequels to me usually imply building and improving on an established foundation. When thinking of it in those terms, DRAGON AGE 2 accomplishes almost none of this. Most of what madeDragon Age: Originsa joy to play (and what made it one of my favorite games ever) is gone now. For fans of the first game, this may result in throwing down the controller in the first two hours of playing. But I really came to like DA2, but not for the same reasons why I loved DA:O.The DA:O faithful might remember visiting a little town called Lothering after the Battle of Ostagar. Not too long after you leave, it's destroyed by the darkspawn, and this is where Hawke's story begins - kinda. It turns out, Hawke eventually becomes a rather important person; important to whom, that remains to be seen. But a dwarf named Varric is intent on telling Hawke's story and his adventures in a city-state called Kirkwall. So, as you continue your flight from Lothering, you're living out a story that's already been written - also, kinda.Now, the story... Was there one? It essentially boils down to a feud between mages and Templars (introduced in the first game), and over the course of the game you gradually decide which side you're going to fight for. It's certainly not strict; in DA:O, you were gathering an army to combat the Blight, but in DA2, you're really just going about your life. You're hit with a mountain of quests almost immediately, almost to an overwhelming degree. You'll have so many to sort through, you'll very likely lose track of what you were supposed to do in the first place, or why any of it was significant.To its credit, this game is jam-packed with content, and I'd argue that there's more to do in this game than there was in DA:O. But a major drawback for me is that the game rushes you through that content. You might remember doing a lot of wandering to complete each of the many quests in DA:O, walking through labyrinthian zones and the plethora of loading screens. BioWare took a very odd route to solving this, by essentially making it so that you can immediately fast travel...everywhere. This definitely took away a lot of involvement you would have otherwise had with the world itself. You can't even walk between zones, since every exit takes you back to the city map.I would have loved to see more pacing with the quests, at least by not making it so easy to jump around to each one. The rapidfire way in which you can burn through these quests also makes one of the game's major flaws more evident. You might have heard of the lack of unique dungeons. Indeed, you might have all four or five of them memorized by the time you're done with the first third of the game. This definitely cheapens the game overall. BioWare have made the claim that it was to save space for content. If that's true, I guess that's the way it has to be (using two discs would have been a solution), but it was very odd to go through an underground dungeon and discover I was standing in an exact copy of Hawke's house.Now, the characters were probably the prime reason I loved DA:O. I loved returning to the camp after finishing big quests and chatting it up with my party members, hearing their reactions, getting to know them. In DA2, you don't really have that option anymore. Although each character has their own house or hangout in Kirkwall, you can only talk to them a handful of times throughout the game. Most of the character development is done over the course of the game itself through quests. For the most part, this worked for me since they seemed to be more involved with what you were doing, and you could even ask for their help or advice sometimes. But, again, only a handful of times. You can't even say \"Hi\" to them otherwise.As for the combat, it was definitely a little uneven. At about the middle of the game, it was a lot of fun; I had the right amount of talents to fill up my hotkeys, so I could just mindlessly smash buttons. It's quick and frantic, and this is pretty much why it doesn't work so well later on. You'll have to start juggling talents and spells eventually, which means to you have to continuously smash the attack button, keep an eye on the battle (your target, your party, your health), and then pause the game at the right time so you can use items or talents that aren't hotkeyed. Through the last half of the game, I felt like I was doing way too many things at once, which made it hard to keep my strategies on the battlefield. In a 30+ hour game, I really started to miss the auto-attack option.Now, probably the best improvement in the game is the visuals. All of the races, male and female characters, look unique from each other. The environments are more defined, brighter, and just more impressive all around. Kirkwall itself is fairly unique, but certainly doesn't have the detail that the city should have, since 80% of the game takes place there. There's a lot of white stone, not as many people walking around as there should be in a city that's supposedly packed, so it can get kind of boring in large doses.Touching on the smaller elements, I was really worried that something would be lost in translation when it was announced the main character would be voiced. The Mass Effect series doesn't do much for me in regards to immersion and roleplaying since the options are so limited. But I was pleasantly surprised how much control you have over Hawke's every little action. You can ask questions, talk to your party members at times, and respond in various degrees of tone (peaceful, playful, and threatening), and you're given A LOT of opportunities to do this. So it does feel less like MASS EFFECT where you only prod Shepard every now and then, and more like DA:O where you have a ton of control over where the conversations go.I also loved that people don't refer to you as Hawke very often. This was a really good move on BioWare's part.As with DRAGON AGE: AWAKENING, I couldn't help but feel like there was a disconnect between the stellar writing and dialogue that the game's writers were turning in, and production itself. The codex entries will tell you that Kirkwall is this amazing city with a history and character, but then you look around and there's only white stone and no people, and when you dig deeper, there's only the same dungeon that you probably just left. For all the flair they managed to imbue in DA2, they never quite gave it enough depth; one of the locations, the Gallows, is supposedly out in the middle of a lake. You could've fooled me.Again, I think it was a mistake to call this DRAGON AGE 2, because this really isn't a sequel, it's a reboot. Unlike DA:O, you're limited to one race, one backstory, one city, a few dungeons, and a handful of instances in which you can talk to your party members (and you can't even change their armor). I personally think the writing and interactions are still just as fantastic, but they suffer beneath recycled and uninspired environments. And for as much as I enjoyed playing as Hawke, the game went out of its way a few times to remind me how much I wanted to play as my Warden again.To be honest, I'm still torn over this game. On the one hand, I would say that it's still worth checking out. RPG fans will take issue with the loss of some classic elements of the genre, elements that were present in the last game, but the large amount of roleplaying opportunities might soften the blow. It just takes a little time. But on the other hand, this game was an exercise in making you forget everything that happened in DA:O. Imagine if MASS EFFECT 3 has nothing to do with Shepard or any of his former squadmates: for me, it was a disappointment on that scale.How much you enjoy this game will depend on how much you invested in DA:O. Judged on its own, DRAGON AGE 2 is still a great RPG worthy of BioWare, if a little more rough around the edges than we're used to, but it won't have too much to offer those of us who left our hearts in Ferelden.[Completed the entire game, minus a few sidequests.]","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2011"}

I like the narrative alot i was surprised by how much of a smart ass hawke can be when you want him to be. I usually play the good guy but i found myself picking the smart ass option more often then not its just too funny to pass up. The romances in this one are little wonky, the two female characters i was interested in seemed to just shrug off my advances while the male mage character was all too eager to jump into bed. I'm not homophobic but it's sad that you're almost forced into romancing the male character if you're male.

I began to quickly become jaded. I dislike games where all there is to do is hit the trigger button. Can we say repetitive stress injury? I like a little bit of a plot with my carnage.I encountered a couple of glitches in the game, which bugged me as well. At one level I got stuck in a wall, and could not move, I just had to wait until the zombies mauled me to death, in another level, the camera got stuck in 'far away' mode, and even though I attempted to adjust the perspective, I couldn't. I was forced to watch from a distance, as my character got hit by monsters I couldn't see. This was the most frustrating glitch.Also, I was disappointed in my inability to save, until nearly the end of each level, which meant I had to go back to the beginning and start over, everytime I was killed. This game is almost impossible to complete in single-player mode without cheating. It was so frustrating to try to go through levels with dozens of monsters spawning all around you only to watch your life bar dwindle to nothingness. I understand from other reviews that this game is really intended for multi-player audience. I whole-heartedly agree. It was fun playing with a friend, impossible in single player mode.Overall, I give it 3 stars for an interesting concept and good graphics. But I'll have to pass, unless the next one has more plot and is a little less dark. I prefer my horror to be subtle. Not graveyards filled with hundreds of endlessly spawning monsters.

{"product_name":"B0053BG122","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Despite a few glitches, overall a successful transition to the Xbox with some spectacular Kinect-only features","reviewText":"Like most of you, I was curious about a few questions with Just Dance 3. First, how does Just Dance 3 for Kinect compare to its counterpart on the Wii? Second, how does it compare to the gold standard for dance games on the Kinect, Dance Central? Third, how does it stand on its own as a game? I'll try to cover all those questions in this review.As with the Wii version, the opening menu of Just Dance 3 is delightfully simple. You're given four choices:* Dance* Just Create* Extras* Shop\"Dance\" has four options. \"Songs\" allows you to jump into the songs and start dancing. You scroll through a list of songs. As with the Wii version, you'll see icons signifying the difficulty level (gears) and the intensity level (drops of sweat).If you know and love the Wii version, it'll be an easy transition to play the Kinect version. The gameplay and the graphics are virtually identical. A colorful silhouetted figure will dance on the screen and you have to dance the \"mirror image\" to it. The more accurately you dance, the more \"stars\" you'll earn. At the end of the dance, you'll see your point total and earn \"Mojo Points\" to unlock new songs, choreography, and playing modes (the first gift is \"Jamaican Dance Mashup\")Ubisoft has wisely kept the songs and the choreography identical across the platforms, which means you can learn the dances on a Wii and know the routines inside and out when visiting a friend with an Xbox (and presumably with a PS3, once that version is finally released).There are two important distinctions from the Wii version: first, you're not holding a remote in your hands so you have complete freedom of movement. Second, you see a little postage-sized silhouette of yourself in the upper left-hand corner which lets you easily compare how well you're performing the dance with the on-screen silhouette. Both of these things are definitely an improvement over the Wii.One thing that is decidedly not an improvement over the Wii version is multiplayer mode. It says that up to four players can play together, but all four players have to squeeze together in a staggered pattern to fit within the Kinect camera range, and players are so tight that you invariably end up hitting and bumping into each other. The way the system tries to automatically detect players can be spotty as well. Before the song, each player has to stand in front of the silhouette whose moves they want to follow and follow it throughout the dance routine. I found that it can take several tries before getting it right, but once you get it right it's a lot of fun, especially if you have four players (You can see from the song selection icon whether the choreography is designed for one, two, or four dancers).Before each song you can choose a \"difficulty level\" by raising your hand. You can choose between \"Easy\" and \"Normal\". The \"Easy\" setting icon shows a person whose torso is highlighted but whose lower body is white; presumably this was added to the Kinect version because some folks' Kinects (like mine) are set up in a small room where there's not enough space to capture the whole body. But to be honest, I tried dancing to the same songs on both settings and I really didn't notice a difference between either.The motion tracking seems to be spot on, if a little lenient. The first time I danced to \"California Gurls\", I easily got 10,295 points and 5 stars. I started to think pretty highly of myself until I noticed that for practically every song I tried (even ones I never tried before), I'd get 4 or 5 stars. As an experiment, I tried just standing still and flailing my arms up and down through the whole song, and I still ended up getting 3,613 points and one star. I think Ubisoft learned from their experience with the original Just Dance that it's better to be a little more lenient in scoring than to be overly harsh. Some people (particularly kids or newbies dancing in a party setting) will welcome this, while others may be a little annoyed that there's not much of a challenge in racking up a high score. As for me, I've learned to ignore the score and just enjoy the game on its own merits.The best way to sum how up Just Dance 3 deals with motion detection is that it seems that the greatest emphasis (as with the Wii version) is placed on arm movements and general body movements, more so than precise detection of where your hands and feet are at any given time.This is probably a good way to describe the difference between Just Dance and Dance Central. Dance Central definitely is a superior title if you're looking for a much higher degree of precision or something approaching \"detailed dance instruction\". On the other hand, Just Dance 3 is arguably the better title if you just want to hang out with friends and have a fun time. And this is just personal preference, but I much prefer the simplicity of Just Dance's silhouetted characters over the overly stylized hipster doofus characters in Dance Central.The other options under \"Dance\" include \"Playlists\", which lets you choose from similar types of songs grouped together (e.g. oldies, songs that make you sweat, duets, etc.); \"Specials\", which lets you play unlocked play modes; and \"Sweat\", which lets you activate \"Sweat Mode\" and accumulate \"Sweat Points\" with every song you play. Just as in the Wii version, about 4.2 sweat points = 1 calorie burned. As you hit milestones, the system will offer encouraging comments (after 1000 sweat points, it'll tell you that you just exercised the equivalent of walking across Central Park).The \"Just Create\" menu is unique to the Kinect, and it is where Just Dance 3 for Kinect really shines. In it, you can record your own choreography. You can select \"Coach Me\", where you can create your choreography based on the existing Just Dance 3 choreography (the dancers will be dancing the standard routine behind you as you record your movements in front), or \"Freestyle\", where there are no background dancers and you just create your choreography from scratch. There's also \"Dance Off\" mode, where you'll dance most of the song to the pre-set choreography, but be able to go off and freestyle during specific parts in the song. In all these modes, you appear on screen as a grainy silhouetted figure yourself, not exactly the same as the usual on-screen characters, but close enough.After you create your dance moves, you or your friends can play them just like any other Just Dance song, complete with scoring (not as accurate as the pre-set choreography, but you'll have so much fun you won't care). You can even share your original creation with the world in the online \"Gallery\", or play other peoples' creations. While no doubt there are some dancers who will use this to create intricate and professionally choreographed dance routines, I get the sense most people will use it to just goof around and have a lot of fun with friends to see who can come up with the silliest moves. The good news is, it works well for both.Under Extras, you can view Credits, enter an Unlock Code (presumably a future feature that Ubisoft will use for promotional purposes), select a Hard Drive \"for loading and saving your progression\", and turn on/off Pictograms, Lyrics, How to Play Tips, Short Dance, or Short Create.Under Shop, there are only three choices as of this writing: Fame by Irene Cara, Heart of Glass by Blondie, and U Can't Touch this by MC Hammer (these were songs that were available on the original Just Dance for the Wii; I assume over time they will port all of those over eventually).You may notice that I give the game 5 stars for \"fun\" but overall 4 stars. And this is mainly because of Ubisoft's very poor execution of the Kinect user interface, which seems like a trivial point but really impacts the overall enjoyment of this title.The first indication of a problem was when I was selecting the list of songs. It was painful to try to choose one. There's a very long list of songs to scroll through, and you have no control over the scroll speed. You just lift your arm to scroll up and lower your arm to scroll down. When you find the song you want, it takes several tries before you can pinpoint the one you want, and then you have to keep completely still to select and \"swipe\" it in a very precise way. The controls are so hypersensitive that the slightest body movement in the wrong way and you need to start over, which can get very annoying. This could have been executed much, much better.The hypersensitivity of the controls is a problem throughout the menu selection process. Here is a true story: I played a few songs before sitting down to write this review in front of the TV. I then looked up at the screen and saw a purchase of downloadable content had been made. What happened was, the Kinect continued to track my body movements and had, completely on its own, selected \"Shop\" > \"You Can't Touch This\" > \"Buy It\", and then checked out (deducting 240 Microsoft Points from my account) all without me realizing it! So the poor execution of Just Dance 3's user interface ended up costing me in a very real sense. The irony is, while the system is horrifically hypersensitive on screens like the home screen, in other parts of the program you have to swipe and swipe at a menu option before it'll let you select anything.At the end of the day, I turned on my Xbox Controller and stopped trying to use the Kinect to navigate the menus. That made things a thousand times better.Poor execution of the Kinect user interface notwithstanding, Just Dance 3 is overall an extremely enjoyable game. If you're more of a dancing purist, I would hold off and see what Dance Central 2 has to offer. On the other hand, if your goal is to just have fun and get exercise, I think Just Dance 3 definitely rates just as high or higher than Dance Central on these fronts with its easy-to-master dance moves and its whimsical sense of humor and fun graphics. And the Just Create mode, unique to the Kinect for now (time will tell if and how well they incorporate it into the PS3 version) is worth the price of admission--it really expands the fun you can have with the game and ensures that it'll be one you play with friends over and over again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

I looked into charging docks and this seemed to be the best choice.The Quad Dock Pro has two spots to charge a regular controller, one spot for a move controller and one spot for the navigator.  You CANNOT plug a move contoller into the navigator spot, which is the reason this item got 4 and not 5 stars, since not many people have a use for the navigator at this time.  The Dock has a regular wall plug, which works well for us. When you plug in the controller the light is red if it needs to be charged and turns blue when it is fully charged, which I like.  The instructions say, that you can charge other items as well, like an MP3 player, but I have not used that function yet, so i can't write a review on it.Overall I think it is a good by if you have several controllers you want to charge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004W4QJ","description":"Three years ago, gamers were introduced to Aya as she resigned from the  New York Police Department and enlisted as a NMC (neo-mitochondrion creature)  hunter for the shadowy government organization M.I.S.T., a secret agency of  monster slayers somewhere betweenGhostbustersandMen in Black.  Wherever there was a neo-mitochondrion outbreak, Aya and her team were on the  scene to put the boots to the mutants. From the outset, it's evident that  SquareSoft revamped the entire game to give gamers a better looking, sounding,  and (most importantly) playing experience.The game starts with Aya training in the agency's shooting gallery in Los  Angeles. Just as she begins to get in a groove, she is asked to look into some  strange happenings at the Akropolis Tower. When she arrives on the scene, an  explosive, full-motion video flashes across the screen and showcases the death  and carnage as Aya surveys the scene. Her entry into the Tower is where this RPG  begins.SquareSoft has kept some of the excellent elements of the weapons systems from  the firstParasite Evetitle, but went for an entirely new battle system.  Combat is delivered in real time and allows players to run, hide, and open fire.  Aya can tap into her parasitic powers and can unleash elemental, magic-based  attacks on the many foes she encounters. Ammunition is plentiful in the game and  there are plenty of entertaining weapons to choose from. Auto targeting and  involving puzzles are back, though the arrow-pointing interface for solving  these puzzles is really hard to operate.The cinematic mix of story and action is very well done, and the numerous  cutscenes do an excellent job of moving the pace along in a believable way.Even though the originalParasite Evehad its problems, SquareSoft has  pieced together an excellent sequel that will satisfy fans of the first game and  help create many new ones.--Todd MowattPros:New, real-time battle system is an improvement over firstParasite  EveGreat weapons and plentiful ammunitionGreat mix of story and actionCons:Clunky interface for solving puzzles","reviewerName":"C.

Who would have ever thought up the idea of mitochondria that went wild and attacked America's most profound city, New York? Not many people, except maybe a genius! Parasite Eve II is not as special as PEI, but it certainly is a great game, and in many ways, it is better than the first Parasite Eve title. For one thing, in this new game, battle is in real time, unlike the first PE which had a Pokemon-style battle system, where each character took turns, esentially in fighting. Not anymore! PEII is much more like Resident Evil, which makes fighting even more fun. The monsters are cooler in PEII, except it's missing the first Eve, no doubt the most awesome video game villian ever created. She was as cool as the script of the game! But now, the monsters aren't just funny little animals loose. There are actually scary, Resident Evil-like monsters with awesome features and battle techniques!(Except for that damn Shaman Horse!)The guns are also better in PEII, and there is not as many features to get used to in PEII as in the first title. That's also way better! The levels are generally cool, and for a Playstation title, the graphics are a big WOW! even for a Gamecube and PS2 owner with games such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and Resident Evil on the GC. Now for the icky part-the innovative but awful control scheme! I spent a half an hour trying to run straight ahead at first without running backwards, and vice-versa! Actually, after a couple of hours, the controls may feel comfortable. That's until you go back to playing one of your other games with \"traditional controls.\" OUCH!! Parasite Eve II is definitely a fun game, if not a great game! In most ways, it is better than PE, except for it's missing the classic Eve and the storyline and cinematics are a little weaker.(However, the cinematics are the best that Squaresoft has ever produced!) Above all, if you liked the first PE, then you will be most pleased with this title! If not, then maybe you are happier with Resident Evil or Super Mario games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS3","description":"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destinyexpands on the original title with larger environments to explore, new character interactions, enhanced swordplay, and more than twice the volume of animated movies. The game tells an epic story that blends magical realism with accurate historical accounts of 16th-century feudal Japan. It begins 10 years later than the events inOnimusha: Warlords, after Nobunaga, an infamous Japanese warlord, has brutalized a village. Players take the role of the hero, a young warrior and master of the Yagyu Shinkage sword-fighting style who seeks revenge against Nobunaga. In the process, he will uncover his destiny.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A lot like the first one, but with more action","reviewText":"Fans of the first Onimusha will certainly like this game. In this game, which takes place ten years after the first one, Nobunaga Oda is now the new king of the demons and is wreaking havoc across the land. The main character, Jubei Yagyu, is a samurai who embarks on a journey to kill Nobunaga for destroying his clan. Like the first game, the story is still a bit straightforward, but it's also more fleshed out and actually branches off into many different possible scenarios thanks in part to some RPG-like elements that have you interacting with supporting characters by trading goods and weapons. Certain cutscenes and mini-games change depending on which of the four supporting characters you have a stronger rapport with, however the beginning and ending scenes remain mostly unchanged, no matter who you're bosom buddies with. Not all players will likely want to spend that much time in playing out each possible scenario, at least not with back to back playthroughs. The game's movement and combat controls are almost exactly the same here as they were in the first game. Jubei plays a lot like Samanosuke and possesses many of the same types of sword attacks and his own array of magical weapons imbued with elemental attacks. One cool addition to the gameplay is Jubei's ability to perform an Oni awakening, which is when he temporarily tranforms into an Oni warrior who can unleash devastating attacks on his enemies and is invulnerable to harm. This ability is especially useful against certain boss enemies, specifically the next to last boss who is actually one of the more difficult enemies in the entire series. The only downside to the Oni awakening is that it only happens after you absorb five purple souls from defeated enemies, and it happens automatically, so make sure to absorb the last purple orb only when you need it.The supporting characters are the skilled fencer Oyu, the spear wielding monk Ekei, the firearms expert Magoichi, and the deadly ninja Kotaro. Each one of these characters has their own distinct fighting style and their own personalized magical abilities (Magoichi in particular offers a unique combat experience since he uses a number of cool, yet strangely futuristic firearms). This variety in playable characters and the more challenging array of regular enemies and boss enemies make the combat more enjoyable compared to the first game. The game's puzzles are of a similar style to those in the first game, collecting certain items to open certain doors, so those who enjoyed the previous puzzles will enjoy these. The great graphics and orchestral music are also very similar. In the end, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a lot of the same fun as Onimusha: Warlords with more variety in its gameplay and slightly longer story mode (you should beat it in about 6 to 7 hours). Fans of the original game (like me) or of hack'n slashers (also like me) will love this game. Get it fellow fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

Kirby is  joined by plenty of friends who will aid in his quest to recover the  pieces of an important shattered crystal.While the levels are a bit too easy for older gamers, the gameplay inKirby&nbsp;64is original enough to entertain all ages. Kirby  still has an appetite for enemies, sucking them up and spitting them  out, but he can also swallow them, inheriting abilities such as fire  and cutter. Also, Kirby can now combine enemy powers, often with  hilarious results. For instance, electricity plus stone turns Kirby  into an electrifying little light bulb. Sure, you don't need to use all  these powers, but they're still fun to play with.--Robb GuidoPros:Whimsical 2-D graphicsKirby 64's copy and combine abilities result in some unique and varied  gameplayCons:May be too easy and too cute for older players","reviewerName":"Clark Beyer","summary":"An excellent game for the N64","reviewText":"This was the first kirby game I ever got my hands on.  And since then, I have been playing numerous games from the series.  I heard about the Kirby series while playing Super Smash Bros.  I became skilled with Kirby's character, swallowing Link and Samus and using DK's super punch...then I heard about the Crystal Shards on a commercial and got it.It is indeed an excellent game.  The story is thus: Kirby gets smacked on the head with a strange crystalline object and is thrust into an adventure with countless baddies, deadly bosses, and cool music.  I particularly enjoyed combining two powers and make a new one.  You could combine spark and freeze and turn Kirby into a refrigerator in order to heal himself with food.  Or you could combine needle with freeze and turn Kirby into a giant expanding snowflake that freezes enemies that come near it.  Pure ownage.For the most part, this game is short and simple, with the exception of a few levels and bosses: On World 5: Shiver Star, there are two difficult levels.  And as for the bosses, I'd have to say the boss of Neo Star is real cool-looking and hard.The effects are what really give this game a significant boost in terms of quality; the sound effects are devastating.  When fighting Mag Man, the boss of world 4: Neo Star, it uses a special attack in which lava thrusts your platform into the ceiling; you could hear the magnificent sound effect of searing lava lunging upward, and it really amplified Mag Man's image as a boss character.Not only are the effects great, but so is the level design!  Each level has great detail, enemy locations, and great twists.  On Shiver Star, there is a level that most closely resembles a mega-mall in the winter time; you can ride escalators, elevators, dodge colorful falling shelves.  Another exciting level would be the underground factory on the same world.  The background art is astounding for this level; you see tanks of frozen organisms that look extremely freakish, there are strange grinning machines that try to crush you, and there are tight spaces with cannons and the ceiling trying to crush you against the floor.  Whoa.And the music goes along with the situation: in the wintertime mega-mall level, Christmas-type music plays.  In the factory level, mechanical percussion dominates.  In the more pleasant grassy stages, peaceful classic Kirby music plays as you hop along swallowing guys for their powers.The only fault I found with this game was that I wish it was longer.  If you ever get bored with it, start collecting enemy info cards, playing the multiplayer minigames, listening to the sound tests, and even trying to collect each and every crystal shard and experiment with various abilities.  It is nigh impossible to be bored with this game.Let me make a comment on the graphics as well: they are great.  These graphics are worthy of a sega dreamcast, they are not the traditional \"blocky\" graphics of several N64 games; they are easily told apart.That's all the info I need to state that this is easily one of the best N64 games out there.  Being a huge Nintendo fan, i highly recommend you buy this game.  If you have an N64 without this game in your library, I hope you find it, because you'll regret it if you don't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2005"}

Brown \"Ghost in the Shell\"","summary":"Halo series; it was good but could have been so much better","reviewText":"I would just like to say, I am a big halo fan.  I do and still consider it one of the best console gaming series, neck and neck with Half Life (or maybe a little better).  But Halo 3, the end of the series is \"good\" but could have been so much better.  My short review really could be summed by saying that Halo 3 is Halo 2.1 for XBOX360.  I think Bungie and Microsoft played it safe by just recreating Halo 2 with better graphics and sound.  From a business perspective, it was probably a smart move.  Literally, there were the same weapons, same ships, same friendly characters just super-sized for the Xbox.  The enemy characters acted in the same way, going through the same movements.  The sad part is that they didn't recreate those famous battles there were tough as h*ll.  There were a couple of tough battles with the flood and that was about it, everything else was a cake walk.  After about 2 checkpoints, I knew I had to go from Normal to Heroic.I don't know, maybe I played Halo 1 and 2 too much, but Halo 3 just felt like a lackluster experience.  The AI, to me, seemed a little weaker; there were times where I was actually waiting before the enemy would shoot at me and he never did.  And my favorite enemy character, the Elites weren't present (I guess they are on our side now).  That Halo 2 character was awesome and would act like a predator and hunt you down.  Most of the characters in three were just dummy targets waiting to get shot.  I remember playing Halo 1 - 2 over and over and over again trying find a better strategy.  It is Sep 27 (2 days after the release) and I have already beaten Halo on the Heroic; it would probably take me 5 hours to beat it on legendary.On the multiplayer, so far it seems pretty good.  Good maps, same Halo 2 like system.In Summary:+1. Great music, really set the tone+2. Great continuation of story+3. Great 360 graphics; you could see the bullets, blood, metallic shininess+3b. So far, great multiplayer-4. Horrible maps that were too linear and too easy-5. AI lacked, I literally could stand there for a minute before some enemies would shoot me.  Where were the Elites?-6. New weapons and ships were cool but I was just fine using the older weapons like the assault rifle.(-76b, pistol reaaaaaallly sucked this time)In terms of the Xbox 360 games out now.  I am not really a fan of Bioshock and think Halo 3 is way better.  I might have to give Gears of War a better rating than Halo 3.  Gears of War left you proud to have beat the game, especially on the hardest game setting.I think Halo 3 will get a bunch of rave reviews and hold people's attention for a couple of months or a year, especially to new fans but I don't think it will satisfy the serious Halo junkie.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2007"}

Best action FPS experience to date","reviewText":"I've been playing video games and FPS shooters since Wolfenstein and Doom in the early PC gaming days. Crysis 3 is a ground-breaking achievement that is probably the closest thing to \"next generation\" gaming that we'll see this generation (with a couple of exceptions; Bioshock 3 being one example).Crysis 1 set the all-time benchmark for graphics, and is actually still used for 3D graphics benchmarking today. Crysis 2 brought improved controls, storytelling, and graphics, along with a more immersive experience overall. Crysis 3 improves in every possible aspect of gaming (yes, especially the graphics, it's just absolutely gorgeous to watch).But best of all, it just has a really, really great pace and sense of action. If Crysis 2 was a 10, this one gets an 11. It's very well balanced; the \"feel\" is rich and full and fast; explosions and atmospheric stuff going on everywhere, just the right mix of sneaking while cloaked and blasting away with various (well thought out types of) weapons left and right. It never gets boring or slow, not for a second. And if you're a fan of smart games with political/futurism/science fiction overtones, it delivers there as well; I've always felt that 2 and 3 take some cues from the Metal Gear Solid series (unabashedly), which is a good thing.I've played a lot of recent FPS games; Halo 4, Killzone 1-3, the Call of Duty games, etc.  My honest opinion is that if you're a fan of the subject matter (especially if you're already a fan of the series), this game is the best value I've found in an FPS in quite a few years, and picking it up is a no-brainer. I just finished the single player campaign and it was tremendously satisfying. And now there's a wealth of rich multiplayer content to be had!

All other buttons work regardless of the keypad being attached or detached.The keyboard is okay but it's better suited for larger hands (or long thumbs). As a Blackberry user, I find this keyboard less comfortable than that of a classic Blackberry - but I've been using Blackberies for almost 10 years already so I may be a little bit spoiled or maybe biased toward their ergonomics.As far as workmanship is concerned, my impression is one of a well-built, durable device. It integrates well, visually and functionally with the PS3 controllers.The setup:----------After a couple of hours of charging through the USB port (cable not included), the keypad is ready to use. Once the On/Off switch is set to On, all that's needed is for the keypad to be connected to the PS3 through a USB cable and the pairing is done automatically.The workings:-------------The keypad operates in two modes: as a keyboard or, interestingly, as a touch pad.In keyboard mode, you get a QWERTY keyboard with well separated, round little keys. The letters, numeric and punctuation keys are where you would expect them to be but the special keys are not exactly at their familiar places and some of the less essential ones (PgUp, PgDn, End, Home and the function keys) are missing. Special characters can be entered with the help of 2 modifier keys (the Blue and the Orange).Three special keys allow you to enable the touch pad mode or quickly jump to your PS3 message box or friends list icons - I did not find the last 2 very useful.Until you make yourself familiar with some of the less obvious key combinations it's a good idea to save the instructions pamphlet (a 17\"x11\" folded sheet) found in the package.The touch pad mode is very interesting in that, after pressing the 'touch pad key', the keyboard is disabled and a section of the keyboard emulates a laptop's touch pad and the 2 cursor keys emulate mouse buttons and you can interact with your environment as if you were using a mouse.I am a 'knob' person as far as mouse emulation is concerned but, based on my testing, the touch pad mode, while interesting and innovative, is not very well implemented. For example, while in Browser mode, it does not allow you to scroll down your browser window, something that is easily and intuitively accomplished with the R3/L3 analog sticks. The cursor, when controlled with the touch pad was jumpy, either moving from one corner of the window to another or, sometimes, not moving at all. The good news is that all the controller buttons, including the sticks, are fully functional all the time so, people like me, won't have to use the touch pad.Brief evaluation:-----------------+ Bluetooth device, does not require dongles or wires+ Replaces a full-size keyboard, well suited for entering passwords or brief messages+ Perfectly integrated, physically and functionally with the PS3 controller - generally, it does not interfere with game play+ Rechargeable battery+ According to Sony (not tested by me) it can be paired with other Bluetooth devices (don't lose that manual)- Adds weight to the controller- Some of the special keys are placed at unfamiliar locations- Keys 'real estate' wasted by assigning 2 keys to jump to the message box and the friends list- Touch pad does not work very well- Small hands may find it a bit uncomfortableBefore I started writing this review, I thought I was going to award this keypad 3 stars but, once I listed the pros and the cons I see that the negatives are relatively minor. The major disappointment is the touch pad but it's not something that I am going to miss because I am already happy with the R3/L3. 3.5 stars should be the fair score but I am rounding it up to 4 because my overall impression is positive.With HOME now a reality, this is likely to become an increasingly useful add-on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

This game will have you screaming at your tv, yelling at the imaginary monsters, and wondering why you died. You may be tempted to give up, but you will hear the game laughing at you. And you just have to put it back in.This game is like Ghosts n' Goblins for a new generation. It is wickedly evil and unforgiving, but oddly addictive. You can choose to take some time to help out other players, attack other players, or just run around on a narrow edge a mile above a toxic pool (of something that will be explained in the game) while giant bugs and zombie-like enemies poke at you with fire while a giant runs after you. Sounds hard? Well, it is. But that makes the victories that much sweeter.Your character is what you make it to be, and while you do choose a starting class, those are just base stats and equipment, nothing more. Will you be an all-powerful mage? Perhaps a heavily armored knight wielding a giant sword is more to your liking? Either way, this game is pure fun and if someone doesn't agree, then they are missing the point. Games have been diluted over the years (Devil May Cry 4 compared to the impossible 3) but From Software said , \"Forget that, you're gonna have to work for your rewards.

The Wind Waker HD doesn't add any uniqueness , rather trying desperately to satisfy the die-hard fans of OOT, by creating the same puzzle ideas, same weapons, same bosses strategies and same nemesis, the only special touch of wind waker is the concept of sailing, and this is not totally great, unless you enjoy getting lost in the seas and sailing for a very long time to reach a destination, you will find your self strayed and not aware of your objective, you simply reach to a point to ask your self, what is next? where should I go and what should I do? and this eventually will drive you to get bored of the game and thinking it's pointless and may want to refer to a walkthrough at most time.I know the legend of Zelda is better than that, but maybe my problem is I didn't play the gamecube version, and actually experienced The Wind Waker after Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess, which both were legendary.I think The Wind Waker should be a game of its own, but the biggest dislike here is why are you trying to imitate ocarina of time? move on, create a game with special ideas, and let us experience a matchless Legend Of Zelda,","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"A Few Flaws but an Awesome Healthy \"Game\"","reviewText":"The Wii Fit \"game\" for the Wii is far more than a game! It comes with a balance board and lets you practice yoga, strength training, aerobics and other fitness games with your very own Personal Trainer.First, how it works. There is a white plastic balance board you stand on, which is in essence a multi-part scale. It can tell exactly where you are standing on the board, and where your weight is. If you lean forward, it senses the weight shift. If you stand on one foot and wobble around, it can sense that wobble. *Precisely*.So for example, in the yoga area one of the exercises is \"tree pose\". This is the classic yoga pose you see with one foot against the other leg and the hands up in the air. You stand that way for about a minute. The Wii knows exactly how steady you are, and shows you a red dot dancing around the screen to show your fluctuations. Of course, if you are really good at this, it shows that dot calmly at rest.Being a scale, the system tracks your weight loss (or gain) each time you use it, and because you put in your age and height, it tracks your BMI as well. The charts show you how you progress each day, and what your daily exercises levels are, broken down by the various categories.You can choose a male or female trainer, and the trainer demonstrates the moves visually on the screen while you watch. So for push-ups, the trainer is on the screen, doing them properly, giving you advice on form and what to do. They tell you exactly what muscles you will be working out. They provide front-and-back views so you can get a better sense of what you're doing, and give audio messages as well so you know when to change position.There is really a lot of variety here. There are games like hula hoop and walk-the-tightrope to give you some fun. There are different levels of some games you can unlock. You can \"go for a run\" where you have the Wii controller in your pocket and run (not on the board) in place, while an interesting scenery scrolls past on the TV. The speed the scenery moves is based on your own running speed, so you can go faster or more slowly. You can even run with a friend!You are told NOT to jump on the board and in fact the game will restart a given level if you do, to help make that clear. The board is a scale, as mentioned, and they do their best to have you treat it relatively gently.You really can work up a sweat if you do harder activities, but there is a LOT in here for the out of shape to start slowly.Now all of this begin said, there are several downsides to this game that they really should have added in.First, they have lots of little short games - and no way to connect them together! You have to track down activity 1. Go through it. Then go back out to the menus and track down activity 2. It can take literally a minute to go between one thing and the other, with lots of button clicking. They should have let you string together \"my fitness set\" to do this more easily. They do have a \"favorites\" menu that lets you see the 10 things you do the most, but it's not the same.Next, they don't recommend anything at all based on your weight / BMI. You are completely on your own to know what to do. You can tell it \"I want to lose 20 pounds in 6 months\". Fine. It doesn't give you any help or guidance at all. No \"hey you lost 20 calories\" or \"only 10 minutes to go!\" You have to make your own plans. Normally this is what a trainer does for you - so their virtual trainer is pretty useless.Which goes into another thing a real trainer would help you with - the order of activities. Muscle groups work in combination with each other and you should warm up, then do a combination of activities, then cool down. The Wii Fit has no information at all about this type of planning. You could randomly choose things to do that all work out your legs for example and never touch your lower back. You could cause strain on your body by leaping into the higher activities without doing a warm up lower activity. This would have been SO simple for them to build into the system, but they did not.The scale unit tops out at 330 pounds. I work with many obese people and there are MANY people out there over 330 pounds who this system would have been ideal for. They can't use it. I know someone who was 270 pounds who used this and the system kept giving them errors. I know they can't have an infinite weight scale, but something a little higher end would have been very encouraging.To me these things are all \"really should put into Version 2\" issues. I will still give WiiFit 5 stars for being a groundbreaking entry into the video gaming world - something that can really change lives and help people become more healthy. There are all sorts of other \"would be great\" enhancement ideas - for example, if you hooked up a video camera, you could see how YOUR downward facing dog looked, to see if it matched the \"trainer\" on the screen. That could be hugely helpful for people.WiiFit is definitely a great software package - I wouldn't call it a game - and I highly recommend that everybody get their hands on one if they can. It's a system that appeals to all ages, is healthy for all ages, and is a lot of fun too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2008"}

Bethesda Softworks (Fallout 3, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion) and Splash Damage (Enemy Territory: QUAKE Wars) hope its the next big franchise to hit consoles.  The impressive art direction in the advertising campaign originally drew me to this game, but does it translate to tengaging gameplay?  Now that it has dropped in price almost universally, is it something you should pick up now?  Is it even worthy of it's all CAPS moniker?The premise in BRINK is not anything we really haven't seen before, but it centers around a man-made, eco-friendly, floating city, designated The Ark, that is on the brink (get it) of Civil War.  Since the oceans of the world have begun to rise to unsafe levels, The Ark has become a sort of haven for people affiliated with its original inhabitants, as well as other displaced people looking for a better life, who have to live on the outskirts.  It's basically a bunch of Haves versus Have Nots.  One group wants to break free of the overpopulation and desecrating conditions for the outcasts on The Ark (called The Resistance) and leave the floating city to see what the world is like beyond its walls, while the other group wants to keep the refugees in control and living in continued squalor, while they continue to benefit in The Ark (called The Security).Upon starting the game, you have to first select and customize a character.  While the customization options are ample, they aren't exactly endless.  The character design is similar to Gears of War, with overexaggerated features and bulging muscles.  There are four different classes of characters: Soldier, Engineer, Medic, and Operative.  Obviously each has their own strengths and weaknesses and in this game you will be switching classes a lot during each level or mission, to complete objectives.To move around, BRINK also uses whats been classified as SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain).  In this, a button can be assigned to to quickly traverse across different environmental obstacles.  Think of it as parkour influenced climbing, jumping, and sliding, reminiscent of Mirror's Edge.  Unfortunately, much of the time, I kind of forgot about SMART and did the regular old climbing and jumping, except for the occasional slide.I've spent quite a bit of time with this game, beating both campaigns (a total of 16 missions, but they are long missions, which turns out to be a blessing and a curse), and utilizing both solo play, as well as completing levels online with human counterparts.  I get that the online component was designed to be a major selling point for BRINK, but the online community is pretty stagnant at the moment.  When starting a level online, I would say that only about 25% of the time did I have another human joining me.GameplayThis game is quite frenetic when you first jump in.  There is a lot of action going on around you and quite a bit of chatter from your teammates (which I liked initially, but then grew to hate).  Initially, only one or two classes will have an objective that are pretty basic (hack this, defend this, escort this person, etc.), but the objectives increase (both primary and secondary), as you progress through the game.  Just find a (or take over an opponent controlled one) command post, and you can switch classes.  There is an objective wheel that is easily accessed at any time, that highlights the objectives and classes needed, so it's not too confusing.  Select an objective and it'll point you in the right direction to complete it.That's not to say that BRINK isn't fun because at times it really is.  Shooting people and is almost always fun... for a while.  Having the missions broken up by each side seemed like a really interesting idea, but they basically turn out to be the same levels, but just opposite objectives of each other.  If the Resistance was trying to destroy something, when you play the mission as the Security, you're trying to defend the same thing you were previously asked to destroy.  This doesn't flesh out the story as much as I would have hoped for, and really didn't make me pick a side I was rooting for, as if they had added totally different levels for each side.There is a major problem with your teammates AI in the game.  They are basically worthless (but every now and then surprise you with a well-placed turret), and you constantly feel like you are the only one that is able to do anything.  For instance if you have to repair something and are playing solo, without human teammates, it seems like you are the only one of the class you selected that can get anything done.  You have usually around 10 minutes to complete the objective, but it usually takes all 10 minutes because your teammates don't help at all.  When they do decide to help, it's like a mad rush in the final minute or two.  The opponents know where to congregate to protect what's needed, but it seems as if your team gets bored rather easily and leaves their mark.Which leads me to my next problem with the game.  If you die, or I should say when you die, because your opponent's ammo tends to be much more powerful than your own, you have to respawnThere are a few \"what if\" missions tacked on at the end, but they seem as more of an afterthought, than a critical part of the story, and are some of the shorter missions of the whole game.  I recommend playing through some of the Challenge levels early on, as by completing them, you earn some upgrades for your weapons.  There are 3 different types of challenges: fulfilling objectives, moving around with SMART to certain areas in a time limit, and defending, each with three levels of progressively harder levels.GraphicsThere are two distinct setting for the missions in BRINK.  One is the futuristic Ark, which kind of reminded me of something out of Mass Effect.  Lot's of plexiglass, neon, etc.  Once the action moved away from The Ark, to Container City, I became re-interested in the game again.  It's a totally different kind of look that really made me push through to finish my first half of the Campaign.  There are lots of little crevices and creative shortcuts to find.I didn't really experience any lag, when playing online, but only really connected with one other person at a time when playing the campaign.  The multiplayer was solid and much more fun than playing with bots, but by the time I tried multiplayer, I was kind of burned out by the game.  Sometimes when enemies died, parts of their body would be underground, or if they were standing on something and killed, seemed to be floating in mid-air.SoundThroughout the game you have a Commander basically talking in your ear the whole time.  He gets very frustrated when things aren't going the planned way.  Considering that you feel like you are a one man show on many of the levels, it get very annoying quickly.I did find the chatter between teammates amusing.  When you give supplies to another teammate, they always respond with some form of thanks.  Additionally, when you have some supplies and they are needed by someone nearby, they will let you know.Replay ValueThere is a planned DLC coming soon (free for the first two weeks), which may increase the number of people playing online.  Currently, there are 8 maps available for multiplayer skirmishes.  I fear, however, that most players originally interested in the game have either moved on to something else or sold/traded in their copy.Once the campaigns are completed, there is not much incentive to return to those missions.  Especially the ones where your teammates seem clueless.  There are some audio logs to collect, which supposedly add more to the story (or unlock a trophy/achievement when all are collected) but I didn't have an interest to find more.There is a cap at level 20.  When I finished both campaigns, I was at level 16, so I played multiplayer and replayed missions to reach the cap.  There are bonuses for completing missions online (which I didn't know until about halfway through the game)Honestly, I really wanted to like BRINK.  Blending solo, co-op, and multiplayer into one somewhat seamless experience seemed innovative and intriguing.  However, in the end, it wasn't done well enough to grab my interest for extended periods.  Each mission is quite long, and if you don't succeed, feels arduous instead of energizing at the challenge, that you have to relive 15-20 minutes all over again.Rating6.5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2011"}

Lohrke","summary":"completely bored after four hours","reviewText":"another new IP, another disappointment [read: homefront].first of all, if you plan on getting this for the single-player campaign, don't. there is no single player campaign.brink's 'campaign' is simply offline multiplayer with bots [think about Killzone's 'skirmish' mode and you get the idea].  there are eight 'missions' in all and each mission can played from either the resistance or security persepctive.unfortunately, these missions are convoluted, difficult to navigate, and even more difficut to complete because your wonky AI squad mates are essentially useless.  most of the maps contain narrow corridors that result in chokepoints with 16 guys in a fifteen foot radius all doing the hokey pokey or break dancing. i was half expecting pop 'n taco to show up with a broken down cardboard box and do the electric bugaloo.  and if you should die, well, you may have to wait as long as twenty seconds to respawn and then spend another 30 seconds running back to the action.  in and of itself, it's not a bad thing, but since all the 'campaign' missions are timed, it's problematic.another big complaint: weapon damage. sure, i can understand wanting to eliminate one-shot kills, but it literally takes an entire magazine to put someone down.  so most of the time you're trying to find ammo or hoping one of your squad mates buffs you some.  good luck with that.sure, you have four quadrillion customization options, but if you're playing from a first-person perspective, who even cares? you can't see all your fancy face paint, head gear, and outfits [unless you're in the menus], so why bother?instead of a great new shooter, you've got a great new $60 digital costume closet. congratulations.if splash damage had spent as much time with the gameplay as they did with the customizations, they might have had something. unfortunately, as is the case with so many shooters these days, the game ships with skimpy content and we undoubtedly await the first $15 \"map pack\" in about a week or two.it's getting downright insulting.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}

The intial reviews i saw of this, kept me from ordering it for some time. Got to talking with a friend who had played through it multiple times and went ahead and ordered it. He was playing the PC version and I got the PS3 version. It didn't take long before I started disliking the game. They had completely changed the format from what it had been and added new elements to the gameplay, such as quicktime stuff. Anyway, I endured and had some very frustrating problems along the way. Finally got to Shanty Town and that was as far as I got, the ledge just below the campfire. I never really got into the town. It was totally unbalanced and you were swamped under an onslaught with no let up. They just kept coming at you. I spent a number of hours on that before finally saying the heck with it and took the game to GameStop and got something else. I can only hope that they go back to what Tomb Raider was, otherwise, they just shot themselves in the foot and killed a successful series. When I told my friend about it, he was amazed and said that that didn't sound like the same game he played. I have had problems with the others, mostly when having to deal with a motorcycle, but after a few starts, Things went well and I had some fun. If you like the tomb raider stuff, this is not one I would recommend as it was a big disappointment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2013"}

But it is far away from being the best PS3 game ever that people hype it up to be. This game takes more of a Hollywood approach, with cut scenes mimicking the type of dialogues and camera works you would expect in an adventure movie. I am completely down with the idea that a game like this could be awesome, but this one just came up too short of the expectations I had. The details of the story don't make much sense because cause-and-effects are unclear. Why was this person here at this time? Why did this happen? So many things just happen to be out of coincidence, and the story lacks transitions you would expect in a polished game. I'm not saying this game isn't polished, but they butchered the storytelling because they had to \"force\" in events into the main plot in order to stretch the game. Otherwise it would have been a 2-3 hour long game, like a movie ought to be...haha. The game was alright, and definitely playable, I would rent it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2011"}

I got the right one delivered March 14, so hopefully that situation is resolved!1.) It doesn't smell at all. I'm not sure why some people's cases are smelling bad, but I have a really sensitive schnoz and I smell nothing. Which was surprising to me, since I was ready for the worst!2.) It fits the Vita perfectly, and there's a little barrier between the zippers and the system so you won't be scratching your Vita up.But...3.) The elastic straps are HORRIBLE! Absolutely the worst. It made it a small nuisance to get the Vita into the case, and a right nightmare to get it out. However, I just took a pair of scissors and snipped the elastic parts off and problem solved! No issues now, and you cannot tell the elastic was ever there in any way, shape or form.4.) The build quality could be a bit better. I had to cut a few threads off, and the game slots aren't super-high quality. But they do the job.Overall, the key thing is your Vita is well protected, and for how cheap this case is you really are getting something that works. And that's more than can be said for Sony's own travel pouch which is a flimsy nightmare and double the price...4 stars out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"Try It First","reviewText":"Personal admission - I at least aspire to be some form of video game reviewer, and the Wii was the last console this generation that I've purchased by a long margin, largely because I suspected from the beginning that I would hate it forever.  Turns out I was right.  Most of my commentary following will at least aspire to neutrality, but just so the dedicated Nintendo fans can dismiss me now, I'm not among those who welcome any stupid idea from the company with open arms.I hate this thing.  I hate it with every fiber of my being.  When the next console comes out I will take this thing out to a big field and smash it to pieces with a whiffle ball bat.  I hate it for being the only repository for modern Nintendo console games and I hate that so many other people like it and I just don't understand what they're seeing.But what, you might ask yourself, is my deal?  Well, for one thing, I don't like the controls.  At all.  When I play a video game, I like being able to immerse myself in the game and not think about what I'm doing with my hands and body.  The Wii takes that away from me and puts me back in the same position I was when I was eight years old and trying to figure out what the different between A and B were on my NES.  This is an individual response, but as far as I'm concerned, waving my arms around like I'm hitting a baseball doesn't make me feel like I'm playing baseball - it makes it very obvious to me that I'm not interacting with my on-screen avatar in an easy or efficient way.The upside of this is that if you're a casual gamer or a newcomer to the field of computer games, you'll probably have an easier time warming up to the controls that I did.  The irony is delicious, really.  I certainly get what the charm would be for a person who doesn't play many games, but truly \"hardcore\" players who have spent years upon years learning how to work a DualShock might want to try the system out extensively before purchase.The second reason I hate the system has to do with the fact that it doesn't support HD, and this is something that everybody needs to think about.  The Wii can output a 480p widescreen signal, which is fine for a regular SD televisions, but you definitely need to check the performance for standard definition on an HD set before you invest.  Most low-end high definition sets don't come with Feroudja upscalers, and that can lead to some really, really awful looking SD, including whatever comes out of your Wii.  It's definitely a good idea to track down the proper settings for your particular set if this sort of thing is important to you.I am, of course, being quite harsh.  My mileage with the system has been and will continue to be terrible because of my reaction to the controls, but anybody not subject to my own strange prejudices will probably have a reasonable time.  While there's a shortage of monumentally great games (at least, as a percentage of total game output), there are plenty of wonderful titles that you can find for the system, and it's likely that your children will have a fun time with it.  The best thing you can do in this case is to do some research on your own television's performance and play with the thing in a store before you buy, just to be sure that you'll like it once you get it home.  For my part, I know that I'm not enjoying my purchase at all, but it's entirely likely that you might.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2008"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests. These quests include both story-driven adventures and side quests that offer players rewards such as items exclusive to quest completion and/or forward movement of the story. Players can look forward to action set in both single player and multiplayer modes--including co-op play--as well as vehicular combat, literally thousands of different types of weapons that change each time you play and randomly generated maps and map features.Playable CharactersBorderlandsfeatures several playable characters, each with its own unique backstory, abilities and skills. Skills can be leveled up, allowing for improvement of things like health, accuracy with weapons and capacity for items. In addition to this, characters possess unique skill tree development, ensuring that each will develop differently regardless of time spend leveling them up.Key Game FeaturesCo-op Design-Borderlandsis built from the ground up to be an exciting, intuitive co-operative experience for up to four players simultaneously that rewards players who work together and invest in co-op skills.

This game was made for multiplayer. With single player Borderland games, the variety of monsters and quality of the weapon drops go down. Not to mention the missions in general just aren't that fun; they start to feel repetitive. That being said, don't get this game if you have no way of playing with other people. On the same subject, the quality of the game also depends on the quality of the people you are playing with (it's annoying when people don't use a microphone).Online multiplayer matching (for Xbox 360) sucks for Borderlands. The game often groups together players of really different levels. Typically the difference is 10-15 levels (e.g. a level 10 player is grouped with two level 25 players). What ends up happening is that either the lower level player gets killed a lot (if playing the higher level player's game) or a higher level player gets bored (if playing the lower lv player's game). I would advise not using Quick Match and just manually searching for open matches that cater to the character you are using.For a heavily multiplayer game, it's a bit annoying that customization of player appearance is really limited. You can only change your character's colors.As a minor gripe - for some reason cars in the game can only fit two players.Summary:If you like games like Diablo, you will most likely also enjoy Borderlands. This game doesn't really have much in terms of story. It's really about killing things and getting incrementally better guns as you go. It's an awesome multiplayer game, but a so so single player game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2009"}

I bought this game mainly for the campaign, having little interest in online deathmatch. I'll admit having bought it pretty much on blind faith that it was going to be as good as Modern Warfare. World at War returns to the franchise's WW2 roots, using the same engine as the previous installment.First, on the positive side: WaW has great graphics and realistic weapons. They look and sound more or less as they should, and the relatively accurate historical setting supports the realism of the game. You play alternately as a Soviet infantrymen and a US Marine, fighting in the Eastern and Pacific fronts. There's also two vehicle levels thrown in for some variety, and they're quite fun.The action is pretty uniformly intense, and enemies don't seem to spawn out of nowhere as they did before (or if they do, it at least seems somewhat believable how they might). Some of the campaign levels are quite creatively designed, and you have a wide array of firearms to choose from. Ambient sound and production values are generally consistent and well done.Now on the negative side. The game is quite short- much shorter than COD4. There's far less opportunity for you to snipe or sneak around in the missions- most of it is just a flat out face-to-face shootout (in fact, only the first Soviet mission really is anything different). The setting isn't really an improvement, in my opinion, despite the seldom-seen Eastern front levels. Unless your lifelong dream is to act out Enemy at the Gates in a video game, it probably won't seem much different from any other of a billion shooter settings. There's an alarming number of places where you're forced into using heavy weapons like 20mm antiaircraft cannon (conveniently, with unlimited ammo) or Panzerschreck rockets (which actually weren't very common). In these your objective is quite simple: hose them all down and win.The allied AI is inept and stupid. Really stupid. I can sort of see Soviet conscripts behaving the way they do, but if US Marines had such lousy aim and combat instincts we'd all be speaking Japanese now. The game periodically saves at checkpoints, but sometimes does so at extremely awkward times- such as when an enemy machine gun has you bracketed and is in the process of hosing YOU down. All the enemies seem to only be shooting at you- they only hit friendly troops on accident, e.g. when throwing a grenade at you. The grenade indicator also seems to have been dropped and broken since COD4- it flat out doesn't work half the time, points in the wrong direction when it does show up, and indicates the grenade is really far when its right in your face. You'll frequently die seeing the familiar gray screen 'you were killed by a grenade, watch out for the grenade indicator' to remind you that you didn't even SEE a grenade indicator because it was bugged! Hilarious.The realistic game setting is somewhat spoiled by the fact that you are ALWAYS outnumbered. How is this possible when you're an infantryman in the Red Army half the time? Guess they shifted all the reinforcements to some more important front so you could storm Berlin with your squad. As a Marine you almost never get to call in artillery or air strikes, which is likewise weird. There's also a strange lack of katanas in the Japanese ranks. Most Japanese officers carried (and, more often than not, used) one; I don't think I saw a single one in the entire campaign. The enemy is largely a faceless, fearless bunch of goons for you to shoot down like targets in a shooting gallery. They aren't villains and they don't scare you- they just annoy you. Your allies are likewise nobodies that you could really care less about. If it didn't cause you to lose, I'd have shot them almost as much as the enemy so I could put their guns and ammo to better use.In short, WaW largely lacks the driving plot, realistic scenario, and general fun of Modern Warfare. It's a bit odd in a sense, because at first glance it looks like it SHOULD have that magic element that separates a merely decent game from a really great one. Perhaps its a combination of the WW2 setting, the antiquated weapons, or the nameless and faceless enemy masses, but as you advance through it, you'll come to realize it's not quite there.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2009"}

I've played every single one since the very first one came out for the Playstation. Survival horror is a genre that has changed quite a bit since that original entry and I'm happy to say that at least part of this game is an homage to that bygone era.Gameplay: The gameplay is quite solid. The cover system works well and being able to move around while shooting is a welcome change. While it may not satisfy the purists, it's a step up from Resident Evil 4/5. The controls are quite responsive and I had almost no trouble at all (I get spazzy sometimes :p).Story: There are three separate campaigns, each with a very different feel. My favorite by and far was the Leon portion, which gives that sense of impending dread that the originals in the series gave. Chris' and Wesker's son both also had solid campaigns, and it was really cool when the campaigns intersected in the story. This is also a pretty long game, so you really get some serious playtime out of it.Graphics: Everything in the game looks great. The action looks good, the new bad guys are pleasingly disgusting and the boss fights look top notch.Overall - a very engaging entry in the series. Well worth picking up if you're a fan. I haven't tried Mercenaries yet but hopefully it'll be fun.One Wish: The anthology version that the Playstation got.

The graphics are enhanced (quite stunningly as well) and you get all of the DLC (minus one character that was 360 exclusive) but the price isn't really better. Considering you can have the &#34;last gen&#34; version for 1/2 the price (without DLC), you may be better served just going that route.One other reason you might want to skip this version, the XBox One version that is, if you own the PS4. Call it what you will, but the PS4 does have a leg up over the Xbox One version - the Xbox One is frame rate capped at 30 frames per second, with the PS4 allowing up to 60 frames per second. Yes, this is noticeable and while it doesn't change the core game play or fun factor, it does have a perceptible impact on the relative smoothness of the game engine. I'm guessing I'm going to get a few &#34;not helpful&#34; votes for this comment, but as someone who tries to remain platform agnostic, and given all of the proof that the PS4 edition does perform with higher frames per second, it would be remiss of a review to not point this out.If you don't own a PS4 or a last gen version, or you want all the DLC and the prettier graphics, then the Definitive Edition is definitely worth a purchase.This new game is amazing. The sound quality, the way you are enveloped in the environment is nothing short of brilliant. Game audio is important to me, and this is one of the games I would drop in to show someone just how immersive audio can be in a video game.Graphically, 1080p with 30 frames per second, along with the updated and enhanced for the new generation of hardware, makes this version shine almost like no other (PC version can be almost superior, though only if you have the right hardware and don't mind not having the &#34;prettier&#34; graphics/Lara).In terms of game play, Crystal Dynamics did a stupendous job pulling together a game that taps into the Indiana Jones loving part of your brain.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2014"}

I mean, they are solid stuff. The attention is evident in every phase of the game, from the delightfully detailed main characters to the excellent backdrops. This is a joy to behold.2) The mechanics you know and love are back, which makes for some excellent multiplayer madness. It remains very easy to pull off big moves, and with the handicapping, you can get balanced gaming every time. I really like the \"final smashes\" - while not necessary, it is incredibly satisfying to pummel your cohorts by throwing them in a giant pot and cooking them.3) I really enjoyed the timeline and masterpiece sections. Of course, giving people trials of all the old NES and SNES games is just cheap advertising, but that's fine with me. I can't wait to get \"Super Metroid\" from the Wii shop channel.4) Trophy collecting is back, and I love it. Moreover, you can now collect stickers as well. Finally, you collect either of them by blasting them in a silly asteroids-like shooter. Good stuff.The bad:1) Subspace emissary stinks. I had high hopes for this after hearing the hype, but it is vastly inferior to the adventure mode in \"Melee\". Why, you ask? Because it's just as pointless, but now takes an incredibly long time. Very unenjoyable, IMHO.2) Control. The Wii has one of the most innovative controllers out there, and a game of this magnitude should utilize it to the fullest, right? Right?!? Wrong. In fact, this game is actually easier to play with the old GC controllers than the Wii nunchuk. I'm stunned that the developers didn't make an effort to incorporate the Wii goodness into the game. Well, stunned and disappointed. What a letdown.3) What is all this \"friend code\" stuff? Do people really like this? Not me (although i do think that the Wifi has been underrated in these reviews - I like it a lot).4) I agree with an early reviewer that there is something very fishy about Nintendo's insistence that the game read errors are the product of a \"soiled lens\". In any case, lenses get soiled. It shouldn't cause fatal errors in reading software. Thumbs down to Nintendo, who usually builds the most reliable product out there.In short, this is not the game it could have been, which is a surprise, considering the number of delays in its production. I think it is an unfair criticism for the game that it hasn't changed the formula in all these years - if I wanted \"Final Fantasy,\" I wouldn't buy \"Smash\". However, it is perfectly legitimate to ask why the gameplay hasn't improved since the original \"Smash Brothers\" for the N64 (which still remains my favorite of the bunch). As far as Wii games go, this one falls well short of the standard set my \"Mario Galaxy\" and \"Metroid Prime 3\". It's still fun, but it just isn't the game it could have been.Addendum: Let's not forgetThe ugly:1) Reviewers who insist that any criticism of a Wii game is obviously an attempt by PS3 \"fanboys\" to subvert the Wii. If your life worth depends on someone liking or disliking a game you purchased, you should get out more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2008"}

Schultz","summary":"Epic Smashing Action","reviewText":"Super Smash Bros. Melee quickly became a hit, making many huge improvements over its prececessory.  There were more characters, better graphics, and all around more to do.  But people still wanted more.  Some of the moves could have used tightening up.  More attention could have been paid to the single player modes, and more characters were always welcome.Cue Brawl.Huge, several-hour-long single player campaign is here along with the return of \"Classic\" mode where you go pick a character and fight several battles one after another.  The Stadium matches with Target Test and Multi-Man Melee have returned with an additional \"Boss Battle\" mode unlockable after beating the main Adventure Mode, the Subspace Emissary.Speaking of the Subspace Emissary--wow.  It does get repetative near the end, but it's great to watch all of Nintendo's finest in glorious Wii graphics interact and fight through to the conspirator at the top.  And Master Hand, the main boss of previous \"Smash Bros.\" games, finally has his motives revealed.Versus Mode, the main focus of Smash Bros. is largely the same with some tune-ups and small improvements.  But it was great before and it's greater now.New additions are a stage-creator, small previews of the game's characters' shining moments in their own games, an improvement on the Coin Lottery used for attaining Trophies in \"Melee\" and of course, at long last, Wi-Fi capabilities.As for new characters: Meta Knight and King Dedede have made it from Kirby's universe.  Ike comes to replace Roy from the land of Fire Emblem.  Dr. Mario has been removed for being mostly pointless and a power suit-less \"Zero Suit\" Samus has joined at long last.  Solid Snake, the legendary soldier from the spectacular Metal Gear Solid franchise made a surprising appearance along with Sega's speediest hedgehog, Sonic.  All the characters, new and old, control flawlessly and fighting feels more gritty and visceral compared to the somewhat \"floaty\" actions in Melee.And of course is the addition of the \"Smash Balls\" that, when borken, envoke tremendous power in whoever broke them, adding a new dynamic to gameplay.I could go on about this for a long time, but I'll try to sum it up.  If you liked either of the previous Smash Bros. games, you'll absolutely love this.  If you've never played one, there's no better place to start than here.  I played it for about eight hours on release yesterday and probably at least six today.  It's that addictive!

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends. Peace. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Margaux Paschke","summary":"a favorite","reviewText":"I am not a gamer or a male but here's my perspective:When in a tight spot, aim for their knees.  Zombies stay down until you are ready to finish them off and it gives you the chance to fight off the hordes coming right at you.  The ax welding, flesh eating zombie horde!  But I don't know if you should listen to me since I am still on the first level......Object - rescue the kidnapped daughter and get the heck of out Zombie Central!  While you're at it, gather as much weapons as you possibly can because you're going to need it.This is truly an all around experience game when playing at night with the lights off and headphones on.  Creepy.  And did I mention the gore?  There is plenty of gore!The daughter is annoying from the female POV but the game is geared towards males so....  The levels and intricacies are amazing and I bow to the team that created it.  This game has been played for months and never gets old. I like that it gives you the ability to save your place once you've reached certain spots in the game but I do not like the little movie-like vignettes (but I understand they are needed to advance the game).Finish reading the reviews, look at the price tag and BUY NOW.  That's my recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1QY","description":"Nintendo certainly has added a quirky spin on the old English game withMario Tennis. With 16 classic Nintendo characters on hand, ranging from  Bowser to Baby Mario, the crux of the game is the standard game of tennis, with  its break points, deuces, and double faults, but also with the added bonus of  power-ups and special moves.The game revolves around the individual players, and, as in other Mario  adventures, the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Bowser  is great for the sheer strength and his powerful smashes, while other characters  survive on speed and agility, rather like inMario KartorMario  Golf.With Exhibition, Tournament, and Multiplayer modes, the game does have a number  of options to keep you busy. The chance to play with up to three other players  makes this game great to play with your friends.With this game, Nintendo has done to tennis what it did to kart racing and golf,  by producing a fun spin on what's not usually the most fun in computer games.  This is how tennis should be: super smashes, special combos, and Mario running  around in circles.--Stuart Miles--Amazon.co.ukNintendo has incorporated characters from the Super Mario Brothers series into a tennis simulation game for up to 4 players.  Each player manipulates a selected character from the 13 in the series.  There are multiple levels of difficulty.  Players need to learn the types of strategies used in traditional tennis; each can choose how to hit the ball over the net by selecting from a wide range of moves, some of which may be unique to the character each has chosen.  Lobs, smashes, and cross-court shots are among the options.Mario Tennis 64 taps the controlled challenge of real-life tennis, and intertwines light-hearted graphics with good game play.  A 2000 Parents' Choice&#174; Approved winner.Reviewed by Jason R. Rich, Parents' Choice&#174; 2000--FromParents' Choice&#174;","reviewerName":"ffootballguru27","summary":"Great fun for everyone!","reviewText":"Even if you aren't a fan of tennis, you will fall in love with this game. When I first played it, I didn't want to stop playing it. With 16 characters including Toad, Bowser, Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Paratroopa Yoshi, Boo, and many more you won't find a character you don't like. Each character has different strengths like serving hard or having a hard return hit, and different weaknesses like being too short (in Boo's case). One player mode on this game is amazing. The game of tennis is very well represented in this game with real tennis rules. But what makes this game so much fun is being able to play with your favorite Nintendo characters. With great graphics, tight controls and an all-around fun game, Mario Tennis is a game that all Nintendo 64's owners should buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0041OWQTO","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"It's called Blu-Ray, Gearbox, look into it ...","reviewText":"EDIT (May 9th, 2011): With PSN being down for exactly 3 weeks now, the argument for including the content on the disc, instead of as DLC, is even stronger. If you bought this game 3 weeks ago, you'd still be without the DLC. If it would have been included ON THE DISC you could play away without worrying over whether or not you could get online.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Why isn't the DLC content ON THE DISC? Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition had voucher codes on the 360 because the content didn't fit on standard DVD. On the other hand, the PS3 version had the content on the disc, because Blu-Ray has much more capacity. Did you hear that, Gearbox? ON THE DISC.If this is 2K being greedy, well, they fail. I bought this, as I did RE5: Gold Edition. But the SECOND I realized the content wasn't ON DISC, I returned it for a full refund. You lose, 2K. And Gearbox loses along with you. I hope they appreciate your greed taking away their cut.Maybe you can release ANOTHER Game of the Year Edition. You could call it, \"The REAL Game of the Year Edition.\" Or just call it the, \"We Apologize\" edition.The game itself is great, but I'll think twice about buying ANYTHING from 2K OR Gearbox after this fiasco. So will many others. I'm sick of publishers thinking THEY control the content WE buy. It's not supposed to work that way and hopefully enough gamers will stand their ground and avoid purchasing this garbage to ensure the consumer stops being scammed.Oh, and we have a RIGHT, under the law, to sell games used. It's called \"right of first sale.\" Look it up, 2K.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

I received it, put it in the Xbox and started playing. Everything was fine until I got to the end of level IIF, the defector. At the beginning of one part of this level I found myself with a black screen with only the compass and the directional guidance arrows as the graphics that were visible. I spent hours trying to move around in total darkness when I finally thought something was wrong. E-mails to Activision support were virtually useless. The did send me a solution for a problem on the PS3 however. I finally returned the disc for a refund and bought a new disc from a different company. It turned out to have the same problem. So I have just wasted $60 on a useless game. Of course the publisher wants to put the problem in my Xbox. But all the other games I have play without any problems. Long story short, Black Ops is a big, expensive disappointment for me.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}
