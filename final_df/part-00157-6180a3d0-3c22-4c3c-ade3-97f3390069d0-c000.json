{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"JckDnls","summary":"Over-hyped but Still Fun","reviewText":"Let's get one thing out of the way immediately:  If you think seeing a Rockstar logo means this game will be a \"sandbox\" game in the conventional sense, with tons of stuff to see and do outside of missions, kill those thoughts now.  You can explore when you're not on a mission, but you'll probably quickly bore of this aspect of the game unless you're hunting for achievements.  Another thing that may be an issue for some players:  you will see brutalized, fully nude corpses during some of your investigations, so if you are sensitive to these things make a note of this.The story itself is so-so, but LA Noire is a story heavy game so I must spend some time discussing why I wasn't enthralled by it.  I did enjoy parts of it but there was a lot of room for improvement.  There were also plot points that received little attention (Phelps' family, for instance) and feel out of place when you do experience them.  I didn't like Cole Phelps or his character development whatsoever.  There are too many flash-backs for my taste, mostly revolving around Phelps' actions in World War 2 as a newly commissioned officer.  The developers seem to have gone out of their way to make Phelps an incredibly irritating, egotistical, headstrong, and by-the-books individual.  It was a gutsy move to take for a videogame, and unfortunately you lose a lot of immersion and empathy because of it.The gameplay itself is enjoyable, but investigating a crime scene can be tedious at times.  I would've preferred being allowed to make my own inferences about evidence, and having the option of making my own decisions about how to pursue what I'd found.  This type of game would've set you up for failure at times, but it least it would be the players fault.  Instead you walk around for a while and click on crap until Phelps finds something, and tells you how he's going to investigate this evidence further.The interviews themselves are the highlight of the game, and I would've liked to do more of them.  This was certainly the most hyped aspect of the game because of the new technology that was used, so conducting one is an enjoyable experience when you get to do one.  Botching one is a painful experience, but nailing someone on a lie leaves you very satisfied.I've obviously had a lot of mixed things to say about this game, but I did enjoy it in the end and I'm glad I played it.  It's an experience unlike anything I've really played before.  I would love to see more games in this genre, but unfortunately Team Bondi was shut down and someone else will have to make it happen.Just know what you're getting before you buy it and I don't think you'll be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B006WQR3GA","description":"","reviewerName":"Tstops","summary":"A nice Gem of a game but, has some downers.","reviewText":"I never played the original xcom so I'd like to say first of I'm not a fan boy. I was however excited to check this game out when I watched the game play footage on YouTube.  Its a turn based strategy rpg that takes you on a global war with aliens destroying cities on earth. You take small tactical squads into warzones or alien crash sites. Duck and cover, sniping and surpressing fire is the name of the game.  Wether you're a fan of turn based strategy and RPGs or your just a casual gamer, most will agree that xcom is a joy to play but it does have flaws I hope my experience playing it will help you in deciding if this game is for youFirst thing I noticed were the surprisingly terrible graphics.  As new as the game is it looks like graphics from the switch era between generation consoles.  but graphics are the last thing on my mind when it comes to games. Another bummer was the cartoony concept art. The look of the weaponry armor and some aliens looks ridiculously cheesy. Reminds me a lot of world of Warcraft IMO.The game is frustratingly challenging at times. I spent a lot of curse words saying \"I had 80% hit chance!!!! How did I miss????!!!!\" These critical cheap issues will cause you to lose soldiers. While you can save and reload at any point you can reload your game....sometimes I will, sometimes I won't.This can be a good or bad depending how I look at it. The game forces a narrative from a players perspective because the soldiers don't speak. Since the look and names of the soldiers are 100% customizable their stories and how they level up is up to you and your imagination. Some soldiers I got attached, and I'd reload if they died in an cheap way but if they took out 3 or 4 of those alien scum before being overrun I let them die with honor. Rookie soldiers had it the worst, if they got killed sergeant major \"big bear\"  would say \"better him than me\". And I proceed to train a replacement FNG.The combat in this game is incredibly satisfying. Nothing beats perching my highest ranked sniper on a roof blowing any aliens head off that tries to push on my assualt troopers. Medics hang back and pop smoke, provide covering fire and brave enemy fire to save a gravely wounded comrade. It sucks you right in to the game. The missions can be very unbalanced and 1 sided at times but winning a desperate firefight is really cool. Keeping up with Alien tech and keeping an elite squad in shape will help you overcome the difficulty, however I felt too overwhelmed at times and had to take day long breaks from the game due to frustration. I think the game should throw in easier missions from time to time but the longer you play the game the harder it gets,and I mean REALLY hard. The pressure is high, and the aliens will make you hurt.One this I was really bummed about was no coop play. This game screams for it. It would be so much fun to play this with a buddy and support each other. I can't believe this game left it out. You can play against your buddy as aliens or troopers(or both) but it becomes dull after a while. I think certain games should be played with friends not against them. And this one had a great chance to take advantage of that recipe and didn't commit. Which is actually my biggest complaint about the game in general. More games need coop ,but I digress.Xcom is a great game that anyone can get into. It's turn based at its finest.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}

I am going to have to go to the Cheats you can find Online and figure out how to get anywhere in this game.  Not their fault.  The Game Boy Advance little compacts are the most beautifully designed pocket games ever made.  Their charge lasts a long time, and the entire unit lasts and lasts.  These little Warioland 4 and Zelda, and Castlevania cartridges are a joy to own.  If you still  have one, hang on to it.  You can still buy a charging unit for not too much $ and too many kids let their parents talk them into trading them for the next new thing.  The parents (too bad) did not apparently play them.  The children were too young to know their value.  I started playing Mario Pinball and Warioland 4 when I was 73.

I was not necessarily expecting this to be a free roam game but at least improve on and continue the fight for freedom, the fight against the EDF force/government.Guerrilla inspired me like no other game had. Fighting an oppressive government, fighting for basic rights, there was no other game like this. I can only assume that the world government threatened the publishers to change the game style. They don't want the young generation to question their will, don't they?... they rather want games filled with propaganda and hatred towards other nationalities like Homefront, Call of Duty MW etc. Reminds me how Hitler brainwashed the German population into thinking that Jews were the cause for their misery.Getting back to the game now. I was under the impression that I was playing below 720p yet my TV was showing 1080p. Wow! Graphics are really bad yet they advertise this runs at full 1080p. What a let down!There are a few new cool weapons not present in Guerrilla, a good soundtrack and short loading times but that's it.

I myself experienced no glitches after over three hours of online play.I found the game modes to be well varied and very fun to playno more campers and giant sniper nests of BFBC2 nor the huge maps.the maps are smaller but provide for a tighter experiencefaster gameplay and overall a lot more fun!speaking via headset works really well and instead of speaking to just a squad, you speak to the WHOLE TEAM!overall it's a stellar online game with a fairly decent single player experience. the inclusion of hi-def versionof MOH Frontline is a nice addition as well. I'd recommend this to ANY Fan of the Battlefield series. call of duty fans may want to rent first. the medals and ribbons are much more fun to aquire.I definately love the weapons including for the first time in a dice game the P-90!!!also for those wondering after the tier one code you have another packe in code that's REQUIRED TO PLAY ONLINE!!!SO IF YOU BUY THE GAME USED YOU MUST PAY 9.99 IN THE PSN STOREFOR THE MOH UNLOCK KIT TO PLAY ONLINE!I thought this info was very important since it says nothing about it anywhere.Killstreaks:Score Chain #1- 50 points:Offensive - Mortar Strike (M224)Defensive - UAV / INTELScore Chain #2- 100 points:Offensive - Rocket Strike (MLRS)Defensive - Match AmmoScore Chain #3- 175 points:Offensive - Missile Attack (AGM-114)Defensive - Flak JacketScore Chain #4- 250 points:Offensive - Artillery Strike (M777 Howitzer)Defensive - FMJ AmmoScore Chain #5- 350 points:Offensive - Strafing Run (A10)Defensive - JammerScore Chain #6- 450 points:Offensive - Air Strike (F16 CAS)Defensive - Armor Piercing RoundsScore Chain #7- 500 points:Offensive - Cruise Missile (BMG-109 Tomahawk)Defensive - Kevlar VestPlus 2x score multiplierMultiplayer Game ModesThere are 4 different gametypes available to play in Medal of Honor multiplayer. They are:Team AssaultThis is pretty standard Team Deathmatch, up to 12 vs 12.Sector ControlA Domination, Capture The Flag multiplayer variant. Control designated areas of the multiplayer map by raising your flag and defending it to accumulate points.Objective RaidSimilar to Rush Mode in Battlefield: Bad Company 2. this gametype features 2 bomb sites and an attacking and defending force. The objective for the attackers is to plant their bomb at each of the Objectives and hold off the defenders long enough for it to explode.Combat MissionProbably the most interesting of the 4 Game Modes in Medal of Honor, and the one that will become most popular, Combat Mission is somewhat similar to Halo: Reach's Invasion Mode, as an attacking forces attempts to complete a series of objectives, fulfilment of which opens up the next section of the multiplayer map, while the defending team try to stave them off long enough for the clock to run down.HardcorePlus they added a \"Hardcore mode\" with no map, slower heal times spread across all the game types. you DO NOT CHOOSE THE GAME. it's randomly chosen for you. overall a solid online offering of gameplay modes.EDIT: I recently experienced one 3 second freeze in game during several motar strikes and thought this was the game glitching.lo' and behold I had my pc running streaming video so I shut that offand have had NO Further Problems at all!Gameplay: 4 stars, some new controls but overall very fun and a blast onlineSound: Superb! guns pack more punch and thunder off their ammoexcellent sound work FIVE STARS HERE!Controls: not exactly BFBC Nor COD controls however ten minutes in and you're easily adapted to them. 4 starsOverall: a great online experience with a so-so solo game.it's really worth it for the online though I'd have called this titleBattlefield Ultimate rather then make it a MOH title. shame they didn't. overall this game wins Three STARS from me due to the very weak single player. also for the multiplayer for it's getting dulland no new maps in sight.Second Opinion after a few days:this game is a BLAST to play! it has that \"frantic\" speed and deathrate of COD with some pretty wicked killstreaks.no perks thankfully, this time it's a full unlock tree with your EXP going ONLY TO THE CLASS YOU ARE USING. I like this because it adds more replay value. in BFBC2 I have unlocked it all and was getting kind of bored waiting for Battlefield Vietnam.thus I bought this game and I may have been too harsh on the single player as well. it has some excellent set pieces though the story is a bit hard to folllow. overall I'd dub this a Must Buy to any COD?BFBC2 fan. I still think COD fans will have a slightly longer adaptation process then BFBC players.still, a great game excellent graphics, thunderous gun sound effects and worth every penny I spent upon it! a SOLID Three STAR TITLE.all the game modes are a blast as well. the weapons this time around are among my favorite supplied by DICE ever.EDIT 4/2011the game has become quite dull after all this timeespecally with BFBC2 having released Battlefield Vietnam!I'd recommend buying BFBC2 it's a far superior shooterto any other out there to be had. the vehicles rule,the destruction is top notch and the graphics are perfect.add to this Vietnam and you have a perfect shooter so get that instead.OR if you must, get this from a bargain bin. (remember you need to buy an online pass for 9.99! just for the Ability to play online!)CLASSES:RiflemanThe basic assault trooper in Medal of Honor, armed with a variety of assault rifles and smoke grenades. A solid all-round Class.Special OpsThe stealth based player on the battlefield, using lighter SMG weapons and smoke grenades to get in close and personal for the kill, or using rocket propelled grenades to cause havoc.SniperThe long range specialist, hiding out on building rooftops or in mountain crags to take out unsuspecting ground troops with head shots from great distance.Class Unlock Tree:Each of the 3 Classes has its own separate Unlock Tree with new weapons and attachments becoming available as it progresses up through the Levels in MoH Multiplayer. The Coalition and Opposing Force sides also have different weapons and attachments available to unlock at certain level, reflecting the nationality of the equipment each side in the conflict uses. All the weapons and other equipment are realistic representations of the items in use in the Afghanistan conflict. We'll be going into more detail on each of the unlockable weapons and attachments in the next part of our Medal of Honor Multiplayer Guide.

FPS games out there and while not as polished as BFBC2 and others, it's worth a rental and to hardcore DICE fans a must buy. the P-90 alone is a blast! this game gets four stars from me due to the lack of vehicles other then the few \"you must take this path\" tanks and while fun feel restricted. otherwise a very fun, frantic game.still BFBC2 is FAR Superior!MOH Limited ed. link hereMedal of Honor","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

What would make a great Michael Jackson game and look what they came up with, a interactive dance game based on his most popular dance songs and then some!  It was a terrific idea and I may just purchase the Wii afterall, just for our hero!  I never played it, but I heard that it was alot of fun and can be easy for me since I know many of his dance moves from the early days (Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad).The overall song selections with the dance sequences, I give a A.  I wish they would have included \"You Rock My World,\" \"Scream,\" and \"Human Nature\" on the set.  I think they should have replaced \"Earth Song,\" \"Heal The World\" and \"The Girl Is Mine\" because those are'nt really songs to break a sweat or to groove to.  The songs with the choreography that should have been on there were far more cutting edge then the ones I said that should've been replaced.  I like to say kudos for them adding two of Michael's previously unreleased songs, (\"Sunset Driver\" from 1979 and \"Streetwalker\" from 1987), though I wish they added \"We Can Change The World\" by using MJ in his Captain EO clothes and the setting from the Captain EO and background dancers as well.The dance sequences, I give a B.

On \"Beat It,\" \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,\" \"Billie Jean,\" and \"Rock With You,\" his signature dance sequences for those songs based on the videos/popular TV performances and concerts were incomplete or just plain absent.  For e.g., MJ on \"Rock With You\" used some crazy generic dancing (none of the moves were from the video).  Its ok to improvise a bit, but when it comes to MJ, the developers got to get it right.  There was little to no spinning in all of the sequences and I don't understand that since that is what Michael Jackson is most known for, especially in \"Billie Jean.\"  They got the dance moves/concept (as per videos and stage performances) for \"Thriller\" down to a T as well as \"Smooth Criminal,\" \"Bad,\" \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'(WBSS)\" and \"Black and White.\"I would like to give a overall B on graphics.  I like how they used the image of MJ for \"WBSS\" from the 45 single cover, but a common complaint for that as well as most other earlier images of MJ (1979 to 1983 era) is why did they make his skin so light?  Its 2011 so there was no excuse on not to get the correct skin color of MJ for the dance sequences based on his earlier songs (e.g. \"Beat It\" and \"Rock With You\").  My point is that you gotta represent the king of pop right when making him into a video game.  They got his images/dance sequences perfect for the Bad era and beyond so why can't they do that for all of the sequences?  The image for the dance sequence for \"Workin' Day & Night\" does'nt even look like Michael and around that era - 1979, he no longer had the afro and no longer wore bellbottoms.  Although there was no video for that song, they should've improvised a simular representation of Michael during that time like his look/clothes from the \"Can You Feel It\" video or from the 1981 US Tour.  For \"Street Walker,\" I wished they used his look from the Bad Tour instead of re-using the \"Dirty Diana\" look, which was a sign of laziness to me.  Good touch on his spacesuit (he wore during 1978-79 during Destiny Tour) and simular Jackson 5 moves for \"Sunset Driver.\"  As for backgrounds that represented the videos or for fun (for his songs that did'nt have videos) were all amazing and there were no complaints on that department.Although it sounds like I'm knitpicking on what they should've done, but as a big Michael Jackson fan, I feel that with todays available use of advanced graphics for a video game that represents our hero, they should have put some more effort on the representation of the Michael from the 70s and early 80s because thats what made him a mega star.I have a good idea for a extended version of this game with the new songs/backgrounds/dance sequences added:1. ABC (Ed Sullivan Show - 1970)2. The Love You Save (Diana Show 1971)3. I Want You Back (Ed Sullivan Show - 1969)4. Dancing Machine (Soul Train - 1973)5. Rockin' Robin (live - 1972)6. Enjoy Yourself (video - 1976)7. Blame It On The Boogie (video - 1978)8. Shake You Body Down To The Ground (Top of the Pops - 1979)9. Can You Feel It (video)10. Human Nature (animated street with MJ in yellow/white...like on single cover and Moonwalker)11. Billie Jean addition (Motown 25 - 1983)12. State Of Shock (Victory Tour stage setting with Mick Jagger and MJ wears Military attire like he wore in the Victory Tour)13. Scream (video - 1995 with Janet Jackson)14. You Rock My World (video - 2001)15. We Can Change The World (Capt EO short film - 1986)16 Another Part Of Me addition (Capt EO short film - 1986)Now that game should be a bonus.

You were probably on the fence about this one. The web sites reviewed this game poorly while the online communities rated it anywhere from 8-10 out of 10 across the board. I understand this game falls into a niche gaming market. The kind of people, myself included, who preferred bioshock to call of duty. It was never that call of duty wasn't a good game. It's just bioshock takes you somewhere. Alice Madness Returns is another said case. This game takes you somewhere. Granted there is some repetition. The combat can feel a little under developed compared to other games in it's class. It would have greatly benefited from more developed combos and wider variety of weapons. Even Alice herself could have been vastly improved by have the use of spells or something comparable to a skill tree of some sort. But those gripes aside the atmosphere and traversal are spot on. For anyone who likes Alice in Wonderland this is your game. Anyone who like the Nightmare Before Christmas vibe. This is your game. This game speaks to the kind of gamer who likes to sit back every once in awhile and say... \"Wow that is creative.\" This game is all about art direction, story, charm.

This is a game that can be played by both a Gears of War fan or a Diablo fan. It's an odd combination, but it just so happens to work in Hunted: The Demon's Forge.Positives:- Gears of War Meets Diablo - Hunted: The Demon's Forge mixes in combat scenarios like Gears of War with a cover system and ranged combat, but it also has up close and personal melee combat with a sword. Even though you can only carry one sword, one shield, and one bow on you at any given time, Hunted: The Demon's Forge has a ton of loot to find, including epic loot that'll really give you an advantage over your enemy.- Likable Characters and Dialog - In Hunted: The Demon's Forge you'll have the choice to either play as Caddoc or E'lara. Both characters have good voice acting. There's a lot of enjoyable witty banter while on your adventure.- Core Gameplay - Caddoc is a mostly a melee character, while E'lara is mostly a ranged character, but both characters have melee and ranged combat in their arsenal. For ranged combat, either character can use cover to their advantage and to stay safe from enemy fire. The ranged combat is very similar to Gears of War, while the melee combat is very solid and allows for combos and shield blocking.- Impressive Environments - Early on in Hunted: The Demon's Forge, you'll be in a lot of dark dungeons, but a few hours through the game and it lets the player outside with glorious and breathtaking vistas.Negatives:- Could Use More Polish - Hunted: The Demon's Forge is made well, but there is some minor texture pop-in, texture flickering, and some other graphical oddities.Hunted: The Demon's Forge really surprised me, as it's a game that was very low on my radar. I'm glad to say, however, that this is one enjoyable game for both single player and co-op gamers. It's a dungeon crawler with present day gameplay mechanics, mixing both old and new.

I mean you would think with all the technology we have now, fiddling around with with old stuff would just be boring.but, Treyarch actually did a very nice job with this game. The campaign is actually engaging, and enjoyable to play through. The multiplayer is also great, as even though the guns are old, they are very fun to use, and  you'll never feel like you are at a disadvantage, because all the guns are pretty crappy :PThat aside one of the biggest joys to this game is the addition of \"Nazi Zombies\".

Each world that you visit is to gather gems and different items (if you choose to) and there is secret things to be found but I found most of them through my first playthrough. I haven't though touched on the co-op which is there and there is the ability to use items you find to add on to your room within the game.If you want something for your kids than this is easy to recommend but for others, its not so much.

With a crowded library of dozens of highly-acclaimed PC and Xbox games I have bought and not yet played, I am pretty choosy about which games I spend time playing and which I skip. I have so many games that I don't hesitate to stop playing a new game if it isn't up to scratch. There have been a good many of these over the past 2 years. My point is that I've played a LOT of games, and I do not hesitate to criticize where criticism is due.As a big fan of the sci-fi FPS genre, FarCry falls square in the middle of my particular \"expertise\" (terminology applied loosely here). When I played FC, I was simply astonished - so much so that I have re-played it not once, but twice. Now, I'm getting the itch to play it yet again. Though it is indeed right in the middle of an overcrowded genre with a many solid, interesting entries, since my first replay, I have conferred upon this game the dubious honor of being the best FPS I have ever played. (More emphatically and confidently, I would say, \"This is simply the best FPS ever.\") As yet, the only game that has even come within sight of this distinction would be HalfLife 2. But in my mind, FC enjoys an uninterrupted eminence in its genre.What makes this game so spectacular? The physics are certainly great, but a great many games also have great physics. It is the phenomenology of the game; in other words, it is the engulfing experience. There is an interesting storyline you play through with an interesting progression of nerve-wracking scenarios. Having a coherent, sufficiently involved and progressive storyline running along with a game that doesn't become intrusive or disruptive to the gameplay is a necessary element of any GREAT game. But this is certainly not FC's only merit; it is only the beginning.Perhaps the greatest feature of FarCry is the level design. The textures are great, the level design is phenomenal, but most importantly, there is VARIETY. In the course of the game, you encounter more than a half-dozen completely distinct environments, and within each, there are almost constant variations. Every last detail in every environment - from a wrecked, rusted out WWII Japanese aircraft carrier to a high-tech laboratory to a tropical encampment of mercenaries - is executed with both technical and artistic brilliance. Not only do you have the exhiliarating thrill of the hunt, the chase, and the great A.I. to contend with, but you have the awe-striking scenery. Many times throughout the game, you will be tempted to just stop and look around. Maybe twenty times throughout the game, one involuntarily says to oneself, \"Wow.\" At so many points, the art is simply breathtaking.I'm not sure if there are any absolute \"firsts\" presented in this game, though there very well may be. However, I am QUITE certain that the game is crammed with \"bests\", from beginning to end. I have never played another game with such awe-striking artistic quality, so much variety, so much action, or such totally gripping immersion in every environment.Now I see that there is another aspect of this game that is awe-striking: Amazon is selling it for $17! For anyone who is as interested in sci-fi/fantasy FPSs as I am, there is no better game available for ANY price. This game certainly comes with the highest recommendation of a fairly experienced sci-fi FPS gamer!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2005"}

{"product_name":"B003ZSN600","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A solid choice for PC (and presumably also the 360)","reviewText":"I guess I will preface my review by saying that I bought this controller for the PC and not the XBox 360. I don't even own a 360.That said, this is an outstanding controller. Photos of the 360 pad always make it look huge and clunky, but the actual device is very compact and ergonomic, and quite easy to hold for extended periods. As iconic as the PS2/3 controllers have become, I think Microsoft has an edge here. The left stick is ABOVE the D-pad, which makes using it as a primary control in driving and fighting games a lot easier. The shoulder buttons are also easy to find- the bottom buttons are triggers while the top 2 are tabs as in a SNES/PSX pad. There are trade-offs: the D-pad is a little harder to use for long periods which makes this controller a little less ideal for oldschool platformers, and the face buttons are a little higher and further out than on a PSX pad making them a little harder to use for quick actions if you also need to use the right analog stick. These are totally livable complaints, however.Fit and finish is leagues beyond the competitors too. The controller makes ample use of grained plastic, with piano-black accents and soft-touch material on the analog sticks (which curve in to hold your thumb steady). Build quality feels solid and chunky throughout. The cord is long and feels hefty and durable, and even large hands will not feel awkward holding the controller. I have found that the buttons require more pressure than those on a PSX controller to register but since most XBox games use them for options and menu selections that makes sense. The shoulder buttons, especially the triggers, are hair-sensitive, presumably for all your Covenant-shooting needs.On the PC use of the controller is effortless. Plug it into a USB port, and Windows will automatically begin a download of the appropriate drivers (this makes the more expensive XBox 360 controller for Windows bundle a bit of a rip, since the only difference is that that pack comes with the drivers on-disk). Pretty much any game that accepts joypad input will recognize the controller with no further configuration. The Guide button (the metallic one with an x on it) is unused in most situations, but when you play a games for Windows Live title, it will open and close the Live overlay, and the player number indicator ring will become active.Overall a well-featured and solid controller choice that comes in at far less than many comparable products (including Sony's controllers, for which there are no native PC drivers). A must-have for PC driving and platforming, although I would never give up my mouse and keyboard for shooters.PROS-Great build quality-Looks good-Cheap-Does the job right out of the box-Great supportCONS-Takes some adjusting if you are used to other brands-D-pad is hard to use as a primary input","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2012"}

Here players scour the expansive environment of Renaissance-era Rome, tasked with ridding the Eternal City of the continuing stain of the Templars and in the process ensuring the survival of the guild of assassins. You are not in this alone though. Additional AI members of your guild are at your command, and can be summoned to your aid if need be. In addition to this, for the first time in theAssassin's Creedfranchise players can compete with other would-be assassins in multiplayer action. In multiplayer modes players choose from a range of Assassin characters, each with their own backstory, unique weapons and assassination techniques. Choose your assassin character, utilize the virtual reality capabilities of Abstergo Industries' Animus technology and match your skills against other assassins from around the world. There's no time like now to join the Brotherhood.Deadly Weapons ArsenalAssassin's Creed: Brotherhoodfeatures a wide variety of weapons, depending on the mode of play. In single player players primarily utilize Ezio's weapons of choice, the hidden blade and crossbow, while in multiplayer modes players gain access to a wide variety of weapon, depending on the character they choose to play as. Examples of this include: the Axe, wielded by the Executioner; the Fan, used by the Courtesan; the Syringe, the tool by the Doctor; the Dagger, used by the Priest; the Switchblade, carried by the Prowler; and the Claw, used by the Nobleman.Key Game FeaturesAs Ezio, a legendary Master Assassin, experience over 15 hours of single player gameplay set in the living, breathing, unpredictable city of Rome.Recruit and train promising young Assassins.

The new aspects: cruising around performing guild missions, taking out towers and training Assassins was also lots of fun.The problem that I had with the single player campaign was the inordinate amount of 'do not be detected' missions. I remember having fun in AC2 where there was a mission to infiltrate a military compound, kill the chest bearer, steal his clothes and assume his identity. There were some tricks to that mission and it took a number of times to get it right; but, ultimately rewarding and still reasonable on the PITA factor. In AC Brotherhood, take that mission and multiply the PITA factor by 20x. There are dozens of main missions where going undetected turns a fun playground into a tedious exercise in repetitive, buzz killing desyncronizations (not to mention the reload times). It is about as much fun as memorizing random phone numbers. You have to try 20 different things until one of them works, make your way to the next bit of cover and go through it all again. To add insult to injury, is it even feasible that dressed as an Assassin you can go into a Cathedral, crash a closed Mass and hide in plain sight by blending with a bunch of bishops?! Surely they are going to smell that raw sewage that I just swam through.Overall, a nice game but not as engaging or clever as the first two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

CJ)","reviewText":"As I walked out my house, I only had one thing on my mind. Sheer destruction. I looked around and saw a few drug dealers on my block. I walked up to one and he asked me if I wanted any. My being the good citizen that I was could have just walked away. Instead, I pulled out my knife and shanked him a couple times and collected the $2000 he had dropped in a puddle of blood. His buddy, just a few feet away, saw what I had done and pulled out his 9mm to cap me a few times.I could have just avoided the situation and ran away. But I ain't no punk, so I whipped out my Silenced 9mm and shot him dead. Stand-byers that had not ran away after the killings ran away as I took aim on them.As the ambulance came, I noticed I had a few gunshot wounds so as soon as the medics jumped out I hopped in a drove away. I drove the ambulance down the street to the gym. There I did a few minutes on the treadmill and exercise bike to work off the pizza I had eaten last night.As I left the gym I saw a few members of a rival gang(The Ballas) dressed in purple walking on the opposite side of the street. They saw me and I jumped in the ambulance and start shooting me with Tec-9s. I slammed the pedal to the metal and drove straight toward them. Two of their dodged me and the other two weren't so lucky. I whipped the car around and tried to hit the other two. They dodged again and continued shooting as I ran into a telephone pole. Now with the ambulance smoking black, I got out and started returning fire with my Tec-9. I killed one but the other hide for cover behind the ambulance. I knew I that I didn't have much health left but could easily dispose of a single Balla with a gun. I wanted to make a statement so I carefully placed a remote explosive in front of the banged up hood of the ambulance. I ran across the street and detonated it. The car exploded with such force that the whole neighborhood shook! After all that killing, I was starving.Since I had just exploded my only mode of transportation, I had to find another option. Luckily for me some dumb fool came riding a pretty nice BMX bike up the street. Before he had time to react, I capped him with a single shot from my Silenced 9mm. I got on the bike and pedaled quickly as up the street to the local chicken joint in East Los Santos. After a good meal, I decided I was going to go to see my girlfriend up in San Fierro. But I wasn't going to drive...I walked out of Cluckin' Bell and jumped back on my BMX bike. I rode it down the street to the Los Santos International Airport. I had already gotten my pilot license so boarding the plane was a breeze. As soon as I got over Red County I realized I didn't change my clothes for the date. I didn't want to go in my gang (Grove Street Families) colors so I decided to fly to my safehouse at the Verdant Meadow Aircraft Graveyard. I didn't realized the mistake I had made till I had flown over the No Fly Zone and saw two heat-seeking missiles headed my way!!! I didn't have enough time to dodge the missiles so I jumped out the plane with a prayer and my parachute strapped on. The missiles hit my plane and it exploded on contact. I was now alone in the big open sky.I safely landed a few miles south of the safehouse and hiked through the scorching desert. I landed too far from the nearest highway so I decided to suck it up and just run the rest of the way.Once I got there, I changed clothes and decided to pull out something memorable for our date. I ran to the back of the garage and strapped on my jetpack, courtesy of my hippie friend The Truth. I soared through the sky at breckneck speeds. There was no way I was going to miss this date. I laughed as I saw a traffic jam on the Garver Bridge. That could have been me I thought. Once I got to Michelle's house I was ready for our date. But I forgot to bring a car. So I rode the jetpack to my safehouse in Doherty. I hopped in my hot pink Cheetah I had stolen from a wealthy patron of the city and sped off to Michelle's house.The list of things you can do in this game is unbelievable. Well worth getting.

Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.

A Fine Return to Form......","reviewText":"Resident Evil has seen many highs and lows in the years since its' debut on the Playstation in 1996. I, personally, lost interest in the series after RE3:Nemesis. While I played RE: Code Veronica X, it just seemed to me it was the same ol' same ol' all over again. So, I went with Silent Hill for awhile because of its' fresh approach to survival horror. Sadly, it, too, began to regurgitate the same ol' formula with it's PS2 games so I gave up on games of this nature altogether. So, recently, my nephew comes over to play videogames with me and brings his copy of Resident Evil 4. Leaving it behind when he leaves to go home, I find it and decide to take a look at the game. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised when I got sucked into the game and played for hours on end. See, with this installment of Resident Evil, the series goes into a bold new direction with a greater emphasis on the story. If you're wondering how, all I can say is to check it out.The story itself has Leon Kennedy(whom RE Vets will remember from RE2) searching for the President's daughter in a remote European village where she was supposedly spotted. Yet, instead of facing zombies like in previous Resident Evil games, Leon faces a threat far greater than that. A threat that is genuinely creepy and very unsettling.While many of you know this game was originally released on the Nintendo Gamecube, it was successfully ported over to the Playstation 2 with several new extras(such as Ada Wong's Separate Ways sidestory, new outfits & whatnot). Very little was sacrificed in the making of this game and it shows. The game looks absolutely stunning(measuring up to the graphical style of Silent Hill and then some) and the gameplay is as perfect as it can be. Resident Evil 4 is a fine return to form as the leading Survival Horror game on the Playstation 2. I highly recommend you play this game.For me, I'm gone....out to buy Resident Evil 4. Later you all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2007"}

I figured why not for so cheap.The game looks great.  It's similar to other mmo's as it has many quests for you to do as well as a multitude of races and classes.To me what's interesting is it's unlike other mmorpg's in how you play the game.  It's more action oriented for larger, fast paced fights rather than locking on to one enemy and doing the 1 on 1 thing.  I realize their are exceptions, but Tera does it so much better.I haven't played enough to give it a thorough end game run down as well, but so far it's a great game.  I don't believe it'll ever get the recognition it deserves which is sad. The player base is there to enjoy the game and have people to do stuff with.I recommend trying out the game if you're into mmorpg's and you have the time available.

Most of the weapons felt watered down in terms of range and power, and the new maps failed to excite us like those in the original game.Luckily, that all changes in this year's version, because Epic Games has gone back to UTs roots. The weapons have been rebalanced, and new armaments like the Spider Mines and the anti-vehicle rocket launcher are fun to wield. On top of this, Epic has revived our favorite game mode from the original-Assault-and added an awesome new challenge called Onslaught that consists of huge, wide-open maps, all-new vehicular combat, and node-oriented warfare that makes for riveting back-and-forth battles. And, because all the content from UT2K3 is included, it's like two games in one.UT2K4 features 10 different game types, so it's likely you'll find a style that appeals to you. The package also includes several new one-on-one deathmatch maps for the hardcore crowd, six Assault maps, and nine Onslaught maps.In a move that adds a remarkable layer of depth to a typically simple genre, Epic makes UT2K's single-player campaign feel like a franchise-oriented sports title like EA Sports' Madden series. You draft a team of players and fight other teams in a series of matches. After a match, you pay money to treat your injured players, sign free agents, and even challenge other teams to \"bloodrites\" matches, where the winner can poach one of the losing team's star players. As far as single-player experiences go, it's a dramatic departure that feels less exciting than, say, Far Cry, but is certainly unique. And it's commendable that Epic took the time to add nuance and strategy to what could have been a flat-feeling simple string of bot matches.UT2K4 is the best value we've seen in a long time. Between the online and offline play, and the myriad game types, it'll be a long time before you get bored. But most importantly, it's F-U-N. Even Maximum PC editors Gordon Mah Ung and Will Smith, both avowed Battlefield fanatics, have become converts. The bottom line is this: If you buy this game and can't find something about it to love, you need help.+ Ownage: Tons of content, tons of fun.- Rentage: Outdated graphics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2005"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Left me wanting more depth","reviewText":"I picked this game up because it looked like a creepy gory action style adventure a bit like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Sadly I was a bit disappointed. Although it looks good, it doesn't play very well and it tries way too hard to be cool.The story tells of a guy called Garcia whose beautiful girlfriend has been abducted by demons from Hell, so he goes to Hell to get her back. That's it, that's the whole plot. I guess that's enough as this is really just a game where you kill lots of monsters and progress through levels, but a bit more depth would have been nice.Anyway the game plays just like Devil May Cry - you start with a weapon and can enhance it or earn new weapons and upgrades by collecting energy dropped by monsters. You can also upgrade your own stats and buy items. The levels take the form of twisted visions of hell, and most f them are pretty grim, strung up corpses and body parts litter the screen as you progress through gothic city slums, foggy graveyards, farmsteads, mazes and cathedrals, and there's blood literally everywhere. Not a game for the squeamish. Anyway it's pretty much a case of kill everything and move on, but there are a few unique features, one of which is the aspect of Darkness. This is when waves of darkness cover the playing field (usually spewing from some boss or from a portal somewhere), and while it's covering the area, enemies can't be killed and your health gradually drains away. There are many points in the game where you have t keep de-activating the darkness, attacking monsters and then de-activate it again as monsters keep turning it back on. This is not as much fun as it might sound. Playing in the darkness is disorientating and difficult - but I guess that is the idea. Didn't make me enjoy it, though. Nearly every boss you meet will have some kind of darkness phase which you will have to interrupt to make progress in killing them, and this became quite predictable after a while.The monsters that come after you range from the annoying but easy enemies that simply come in waves, to the annoyingly difficult. Some are hugely frustrating to kill, as they have specific attack patterns that you have to learn and dodge, and a few only have very few hidden weak spots - case in point, some are like spiky hedgehogs and they only reveal their weak spot (concealed on their belly) when they are stunned and fall flat on their backs for a second or two. You need to be an extremely good aim to kill these. Sadly I found the aiming really tricky! This is a 3rd person shooter mostly (Not sword swinging), so think Chris in Resident Evil 5, but a lot faster. Fun for those who like a challenge to the reflexes.Anyway, now for my most severe criticism: this game tries so hard to be cool it just made me want to turn off. It is extremely vulgar, there is way too much talk about sex, bodily functions and general bad language. Things reach a low point when your gun (which has a character and a voice) gets an upgrade that makes it behave like ...an erection. The level involves a peep show and the gun only works when you let it become aroused via a dirty phone call. I found this puerile in the extreme, and it really left me not wanting to bother finishing the game. But if you love things crude and dirty, then roll up, but it didn't engage me in any way whatsoever.There was some more ingenuity - a couple of levels were 2D side-scrolling cartoons! Very odd (and not all that simple). In general the whole game is pretty surreal, it's all based in Hell so anything can happen at anytime - actually that kind of worked against it, as after a while you're just saying: \"yeah yeah, what are you gonna do to me next?\".So to wrap up, I didn't find the game much fun. Aiming at monsters was very tricky - and that's almost 90% of the fighting style. Levels became predictable - oh look more heads on spikes - and the sexual and toilet-based humour should have been left out. So for me, this was a bit of a miss rather than a hit.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

The mere mention of it conjures up memories of days long past in arcades.  It was both a phenomenon and a fad.  A 2D fighting game with one eight-way joystick and 6 buttons, whose purposes were burned into the minds of everyone who played it.  Jab, strong fierce, short forward, roundhouse.  8 colorful and varied characters representing the world's martial arts styles, and  4 boss characters doing the same. A game that became the ultimate test of two players against each other. Loser pays, winner stays.  People spent hundreds if not thousands of quarters and tokens, and when the home versions were released, living rooms across the world were blessed with the cries of \"Hadouken!\" and \"Sonic Boom!\"  It single handedly jump started the fighting game genre into high gear and was the catalyst for the revival of the arcade .  Soon everyone had to have a fighting game too.  Fighter's History, Martial Champions, Mortal Kombat, Primal Rage, Virtua Fighter, all of SNK's Neo Geo fighters were among the few that cashed in on Street Fighter's popularity.  Then, the arcade scene slowed down, and fighting games pretty much went the way of a niche genre, just like shoot `em ups (shmups).Fast forward to February 17, 2009.  Capcom will release Street Fighter IV onto the PS3 and Xbox 360.  Oh sure, there were other Street Fighter games along the way since the original II.  But not even the Alpha series, nor Street Fighter III's pinnacle, Third Strike has had everyone talking about Street Fighter like it's 1991 again.  Bringing back all the original World Warriors and bosses, 2 of the New Challengers, and four all new contenders plus some fan favorites including the infamous Gouken, Ryu and Ken's master, otherwise known as the infamous Sheng Long of the famous EGM April Fools trick, Capcom is giving the fans a very nice trip down memory lane wrapped up in more than just a shiny new 3D package.The character roster is as follows:RyuKenChun LiGuileBlankaZangiefE. HondaDhalsimBalrogVegaSagatM. BisonAkumaEl FuerteCrimson ViperAbelRufusSethGoukenCammyFei LongRoseSakuraDanTo start: SF IV is the same 2D gameplay you remember.  What's new is the 3D graphics, which sweep and zoom during certain specials and super/ultra moves.  It's SF as you remember only better.  With features such as new gameplay systems such as the Ultra moves where a gauge is built up as you take damage and when full, allows your fighter a spectacular come back Super move which allows even the underdog in a match a chance at victory. The Focus attack in a sense replaces the Parry system of SFIII but this time around, it isn't as difficult to master for the casual player.  All in all, the gameplay is classic Street Fighter II but with added polish and a few new additions.Graphics: gorgeous looking, and must be seen in HD in person to fully appreciate.  When the early artwork hit, and the first screen shots were released, many were not pleased with SF IV's bulked up muscular look.  A new art style and  a new direction, for a new era of fighters, rest assured it looks terrific.  Backgrounds are 3D, and varied.  I especially like the temples.Sound: Sublime.  In addition to the music tracks for each stage, there are remixed arranged versions for some of the original fighter's themes in the game as well.  Once you hear Cammy's remix of her classic England stage music, you'll know what I mean.  In addition to being able to change the voices from English to Japanese, you can do it...for every character.  If you want Cammy in English and Ryu in Japanese, you can.  Why, because Capcom loves you. My advice: The Japanese voices are better by a long shot.  The opening intro features a song by Exile (A pop band in Japan), which may or may not be your taste, but it does grow on you.  If not, the second song of the intro will get you so pumped to play, you'll forget the 1st half of the intro's song.In closing because this review is too long, get it, play it, enjoy it.  Street Fighter is back and it's been worth the wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2009"}

I was also struck by the combat they pit you against a boss in the beginning minutes of the game only to suggest you run for your life! this is the only game i've encountered where the npcs are all killable not easily mind you, i killed the first human you encounter after leaving the asylum by parrying him 10 times in a row. It was very rewarding to kill him one because he was a jerk and because it gave me 1000 souls which is the same as i got from the asylum demon, the first boss. Only real complaint i have is the co-op apparently if you aren't on the same server as your friends then they'll never be able to join your game, this is very disappointing as i have 4 friends currently playing on xbox live and none of us are on the same server so i'm doomed to play alone and this a game where co-op would be a life saver.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2011"}

It's at this point that you realize you've been bamboozled by HD graphics and that dark reality is now staring right back at you.2- Linear - More props to S/E. *Never* in all my years of gaming have I knowingly walked in a straight line for 12+ hrs and when I say straight Im talkin 'as an arrow.'

{"product_name":"B006P5RW3M","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Breath of (DRM free) Fresh Air","reviewText":"First, a quick bit of background. I play primarily FPS games. I occasionally dabble in RPG's. I loved Oblivion. I loved Skyrim. But most of my gaming time is spent on FPS games. As anyone who plays FPS games can tell you, that genre is stale.  Every major FPS game is a sequel, and aside from some minor variations, you realize in about 30 minutes that most FPS games are almost exact clones of all the FPS games that preceded it. So, I look to RPG's for some variety.Witcher 2 is indeed an RPG, but even within the world of RPG's, it is unique. The Witcher series are based on books written by a polish author. The games are steeped in the mythology of the books, and Witcher 2 simply thrusts you into this world with little explanation.  No baby steps here. You learn from context that your character is a Witcher, which is a supernatural being that folks hire to slay monsters.  The world of the Witcher 2 is vast, detailed, and filled with competing factions with a long history of distrust and racism. Humans detest non-humans (elves and dwarfs). Elves have been subjected to pogroms and massacres, and live in the woods as rebels. The Witcher's world is divided amongst competing kingdoms, and the kings wage wars based on petty differences.  This is a detailed, rich world filled with interesting characters.Witcher 2 was originally released in 2011 as a PC only game. It was released again in 2012 as the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition on the Xbox 360. The Enhanced Edition added hours of new content, an improved tutorial system, and included some previously released downloadable content. People who owned the original Witcher 2 on PC can go to the GOG.com website and download a 14 GB patch for free, which updated the original witcher 2 to the Enhanced Edition.  Because I am what they call \"frugal,\" I purchased the original Witcher 2 (which is less than the Enhanced Edition) and then downloaded the free patch to update to the Enhanced Edition.The game starts with the most amazing CGI cutscene I have ever seen. It is so amazing you will wonder why they don't make whole movies with this technology.  The scene is important because it kick starts the story of Witcher 2 but isn't really placed into context for a while.  (Mild Spoiler alert: the cutscene shows the assassination of King Demavand, which starts the story. End of Spoiler.)The story of the Witcher 2 is complex. And violent.  Innocents are slaughtered by their enemies. There is CGI nudity. There are sexual acts that make Mass Effect look like a Disney movie.  This game plays like an R rated movie.  The voice acting is flawless.  The main character's voice is perfect and well done. You don't hear the same annoying lines from NPC's over and over again like you do some other games. (Hello, Skyrim!)  The combat has a learning curve. You fight with a sword, in conjunction with powers (which the game calls \"signs\"). The fighting is real time, and involves a combination of timing your attacks and parries with evasive movements. It looks weird if you watch gameplay movies, but makes perfect sense when you are the one executing the moves. I found the combat quite gratifying and enjoyable. I tried playing the game with my standard keyboard and mouse set-up. I did some research and read that some folks really preferred playing the PC version with the xbox 360 controller.  I switched to that set-up and found the combat much more intuitive. X for a quick sword strike, Y for a stronger attack (for armored enemies or massive gollums), B to use a power (incinerate was my favorite, and A to roll away or towards an enemy. For me, this set-up was much better than my mouse and keyboard.The story places the combat in context and gives it meaning.  You level up and develop your character, investing skill points in swordsmanship, powers (signs), or alchemy.  There are different endings, and about 1/3rd of the way through the game, you must pick a path that plays out independently of the path you didn't choose.  The ending I reached explained every loose thread of the complex story. I was very impressed with how much effort and detail went into every facet of this game, from the gameplay and graphics to the story and the story's resolution. You can really tell this game was a labor of love for the developers.  I plan to go back now and play the other path. Two games in one?  Bargain!If you would like to play an original game that isn't a rehash of all games that came before it, consider Witcher 2. I did, and came away impressed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}

The game almost ALL of my friends on XBox Live recommended as their game of the year. Seriously, I'm talking like 90/96. I was of the opinion that Orange Box deserved to win, more so than many other phenomenal games we've seen this year, such as Bioshock, Super Mario Galaxy and others that some will agree and disagree with.Anyway, Call of Duty! I loved CoD2, it was the first game I got for my 360, and the first game I played online. It was awesome. I really mean that, and I've played the majority of FPS games on consoles especially, since around Wolfenstein 3d. CoD3 was a bit of a disappointment and was just lacking in areas, Trearch tried to make the Multiplayer experience a huge deal, but it lacked structure, and Ranked games were a bitch to get into. CoD2 thrived in more close range environments in my opinion.Call of Duty lets you lose in Modern Warfare if you could never have guessed, playing as both sides of \"Good-guys\" in the game; the US and the British. The new guns are great for a nice change, but I've got a few key problems to get out of the way nice and early:- The game is ridiculously linear, and shows it alot more than Call of Duty 2 and even 3 in some cases.- I have also noticed quite a few bugs without searching for them, such as enemies and allies getting stuck on scenery, and the Invincible members of allies getting dragged and sliding along after a tank crashes into them. It's quite funny to be honest, but it breaks the whole \"realistic\" feel the game is heading for.The game's also VERY short. I beat it on Normal (And yes, I will soon aim to complete it on Veteran) and it took me under five hours. I know that some people will argue that the game focus is on multiplayer, but a)This is a single player campaign review, and b)Look at the Orange Box and all that fits in. A Half Life \"Episode\" took me the same time to complete as Call of Duty 4, which is quite disappointing.Some of the levels are great. Because the level design is so linear, this makes the game have a far more cinematic effect, but you always feel that you are trying to get to that \"I win\" moment, to quote Garnett Lee on the 1UP Show. Grapics are also very good. It's got a very \"Triple-A\" game feel to it right from the outset.Overall, I'd give it a 7/10 in Single Player. I should be reviewing Multiplayer Online play soon, but since I got my 360 back from repair, I haven't been able to get online.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

The game revolves around the Master Chief who is the last of a superhuman soldier group only known as Spartans. He is onboard a ship that falls under attack and is forced to wage a guerilla war on the alien threat. The gameplay is extremely easy to use giving the Xbox controller a great usage in the course of the game. This is where it truly shines. Graphically the game can only be described as a work of art. The multiplayer experience is awesome, it utilizes four controllers on one Xbox and gives the ability to link four Xbox consoles and Four Televisions up in order to have a decent 16 person LAN party. It is a very fun game and the difficulty levels and multiplayer experience gives it a great replay value all in itself. At least rent the game and if you lose you skepticism then buy the game and enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2001"}

I would rate the single player game a 4 out of 5.  It loses a point for some repetitive play and its short length.  I would like to concentrate, however, on the multiplayer game, which I rate a 3 out of 5 -- and that is being generous.  If you were to list the \"glitches\" in Halo PC it will add up into the hundreds.  Yes, it's fun, but it is VERY buggy.There are so many problems with Halo PC that it would take pages and pages to outline each one.  I will list below a few below.1) The year is 2552.  I guess we haven't made much progress on vehicle design and operation.  The warthog overturns way too easily.  The ghost and banshee get \"stuck\" on corners.  A banshee going full speed is stopped dead by a branch of leaves and it sounds like it hit a rock.  Okay.2) In the PC game, we often get the \"mystery of the half-flipped vehicle.\"  Shoot a warthog from a distance with a heavy weapon and you will often see the vehicle begin to flip over only to instantly right itself and continue going as if nothing at all happened.  Okay.3) Forced Flag pick-up in CTF.  If you get too close to the flag, you are FORCED to pick it up, even if you don't want to.  This nullifies your weapons.  It would be much better to have to press an \"action key\" to pick up the flag.  Many a people have been killed because they accidentally picked up the flag.4) The \"reacquire flag\" bug.  If you have the flag and want to drop it in order to shoot an opponent, good luck.  As soon as you drop it, you will instantly pick it up again.  Even if you try to throw it, you will pick it up again.  Even if you run forward and throw the flag and then back up, you will pick it up again.  Many a people have been killed because they reacquired the flag when they didn't want to.5) Are rockets propelled by rubberbands?  They go so slowly, you'd think so.6) Want to drive a ghost or warthog in a base.  Better be careful.  Even though your head height in the vehicles is many feet below the ceiling, you can't see.  You get all kinds of vision interference.  Hard to steer or shoot if you can't see.7) So how did you get up there?  That's what you might ask when you see people in the sky.  Yeah, it's a \"sealing glitch\" that can be taken advantage of, if you know how.8)  You can usually make a kill with one rocket, or two fuel rod hits.  But if you really want a powerful weapon, use your fist.  You can follow an opponent up a ladder and hit him in his feet and instantly kill him.  A hit in a foot is more powerful than a rocket or fuel rod or sniper rifle.  Yeah, that makes sense.9)  What about the dud granades?  Yep... sometimes you can throw a nade and it won't blow...this often happens if you die after you throw the nade.  Not all nades are the same strength either, it appears.  Sometimes a nade will blow right at the feet of an opponent and won't kill.  Other times, it blows 20 ft. away and WILL kill.  Never really know what you're getting.10)  The \"run-over\" glitch.  Very frustrating glitch that occurs when you head in a vehicle straight for an opponent only to find when you hit him, he will disappear and reappear about 20 feet away unharmed.  Sometimes this can happen over and over again as you try to hit him.  Another glitch is when you apparently DO hit an opponent and you see him fly in the air about 50 feet -- only to suddenly disappear and reappear on the ground unharmed.  Some will say this is a \"lag\" problem, but I find this happening all the time with my 1.5 mb line at under 75 ping.11) What is all this Tking!  It appears there is no adequate method to deal with it.  I'd say at least half of all games have Tkers on them.  And if that's not bad enough, there are the spys.12) The spies change teams for a short period to see what the defenses are or to find where a flag is hidden.  Then they change back and let their teammates know what's up.13) Watch out, you may get the boot.  You might be thinking I'm talking about Tking too much.  Nope.  If you're \"too good\" the admin of the server may just boot you right off.  A lot of games are \"stacked\" so that the admin's team will always win.  They just boot the good players off the opposing team.  Happens all the time.  On a bad day, I can get booted off five or more times by the admin just because I have \"too many kills\" or I killed the admin.  Okay.14) Stupid Rules.  Sometimes you just have to laugh at some rules people make up.  \"No driving vehicles,\"  \"No using fuel rods or rockets\"  \"No camping.\"  That one is the funniest.  You CANNOT play defense...it's not fair.. LOL.  \"This is only an offensive game.  No defense is allowed.\"  LOL.  When that is said, just ask what \"camping\" is.  You will probably get an answer like.  \"It's standing still.\"  Or  \"It's staying in a location too long.\"  So you can't stop running or hide behind a rock or a tree... or wait for a ride.  It gets so ridiculous that you just have to laugh at the stupidity of the players on your server.15)  The \"following behind\" glitch.  When facing an opponent guns are much more accurate.  It is possible to kill an opponent with full health and shield in 3 pistol shots -- even from 50 ft away.  But running \"behind\" an opponent is completely different.  I have run behind an opponent as close as only 10 feet away and pumped more than 30 rounds into his head without a kill.  Doesn't seem to matter if they're head shots or body shots.  No kill.16)  The \"stuck in the wall\" glitch.  Sometimes a tank or warthog or ghost can break the plane of a wall and get \"stuck.\"  Once stuck, there is no way to break it loose.  The vehicle is lost.  One game I played had no less than five vehicles all stuck in walls.  Again, poor design.Since I'm running out of time, I'll stop here.  It may sound to you as if I don't like Halo multiplayer.  That's not true.  In fact, I still play it more than any other online game.  However there are so many bugs and issues with it that, even though it is usually fun, I have to knock off a few points for some of the shortcomings.  Some might argue that ALL games have some glitches.  True... but not to this extent.  These bugs are mostly confined to the PC version of Halo, not the Xbox version.  Hopefully, Halo 2 for PC with be much less buggy.  I rate it a 3 out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2004"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

Given Nintendo's track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new GameCube platform, I had every reason to think that \"Luigi's Mansion\", even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors, would be a quality entry in the series. I have to say that I was sorely disappointed.I have a certain level of tolerance for games, even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding, but I ran out of patience with this game. I could barely even get into playing it. From the very beginning, this game gets annoying. When Luigi first enters the mansion, he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give Luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion. Yet, the idiotic professor rambles for about 10 minutes worth of dialogue and THERE IS NO WAY TO BYPASS IT!! After each brief piece of dialogue, you have to hit a button to make it continue, too. So you just can't do something else while he rambles. But, I digress. You would think that once you get past that annoyance, you could just get right into the game. WRONG! Learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating. The game doesn't give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it THAT STUPID PROFESSOR STARTS YAPPING AGAIN!!! This, alone, caused me to put the game aside for about 8 months before trying it again. Once I finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness, I figured I would finally be able get into the game. Once again, I was wrong. I find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board. I had the strategy guide and could very well have looked up how to open these locked doors, but at this point, I was just too frustrated to care anymore. I put the game down for the last time...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2002"}

Let me tell you something people, this should have been a downloadable game costing from 5 to 10 dollars, no more, maybe less. This game was shorter than pilot wings and I beat pilot wings in one day. Luckily I rented this and pilot wings so I'm not upset really, but had I paid full price for the two games I would be outraged, because both of them could have and should've been downloadable games. I thought pilot wings was excellent from start to finish, but steel diver is a different story. Steel diver was awesome in the side scrolling mission mode, however, the other two modes were awful and not my cup of tea at all. You may disagree, but I think they should have discarded those two side modes and focused more on the side scrolling missions by adding more of them. One big gripe I have is that I noticed in other reviews on this website people saying that the music was beautiful and wonderful. My question is, what music? You mean the occasional soothing chinese music that lasted a whole 30 seconds on a few missions. I found the music to be non existent to say the least and that's where I'll stop. In closing, if you want a fun game that takes around 30 minutes to a hour to beat, with no depth, then buy this, if not, rent it or just pass on it all together and save up for cubic ninja or resident evil revelations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

Bungie single-handedly raised the bar for first-person shooters when Halo was released as a launch title for the Xbox.  It quickly gained \"legendary\" status among many gamers, for both its carefully designed campaign and endlessly entertaining multiplayer options.  Halo sold millions of copies, won many awards, and is regarded as the best first-person shooter on modern consoles.A sequel quickly became a matter of \"when\" rather than \"if\", and fans everywhere worked themselves into a frenzy whenever one tiny speck of new information trickled out from the locked-down Bungie labs.  The emergence of Xbox Live also created dreams of multiplayer mayhem never before considered.  Needless to say, the hype surrounding Halo 2 reached feverish, surreal proportions (supported by a brilliant marketing ploy called ilovebees.com), and by the time the November release date was announced in early 2004, Microsoft had already pre-sold close to two million copies.How on earth could Bungie possibly live up to it?  Incredibly, they did.......halfway.  Halo 2 multiplayer is as good as the most rabid fanboy could dream, except for the inexplicable removal of system-link co-op play for the campaign mode.  Splitscreen returns for the offline sector, with a versatile selection of maps and options galore.  And Halo 2 online is just about as perfect as you'd want.  More vehicles, interesting map design (downloadable content coming later via Xbox Live), nicer weapon balance via the new dual-wielding, and interactive environments make for some of the best deathmatching (and CTF-ing) you could want.  This is where the action is, and you can bet Xbox Live will gain lots of new subscribers......if they'll fit on the crowded servers, that is.In fact, multiplayer is so well-done, it's hard to believe that Halo 2's single-player mode (co-op in splitscreen) was developed by the same Bungie.  The original Halo's campaign had a gripping story, intelligent enemies, brilliant level design, and a diverse, equally useful selection of weapons.  Almost all of this is missing in Halo 2.  A friend of mine described Halo 2's campaign as \"a really good mod, if I didn't know any better\", and I think that's a perfect portrayal.  Good?  Yes - in parts.  Up to the original?  Not even close.It's really hard to believe that it's so faulty, especially since multiplayer was done with such obvious care.  The fanboy conspiracies are popping up constantly, and you can't really blame them.  It's not poor in a technical sense, but rather in a design sense.  Whether it was technological or time constraints, that ol' lovin feelin is gone...gone...gone.One of the problems is the story.  The Covenant are invading Earth, and there's a second galaxy-shattering Halo weapon to deal with.  To use kind words, you will be totally baffled by the ending, and not in a good way.  Imagine reading a book, riding a crest of events rushing towards a climactic encounter, only to discover someone has ripped out the last five chapters.  Yep.  Anyone who played Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver on the PSone/Dreamcast will know well of what I speak.  It's hard to believe that Bungie treated their fans to such an un-final final act, but it's right there for us all to see.  The story also doesn't flow nearly as well as before, for reasons anyone who played the military soap opera Metal Gear Solid 2 will recognize (see: Raiden).  Bungie took a chance with the game's structure - the wrong chance.Another problem is the gameplay.  Halo 1's gameplay was tweaked to perfection.  Halo 2's gameplay reflects its uneven and choppy story.  The duel-wielding mechanic is a good idea, but the weapons take up too much space on screen, you can't separate targeting, and the combinations don't really differ much from each other, as only single-hand weapons are eligible (the energy sword excepted for puzzling reasons).  The beloved assault rifle is gone, replaced by the nigh-useless battle rifle.  Halo 1's omnipotent pistol is now a limp shadow of its former self.  Twin SMGs or needlers make you feel like you're starring in a 29th-century John Woo flick, but it ends up being a wasted opportunity that feels like it was intended for multiplayer (in which it's very useful and strategic).  Same goes for the new vehicle-jacking:  no matter how cool it looks, it's practically useless in single-player, but a highly important multiplayer strategy.In fact, much of Halo 2's single-player campaign feels like training ground for the online aspect, reflecting a trend that's becoming disturbingly more common.Directly affecting the gameplay is Halo 2's level design.  On one hand, the repetitive hallways of the first game's Assault on the Control Room are gone.  But what's also missing are the wide-open, chaos-filled areas of The Silent Cartographer and Two Betrayals.  To be blunt, Halo 2's levels are too narrow, cluttered, and hard to navigate.  The versatility is gone.  In Halo 1, there were multiple ways to set up your offense, but the sequel's smaller, crowded levels often leave players with a  straight-ahead assault usually saved for games of lesser caliber.  Halo 2's design is a lot more linear and straightforward, probably because the detail on everything is so much higher.Which brings me to another letdown: the visuals.  Halo 1 won't win any beauty contests, (especially when compared to visual masterworks like Ninja Gaiden, Panzer Dragoon Orta, Otogi, and Project Gotham Racing 2) but featured a very serviceable, blue-collar engine that did everything well, but nothing spectacularly.  Halo 2 has slowdown.  Muddiness.  A strange unevenness between background and foreground.  Character models do look a lot better and are well-animated (just close your eyes during the ugly cutscenes), but at the price of cutting down the scope of the levels.And let's be honest here, Bungie are better programmers than they are art designers.  Halo 2 is not an UGLY game per se.  It can be striking at times, and the on-screen action often gets quite hectic.  But it's strangely disengaging, bordering on uninspired and cliched.  The environments lack character, and range from some truly nice-looking vegetation to horribly barren and bland passages (in an alien stronghold, no less).  Grunts and Elites thankfully look like their old selves, but Jackals are now punker birds, and Hunters look like anime rejects instead of menacing armored beasts.  The new Drones are a nice touch, but I won't mention the terribly designed Brutes and Prophets. Even the Flood doesn't strike the same kind of mutation-fearing awe as before, the higher detail making them look silly rather than blurrily half-formed.  There are some nice atmospheric touches, but these moments are far too brief and infrequent.Soundwise, however, Halo 2 is magnificent.  Martin O'Donnell matches the triumphant tunes of the original, and although you'll hear a lot of familiar melodies, they do the job while adding to the experience.  the voice-acting also deserves a mention, with celebrity voice talent like John Hurt, Orlando Jones, and Keith David.  One notable exception:  the Covenant now speak English.  You'll understand why early on, but it robs them of their Halo 1 identities - bad Bungie, bad!In the end, Halo 2's campaign is thoroughly underwhelming, and a real disappointment.  Horrendous anti-climax not withstanding, the levels are too difficult just to move through - not what you want in a fast-paced shooter - and confusingly designed.  You should never EVER have to wander about in a non-puzzle action game, wondering what to do next, or where to go.  The checkpoint system needs a redesign, Bungie - do it now.  And the vaunted vehicle sections now feel like they're on rails because the levels are so narrow.Remove the superb multiplayer and the Halo universe/license, and you'd be left with a good-looking, above-average, sci-fi shooter whose \"endless\" story wouldn't be easily accepted, and whose campaign shows potential for greatness.Bungie stands guilty of trying too hard to fix what wasn't broken, of level design overkill, and also of unforgivably falling asleep before finishing the narrative (or else they must have been visited by Starship Troopers' Brain Bug).All told, if you don't have Xbox Live, it's hard to recommend Halo 2 as a purchase if you already have the classic original.  Rent it to be dumbfounded with the messy campaign.  If you're one of the six Xbox owners who hasn't, drop the $20-odd and pick up the original, but don't let your curiosity with the sequel get the better of you.Bungie has a lot to prove with Halo 3, and unfortunately, we'll probably have yet another long wait to discover the outcome....unless the rest of the campaign is released one level at a time on XBox Live (yeah right).Halo 2 is a candidate for the most perplexingly disappointing high-profile release of the last few years.  It's not nearly as well-rounded or evenly balanced as Halo 1, with multiplayer easily blowing away the story mode.  It's still good, but that's far, far short of what it should have been.Single-player:  3 starsMultiplayer:  5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2004"}

Now, Brothers in Arms from UbiSoft takes it to the next level with it's implementation of full infantry combat where YOU call the shots.  Played principally from a first-person perspective, Brothers in Arms clearly draws from the same graphical pool as it's forebears - gritty, lifelike animation, sound effects that will rattle your speakers and plenty of neat touches - dust, explosions, sun glare and weapon flashes all look and sound great, and WW2 buffs will be able to salivate over a wide range of accurately modeled weaponry.  As in other games, Brothers allows the player to commandeer enemy weaponry and gun emplacements in order to give 'Fritz a taste of his own medicine.  The player can also duck behind cover or lie prone, which in this mostly-realistic world of bullet damage can make all the difference between a live paratrooper and a letter home to mom.  So far, so Call of Duty.The ace-up-the-sleeve for this game comes in the form of your GI comrades.  The player is typically accompanied by 2 computer controlled fire teams.  In combat you can give orders and instructions to your troops using a simple, context-sensitive command system.  Placing the command cursor, similar to aiming crosshairs, over the terrain instructs your troops to move to that position - once there, they are smart enough to find appropriate cover and begin to scout for enemy positions.  Under attack, they automatically return fire, cover each other while reloading, and stay hidden and defended if the going gets really rough.  The AI is leaps ahead of previous games, and it's a tremendously satisfying sight to watch your troops take care of themselves without you having to hold their hands. The 2 fire teams are split between a rifle squad, who are able to lay down supressing and covering fire with their M1 Garands and BAR, and an assault element, who, with grenades and machine guns are used to flank and destroy the enemy - a classic infantry tactic that the developers have researched in order to get it spot on.  A typical engagement sees you the player supporting one of these 2 teams, which really allows you to play in your own style - budding commandos will enjoy rushing right down the enemy's throat, Thompson Sub blazing, while thinky types will relish the more strategic side of planning the attack.In order to simulate the intense pre-mission preparation that paratroopers underwent, Ubi has implimented a unique command-map that can be opened during play.  The area around the player can be viewed from an aerial vantage point, and partial zoom and rotation allows the player to plot their next move.  The map terrain  for each mission has been modelled from historical photographs, and the development team actually visited the battlefield to get a feel for how it must have looked.  Best of all, each member of your team is based on a real soldier who fought in the campaign.  It's at once rewarding and curiously spiritual to know that you are leading representations of real young men into the jaws of death, and when one of your guys goes down in the field, you better believe it tugs at your heart in a way very few games can achieve.Like most modern games, Brothers in Arms requires a decent computer, with a gig or so of hard-drive space, a quality graphics card and plenty of free ram.  However, you don't need a supercomputer to have a great time - my machine is a P4, 1.4, 9600 pro and 512meg of RAM, and this game remains smooth even when the fight gets close and personal.  I highly recommend this game to anyone after a fresh take on an exciting genre; one that takes risks, pushes the envelope and offers a powerful, moving, and above all fun experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2004"}

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"Not for Beginners","reviewText":"Anyone who's played Soul Calibur, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, or any number of the 3D fighters out there will come to Soul Calibur III with an advantage. You'll know the basics of the engine as well as the common button combinations inherent in the genre.If you're not familiar with fighting games of this kind, then this game will be a difficult experience; hell, it's a challenge for advanced players just starting the game. The learning curve on this game is extremely high. You need to have great eyesight and blindingly fast reflexes as you'll need to time button combinations perfectly in order to get what you're aiming for. This game is no simple button-masher. You must learn a lot of these techniques in order to advance in the game. There is a rewarding feeling that comes though, when you feel you've mastered some of the tougher techniques.The game-play itself is solid, with plenty of options to choose from, including a strategy game called Chronicles of the Sword involving a character you create( which is another great option to the play of this game). You must go through the strategy game in order to earn money and new equipment to create better characters later in the game. To go with that are all the individual story lines you can follow in Tales of Souls mode. There's your basic World Competition mode (tournaments and league fighting) along with Soul Arena, an arcade mode that has a number of small mini-games you can play and earn money in. Museum mode lets you explore your previously earned rewards. Plus, you can practice and go through a much needed tutorial.Like all Soul Calibur games, this game has the weaponry system that adds something to the fighting genre. You play to attain more weapons that can give your character better abilities as well as strengthening his or her attacks, something you'll need as you progress in some of the games. Though the list of moves a character can perform is relatively small, it does make the game a little easier to handle, especially since some of the moves are situational--can only be used at special times. When you're tired of doing the same moves, just pick a new character. This game is loaded with them at the very start but with unlock-ables the list becomes huge, adding replay value to many of the game modes.I highly recommend this game to fans of the 3D fighting genre. It's isn't for everyone because of the learning curve, but for those willing to accept a challenge, I recommend you also.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"An Amazing Game Overall","reviewText":"Pros:+A good challenge overall+Loveable characters+Fantastic voice acting and cinematics+Good sense of humor+Creative puzzles that aren't too difficult to learnCons:-It can feel like the game is holding your hand at times-A short adventure overallAbout a year after the Playstation 3 launched, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune landed down and became one of the first games to really take advantage of what the PS3 could do.  But beyond that, however, Naughty Dog has done a fantastic job creating a simple adventure game that's easy to pick up and learn and yet at the same time can provide a challenge.You play as Nate, a treasure hunter who has just uncovered to coffin of his ancestor Drake.  In the coffin, Nate finds a treasure map leading to the Lost City of Gold: Eldorado.  He's got a journalist tagging along who wants to find a good story as well as a partner named Sully.  Of course, Drake isn't the only one after the treasure.  Throughout his journey he'll not only face the perils of the ruins he discovers but also have to battle pirates.  There's nothing original about the storyline, but the characters are incredibly likeable--particularly Nate himself.  The story and dialog within the story is also incredibly well written.  As you get yourself into certain skirmishes Nate will also give his own commentary which is sometimes humorous.  That's not the only thing that's humorous.  Much of the dialog in the cutscenes is also funny.  It's a game that knows it's clever but is careful not to rub your face in its wit.  It makes a simple story all the more enjoyable.Gameplay is pretty simple to pick up on and play.  For the most part you'll be doing one of two things: Solving puzzles or participating in gun fights.  When it comes to the games puzzles, most of them are pretty clever, but none of them are too hard.  Some puzzles, such as the jumping puzzles, can seem a little threatening, but for the most part Nate does all the jumping automatically.  All you have to be doing is facing the right direction and he usually lands a jump.  This doesn't mean you can't jump too early, but for the most part, Nate is good at grabbing on ledges.  For the most part, gameplay flows incredibly smoothly.The other aspect of gameplay is the gun fights.  Just about every gun fight plays out the same way.  You hide behind an object, you pop out and you shoot at your enemy.  You can carry two weapons with you at a time and each time you down an enemy you can have their remaining ammunition.  While it seems like ammo would be plentiful, it's not really.  Even if you manage to make every shot count your adversaries can take quite a bit of damage.  Luckily there's also melee combat involved.  None of it is hard to pick up and learn, though it's quite surprising how difficult Uncharted can be.  In fire fights where you're surrounded on all sides it can be difficult to find cover to let your health recover.  Not to mention you can run low on ammo.  And despite the melee combat, it can be hard to pull off on a single enemy when you're being shot by three others.  Despite that, when you get the hang of it and you know where to go to get cover, Uncharted can be fun.  It can feel a little repetitive at times, but with the good mix of cutscenes that don't drag on and puzzle elements, there's a good amount of variety.Likewise, you'll never find yourself in too dire need of trouble.  The game is pretty linear for the most part.  Despite all you can see in the environments, it's pretty straightforward.  Should you find yourself lost the game will point you in the right direction.  Just the same, the helpful prompts that remind you how to duck behind cover and how to shoot never stop popping up when it seems like your stuck.  It would feel like the game was holding your hand if you couldn't turn these off, but you can and you're allowed to do things yourself.  If you ever find the game being too hard or too easy, you can adjust the difficulty level on the fly.The strongest aspect of Uncharted is without a doubt the game's stellar production values.  It's quite possibly the best looking PS3 out there.  The detail put into the world you're in is incredible.  There's eagle eye attention to detail.  When Nate goes into water and emerges, for example, the water is actually dripping off his clothes and they look damp and he'll slowly dry off.  Not to mention that the lighting effects are fantastic as well.  There can be slight dips in frame rate, but you may not actually notice them.  The music is also fantastic as it fits the adventure well.  Better than the music, however, is the voice cast.  Every voice suits each character well but they also put a lot of good emotion into it and inject the right tone when it's called for.  The production values are one of the reasons to at least check the game out.While there will without a doubt be some who find the gunplay repetitive, at least the other elements keep the game afloat.  If there was anything wrong with Drake's Fortune, it would be that the game is pretty short.  Aside from that, it's a game that's worth checking out if you're into the Adventure genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2009"}

After finishing the game and unlocking >80% of the secret emails, here is what I thought of it.PROS.ACROBATIC ABILITIES: Like in Prince of Persia games, this is one of my favorite aspect of this game. Climbing buildings, jumping from roof to roof, taking leap of faith etc. can be real fun.OPEN WORLD: I truly like open world games. Between three major cities, there are plenty of open world exploration you can do. My favorite part was to get on top of tall buildings and just admire the beauty of the well designed cities.TOOLS FOR ASSASSINATION: As the title of the game implies, it is about assassinating targeted individual and to do so, they give you some pretty good weapons. My favorites are hidden blades. Loved taking down enemies with them.STORY: Have to say, the game has somewhat confusing, but never the less decent story. Can't tell you much without spoiling it.CONS.EXTREMELY REDUNDANT MISSIONS: I was expecting they will challenge you with variety of assassination mission, however, most of them are exactly the same. Unfortunate part is they are also very easy. So the first few assassinations were fun; however, after that I was bored to death killing the targets same way over and over again. And difficulty only increases slightly from initial missions to later missions.EXTREMELY REDUNDANT CHORES: In order to get your mission,  you have to do some chores. These chores are EXACTLY THE SAME IN ALL CITIES. By the time you finish the game, you will hate them.ANNOYING CHORES: Some chores involve annoying task like collecting the flags. HATE IT, ABSOLUTELY HATE IT.LIMITED VARIETY IN WEAPONS AND UPGRADES: They have few different weapons and upgrades for these weapons, but I was expecting more. Much more.LIMITED VARIETY IN ENEMIES: There are very few different types of enemies in the game. Again, I was expecting a lot more.ANNOYING CHASES: So after you assassinate someone, you get chased by the guards, very understandable. If you get caught in public doing something stupid, you get chased, acceptable. Initially, all of these didn't bother me, but as the game get more and more redundant, these chases started to annoy me more and more. What was fun before, became torture now.WATER = INSTANT DEATH: What the...?? You are master of so many different weapons and skills, but you can't swim!!!! This would not be a problem if some missions and assassination required travel over the water.To me, Cons easily outweighed the Pros and what was supposed to be an enjoyable experience, turned out to be a great punishment. SO I REGRETTED GETTING THIS GAME.Now while it falls the scope of this discussion, Assassins Creed 2 is a completely different story and a great game.

This demon form features new visual effects and allows Dante to destroy enemies with one smashing blow.","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"A step back :(","reviewText":"For those who don't know Devil May Cry 1 pretty much created the heck & slash genre and is undoubtedly one of the best games ever created. With that in mind I had high hope for the sequel. Unfortunately, Hideki Kamiya, the brilliant mind behind the Devil May Cry geme, leaves Capcom and Devil May Cry 2 is developed by a completely different developer, Never the less, at from the trailers, the game looked great and I at least had to give it a shot. And so I did.Pros.Heck & Slash: Just like first DMC, it has heck and slash action new combat moves and what not.2 Disc story; Unlike the first game, you can not only play as Dante, but also as a female side character. While some levels are same for these two characters, most of the levels are different. So you will have a pretty long story with different enemies and bosses. Both character get different FINAL BOSS, which to me was the best part of this game.Unique character designs; I truly like how they made demonic forms of Dante and the side character change slightly depending on what powers you decide to use. Other than that some enemies are very well designed.Cons.Boring Action: You get very limited amount of weapons unlike the first game and they are pretty boring weapons. For example, Dante only get three different types of swords and they are only different in terms of range and power. If you played the first game, you would realize that each weapon awarded in the game has different ability, powers and moves linked to the weapon and all and all they were a lot more fun to use.Boring and Redundant enemies; Yup. The game is long, but different enemies in the game don't require different tactics to defeat. You can pretty much get through the whole game by button mashing. If you played the first game you know DMC is not a game you can get through button mashing. It forced you to try different tactics and hone your skills before you take on new enemies and bosses. Plus, enemies and bosses were a lot more interesting in the first game to begin with. So they were a major disappointment in this game.Whiny and confusing story: It seemed the story was more focused on the side character than Dante. It was rather tasteless and unintersting.Zero replay value: What I liked in the first game is once you finish the game, you are encourage to finish it again and again on challenging modes because it is so much fun. This game was so boring that once I finished the Dantes and side characters story, I was pretty much done with it and never wanted to play it again.Conclusion; DMC1, DMC3 and DMC4 are great game, but to me DMC2 was worth nothing more than a rental. I highly recommend all the DMC games other than DMC2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"The Witcher II - RPG Excellence","reviewText":"I really enjoyed The Witcher, but it had some rough edges that were sometimes a bit of a nuisance, but The Witcher II does away with the first game's issues, expands upon nearly everything, and delivers what is easily one of the best role-playing experiences of recent times. Every other RPG developer should take note of the successes by CD Projekt Red with The Witcher II.Positives:- Excellent Story, Well Realized Characters - While other role-playing games can often suffer due to being developed on lower budgets, The Witcher II is a grand title with stellar production values. The story is well-told and keeps the player involved. The characters are well voiced, interesting, and just well done all around. This is a story for more mature players. CD Projekt Red didn't pull any punches with this one.- Gorgeous Art Direction, Stunning Technical Graphics - The Witcher II is no doubt a showpiece for the Xbox 360. Not only is the the art among the best, but it's technically a masterful experience in terms of graphics. The graphics are detailed, including nicely rendered characters and environments, well done texture detail, stunning lighting, and it goes on and on. And like I said earlier, the art is absolutely wonderful and only lends to the beauty of this title. The world of The Witcher II feels like a living and breathing place packed with detail. Just make sure to install both discs to the Xbox 360's hard drive to get the best performance.- Hardly Any Recycled Assets - The Witcher II doesn't use many recycled assets in the game world. There is a lot of variety to the texture work, NPC models, environments, etc. This world must've taken a long time to fully realize, as it's a thing of beauty and doesn't wear out its welcome.- Wonderful Gameplay - Different from The Witcher, The Witcher II goes for more simplistic gameplay, which it definitely succeeds at. Gone are the mouse-clicks in favor of a more 1:1 combat system that keeps you in the fight in a more natural way. You have weak attacks, strong attacks, and you also have an evasive roll mechanic that allows you to dodge out of harm's way. In addition to the melee combat, you have Signs, which is also known as the magic attacks. The combat menu is slick and works well. The overall UI is just so well done in The Witcher II. Leveling up has been made simpler with 3 areas for upgrades: Signs, Alchemy and Swordplay.- Top Notch Packaging - Within every copy of The Witcher II: Enhanced Edition, you'll receive the game (2 discs), the official soundtrack via disc, a double-sided map, an in-depth manual, and a quest guide all together in a cardboard slipcover.Negatives:- The Witcher II still has some rough edges, but the edges are getting closer and closer to straight as an arrow. This feels like a top notch production from a AAA studio, so even its flaws are very minor.The Witcher II is a compelling and rewarding role-playing adventure that'll immerse you in a grand world, with delightful characters and an overarching story. If you're searching for a role-playing game that is of high quality, you need not look any further, The Witcher II is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

It is similar to many actual eye-training exercises used by optometrists.Set up much like the Brain Age series, each player creates a profile. There are daily activities you perform to improve your skills, and then you do a series of tests to determine your \"eye age\". Your aim is to hit 20 years old, representing a young, healthy pair of eyes.The tests cover a range of eye activities. There is the peripheral vision test, where you focus on a central spot but have to see the items around that. There are quick moving tests where you have to track a fast-moving object and remember where it ends up. There are reflex type activities where you stylus-click on objects, hit a moving baseball, swat at a ping pong ball. The more activities you work through, the more training session styles you unlock.I definitely see the value of these activities, and like that it tracks your progress over time. However, I have the same complaint with this game as I do with Brain Age - and you would think that by now they would have fixed these issues.First, the \"discussion\" involved with each game is maddeningly repetitive and annoying. You have to page through every single prompt. Surely by now they should have a \"discussion off\" option in the options menu!Next, when they kick you up to hard, you don't get any credit in the tracking system. So if you go from easy games to hard games, and don't do 100% on the hard games, they berate you for being less good even though you are now MORE good, i.e. beating harder tests. If the point of the game is to improve your skill and to be tracked in that improvement, they should track it properly.Finally, I am all for concentrating on the main task at hand, but some of the graphics here really could use a designer's touch. Remember, this is a VISION game!! The whole point is how things look! I think about how gorgeous Plankton looked, and that game was a very simple game. Just a basic overhaul like that could move this game from looking like it was made by 3rd graders to making it a game that's a true visual feast. They just didn't bother.Well recommended for its practical eye enhancement features - but I really hope someday that a person with a clue about game design takes over the Brain Age group and overhauls these games with some basic but much needed upgrades.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2008"}

If you haven't, the control stick (left) determines direction of the car, A is Handbrake, and the triggers left and right brake and accelerate respectively. It's straightforward and easy to use.Technical:When speaking on the technical aspects of the engine used to make this game, I have to admit this is one of the most STABLE games I've played, Literally ZERO framerate drops, no clipping,In addition, the Complete Forza Physics engine returns, the cars don't feel any different, the assists, like before can be tweaked. With all of them on, the game becomes very accessible, but when all of them are off, the game becomes hard, especially when racing very high powered machines. This game makes no compromises, its arcade on paper, but it's quite sim when you sit down and ask it to be.Menus:I can REALLY tell codemasters exercised their hands here. The menu feels like Grid, Dirt, and all of their other 4 lettered awesome racing games. The menus even so are coherent, deliberate, and very detailed and immersive. (It's odd how a race event becomes a bit more interesting when there is a sweet looking card thingie showing you the event.) The one gripe I have though is that the menu CAN be cumbersome, and I don't like how it has to load a car fully before you can buy it, but all in all, it's a minor whine, and even so, the menu looks and controls great.Cars:Overall, Forza Horizon Brings MUCH less cars to the table than Forza 4 does, but many of the cars in Forza 4 are recent saloons or hatches that aren't rare or impressive, the list brought here contains primarily the best of the best, and is a very refined list for manufacturers. For instance, the Dino for Ferrari does not make an appearance, but the GTO does, the Civic Makes ONE appearance, the Golf though, the Iconic Hot Hatch has multiple appearances. Still, many cars that MAY be your favorites don't appear, but even so, many excellent and Iconic cars do, and I'm SURE more are on the way as DLC. Still, the game is huge and well detailed, and even THIS many cars is a lot, you shouldn't get bored of them and you should have at least one or two favorites available to you.The Festival:To put this easily, the game begins at the start of the Horizon Festival, a Big event at the Core of the world this takes place in, very much so based on the Roads of Colorado in the United States. The festival is a celebration of music, cars and drivers and as such has normal and special events that occur over the course of the game based on your progression. As you continue racing, you'll earn more \"wristbands\" the corresponding color signifying your \"rank\" in the festival. People with a green Wristband have more privileges and can access more races in the festival than Yellow wristband holders do. To earn wristbands, you have to race in the festival events, based on your position, you'll earn more points and work towards the new wristband faster or slower depending on your placing. It's not the most riveting system, but I pushes you along. Obviously as you progress, races get more involved and the stakes get higher, and the ultimate goal is to Knock Darius off his high horse and become the new champion of the festival.The WorldThe world contains a lot of stuff besides the festival, Barn finds which net you old cars for free, but you have to find them, 200+ Discoverable roads to drive on, Racers all over the place to find and challenge. Special Horizon Festival waypoints which have 3 events a piece and can upgrade your car, or be fast travelled to. The world also has 100 breakable upgrade signs, each dropping upgrade costs by 1% for each you find and take out, Colorado also has a fully integrated day and night cycle, with nighttime having illegal street racing to participate in, speed traps for stretches of road and cameras for high speed snapshots for leaderboards,  and Finally, the game has Street Cred, an indefinitely increasable skill point counter that keeps track of just about all the stuff you do, from sideswiping signs, breaking benches and fences, to just barely dodging traffic. Doing this earns you points to reduce your popularity rating from 250 (nobody on the subway) to 1 (the most popular guy in town) and also unlocks challenges which when completed earn you credits, and as you progress up the ranks you get to participate in more and more ridiculous invite only events such as racing planes or helicopters. In short, there is a LOT to do.What's the Same?Well, the driving physics is yanked right out of Forza 4, and its implemented perfectly, rollover returns and the full customization options that forza 4 gave return as well, from swaps to body kits, its all there. Damage is on permanent cosmetic though, which drops a bit of realism for the series, but in a game like this, it's almost necessary to scrap this. Still, it'd have been nice. The driving cockpit is also back; all cars have a full cockpit view. The biggest omission though is tuning, no cars are tweak-able, not even tire pressure. It's a big omission and I'm unsure yet how much of a change this will have in multiplayer.Can I play with other people?Yes, yes you can, though the interface is clunkier than it should be, and you can't go there from the Horizon in game menu and instead the title menu, the online matchmaking works, is fun and its exceptionally well balanced between funky casual stuff to do like infection and actual competitive racing.So how's the game look?The game is exceptionally pretty, with MILES of digital road; gorgeous lighting and super well detailed effects, cars, and feeling of speed. Forza Horizon is a great looking game. Not only that but its SMOOTH, no drops in frame rate at all even as Bugatti Veyron and SS Aero Speeds. I urge you, try the demo to see how it looks. It's exceptional.SummaryAll in all, Forza Horizon is an exceptional Racing game that set out to deliver the Forza Driving experience, an Authentic feeling drive, with the virtual reality of being able to go anywhere you want however you want with no consequences. All the while give players the chance to drive their dream cars however they want, the ability to customize and drive them however they wish, and a comprehensive set of events and challenges that are entertaining. It also give you plenty to do, exploration, challenging your friends on and off the track, and In odd, addictive events. It offers the accessibility of an Arcade racer, with the challenge and feel of a Simulator. Not only that but It does all of that at a steady, great, non-dipping Frame rate with excellent visuals,  and though the story is a bit lackluster and the main opponents mostly punk-ish. The game is very solid at what it sets out to do which is create a fun, open world for racers and car lovers to explore and enjoy.The Edition:The Special Edition includes more cars, the typical Forza VIP pass and a few more uh... Cars, To be honest, except for the tin and that Topless Aventador (HAPPY FAIC!), there's not much to really justify the purchase. Still it's a great game and the metal tin looks really nice.It's truly an excellent title. Playground games did an excellent job with this game, lets hope they stick around.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2012"}

Players will be able to adventure by themselves, on the couch with friends, or online in a fully multiplayer experience.View largerView largerView largerView largerLucas MontbarronLucas Montbarron is the son of the former Grand Master of the Legion. He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life. In the old stories, archons were spirits of fire, who served the long-lost creator gods. But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.KatarinaKatarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch. Her mother's people are nomads and wanderers, skilled in both warfare and magic, Katarina has been trained in their ways. At long range, she fights with ensorcelled bullets and deadly curses. When foes get close, they fare no better, as they come face-to-muzzle with her pistol and her shotgun &ndash; or perhaps the jaws of her faithful black hound. Katarina is mischievous and unpredictable, but she is also devoted to the Legion's cause...ReinhartReinhart descended from a great line of Legion mages, but he spent most of his life in Stonebridge, studying magic at the Collegium. As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes. Or he can use Entropic magic to warp time and space, destroying large numbers of enemies from afar. Reinhart is known for his unconventional thinking and innovative magical techniques...and for his eccentricity, too.","reviewerName":"Pavel Bass \"Jim\"","summary":"Solid game, co-op highly recommended","reviewText":"I bought this game when it went on sale, and I don't regret it.There is a decent level of polish to this game, not quite AAA status, but enough to keep it out of the bargain bin. The menu system and skill level-ups aren't necessarily explained the clearest, as you have you skills and your powers which are character specific.After playing solo for a few hours I noticed how heavily this game relies on co-op to provide the full experience. Many of the skills that can be upgraded benefit the team as a whole and don't have much usefulness in a solo game (party buffs, group heals, etc).This game has a very linear approach, the only divergences seem to be if you want to backtrack in order to pick up an extra quest (keep in mind I'm not past Act 1, though I have no indication that this will be different later in the game). The camera is a slight issue, but there are different levels of zoom to fit the circumstances so there is some leeway.Now- is it fun? Your mileage may vary, the loot system is good, not great. It's not always apparent if you've picked up something better than what you're using, so be prepared to sift through the menus a bit. Combat is pretty quick, with no pause function like you might see with a game like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but it's not a critical misstep. I'm not sure if I would suggest this to somebody who is playing by themselves, but at the price that this game is at now, it would be worth picking up a few copies and play through as a group.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

Don't believe any reviews lower than 4. Basically anything given here in Amazon 3 stars and down for GOW3 is straight up nitpicking at anything to sour an awesome game experience. I know its your own opinions, but when I hear someone low star review because... oh so much blood?? oh the camera is fixed?? oh is a button smasher?? If you didnt know this before picking up the game, then is your own fault. GOW has blood, and a lot of it, ripping apart your oponent and smashing them against walls are the way you get ahead. Hence the M for mature rating.. The camera is fixed in the most theatrical way possible, for me surpases the previous games. It is more than just a button smasher hack and slash game, you have puzzles to solve, places or bosses to climb... You also level up your weapons at a right pace. Huge..... I mean HUGE!!!!! Boss fights!! Id say all of the boss fights are EPIC! The graphics are definitely on par if not surpasses Uncharted 2 graphics no less. Music fits the game perfect. You have to play GOW 1 & 2 to apreciate the story a bit better. But even if you didnt play the previous God of War games, it can still be understood for the most part. GOW3 for me its the best one in the series, more blood, more action, bigger boss fights and eyecandy graphics. This is definitely the reason to get a PS3 if you haven't already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}

So I wasn't holding out very high hopes for the sequel. So you can imagine my stunned surprise when I found out that Age of Empires 2 (AOE2) was a  surprisingly good game.The biggest improvement in the game was the user  interface. I think AOE2 has the most advanced user interface ever  introduced in a real-time strategy game. It makes it extremely easy to  control the formation and behaviour of your troops, and queing units is a  snap.The second strength is the AI, which (along with Dark Reign) is the  most complex in any game to-date. The AI will respond to attacks on its own  bases, and it will send large strike forces against your armies.However, AOE2's greatest weakness is its lack of a cohesive  single-player campaign. Instead of a series of missions linked with a  cohesive storyline, you have several separate campaigns, each centering  around a different empire. So the missions are more like skirmishes than  really cohesive campaigns. Regrettably, Starcraft is still the king when it  comes to single-player campaigns.For the above stated reason, I must  remove one star. Other than that, AOE2 is a game every discerning computer  strategy gamer should have on their PC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2000"}

Gameplay itself has changed very little from F2, and can get repetitive after awhile especially in Campaign mode.Level design is solid, but weapons remain pretty much the same as F2. The save system is ok but flawed; the autosave works in relatively short timeframes which is good, but if you are stuck then you need to restart the entire level. Example: I needed EMP grenades to take out a boss at the end of one level, but I had none left from a previous fight. I reloaded the save file and the level did not provide me with any EMP grenades. My only option is the replay the entire level, which I absolultely hate. I am taking a break from the game and may not go back.I'm not a multiplayer fan generally so I didn't try this mode. Based on Campaign mode alone, I will have to rate this a 3 out of 5. Worth a try but don't expect too much.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"The time for War is over, now prepare for Death","reviewText":"This is a game I was eagerly waiting on for quite some time after beating the first game. Now that I've beaten it, I can definitely say it was almost everything I had hoped it would be. This sequel actually takes place during the 100 year \"intermission\" of the first Darksiders where War is imprisoned by the Charred Council after he (allegedly) kick-started the Apocalypse too early, which caused all hell to literally break loose on Earth, completely obliterating the human race and turning the world into a demonic paradise. War's elder brother, Death, rightly believes his younger brother to be innocent. The game opens with Death journeying to the lair of the mysterious being known as the Crowfather, with the hopes of finding out from him how to restore the human race and effectively erase War's (alleged) crime. This opening mission serves as a tutorial, where we immediately see some of the game's improvements over its predecessor. First off, Death already has full access to his own trusted steed, Despair, while War didn't get his horse back until just past the first game's halfway point. Death also has his guiding crow, Dust, flying nearby him at all times to show him where he needs to go. When fighting enemies, Death moves and dodges much more fluidly than his younger brother before him, and although he can't block enemy attacks, he doesn't really need to. After facing off against several standard grunts and a rather large sub-boss, Death meets up with the Crowfather and things kind of go south for the Horseman. An interesting battle ensues (the details of which I won't spoil) and the Crowfather ends up dead, while Death is injured and accidentally transported to the heavily Lord of the Rings-inspired domain of the Forge Lands, the homeworld of the Makers (the race that Ulthane is part of).Death is then told where he must go to continue his journey to exonerate his brother by an old and wise Maker, so he sets off on his adventure. He will visit 4 different worlds of varying size ranging from decaying dead kingdoms, bright and shining heavenly cities, and hellish realms of fire and brimstone, each with their own collections of dungeons, enemies, missions, etc. The gameplay is very much like the kind experienced in the first game, with the combat being very similar to that in God of War, as well as the dungeon exploration and large environments of the Legend of Zelda series. A new addition to the formula is improved platforming and environmental traversal reminiscent of the more recent Prince of Persia games. Death can wall run, climb on posts and wooden beams, and jump back and forth between adjacent walls to get to normally out of reach areas. Even the deadly substance known as Corruption is practically yanked out of the 2008 Prince of Persia game and given a somewhat different role and purpose in the story for Darksiders II. As if that wasn't enough of an homage, Death can save himself from falls by transforming into his Reaper Form and dashing himself back to the nearest stable ground (although these falls still count as \"environmental deaths\").One big improvement this game has over its predecessor are its much more in-depth RPG elements. Death has access to hundreds of different weapons to carve up his enemies with. His primary weapons are, of course, scythes, which he uses to great effect. His secondary weapons fall into two main categories: larger, two-handed weapons (hammers, maces, and glaives) and gloved weapons (gauntlets, bucklers, and claws). There are hundreds of variations to these weapons, with many of them offering certain advantages like elemental damage, draining health and wrath (magic) from enemies, and increased chances of landing critical strikes. Certain \"possessed\" weapons can be upgraded by feeding/sacrificing other unneeded weapons and armor to them to further increase their effectiveness. Many different types of armor and talismans can be equipped by Death with their own advantages in increasing his strength, defense, health, wrath, resistance to magic, etc. All these things can be found as loot drops from defeated enemies, in chests littering the environment, or purchased from several different merchants using the form of currency called gilt. More advanced combat moves tied to Death's many weapons can also be purchased from certain merchants. In addition, Death gains newer abilities and sub-weapons as the game progresses: the powerful Redemption revolver, the Deathgrip, which allows him to grab distant grapple points and enemies, his own version of the Voidwalker (which later on gets an upgrade that involves time manipulation), and Soul Splitter, which basically allows Death to be in two places at once. Many of the game's more challenging and interesting puzzles revolve around using these new abilities to advance or find hidden items.But wait, there's more. As Death levels up, he can distribute a point towards a multitude of additional abilities that are accessible in a new skill tree. The Harbinger portion of the skill tree is dedicated to special abilities tied to Death's scythe attacks, such as performing a teleport slash on distant enemies or temporarily increasing his physical attack power. The Necromancer portion of the skill tree focuses on Death's magic attacks, which include the ability to summon ghouls or a flock of crows to attack his enemies for him, or surrounding himself with a magic shield to temporarily increase his defense. More abilities can be unlocked or upgraded as Death continues to level up. Then there's Death's Reaper Form, which more closely resembles his more familiar Grim Reaper incarnation where he is decked out in a cloak and hood and wields an extra large scythe. Functioning very much like War's Chaos Form in the first game, Death can temporarily transform into this state after filling up his Reaper meter and devastate any nearby enemies. All these different abilities and sub-weapons can be accessed through a weapon wheel which pauses the action or mapped to specific button combinations for immediate use.Unlike the first game, Darksiders II boasts a hefty number of side missions which can be completed at your leisure alongside the main mission. These include hunting down specific enemies and hidden collectibles, as well as visiting optional dungeons and normally encountering optional boss battles in the process. Due to the much less linear design of this game, it's very possible to get to one of these optional dungeons a little too early, only to encounter an obstacle that can only be bypassed after acquiring a specific ability (such as the Voidwalker or Soul Splitter) or even run into enemies and bosses who are at higher levels than Death. I once found myself nearly getting killed by unusually strong regular enemies in a particular optional dungeon, so I left the dungeon for the time being. When I returned after leveling up a couple of times, I was able to slaughter those same tough enemies more easily, as well as the boss who awaited at the end of the dungeon. I liked this new non-linear approach to gameplay, it gave the game a more organic and adventurous feel to it. However, with regards to the many hidden collectibles to be found in this game, some of them were quite the chore to locate. Most can easily be found just with a little effort, but a fair number are VERY well hidden, to the point where a couple of them are literally invisible. I had an easier time finding Riddler trophies in the Batman games, let's just leave it at that. The ability to fast travel between discovered locations greatly helps to minimize the already time consuming process of finding collectibles and completing other missions.The many different enemies Death faces include Corrupted constructs, undead warriors, Corrupted angels, demons, and other freaks of nature. A fair number of them offer greater challenges than the noticeably easier enemies in the first game, although almost none of them reach the level of incredibly frustrating (except one particular optional boss). On the flip side, most of the enemies and bosses in this game are typically beaten simply by dodging their attacks and then striking back when they're exposed. The more puzzle-based types of bosses from the first game are noticeably lacking in Darksiders II, with only a few notable exceptions. So, while Darksiders II is an improvement over the first Darksiders in most areas, it is lacking in other aspects, aside from the less puzzle-based enemies. The optional arena battle known as the Crucible has Death face wave after wave of increasingly tough enemies. Most gamers will find themselves more than sufficiently challenged by this addition to the Darksiders games. I myself found it to be a lot of fun, as well as occasionally super difficult. Unfortunately, the final rounds of the Crucible can only be accessed after Death has reached a high enough level, which in turn can only be done by starting the game a second time in New Game +. As much as I love videogames, I've never really been one to go the New Game + route and play a game twice in a row. Simply too redundant. I know this isn't an issue with most gamers, but I for one was a little disappointed that I couldn't complete the Crucible in just one playthrough of this game. Forcing someone to play the game twice in order to complete everything it has to offer was not the right way to go in my opinion. I'm just glad these optional arena battles don't affect the game's story.Speaking of which, the story for this game is simply not as interesting or cinematically grasping as the one that came before it, although it's certainly not bad either. For one thing, Death himself is not all that different from his younger brother War, aside from being somewhat more humorous in a snide way. The two of them share a very similar sense of honor and duty, although that's not really a bad thing. They're both cool characters by their own rights. Also, while the cast of characters in this game is much larger compared to that of the first, most of the characters Death speaks to normally just provide him with a list of chores and favors for him to do in exchange for them helping him complete his journey. Amusingly, Death himself makes a comment early in the game about how he seems to be doing all the work while everyone else just stands around. The pacing of the missions is also rather drawn out. Between the many fetch quests and favors Death undertakes in both the main and side missions, I actually forgot once or twice exactly what the purpose of Death's journey was. Still, a fair number of the missions Death goes on provide some genuinely fun and addicting gameplay moments. One particular mission where Death uses an angelic cannon to shoot his way through swarms of undead creatures and demons in the destroyed, rain soaked streets of Earth is definitely one of this game's high points. Unfortunately, the story simply never reaches the same level of epic satisfaction achieved towards the later moments of the first game. Even the ending for this game was disappointingly abrupt and rather unsatisfying in how it ties in with the first game's ending. This is further compounded by the fact that the final boss battle was one of the easiest battles in the entire game. However, the extra scene after the end credits hints at a possibly (and hopefully) more epic true sequel that shows what will happen further down the line with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Despite the somewhat weaker story, Darksiders II is a great improvement over the first game in terms of providing larger environments, more challenging enemies and puzzles, and just more addicting and fun gameplay overall. Don't miss out on this game, especially if you enjoyed the first one.**Update**This next part is dedicated to the 3 DLCs for Darksiders II: Argul's Tomb, The Abyssal Forge, and The Demon Lord Belial. I'll get right to the point here: those hoping for something new or different in these DLCs will be sorely disappointed since all three DLCs have the same exact type of gameplay present in the main game of Darksiders II with regards to combat and puzzles. There are some new weapons and armor for Death to use, but that's it; everything else remains the same. However, this may not be such a bad thing for those gamers who greatly enjoyed playing the main game since the DLCs all offer the same addicting combat and a fair number of challenging puzzles. Having said that, I must warn those of you who have still not played these DLCs: freezing issues are a SERIOUS PROBLEM. Argul's Tomb runs fine, but The Abyssal Forge and The Demon Lord Belial are basically broken. Apparently, the games freeze at certain moments when performing autosaves or even if you do a manual save. After checking for more info online on how to fix this problem, I was able to bypass these freezing issues (to a certain degree) by emptying Death's inventory of weapons and armor to the point where he only has one set of scythes, one secondary weapon, and one full set of armor left. Having to get rid of so many cool weapons just to progress in these games was truly annoying, to say the least.However, despite dwindling Death's collection of weapons down to almost nothing, The Demon Lord Belial still freezes on me and I was unable to complete it, so now I am forced to see the ending on Youtube. The best word to describe this nonsense: \"infuriating.\" We gamers should not have to put up with these kinds of issues in games that we paid good money for. THQ and Vigil really dropped the ball on this one. So, in short, these 3 DLCs aren't what most of us would consider as \"must owns\", but they're still fun for fans of the series. However, due to the freezing issues, I strongly suggest that all gamers stay clear of The Abyssal Forge and The Demon Lord Belial until a patch is released.......IF a patch is ever released. If you're one of those fans who live and breathe for Darksiders and simply MUST play these DLCs, then stick to playing Argul's Tomb, which is the only DLC that is free of freezing issues, plus it's also noticeably longer than the other two broken games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2012"}

It's an early attempt at a not quite linear game with lots of people and traffic on the street.  It sort of works.The cut scenes are nice and they tossed in a little eye candy at times.  They were the compelling reason to finish the game.  The gameplay itself is pretty solid letting you drive, use a hover board, or fight on foot.  Overall the gameplay is quite a bit of fun.  The bosses are inspired and truly a lot of fun to figure out and beat.  They also manage to throw in a few different activities here and there that keep things interesting.However, the game has some significant problems.  One is your aim.  Jak often cannot lock onto the target you want to shoot making things much more frustrating than they need to be and wasting ammo.  On the plus side I suppose, the enemies have equally bad targeting so at least that feels a little more fair.  Another issue is when you're about to complete an objective and some random driver, literally driving in circles decides to plow into you and end it.Large portions of the game feel more like mini-game time trials (some literally are) than a cohesive game.  You'll be set up to fail in a few of them, until you learn the patterns.  The problem is, there are very few checkpoints at times and you'll be playing the same annoying thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over...you're not done yet, and over, and over, and over again until you want to put your controller through your screen.I mostly liked it, but I can't see myself ever being able to play it again.  It's just too much repetition and too frustrating, despite having some really great elements the controls are just sloppy, especially the aiming mechanic.  Really hard for me to recommend this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"The Top 10 Most Obvious (and unusual) Problems With This Ambitious Game","reviewText":"UPDATE: 12/18/2013In response to the \"Ultimate Edition\" being out, I have to say I'm a bit shocked that people are saying the original is no longer worth it. The reason I say that is because I re-purchased this game for $19.99 almost the same time the UE came out, and the UE was full-retail. I later saw it again for $14.99. But others don't seem to have had the same experience. Unless people aren't really looking at the prime sites to buy games (GameFly likes to get rid of their excess stock of older titles, so they tend to drop their prices first. I re-purchased the game for $19.99 from them, and later picked up the Vita edition, for the simple reason that I like playing games on the vastly-improved Vita console.)The score remains three stars, as the game is now absurdly newb-unfriendly. It's as if everyone's a pro who's still online. 40%+ combos are extremely commonplace, and the top-tiers are still top-tier. That's disappointing, as I never wanted Injustice to be such a combo-fest to scare away new players (or, in my case, returning players who aren't used to the new emphasis on combos), but that's what it is. Some balance issues were fixed, many weren't. Priority still feels weird, and the close-up game is very difficult to break up, making the game even more offensive than before. Many players simply hang back, wait for the other player to attack, and then attack once they come in range. This is basically how you win now, which isn't really fun for me.In the end, this is by no means a technical fighter. It's a strange mix that turns out to be a 2.5D combo-based fighter. Newb-friendliness was always diminishing, but now it's worse than ever. I just don't like that, and the balance changes they made, while significant, aren't enough to change the overall oddness of the game mechanics. It never seems to come together properly. But this is an older game now that, in my opinion, never quite reached greatness. NetherRealm appears to have all but abandoned it, as well.I just can't recommend this title if you want to play online. If you've got some local versus buddies, cool. If you don't mind playing with all the Battle modes, that's cool, too. But I'd go as far to say online is broken, with characters that are too strong, combos that are too effective, hitboxes that make little sense, and all those little things, like Harley's hammer *still* constantly going over the heads of players, and the low priority of throws making them almost entirely useless. Clashes, too, still don't seem right, as there is no real \"gambling\" involved, since whatever the other player bets is offset by whatever you bet. In other words, it's still the case that, if you bet your entire meter and they bet one bar fewer, you're not going to really get anywhere. IMO, the Clashes could have worked if it were a winner-take-all, last-ditch attempt at coming back (after all, you had to be in the middle of being stuck in a combo to activate it at all). This simple fact that it doesn't really matter what you bet, because you already know what the other person's going to hit, anyway (depending on their life bar), makes Clashes still pointless. Cool, but pointless.I think this was best illustrated when I was playing Bane against a Grundy player. Details aside, I used all three Acid charges and triggered my Super. It was stopped by one meter burn on Grundy's special grab, and my triple-Acid Super was completely stopped in its tracks. Not cool.That's the end of this update. This game's ideas, as cool as they were, were never properly implemented into a cohesive whole. I still can't really recommend it, especially not the Ultimate Edition.---And here are the top 10 problems that keep this game from being what it really should be.10: Over-emphasis on poor DLC as of this moment. There's not much that needs to be said about this one. Lobo was OK, even if he had one single costume. I can deal with that. But then we got Batgirl. Batgirl? Huh? We have enough Batman characters and villains to fill about half the character roster, and who the hell cares about Batgirl? What about someone just a tiny bit more original? I don't know much about the DC Universe, but I know there are other characters out there who could be thrown in. Don't even get me started on the rumors about the next DLC characters at $5 a pop. I won't claim to know who they'll be, but because we're talking about NetherRealm here, it's not totally inconceivable they'll throw in someone such as, say, Scorpion, or another MK character. Come on, that's just wrong. It's not like he'd have a fatality, either, so he just wouldn't work even as a bare-bones DLC character.9. Blocking. This one is really huge and takes a lot of getting used to. Normally, blocking a strong attack gives you a chance to counter-attack. That's just the way it works in almost all fighting games when someone does a strong attack. But this game actually *discourages* blocking, instead strongly encouraging both players to go on full offense. How does it manage that? By a stagger effect that applies to everyone who chooses to block an attack. This is highly unusual for fighters, and is difficult to get used to. But because of the very problematic stagger effect when you block, blocking is practically useless in almost all cases.8. Odd damage system and scaling. At first, it seems simple enough: Every character has the very easy combo-starter that is the X button, plus either forward or backward. This is a good thing, since you can either hit mid or overhead, depending on which button you press. Even better, if you use up a bar of meter, you gain significant armor during it, so any attacking opponent in the middle of their attack will be hit by it. Invariably, if you connect a Strong (X) attack, you can start a combo. This is basically what discourages blocking in favor of offense, if you have a bar to spare. But there's a rather significant flaw...7: ....and that is the extremely wide difference of characters' combo-starting (and stopping) Strong moves, as well as some odd particulars with some characters that just should not be. Let's take Harley Quinn for an example. Her Strong attack has a *massive* range, and she can just ravage any opponent who does nothing but attack close-up. Unfortunately, her overhead X has the very serious problem of lifting her off the ground, which, in many cases, causes her to go *over* the head of her opponent, and miss. Because overhead attacks are key for turtle-style players, this means that you can't be right up against an opponent to perform this--in fact, you need to have a lengthy sweeping distance to make up for this aerial effect of the attack, making it very hard to connect. On the other hand, other characters have almost point-blank Strong attacks.6. Repetition. If you happened to play high-ranked Sub-Zero players in MK in its later days, you know exactly what that's like. Just as those ultra-boring I-Refuse-To-Learn-How-To-Be-Good-With-Anyone-Else Sub-Zero players abused a combo that went ignored but was absurdly easy to perform for a comically high amount of damage. This game's got many characters who suffer that in spades, with very common combos used for their ease of use and almost-universal effectiveness on any stage against any opponent.5. Supers vary extremely widely in their usability, while Clashes are poorly designed, highly underpowered considering the \"betting\" system of it, and essentially ineffective due to the health regeneration and damage caps. But as for Supers, they're useful on some characters, not so much on others. Superman, for instance, clearly has the best Super in the game, but not really because of the damage it does so much as the fact that it's practically an instant connect once used, and it is a *full-screen* attack that can be started with just a 24C standard eye-beam. Superman's straight, ground-based eye-beam causes his opponent to go aerial and fall backward...Which is more than enough time, no matter how much distance there is between the two, for Superman to connect his instant-rush toward the opponent and Super the hell out of them. Now, I understand one thing: Some characters are better at Strong attacks than others, and some characters really weren't designed to even use their Supers often (such as Harley, who really needs all her bars for armored Strongs and her particularly powerful cupcake bombs). Superman, however, is loaded with attacks that work at any range, and worse, his Strong attacks are no slouch, either. You'd think that a character with such incredibly powerful Specials and his Super would at least have a relatively easy-to-avoid Strong attack...But this is definitely not so, as the range on his strongs is very good, and also total ground-based, meaning they can't miss like Harley's.4. This one is a controversial debate, but it needs to be said for what it is: Grossly overpowered, unblockable, and unequal environment attacks. Now, I don't mind these environment attacks by themselves. They add an interesting and new idea to the game (as do the level transitions), but they feel twice as powerful as they should be. It's bad enough that these attacks are extremely difficult to avoid if your opponent gets a couple seconds to act, but they are not only unblockable, they also do *tremendous* damage--typically between 20-30% damage in *one* hit. Consider the fact that full-bar Supers usually are around 30-35%, and you can see why this can get really annoying, really fast.Now, this wouldn't be *that* bad if each player had equal access to these environment attacks. It would still be way too powerful as it is. Unfortunately, every stage has environment attacks placed seemingly randomly across every stage. You can see why this is a major problem. A player who knows how to use the environment attacks and gets a stage in which most of them are on *their* side of the stage has a tremendous advantage. Sure, the other player can simply back up a lot to prevent it, and maybe fire off a projectile or two to avoid letting them use it, but this is still clearly unfair for the player on the side of the stage with very few or no environmental attacks on their starting side, since many are immediately accessible from the starting positions, only being a jump away.3. There are a set few characters that dominate the entire online scene. Good luck against them, because they're common for a reason you really don't want to initially know about. When it comes to tier lists...you know there really shouldn't be one in the first place. Go take a look at the leaderboards and see for yourself.2. Game-breaking glitches are out there, mostly revolving around abusing aerial attacks and a character's slow-to-react stance changing from facing left or right. I obviously want to keep the ones I've seen mostly under wraps (and haven't been patched, although a few have), but I can safely say that if you get caught in one of these glitches, you're screwed no matter what. That's bad. Like, The Flash's insane superiority in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe bad.1. Extremely excessively effective of projectile moves. Their damage is high, you can spam them ad nauseam, and you get way, way too much room between each other to close the gap easily. There are extremely few anti-projectile moves, and even armored Strongs often can't get through them due to the multiple hits involved (I'm talking to you, Deathstroke, you designed-for-zoner-newbs bastard). Characters simply lack the recovery time needed between Specials for an opponent to close the gap. This is why Deathstroke is such a nightmare, and why newbs complain that he shouldn't be nerfed (because spamming projectiles is the easiest thing in the world, naturally). His attacks are bullet-based, so they have few to no traveling frames. But worst of all, he can use these so quickly, one after the other, that closing the gap becomes insanely frustrating if you're playing a character that isn't that good at closing gaps. While Deathstroke is the best example, Superman also has his eye beam Specials that can be almost as annoying for a zoner playing keep-away. Because stages are relatively wide and zoning is so effective right now, people can win by playing keep-away indefinitely, hence pissing off newbies who want to play for, you know, fun. Like games are supposed to be about, since no one cares about anyone's record.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}

Don't get me wrong, Resident Evil 4 was an excellent game in many regards but was not the scary dark survival game I had been hoping for.  DeadSpace 2 did the same thing but with a little more tweaking towards action with a little more emphasis on Cool MasterChief-esque suits which was fine with me. DeadSpace 2 still had the elements to scare and definitely still felt like a DeadSpace game.I understand that games have to change and evolve to avoid feeling stale and repetitive (Call of Duty) but I feel that this game sort of alienates players and fans who loved this series in the first place - it scared the **** out of you.DeadSpace 3 feels as though the team got developers from Lost Planet, Resident Evil 5-6, and Gears of War and slapped them into one hyper-driven game. The game is definitely fun and has a slightly different pace to it but here are some of the factors of the game broken down for ya'll before purchase. PLEASE READ and CONSIDER!Gameplay:It is still the shoot-limbs-and-hope-to-God-they-stop-coming-at-you survival horror game with slightly tweaked(literally) and classic necromorphs. This game tends to focus on the Lost Planet style HUGE bug monsters though which was not as frightening as those damned baby slashers in DS2.(Physics, Limbs)The one thing that I noticed in this game and also in Resident Evil 6 is that the physics of shooting enemies in the limbs feels very funky and not as responsive. Go play DeadSpace 1 & 2 or Resident Evil 4 and you will notice how crisp and responsive the enemies are to those shots. In Deadspace 3, you shoot at the limbs and they stand there laughing at you. It irked me but I dreaded on.(Shop)The game also has a different shop system. This is a double-edged sword to the game and needs to be analyzed more. On your first run of the game, the crafting system is a HUGE detriment which makes you focus on supplies, materials, and  item management. I LOVE stacking ammo and upgrading things to make mincemeat of the necromorphs BUT The new system sort of detracts you from the story and atmosphere and sort of offputs you from shopping with the millions of things to keep up with. The previous styles sort of simplified it and made you focus on your surrounding with minimal item management.This, HOWEVER, is also a WONDERFUL system once you beat the game or play on hardcore or different difficulties once you are more familiar and experienced. This system can be played on Hardcore where you can ONLY craft items giving you an extra dose of challenge and I think it is quite brilliant in that sense. Great idea, poorly executed...sort of.Also you get a robot that gives you free crap randomly. Meh.(Graphics)Beautiful in all three DeadSpace games. Brilliant.(Environment)I liked how they changed it up with it ranging from frost planets, dark corridors, and even a city at one point. Occasional Fighting of humans  but luckily those moments were sparse.  ENEMIES KEEP COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK. Your blood pressure stays high but not because you're scared but rather due to the thought of how you'll have to craft up that much more.(Story, Voice, Direction, etc)A little convoluted but I am personally entranced by the story and find it exhilarating to see game and story progress and come to an end. They sort of left out a lot in the beginning and a lot of inconsistencies (Ellie got her eye back wtf?) but overall I was still very interested. New comers will feel a little lost so I suggest PLAYING DEADSPACE 1 & 2, they are both EXCELLENT games and it'll definitely help you understand what the heck is going on here. Also, Issac somehow has the ability to be disturbed  and an Action hero with the occasional one liners and self composure. Voice acting is excellent but people seem fairly calm despite all the ridiculous things going on.(Co-op)THIS is where this game shines and I LOVE that only each player can see things on their screen. It is incredibly fun especially over teamchat, vent, or some method of communicating. I found this to be a very fresh and nice experience to the game. You feel a little less scared with someone crying over a mic with you.SUMMARYI think many newcomers and action lovers will have fun playing this game but if you're looking for a SURIVIVAL horror game, I'd look elsewhere. I understand that the developers wanted to keep the formula fresh and they did a pretty good job of that. I think that DeadSpace fans will love new elements about the game but I personally still miss those dark corridor days after classes. I think I will go play DeadSpace 1 & 2 before I replay this game.4****/5*****  Stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}

This thing works GREAT to secure my kinect to my television set at the top. It has a sturdy construction and an extraordinarily easy way to get it on. Basically you lower the kinect on to the mount, and then there is a large plastic wheel to turn the flat screw to go into the kinect with its' already prepared female hold for the screw to go in to. I am VERY impressed with this mount over the mount I used with the 360 kinect. Well done PDP.I was looking at the old kinect mount, and I think there are some things I might want to bring to your attention. The old mount had legs that would go literally three feet or so. I mean these things just simply got in THE WAY! Aggravating! This is no longer the case. Of course my application may be different than yours. That being said my application is a 55\" LCD tv. So it's not too thin. I would imagine that an LED would play with this mount even better, but my LCD did great.The only thing that is maybe a little disconcerting about this mount is the way that you adjust it to fit snugly on your television. It has those resistance gears, where you have to kind of push and pull the thing into place, and when it moves a gear it sounds like it has broken. That's unpleasant and scary at first, because you think you are going to break the thing. But fear not, it's just how they've designed it. I understand why they designed it this way: to make it more simple so people couldn't mess up and drop their very expensive Kinect.The difference between the new school and the old school is that the new (this one) offers a much higher point of pressure for where it puts the weight, rather htan using those long long arms to redistribute the weight throughout the entire length of your tv.I also like the cover for the camera that is provided if I choose to, you know, play checkers in the same room as the kinect!Xbox, Record that. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

Well, you'd figure wrong.  Lego Batman features everything that was enjoyable with the aforementioned games, and slaps the Batman license on it to boot.  Playing as the Caped Crusader and his sidekick Robin, you traverse a Lego-fied Gotham City and take on the usual rogues gallery of baddies.  Fans of the Batman comics will be happy to see plenty of familiar faces: Joker, Nightwing, Batgirl, Hush, Bane, and plenty more are all here for your amusement.  If you've played any of the previous Lego-based games, you should already know what to expect here, as Lego Batman offers up plenty of funny and comical moments supplemented with tons of unlockables and bonus characters to boot.  The game looks good and even offers Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme, rounding out the presentation.  The only downsides to Lego Batman are the same flaws that were apparent in previous Lego games: the difficulty is simple to say the least, there isn't enough use of the Wii-specific controls, and the game isn't that long at all.  Still, with the hordes of unlockables to find that will hold your attention and keep you playing for a while.  All in all, Lego Batman is a fun and family friendly diversion that anyone can enjoy and easily pick up and play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2008"}

I didn't want to wait for Amazon to send me another game with a book so I pop the CD in my Xbox and hoped I'd be able to figure it out on my own. And I was able too, there are a lot of on screen hints to help you get through the 1st couple fights. But without the book I never did figure out how to get my men to search a room for me or destroy enemies for me as described in other reviews; I did most of the killing myself, and it took me awhile --by pushing ever button on the control pad-- to figure out how to change weapons and reload. Still despite not having an instruction booklet to help me, I was still able to finish the games in 4 nights.Things I like about the game the graphic were great like watching a movie. I didn't have to fit the bad guys over, over and over again; you know like other games --like episode III--were you die 7 or 9 times before you finally defeat the big villian and the story line keeps you hooked.Things I didn't like about the game was missing the book. And it was over too quickly. I would say it is an easy game to play, anyone can finish it even if your not a big time game player.

You can see that they could be so much better but that Lucas Arts just got lazy. Though the graphics are less than satisfactory, I quickly forgot as the gameplay is amazing.The controls are responsive and accurate and each level offers something different.In general you could say that each level is running around throwing Stormtroopers, but it really isn't. The environment is a large factor in combat, if you want to take out a guy behind a corner, you can pick up pretty much anything and take aim to get rid of him.  Some enemies resist the force, others melee. This creates a great balance of fighting style.  This balance removes the often seen style of spending half the level slashing, the other half using the Force (or magic or ranged combat).Overall, I think that people should stop whining about the graphics and actually play the game because it really is great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

I've long waited for Jak 4 on the PS3 -- but Naughty Dog just revealed that \"Last of Us\" was made instead of a Jak 4 because the team ran into trouble while attempting to design it. But as they always say \"never say never\".As for this collection, it's the next best thing. The HD visuals are definitely an upgrade to the originals on PS2 (particularly 2 & 3). Frame rate is smooth and the environments look great. I do not own a 3D television so I can't comment on that, although I have read that it is well done.If you're a fan of the series, you'll be very pleased.

{"product_name":"B000HCMR8E","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"Slide baby slide!","reviewText":"This is the oldest PS3 racing game yet it still stands as my favorite. Released during the highly controversial release of the PS3, Ridge Racer 7 was one of the very few reasons to own the once ultra expensive new hardware. Due to the relatively lukewarm sales and reception of Ridge Racer 6 on the Xbox 360 a year before the release of 7, many assets of Ridge Racer 6 have been ported over to Ridge Racer 7. Essentially widening Ridge Racer 6 to a larger audience as Ridge Racer 7 sold way more than Ridge Racer 6.The gameplay of Ridge Racer 7 (well 6 in essence) is a bit different than past Ridge Racer titles. Previous games on the PS1, PS2, and PSP had you playing catch up to your opponents. You start way behind of the race and try to overtake the completion within the 3 lap race. This essentially was done because of the hardware restrictions of the past. The older consoles couldn't render as many race cars on screen at once. A particular example is with Ridge Racer 4 on the PS1, the game was pushing the limits of the PS1 that having more than 3 cars onscreen caused the game's frame rate to dip. Thanks to the power of the HD era, Ridge Racer 7 has you starting on a tight race grid with all cars (up to 14 racers) can be on screen with very minimal effect on the frame rate. This also means the computer AI has been tweaked up to constantly follow pursuit of the first place racer throughout the race.  It's a far more dynamic racing experience especially when you put factors like nitrous and slipstreaming. To add a dose of strategy to your race, Namco has expanded the effects of nitrous on the race. You can now tweak your nitrous in various ways from the usage of its bars to how you gain it. Ideally you'll want to use your nitrous before a critical drift turn because the basic rule is that performing drifts fills up your nitrous bar. If you use up your nitrous right at the beginning of a heavy drift turn, you gain a massive amount of nitrous in return. You can also change how much of the nitrous bar you can use to empty your charge, emptying two bars or more at once will give you a faster turbo bonus than say using one bar. There are many ways to experiment with nitrous charge in RR7 and finding one that suits your racing style may be the key to victory in online races.Your cars can now be tuned up as well. You can install exterior body parts but its primarily for visual aesthetics. You can buy upgrades for your engine to increase speed and accelerations. Successfully meeting certain conditions will give you plug ins that can increase your slipstreaming or reduce speed loss from collisions. The classic three handling systems return in RR7. Three distinct driving styles are for the drifting you do in the game. The standard drift type is perfect for intermediate Ridge Racer drivers and is recommended for harder race events. The mild drift type is meant for beginners, these cars are slower than the other two types and controlling the drift is much easier to manage. Not really meant for the harder race events because of your overall slower speed. The dynamic drift type is meant for Ridge Racer veterans who want to drive an uncontrollable beast, these are the fastest cars in the game but controlling their drift is a very challenging. Not really recommended for the hardest or online races, you may have the highest speed but they are so sensitive that even the smallest turns will cause the car to drift. Fighting to regain control is often difficult with the dynamic drift type.The single player experience in Ridge Racer 7 is plentiful and long. You have the standard 13 stage Grand Prix but there are various race events on the side and hidden race events that can only be unlocked by meeting certain conditions. Some events put you at a handicap like limiting the race to only stock race models no modded parts. Of course, playing the game long enough will unlock races against the most bizarre special cars. These cars are a staple of any Ridge Racer game and they range from a floating car, to a souped up hot rod, to even a rocket ship.Ridge Racer 7 is the largest game in franchise history with 22 race courses. The 15 original courses from RR6 return with 6 brand new ones and the classic novice course from the original Ridge Racer included as a bonus. The courses are all set in a fictitious place called Ridge State. The locations are well varied ranging from a seaside resort, a high altitude mountain range and national park, a futuristic mega metropolis, airport docks of a bustling city, and even to an ancient forest with ruins. The visuals are crisp and clean and still look very good to this day thanks to their excellent design. The game runs at a silky smooth 60 frames (cut that to 30 if your playing the 3D license edition). It truly looks like a place where you'll want to live in, the game has such a very high dosage of detail its simply very impressive. The music is just as fantastic with a high caliber dance soundtrack perfect for this type of game.Ridge Racer 7 is a highly enjoyable racing game. Even though it never got trophy support I often replay this game from the very beginning. It's a very well made, well polished racer that easily is still my favorite racing game on the PS3 despite the likes of Gran Turismo 5 or Burnout Paradise or any other high ranking PS3 racer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Franz Escobar \"franzescobar\"","summary":"Honest Review of GTA IV","reviewText":"Having played this game for at least 30 hours, I feel like I can give you guys an honest review of the game. My overall impression is that, while extremely addicting and deep, there are some major flaws that greatly inhibit the flow and overall fun you could have playing this game.PROS:1) The open world. Yes, every GTA game has open-ended gameplay, but the sheer size of Liberty City is overwhelming (in a good way). Granted, you can only enter certain buildings, but the sheer size of the city and things you can do you throughout it is mind-blowing. You can go on dates, go out with your friends, go bowling, strip club, drinking, eating, the list goes on and on. The attention to detail really makes a big difference. For example, if I go on a date with Michelle and I pick her up with my motorcycle and i am wearing sunglasses, she will say \"nice bike\", and \"I like those glasses on you.\" Next time you go on a date with Michelle, if you pick her up in a car, without glasses, she will say something like: \"hey, where's your bike?\" and, \"i miss those glasses, they looked good on you.\" I mean, cmon, that attention to detail is so cool. Also, I think the developers knew that you would be repeating missions several times before you beat them. So when you repeat a mission, most of the time completely different dialogue takes place with whoever you are doing the mission with. Very, very cool!2)Graphics. I think the voice acting and cut-scenes were done very well. Could they be better? Sure. But,I think they are just fine for my taste. I'd rather have a huge map to explore and sacrifice some graphic detail then the other way around. The game definitely looks next-gen.3)The Storyline. Keeps you engaged and you find yourself trying to beat \"just one more mission\" before you go to bed at night. I think the dialogue can get a little corny in spots, but overall I found myself not skipping any cut scenes and actually enjoying them overall. They enhance the story and give you some structure to an otherwise open-ended game.4)Cover System. Now, I know other games have done it better, mainly unchartered and gears of war, but, just the implementation of a cover system has greatly enhanced the gameplay in my opinion. You can come up with a strategy on how to handle each mission and pick your way through enemies by duck and cover. Very cool.CONS1)Driving. Awful. My best friend keeps telling me I have to \"Get used to it\", but this, in my opinion, is the biggest flaw with the game. Considering how much time is actually spent driving in the game, you would think they would spend a little more time testing it. I find myself losing control of my car all the time. It becomes VERY, VERY frustrating. Especially during a mission where you either racing, trying to catch up with an enemy, and/or trying to lose your wanted level. I've come close to throwing my controller against the wall. Major flaw that makes the game very tedious in certain spots.2) Lack of checkpoints during missions. I mean, c'mon, I have to drive halfway across this huge map to pick someone up, then drive all the way back to complete the actual mission. Then, the cops are after me and I'm almost at my last destination and my car explodes? Most of the missions are very long and require A LOT of driving. You almost have to put a checkpoint in here or there, but there aren't any. Don't understand why they aren't there. This annoys me.3) Side missions/dating. Don't really see the point in doing alot of these activities. Yes, if you hang out with someone enough you unlock their special skill, but in terms of dating women, it's really pointless. Don't get me wrong, it's very cool that you have a lot of options, but if they don't really help you, why do them?4)Soundtrack. Awful. Worse than any other GTA game out there. Can't find one song I like. I'm a musician, so normally I would say that everyone has different tastes. But from reading other reviews on here, I can say that I'm not the only one that feels the soundtrack is lacking. Also, they should give you the ability to create your own soundtrack. They should have utilized the full capabilities of the PS3. They could have done a lot more.Overall, GTA IV is a must buy for PS3 owners. You will have loads of fun, minutes will slip into hours, and you will have rewarding experiences throughout the game. However, it is far from perfect and does suffer from some major flaws listed above. I recommend this item for sure, but be forewarned that you will get frustrated.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2008"}

There is nothing like playing not only Jack Bauer, but others from the series. At one point, you even play Kim Bauer. This game is full of action and puzzles, but it being written by those who do the TV series makes it even more incredible.Things that were left blank between seasons two and three, such as how Jack met Chase, are explained in the game. That is why this game would mainly only appeal to fans, like the series, there is a lot of dialogue and it may turn non-fans off if they don't like a lot of talk in their action games. But, what the characters in the story are saying is very interesting and you will be hanging on to every word if you are a fan of the series. A lot of people who were still alive by the end of season two are on this game, which just makes it all the better.The game also has it's share of puzzles that are not extremely difficult but can take some time to complete. You also have to interrogate people on some levels to get information which is probably the most tedious and frustrating part. To question people on some levels, you have to stop the marker in a blue bar, but the blue bar sometimes moves.There are also special features that include interviews with the people who voice the game, but all extras besides the season 4 trailer have to be unlocked. Overall, if you really enjoy the show and it's characters, then I would recommend this game to you. It is fun and I definitely think I'll be playing this game again. If you are not a fan of the TV show or have never seen it, then I would recommend renting to get a feel of the game. Like I said, it is a lot of talk, so it wouldn't be great for some one who wants all out action and in-game dialogue","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2006"}

No Spoilers","reviewText":"This game caught me off guard.  I had pretty much written off the GameCube as a legitimate vehicle for great RPGs after no great original titles had come out.  Yes... \"Skies of Arcadia\" is amazing, but this was a game ported from another system.  \"Tales of Symphonia\" is a GameCube exclusive in the U.S.A. for the time being.  It has a somewhat cell shaded look to the characters, but many of the environments have more of a water-color look to them.  In my opinion, the graphics look rather boring in screen shots, but in action, they can be really stunning.  Overall, I found the cell-shaded aspect of the graphics to be much more satisfying than what was exhibited in Nintendo's own \"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.\"  This is the exact reason I was hesitant to pick up this title.  I was disappointed with Zelda, so I was apprehensive when I saw the cell shaded aspect of the graphics here.  Do NOT let this be a turn-off for you.This game has got to be about the most fun I have had on the GameCube system.  I am extremely impressed with the battle system where you control a player chosen character in your party in real-time.  It makes the battles very action packed with plenty of player involvement.Sound is very good.  I was really impressed with the voice acting.  It is endearing and fits the animated character design really well.  The English localization for the game is spot on. Music is hit or miss, but the voice acting and battle sounds make up for this. I had heard that the game would make about a 700 page book, and after having played through it with most of the side quests, I can say that I have no trouble believing this through all of the spoken and written dialogue between the characters.Story?  Where to start.  I had heard the story to be cliche fantasy, but I found I was really impressed.  There are obvious nods to other fantasy oriented storys and games, but these handled in the form of homage, not blatantly ripping off. It starts out with a formulaic introduction, but the well written story quickly forges its own very interesting path.  The player becomes emotionally involved with the characters and their quest, even though some of them are in archetypal fantasy/anime roles.\"Tales of Symphonia\" is a stellar experience. Gameplay and graphics are polished and top-notch fun.  The characters and story are interesting, and the sound is engrossing.  GameCube players should not miss this, and I go out on a limb saying this... but I would say it has the polished qualities of a system seller.  My hat is off to the folks at Namco for bringing RPG starved Nintendo players an absolutely fantastic game.  One word of caution.  There are rumoured to be \"anime\" cut scenes, but doon't get your hopes up for a lot of them as there are only a few. I hope the upcoming \"Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean\" (also from Namco) is half as good.  Nintendo should take a cue from Namco on this one.  I never thought I'd say that!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B008E6ZXTA","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"The originals outshine the modern sequel","reviewText":"Take note that I am reviewing this product as a compilation package and not simply of just the Doom 3 game. I have given it 4 stars overall directly as a result of the inclusion of the original Doom games (I and II), which I happened to enjoy far more than their modern day siblings. If this game contained only Doom 3 with its two expansion packs, I would've rated it as 2 or, at the most, 3 stars.Doom 3 (plus expansion packs):I played Doom 3 on PC back when it was first released and at that time wasn't really impressed with the game. The shooting gameplay was cookie-cutter and the only thing that really attempted to set it apart from other games was the atmosphere, graphics, and lighting effects (which were first-rate at the time). Unfortunately, the atmosphere (creepy at first) wore thin after a few hours since nearly the entirety of the game takes place in a monotonous moon base with very little variation (except for a brief stint in Hell near the end). The attempted scares I felt were cheap at best (such as the usual \"hide an enemy around the corner who jumps at you RAWR\" stuff), and the lighting effects were adversely impacted severely by the horrible design decision to make it where either you have a flashlight out or a gun out, but to hell with having both out at once. Tons of fun firing at near invisible enemies in complete darkness while they take turns violating you. Frustration and scariness don't exactly go hand in hand.Present day, I'm still not impressed with Doom 3. It's still a generic shooter made even more so by the passage of time. On a positive note, the developers included a \"better late than never\" fix in that players are now allowed to hold a gun and use the flashlight at the same time, which significantly mitigates the frustration of fighting in the dark. Other than that, I personally didn't find the gameplay modified in any way, for better or worse. The save/load times are a little on the long side for a console game. The graphics are nice and shiny of course, so that today's kids will even look at the game.  I suppose it goes without saying that if you liked the original Doom 3 experience, you probably won't be disappointed with the second go-around, but if you didn't care for it, you likely won't care any more so this time. Standard remake stuff.I did realize that one of the things that sucked the life out of the shooting in Doom 3 is how the guns have absolutely no audio \"punch\" whatsoever. The standard pistol sounds like a stapler, the shotgun sounds like a metal door being slammed, and the machine gun sounds like a telegraph, just to name a few. It's hard to get into a shooter when the guns don't feel or sound like real guns. It also doesn't help how the power of the guns felt nerfed to the point that it took an excessive number of shots to take out most of the enemies. Supposedly a shotgun blast will kill anything in one shot at close range. Yeah... not really. But then again, when your shotgun sounds like a toy, should you be surprised?The inclusion of the two expansion packs (Resurrection of Evil and Lost Mission) are nice additions if you enjoyed Doom 3, but they really don't add anything new, other than a few new weapons or gimmicky powers, like expansion packs often do. In other words, if you enjoy the main game, you get 5-6 extra hours worth of playtime out of the additional campaigns for no real extra cost, but it really is just more of the same.Doom I and Doom II:In my opinion, these two games are where the meat is in the Doom experience. Are the graphics dated? Yes, very much so. How about the music and sound effects? Oh yes. But does the gameplay hold up? Absolutely. I can't remember how long it had been since I had last played these games (almost a decade and a half ago??), but I found myself pathologically addicted to playing them in 2013. The controls on a dualshock3 are very responsive, which alleviates a concern I always feel when going from PC keyboard/mouse to console. The levels themselves are untouched and are the same as you may remember. I played through on Ultraviolence difficulty, which I felt made the game challenging without being stupid unfair (i.e., Nightmare difficulty). Some levels were extremely difficult and required specialized strategies to beat successfully, which was rewarding and was ultimately the thing that kept me coming back and looking forward to the next level and challenge. This was in direct contrast to Doom3 which seemed to require little real strategy other than brute force and the rapid emptying of magazines. But of course Doom3 is, after all, a modern shooter, and this style is to be expected nowadays.I think overall I spent almost three times as much time playing through Doom I and II in total than I did playing through Doom 3 and its two expansions, which is all the more impressive when you consider that the modern games are filled with game-lengthening cutscenes. If you're like me and can appreciate what made older games so much fun and addictive, you'll be in heaven here.------------------------I love compilation packs. It's hard to beat the value-for-your-money that comes with getting multiple games for less than the price of one. I happened to find this game listed at $19.99 brand new online before Christmas and truly got it at a steal. Although I can openly say that I would've paid the $19.99  even if the modern Doom games had been left out, if you're the kind of person who prefers modern shooters, you'll likely be pretty happy too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001C58T46","reviewerName":"B.L.","summary":"Great for Kids","reviewText":"This game is in the style of a 2d platformer game, but updated with some new tricks to suit the Wii Console.I was particularly impressed with the way they handled the tutorial level, where you proceed through the level in much the same way that the other levels in the game work.  The great thing about it is that they have set up small obstacles for you to get past that require you to try out each of the main actions that you need to do to be able to succeed in the game. Instead of relying on looking at the book or written instructions on the screen however, they put pictures of the Wii-mote being moved as needed in the background of the scene.My nephew was just a couple months past his 5th birthday when we got a Wii and once he got the hang of it he went absolutely wild for this game.  It was nice that they gave the instructions in such a way that he could understand what he was intended to do (though there were some cutscenes where all of the dialog was given in subtitles, and that I had to read to him).For the most part they also do an excellent job of gradually making the game more complex in what it's asking you to figure out or achieve to move forward while also mixing in challenging optional goals (such as beating an area within a timer, or beating an area without killing any enemies).  The optional challenges also create some extra interest if you need to play the same area repeatedly to get more gold.My nephew did struggle at times to figure things out, so I think freshly turned 5 may have been just a bit on the young side for this game, but he also didn't have very much background experience in video games (beyond things like v-smile) at the time so he wasn't used to solving the kind of puzzles that come with a platformer game.  I really think this game did very well for him in teaching him how to think his way through puzzles, become better at dealing with frustration when facing the harder parts, and generally understanding concepts like having to gather enough money within the game to acquire a needed item.  I'm not trying to say that this game is really educational, but it did work well as a teaching tool in his case and might help build similar skills in other kids.For him, he was so enchanted by Wario Land that I think if he'd been the only one playing Wii we wouldn't have had to buy another game for 6 months and he'd have been perfectly happy.  Even for people who are already adept with games, this one is still fun, but unless you're the type who really wants to chase after all of the optional challenges (some of which really can be tough) you're not likely to find the game especially challenging.Have fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2009"}

The biggest plus of this newer version in unlike the earlier one the console power adapter doesn't hook up though the cooler slot attachment which lead to poor power connection sometimes and actually causing temporary RROD until you replugged the power adapter cord,  this cooler comes with its own ac adapter and doesn't block the consoles power slot which is actually a good thing as well since the cooler fan isn't taking power from the console either.  The silence of the fan while on was incredible too after hearing that atrocious noise for so long I actually checked to see if the cooler fans were on which they were but it was so silent I had to make sure it was working after expecting to hear some loud noises from the cooler fans.  So for hardcore games who play for long hours or just the casual gamer making sure that their console last a longtime here's a great addition for their system and at a very reasonable price too...UPDATE 01-12-2011Sadly what I first thought was a better updated version of the Nyko cooler fans turned out to be like most of the others,  after about a month into using my Xbox 360 the fans from the cooler started grinding and making as much noise if not worse than the previous one I had.  Though the noise did lower when the cooling fans were in use after five or so minutes and all you heard was a constant low mechanized hum but not as loud as when the fans first turn on.  So far I bought another cooler but that one turned out to be no good, meaning its fans weren't rotating well enough to cool down the Xbox 360 like the Nyko Cooler fan was so until there is a much better solution I'll still be using this one I'll just have to learn to ignore the noise the cooler puts out for now..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000IN0BSU","description":"The Classic Controller is an expansion for the Wii's remote. It connects to the port on the bottom of the Wii remote to allow for wireless connectivity with the Wii console. The shape and style of the Classic Controller is more like the traditional controller design, which allows for ease of use with the classic games available through the virtual console.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Very Good Controller in Most Cases","reviewText":"If you plan on buying a Wii and going through with the virtual download, then getting the classic controller is not such a bad investment.  What causes to be a bad investment however depends on what games you plan on downloading for the virtual console.  Case in point, if you've got a Gamecube controller, there's a big possibility you may want to stick with that one instead.To begin, the controller attaches to the Wii remote, so it is in fact wireless.  So you don't have to deal too much with cords in the way.  Although, this brings about the problem of your Wii remote batteries dying.  Then your shell controller doesn't work so well either.  Another interesting aspect of the classic controller is that you can use it to navigate through the Wii channels if you like.The layout of the controller is almost an exact replica of the classic Super Nintendo Controller.  The differences are two Z buttons, one next to the L button and one next to the R button, and a home button to navigate back to the wii menu.  Its fantastic for playing virtual console games because the buttons are set to correspond to the same things they did on their respective controllers.  Although at the same time this can be troublesome, particularly for playing Nintendo 64 games.  If you plan on downloading N64 games, the Gamecube Controller works far better than the shell controller does.  Mainly because the button layout just feels awkward at times.  The Z buttons are small, unlike the Gamecube controller which happens to have a fairly large one.  The control stick is also far better on the Gamecube Controller for N64 games and the A and B button placements are better as well.Otherwise, if you plan on getting a Super Nintendo game, this controller is perfect!  It's also perfect for NES games, although you could just use the wii remote to play those games (although, the wii remote definitely feels awkward at first).  Aside from that, the classic controller works extremely well.There are a couple of problems, however.  For starters, the classic controller doesn't work for Gamecube games at all.  This brings about the question as to whether the classic controller is worth buying at all.  The answer is simply that it depends on what you want more of.  If you plan on playing tons of Super Nintendo games on your virtual console, then yes the classic controller is a fantastic buy.  It even works better than the Wii remote when playing classic NES games and TurboGrafx-16 games.  However, you can't help but admit the Gamecube controller works great as well (although the Gamecube controller doesn't work quite as well with Super Nintendo games; just try playing Contra III).  The classic controller is great, but until there's actually a Wii game that requires it above all else, its hard to tell people with Gamecube controllers that they'll absolutely need it.  It's a great controller, but not yet a necessity.On the positive side+The button layout is pretty good+Can be used to navigate the Wii Menu+Attaches to the Wii remote so you don't have to deal with a lot of cords+Controls are precise and corespond accordingly to each game+Works especially well with Super Nintendo gamesOn the negative side-It feels awkward with N64 games (the Gamecube controller is better)-As of yet, there are no wii games that require the classic controller-It's really difficult to recommend the classic controller when the Gamecube controller works just fine as well.  Perhaps when a game for the Wii that requires the controller it'll be a lot easier to recommend to people.So it really IS a good controller, but unless you plan on playing tons of Super Nintendo classics, the Gamecube controller is a better buy right now--especially if you plan on playing Nintendo 64 games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2006"}

The game can be beaten in one day easily.  For 50 dollars I expect something a bit longer than this game turned out, it's extremely short.  People have discovered remnants coding in the game of things they left out, things like dragons, extra quests, a singing sword, and instead we are handed a shell of the game we were supposed to get.  I have a feeling this project was running for so long and probably so over budget that they finally decided to just realease what they already had to the public.  You have the option to continue playing after you beat the game but why?  There's nothing else to do, no point to it.

The graphics kept me zoned in. Theirs one race track that it is nothing but music stuff and you start out on the piano and it's really just amazing how they have it laid out. Then theirs another one I like where you are racing on a rainbow, and then theirs one in space and underwater... theirs literally a bunch, but the 3d is amazing. I had it turned up on high and it actually improved the 3d on it. Instead of like when your playing some games such as Nintendogs + cats where if you turn the 3d on high you see 3 dogs instead of 1, well this just brought out the graphics more and the stars actually looked like stars and the rainbow looked like rainbow... it was amazing. I think totally it only took me about 3 hours to beet, but that's only because a couple races I only came in 2nd instead of 1st because browser kept trowing those stupid squid and fire things at me.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

I remember at the time it was THE game to have. I think I only ended up playing the game once, then I threw it back in its case. After 10 years, I finally picked it back up and decided to give it another try (why I don't know). So what are my impressions of the game after 10 long years? Well, there are good and bad things about this game, just like all games. When you first start playing the game, the first thing you notice is the graphical images. The Final Fantasy team put a lot of time into the design of this game and even today it's still pretty.Aside from the beautiful animations, I found the game hard to get into. There is a lot of information that is thrown at you. When you're really just trying to understand what exactly is going on. It seems as though a lot comes at you very fast. It's hard to grasp your role and how to play the game all at once. The junctioning system is by far the most difficult interface to learn. It's odd to use, and makes the game awkward at times. You have to draw or gain magic from defeating monsters. It's time consuming, but you don't really need to level up that badly until disk 3, so I didn't use the system really until I needed to. The fighting in the game uses what they call Guardian Forces or GF's. They are a neat idea, but for a large portion of the game you don't need to fight you can just use your GF. This makes the game feel all too easy, since the GF's usually destroy all enemies at once. The only true poor aspect of the GF is the scene time. They take almost Minutes! To execute their moves and it gets old battle after battle (not to mention makes fight time seem longer than it needs to be).The characters of the game are an interesting pairing, but it feels like they never go in depth with them as they should. They have Squall who is a loner, Quistis who is love hungry, Selphie who is adorable, Zell who is a bit goofy, Irvine who's the self proclaimed ladies man, and Rinoa (don't get me started). Squall for me was a realistic character. I liked him a lot, mainly because I was just like him. Squall likes to stay to himself because he doesn't want to open up to other people, he is afraid of getting close to someone and then losing them. He felt that pain as a child and doesn't want to feel it again, so he alienates himself from close relationships with the people around him. Overall, he is really a nice caring guy and he does care about the people around him, but he is afraid of showing his emotions...so he doesn't. It is just easier for him that way.You don't learn much about the other characters except Rinoa who is Squalls lover interest in the game. Rinoa isn't exactly my favorite character, since most of the time she is a damsel in distress and causes all attention in the game to be focused on her. The game made the relationship feel forced and you feel thrown into a love story. Squall and Rinoa never truly have a bond in the game, but Squall falls madly in love with her. From a realistic stand point, Quistis would have been the best match for Squall. She was truly understood him, she was mature, and she actually went out her way for him. It just seemed odd that he would fall in love for Rinoa whom he hardly had a chance to interact with. It's the gaps in the plot like that that didn't make too much since to me, like the writers didn't know how to carry out the character relationships, which is a strong point in any love story. I guess for the player, you never truly understand why Squall falls so madly in love with Rinoa. The game does a poor job at executing just why he cares for her so much all of a sudden, and is willing to risk his life for her.Aside from the pot holed love plot there is the main plot which is fighting an evil sorceress Edea, who is actually pretty hot herself. The main story is also pot holed as well. You never get a chance to understand why the Sorceress is doing what she is doing. You spend most of the game learning about the past and what led up to the current events, but you don't ever learn the motives behind it all from the Sorceress...this is probably the most puzzling part of the game. After you breeze through disk 1 & 2 you don't get into the real game until disk 3. Disk 3 is when you release that you need to power up your characters. This is when you spend hours drawing magic, searching for weapon parts, fighting monsters, and truly learning the junction system. I spent more time doing these tasks than actually playing the main plot of the game. This made the game feel stale and repetitive. This is probably what causes the game to be so bland for most people. It's a tedious task to level up in this fashion. There also is a lot you can miss out on if you don't know what to do. I lost an important GF ability and weapon item just because of this) this is a game that requires a guide of some nature to fully master it so be prepared).Overall Final Fantasy 8 is a beautiful game with a shallow story that leaves the player with a lot more questions than answers; however, it is a Final Fantasy classic, and a very beautifully developed game. Sure it lacks some things here and there, and the battle system can be a pain, but when you see the 18 strike with 9999 damage per hit Lion Heart...you can't help but sit back and smile and say \"hey, this is pretty awsome.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2009"}

It's a pack you can get and easily install from Steam's official website that significantly enhances the graphics in these old Half-Life games.

I have never before played a game quite like Mirror's Edge, and I have reason to believe that you haven't either.Imagine a world where everything is censored and monitored. You can't even send an email or a letter without a government middleman stepping in. All the phone lines are tapped. everything on the internet is closely monitored. How would you then transport sensitive or private information? That is where \"runners\" come into the picture. These parkour practitioners will get your package delivered safely, discretely and effectively without anyone knowing. Traveling across the rooftops of towering skyscrapers, through ventilation systems, or whatever else will get them to their destination the fastest, these people will get your items delivered in record time. In Mirror's Edge, you play one such runner named Faith. Faith's mission is much more important than delivering a package - her sister Kate, who is a cop (or a \"blue\" as the runners call them) has been framed for murder. Faith is trying to uncover the truth and prove her sister's innocence.Mirror's Edge is played in the first person view point, and while there is very brief gun-play, it is not a first person shooter. It is more akin to a first person platformer or adventure. You always have a destination you are trying to reach, and you may use anything in the environment that you can grab onto, jump off of, or run across to reach your goal. If you ever get lost, and don't know where to head, you can hold down the B button (on Xbox 360) and Faith will automatically look in exactly the direction you need to be heading. Additionally, any object that you can grab or jump from is highlighted red when you come near (except on hard mode). Faith is very fragile, so if you fall from very high, she will die. Additionally, if \"blues\" are in the vicinity, combat is best avoided unless it is a directive. While Faith knows hand to hand combat, she will still die in just 2 or 3 hits.Mirror's Edge has very tight controls, though they take a few minutes to adjust to. Once you have them down, which should take about half an hour at most, you'll be scaling rooftops, sliding under pipes and throat chopping blues like you did it for a living. I'll be using the Xbox 360 controller to explain the controls, as this is the system I played the game on. As you probably guessed, the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls where you are looking. There is no need to press or hold a button to run faster. As you move, you slowly gain speed and momentum - so, if you need to make a long jump from one room to another, all you need is the proper distance to gain the momentum. Speaking of, jumping is handled by the left bumper, which also controls grabbing ledges. This may feel awkward at first, but ultimately this makes the game easier to control and more fluid. The right bumper causes you to perform a 180 degree turn. So, if you press left bumper at a will, you will wall run up the wall about 4 steps. If you then press right bumper while on the wall, immediately followed by the left bumper again, you will kick off the wall in the opposite direction. When you land when jumping or falling from a great height, you will need to press left trigger with the proper timing to roll upon landing and break your fall. Left trigger also causes you to crouch while on the ground, or the slide while running, allowing to to slide under pipes, doors, etc. The A button is used to interact with buttons such as elevator calls, the X button enters \"reaction time\", which is slow motion and can be used once per stage. As previously mentioned, holding B will cause Faith to look at your goal. the right trigger handles attacking as well as barging into doors. When you press the right trigger while stationary, Faith will punch. While crouching, it will cause her to kick. If you run, crouch and then press the right trigger, she will slide kick. Finally, if you jump and press the right trigger, she will perform a jump kick. If you get close to a \"blue\", and he tries to melee you, his weapon will at some point during his swing flash red, usually for only a brief second. If at this time you press Y, you will disarm and take out that enemy. Additionally, if there is a weapon lying on the ground from a defeated enemy, you may press Y to pick it up, and fire with the right trigger. Gun-play is a tad sloppy, but I think they intended this. Faith is not a sharpshooter - she is a runner. She is not good with guns. This isn't a huge setback, however. The Y button also drops a weapon if you are holding one.The graphics in Mirror's Edge are truly gorgeous.The detail on clothing, such as Faith's pants, is astounding. Environments have a mostly sterile feel, being mostly white. This is offset by the glowing red objects that you may utilize. When inside of buildings, there is usually a central pastel color theme - usually blue, green, orange, or yellow. The lighting in this game is also very bright. Occasionally, it can be a tad blinding. Perhaps this effect was desired, but it may be annoying occasionally. If this becomes a problem, try adjusting the brightness settings in the game or on your television. Cutscenes surprisingly don't use these gorgeous visuals. They instead use a beautiful art style of their own. They are 2D and cel shaded, giving cutscenes a distinct anime look, but with enough flavor of its own for it not to technically be anime.Mirror's edge has a bit of replay value as well. Though the campaign is relatively short, there are several challenge and speedun maps, more of which can be downloaded will keep you occupied for a while if you let them. Additionally, each level in the story has 3 hidden runner bags. These bags, dropped or left behind by other runners are cleverly hidden and require tricky tactics to reach. A nice touch for the completionist out there.I honestly don't have a lot of complaints about mirror's edge. It is a very unique experience. Difficulty mostly stems from combat, and if you get stuck you'll find a solution relatively quickly. The story is also quite short. The music, which mostly consists of piano melodies and techno, is almsot unnoticeable most of the time. This makes it relaxing, however.If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket, and you are looking for a unique game to occupy you for a bit, Mirror's Edge is well worth looking into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004QEWVTO","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"Tight Controls. Good Graphics. A True PC Game.","reviewText":"Let's be honest, when Saints Row 2 came out for the PC, it was nothing, but a broken console port plagued by buggy controls. I, like many others here, was hesitant to buy this game and at the same time, very curious, because I own the 360 version and can't recall having such a blast playing a game. I laughed so hard at some of the missions, I was in tears. Just wait to rescue \"Zimos\", the dude with the voice box and you'll know what I'm talking about.Controls:So, I took the plunge and bought the PC version, and all I can say is, well done to Volition and THQ. You have redeemed yourselves. I have to admit, I started the game with a 360 controller for windows, but then decided to do the game some justice and give it a try with the old mouse and keyboard combo...and boy was I pleased?! From the moment you start walking, you can feel how tight the controls are, driving vehicles and shooting is just as impresive. It's been a long time since I played a game that reminded me of what a TRUE PC GAME should play like, and Saints Row The Third's done it. I was very impressed. The controls are so tight, I had no need to re-map any; in fact, I tried going back to the 360 pad, but found myself returning to the mouse and keyboard; it was nice to finally play this game aiming with a mouse, the true tool of FPS and TPS. Hands down.Story:Now, the story, for those of you who have not played the console versions, well, long story short, your money is gone, your hood is gone and now you must take it back at all costs. As I always say on all my game reviews, \"I won't spoil\" it for you. You will have the most fun you've had in a long time, I promise you that. This game is so silly and at times, plain stupid, but in a very good way. It takes elements from other games, GTA being the obvious one, and puts a spin to it that will make you wonder how the dudes at RockStar (I'm a fan) could miss it...You will laugh so hard your sides will hurt. The various weapons (a long one in particular) are fun to use, the various costumes and vehicle options will keep you busy and enterntained in between missions.This game has kept its original formula, making it one of the best, most relaxed games you'll ever play. With plenty of rewards.Graphics:The game looks better than the console version and even more if you use Dx10 or higher. I'm running it at max settings with 2 GTX570s, 12GB, i950. I haven't had any issues at all. I've heard/read online that the \"experts\" think the game is not optimized for high end systems; well, I'm running it at max without a hicup. Game's smooth as it can be. Lighting and water effects look better than the console version and so do some of the textures. But to be honest, I'm having so much fun when I'm playing this game, I couldn't care less about the graphics.Sound:Both sound effects and the music are simply amazing. Explosions sound amazing. Gunshots are a bit generic, but never the less, they do sound good. My favourite is the background music during missions and the different radio stations. I was quite surprised to hear groups such as Tandem (a french canadian rap group) amongst others. 80's & 90's and a lot more rap. If you  have a surround system, pump up the bass, this game sounds that good. Every single track played in this game adds a bit of flavour to every single situation. I sometimes drove around, not taking any missions, just listening to the radio; I would stop now and then to car jack a better looking ride, but then kept on driving.Character and Vehicle Customization:To put it simply, you have colours, clothes, hair styles, bling bling, rims, threads, bumbers, spoilers....what more can you ask? This is the one aspect of this game that others can't match. The countless options given to you add so much freedom to chose who or what you to look like and what you want to ride.Record Mode:The major difference between the console and PC versions. Record Mode, basically, record yourself (the character) during what you consider a good play/move or simply breaking havoc, and share it with others. I had a blast doing it and even try doing a bit of a remix with some video software of my own. It is fun and you should try it.In conclusion, whether you get this game on sale or at full price, you will get your money's worth within the first couple of hours of play. So if you are still thinking about it, doubting it can deliver, due to past experiences, let me put your mind at ease, because Saints Row The Third has shown that the PC version can be an independent version, a game on its own with responsive, tight controls. What a PC game is supposed to be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Final Fantasy VII.............","reviewText":"It wasn't until the Greatest Hits version came out that I ever really took an interest in Final Fantasy VII. I guess it was because I wanted to pursue the game in my own time. Besides, back when this game first came out, you hardly ever found a copy on the shelf to buy. I was always one of the unlucky ones, it seemed. Finally, after obtaining a copy for myself, I got to see what all the 'hoopla' was about.The story, itself(as you probably already know by playing it), is about Cloud Strife. Cloud is a mercenary who joins with a group of others(Avalanche) to stop a megacorporation callled Shinra. Shinra is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Course, the story progresses and deepens when Sephiroth(the game's main antagonist) comes into play. Sephiroth's part in this story?...if the world is damaged, its' Lifestream will gather together in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth plans to use a powerful spell called \"Meteor\" to cause this injury, and then merge with the planet's energy, allowing him to be reborn as a god. Then, he plans to rule over the planet.Final Fantasy VII has a long history behind it. FF7 was planned, first, as a new game for the SNES and was quickly moved to Nintendo's new system at the time, the Nintendo 64. Due to lack of catridge storage capacity, it eventually led to a dispute between Nintendo and Square that resulted in Square ending its long relationship with Nintendo.  Square decided, from that point, to release Final Fantasy VII for the Sony Playstation. The game has went on to sell well over 9.8 Million copies worldwide. It's spawned a series of other games under the FF7 name but none have quite reached the status that the original has. A remake has been rumored for quite some time now but, as of yet, no remake has been produced by Square. My opinion on the remake or lack thereof? Well, considering at to how they made a killing on fans buying the first game when it came out, it's almost guaranteed that they would make a killing a second time. I don't understand why they won't give the fans what they want. They'd come out alot better because of it. It would, definitely, put them back on top as the leader of RPGs..to be sure. Course, enough on the subject, right?Onto the meat of this review..What do I think of Final Fantasy VII?? First and foremost, it is quite an achievement in the RPG genre. It was the RPG where players found themselves in a three-dimensional world that, after playing the game, they actually felt like they'd went on an epic journey. It's the only game other than Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time where I ever felt that way. It was also the first RPG to really evoke some emotion out of me. The characters weren't two-dimensional, they had character and you could invest in that. It helped set the standard for all other RPGs to follow to this day. Too bad, though, you hardly see traditional turn-based RPGs like these anymore.  Sure, you may on the Nintendo DS and the Sony Playstation Portable but not much on any of the console systems these days. While it may seem dated in a time when everything is in 3-D and not 3-D on prerendered backgrounds, it still stands the test of time. The story holds up as well, even if it is a little hard to figure things out at times. The battles are engaging and the game is just fun! While I won't say it's my most favorite FF game; it's one of the games that got me hooked on RPGs. There's never a shortage of good things that can be said about this game.Do I have any gripes about the game? Just one thing...the ending.  The ending is kind of sudden and, as another reviewer stated elsewhere, it just ends. Not quite like Legacy of Kain:Soul Reaver did back in the day, though...nothing like that. The way it ends leaves you wanting more. Maybe it was intended to be that way...you think?All in all, Final Fantasy VII is a game that I highly highly recommend that everyone(and I do mean everyone) should play-at least once-even if you're not into RPGs. It'll definitely give you a better understanding of RPGs and why people love playing them so much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2010"}

As a 1 player game you will enjoy it if your a fan of the Resident Evil series as it will pretty much cover a lot of side stories that were not covered from the previous games.  Even if you are not a fan of Resident Evil, those who enjoy light gun games will enjoy this game.+5 Stars if you are using the Wii Perfect Shot (see my review)+4 Stars if you are using the regular wii remote (hence this review is based on since not everyone will be playing this game with the Wii perfect shot)+4/3 Stars if you are using the ZapperOverall I recommend this game if you are a fan of the Resident Evil series or light gun games.

It revolutionized the way we play video games, not just for fun, but getting better in tune with our bodies and exercising better. Since then, Sony & Microsoft have tried to get on the fitness train as well with games for the PS3's Move and Xbox 360's Kinnect. Yet, what they are trying to do, has already been done with the Nintendo Wii. Yet, with Nintendo putting its emphasis onto the upcoming Wii U, that still doesn't mean that it is too late to get a Wii, and get into shape with the sequel to Wii Fit. But honestly with the holiday season winding down, now is definitely a good time to get better in shape with Wii Fit Plus.Wii Fit Plus for the Nintendo Wii, brings more of the workout fun for what gamers have already loved with the first Wii Fit. This software is a must buy only for those whom have originally bought Wii Fit in 2008. The software really can recognize your body image by how you workout, and has fun activities that work brilliantly for the balance board with your body like snowboarding, and balancing your body to try to place balls through a hole, without losing time. The game has 70 different activities that work from yoga, to cardiovascular running, to fitness that is more extreme than going through a military obstacle course. The graphics handle well, but it really is the gameplay that can be healthy and addictive as well. My only gripe is that there is no curve to getting the basics down, especially to those whom are disabled and have a disadvantage with the game because of outer body image. Still, it is fun to challenge yourself virtually with great activities and a strong workout that holds up well.Overall, Wii Fit Plus is definitely a great buy for gamers whom are looking for getting a workout or improve their health, without the hastle of going to the gym. This is a must buy only for gamers that have bought the original Wii Fit, otherwise you would have to purchase the Wii Fit Plus with the balance board. Still, despite a few flaws, what you play and workout with really is what you get. I like how the game can really communicate with you well, and it truthfully is a great buy for the Nintendo Wii. For better or worse in health, Wii Fit Plus is strong a nice way to go for the Nintendo Wii.Graphics: BSound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2011"}

It was released in 1988 for the NES and was the first Zelda game to cause quite a stir because it was revered and loathed at the same time. I won't get into the huge debate that still rages on to this very day. All you need to know is that even though it doesn't \"look\" like the first game, it is still a Zelda game and advanced the story line while it added new game play mechanics, characters and a quest that made it quite unique.This was an excellent sequel to the classic NES game, The Legend of Zelda. It brought the RPG aspect found in RPG games mixing it with side scroller action found in most platforming games at the time. It's also a pretty hard game and the challenge stays with you. Though you could find the original NES cartridge, you can settle for tracking down the GBA cart instead and it probably won't cost as much. You can also find this title on Nintendo's Virtual Console Service and buy it for 500 points (US $5.00) If you haven't played this game and are still hung up about taking a chance on it, look at some YouTube videos to get an idea.I loved this game and have the original NES cartridge. It didn't deserve to be branded as the black sheep of the Zelda series just because it was radically different from the first game. Parts of Zelda II made it into future games so that says a lot right there.

No way!","reviewText":"The Good: Original cast!, amazing visuals, immersive, you really feel like a Ghostbuster, pretty good storyThe Bad: Repetitive, some times unbalanced, really shortWhen we called the Ghostbusters back into our games in the early 90's, they didn't do a very good job. You remember the Genesis version, MSX, NES, GameBoy, Atari 2600, and C64. The richness of the Ghostbusters universe needed more than 8 or 16 bit graphics and midi sounds to make it come to life. Technology has improved considerably since then, -finally- able to do justice to our Ghostbuster friends. With the help of the Unreal 3 engine, the developers were able to set an atmosphere and story that is truly amazing.Players start out in the Ghostbusters headquarters which has been properly equipped with a true to life fire pole for you to slide down on. Ray takes you through the basics on wrangling ghosts, trapping them, and using your gear down in the basement. One of the first things you will notice is that the controls feel very familiar, resembling those of games such as Resident Evil 4/5 and Gears of War. Still comparing it to a shooter, your Proton Pack takes the place of your \"gun\" and your \"ammo\" consists of different types particle streams. You can unlock four streams throughout the game, starting out with your basic Proton Stream. The Stasis Stream, Meson Collider, and Slime Gun follow suit quickly. The most useful is the Proton Stream which weakens ghosts and stuns them so you can wrangle, toss and then hopefully trap them.Ghosts come in many shapes and forms and it is rare to see so many different enemy types and level bosses in a game. These include many of the ghosts from the movies. You will be battling the Stay Puft Marshmallow man, heading through the Sedgewick Hotel and the Haunted Library.Each ghost has a weakness to a specific weapon type. To find out which type is effective, you must scan them with your goggles. Doing so will also reveal all sorts of other interesting and sometimes ludicrous information. Some ghosts are dispersible which means that they die after a few hits of a certain weapon, but others must be trapped instead. The objective is to weaken them until their health bar turns red after which you can trap the suckers. Walking around with your energy detector is good for finding artifacts -treasures that you get money for- and enemies.Upgrading your weapons will improve them in various ways. You can increase a weapon's rate of fire, make it overheat less often or let you trap your enemies faster. All of these upgrades can be purchased in one play through. Ghostbusting is a high-revenue business and you will earn ample money to purchase any upgrade that catches your fancy. You are also tallied by how much damage you cause the city throughout your play. Doing too much damage may affect achievements.The gameplay may sound simple, and it is, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it is extremely fun. There is always something new to be experienced and only towards the end of the game did I feel some repetition setting in. Ghostbusters kind of felt like a mix of Gears of War, BioShock, and Silent Hill. It can be downright creepy at times but it also has wonderfully witty humor and some great lighting effects that help create a fantastic ambiance. Walking through dark hallways, your senses are always stimulated in various ways. Things may jump out at you, or you will hear strange cries and screams. Besides being scary, it is also immersive; I left the game after about a four hour sit down and I really felt like I was a Ghostbuster (don't call the men with the long-sleeved jacket until you have played for four hours straight yourself!). This is for a large part due to the fact that the original actors are voicing the game, and I think that's what truly made the difference.The game is actually based on the penned script written by Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd that was never made into a third movie. There are a lot of tidbits in the dialog that relate back to the original 1984 classic. This game can be played by both fans and non fans, but is truly geared toward fans of the movie. You can safely say this game is one of the best move license translations ever made.Ghostbusters is just one of those amazing and immersive games that make you all giddy inside. The game truly has an amazing effect on its players. It may not have a lot of depth, but it easily makes up for that in the fun department. It is worth noting that Ghostbusters is a little on the short side, giving you about 6 to 8 hours of gameplay. Fortunately the replay value is fairly high, making this a recommended buy. I really hope there is a sequel, playing Ghostbusters has been one hell of a ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"George Ko","summary":"Good","reviewText":"As a action player, I love to play mature action game just like this one.

N. K \"Esco\"","summary":"A Great Game With More Flaws Than Any Other Out There","reviewText":"I have played this through several times because the puzzles are excellent and you kill zombies.  There are many puzzles I still haven't solved and I may end up playing though again just to see whats there.  Also, some of the graphics were nice and I love the fear, even though I played RE's 2&amp;3 first, this one scared me the most (but being the first I played, only RE2 gave me nightmares for months).  I will agree, this game is hard core, and there is plenty to like about it.  I love interactive movie feeling like Final Fantasy VII and Wing Commander: Prophecy.However, now I will list what I didn't like.  Why I only gave it three stars.  Well, to start off, the cinematics are not only outdated, but horribly done to begin with.  If I made the game, I would have just said: &quot;Y'know, that was really bad, let's just not have a cinematic.&quot;  Also, the movement is quite shabby and fake looking, and while a zombie hovers into a standing position, you can't shoot him until he is standing up and walking toward you.If you think that such a picky thing about positioning, picking up items is worse.  You can commonly at a position in which you appear to be facing an item perfectly, but you can't pick it up, because it's really 30 degrees to your left or something like that.  With these positions, you are forced to listen to mind-numbing music.  I thought the sound effects were bad and the voice acting made the sound bad enough, but they had to go and give us the abolute worst soundtrack you will ever find, for any game or B-Movie.  The only trouble with the music is that you require listening to the sound effects to survive, and so you must endure the music as well!However, the music is beaten in abysmal-ness by its dialogue.  The script is terrible, and to say the voice acting is laughably bad would be a huge understatement.  It doesn't end there.  The pitiful dialogue scenes do nothing but tell one of the most cliche-ridden plots ever devised.  You have police traitors, huge creatures that come out of rooms that you just came out of to kill you, and worst of all, you have about three dozen times through the two stories (which are almost identical) where people walk in just in the nick of time to save the other.  That type of stuff makes me sick.

The graphics are pretty good, and the soundtrack is excellent with some very good musical themes and best of all, voice acted dialogue from the TV characters themselves! But, the game is lacking overall and is frusturating. It's very short, and you could definitely beat the story in a few days. There are lots of extras, but they're mainly just gimmicks to extend what is otherwise a very shallow game. Worst of all, almost every mission consists of this: Drive to some random location, talk to some person, and go pick up something before the time runs out. Many of the missions consist of multiple parts so mess up at all, and you are forced to the very beginning. It's very repetitive, very linear, and very frusturating.

I now know via web sites I need to restart but this should not be necessary.  No bugs were in previous versions  Too bad there is no way to find this stuff out having to look for my own answers.  If the game can be updated without asking, then why is there no bug notice system using the same system??  Does not take much thought to implement that.I was correct that there are more problems and just one of them is when trying to delete saved data utility file it crashes and corrupts the ps3 file system.  So now I have 2234 MB of corrupted data that will not apparently delete and file system restore won't apparently fix or erase it either.  Installed new larger HDD but it copied the corrupt folder back during the back up/restore.  Folder did erase after about 30 minutes of seemingly no activity except hdd light about every ten seconds for faction of a second.On another note there are too many bosses.  Seems in order to not have to make the map (area of play) larger they decided to make you spend most of the time trying to kill bosses thereby making the game seem longer.

Players are free to choose your own fighting style by customizing Dante to your advantage.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Devil May Cry Cause He's Out Of Continues...","reviewText":"Here, finally, is Capcom's answer to its critics. While the original DMC was a great game, and a true classic in every sense of the word, its sequel DMC 2 was pretty much roasted by all and sundry, and denounced as boring by the gaming press in general. Capcom have turned back to the drawing board and kept this second sequel in development for longer, perhaps, than expected, but believe me, the rewards are palpable.GRAPHICS: 5/5Top marks go for visuals, with smooth and clean animations, INSANE levels of detail (even on the lowliest of enemies) and some really impressive backdrops. Sure, they don't seem as impressive anymore - what could better the original experiece of DMC 1? - but if you look closely at the enemies, bosses, accessories and animations, you'll gain a very fast and very deep appreciation for all that Capcom has accomplished here. Gorgeous, fluid and very, very pleasing, the neo-Goth wasteland that Dante and his cohorts occupy is nothing short of remarkable. Action cutscenes are of the type that Jet Li can only dream about, and the whole visual shebang runs along like a freight train on speed.SOUND: 3/5Not so good. Humdrum battle tunes and odd blends of metal and trance provide a well-fitting, if somewhat uninspiring, aural experiecne. Voice acting's as lousy as ever, with the younger Dante bearing more of a vocal resemblance to Steve from Biohazard: Code Veronica than anything else. Weapon effects are satisfyingly macho, though, and the demons make some pretty plausible sounds when on the receiving end of your arsenal.PLAYABILITY: 4/5Minus one for the F Word - Frustration. Dante controls like a dream - it's tighter and easier to master than before, with combos and style points racking up hand-over-fist... ...but that can't mask the fact that, in places, this game is just too damned hard. For the casual gamer, DMC 3 is a definite no-no, and if you're like me and adore this series, you'll still be put off by having to play through the same level ad nauseam before you work out how to defeat the horrifyingly difficult bosses. It's a sad flaw in a control system and in-game physics that are nigh-on perfect, but there you are.OVERALL: 4/5A beautiful game that is, on the whole, very fun to play, and very reminiscent of the excellent original title, DMC 3 is just a little too demanding for its own good to be truly considered a Classic. If you have patience, or can get it cheap, it's thoroughly recommended, but the more casual gamer will be disappointed by the unforgiving difficulty and the bland audio effects. Still, on the whole, Capcom is to be congratulated for rescuing one of its most promising series to date.Roll on DMC 4!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2005"}

Anyway, this game is AWESOME! I was never a big fan of 3D Rayman games, but I liked the first Rayman and I REALLY liked Rayman Origins. I would even go so far as to say Legends is better than the original AND Origins combined! The HD graphics are AWESOME, and the colors are extremely bright and vibrant! The controls are PERFECT! They make the New Super Mario Bros. controls seem almost sloppy! You can run, jump, punch, wall jump, wall run, ground pound, kick...AND IT'S ALL. SO. PRECISE! There really are A LOT of levels too, including many completely remastered Origins levels (and yes, this includes Moskito levels)! The music is also amazing! It's extremely well composed, and very catchy too (no wonder they made a Rayman Legends soundtrack)! There are quite a bit of unlockable characters (including Rayman dressed as Mario and Globox dressed as Luigi). It seems like there's a lot of replay value too, considering there are 700 Teensies to rescue...And if you are over 7 years old, it probably took you around 20 minutes (yeah, that's a slight exaggeration) to beat a New Super Mario Bros. game, but this game can actually get quite difficult, and I've realized that from less than 3 hours of gameplay. There are also challenging boss battles, and-maybe the best thing about this game-MUSIC LEVELS (I think I've replayed the first one about 20 times so far)! The touch screen Murphy levels are really cool too, but it's a lot more fun when a second person plays with you instead of the computer player...The daily and weekly challenges are awesome too! They add new challenge levels EVERY DAY for you to compete against other players all over the world in order to win trophies. Multiplayer is less chaotic than NSMB, but still can get a little chaotic. However, there IS a different mode in Rayman Legends specifically for multiplayer: Kung Foot! Do you like side scrolling soccer where you're allowed to punch and kick other players and use an axe or sword to hit the ball to make it set on fire? Me too. Kung Foot may also be the most addicting competitive mode in any game EVER. Overall, Rayman Legends is an extremely entertaining and addicting game, with a heck of a lot of replay value.

Howard's stories, \"Conan\" is a sword-swinging testosterone-heavy hack and slash game that, while not necessarily innovative, is a fun romp in the spirit of the archetypical warrior.\"Conan\" is basically a game that wears its heart on its sleeve: it's a game about hacking through legions of enemies and monsters, getting treasure, and rescuing attractive, scantily-clad women. It's a beat-em-up in the same vein as games like God of War. By default, Conan uses his famous Atlantean sword, but other styles of weapons (picked up from weapon racks or taken from fallen enemies) include dual-wielding weapons, two-handed weapons, and sword-and-shield style. Each style has its own moveset, purchased with \"red runes\" gained by opening treasure chests and killing foes. Unlocked moves function like combos in a fighting game, for the most part; some moves have special traits, like breaking an enemy's block or even stealing their weapon. The game relies fairly heavily on QTEs, which can get annoying quickly and detracts from the overall feel of the game (especially during boss fights).As the game progresses, players also unlock magic spells in a linear fashion (one per stage, essentially, for a maximum of four). These vary in usefulness - the basic spell is a petrification spell that can basically clinch fights against most opponents, while more expensive spells are arguably less valuable in terms of mana cost. Advancing statistics like health and magic power is done by finding \"triumvirates\" in each level - essentially a short puzzle that results in a boost to one of those two stats or a lump sum of red runes.The enemies and obstacles provide the main content in the game. These can range from standard soldiers with different weapons and armor (swordsmen, spearmen, archers, and so on) to wild animals (dogs and gorillas) to outright monsters. Finding their patterns and how best to deal with them is a relatively exciting part of the game, and they're varied enough that it doesn't get old quickly. For the most part, they feel like challenges, too: even a simple soldier can defend himself well enough to be more than a speed-bump.The game's graphics are reasonably good. They're not worth it by themselves, but the locales and designs are at least detailed and pleasant to look at. The sound is all right, being primarily memorable for the endless stream of one-liners that Conan spouts (\"You scratch like a child!\" or \"My blade thirsts!\"), though the music is pretty impressive too.Conan is essentially a \"fun\" game. It's not necessarily notable or well-made, but it's the kind of game you can pick up and work your way through without having to think about it too much. If you like hack-and-slash games, you'll probably enjoy Conan.Rating: 7/10.FTC Note: Conan was purchased from a game store with our own money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2010"}

The game differs slightly from the first one as you have to play certain areas of a planet that are toxic to Samus before he obtains the right protection suit. They are dark areas.Besides that, the game play is very similar to Prime. I was not the least bit disappointed in this sequel. Metroid Prime 2 was voted #15 on IGN's top 25 GameCube games of all times, while the first game was voted #1. You will be playing for hours upon hours and it is just as fun as the first.

To me, there is no other game to compare this to. If you are expecting a hack n slash action game like God of War and Castlevania (I love both of those btw) you will be very surprised at how different this is. The combat system is simple, but complex at the same time. You're basically pressing one button to attack, but if you are doubled or tripled teamed, you have to press another button to counter attack. If timed correctly, you can string together some very cool looking combos that are a thing of beauty. In short, you will either love or hate the fighting system. I usually don't like games that have a limited variety of bad guys to fight, but Batman Arkham Asylum was special because each fight felt a little different than the last fight.I can't say I'm a comic book fan, so I don't know a ton about the Batman series. Apparently Batman was a good detective and I'm pleased that was incorporated into the video game. I had a blast using some of the cool weaponry and gadgets while looking for and solving various puzzles. I really had to pace myself with this game because I didn't want to turn it off once I popped it in. I have yet to try out the various challenge maps so it's even more fun waiting for me now that I've beaten it!Batman Arkham Asylum deserves any and every award that it received.

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"Graphics are not Everything","reviewText":"Gran Theft Auto- San AndreasThis edition of Grand Theft Auto was released in 2004, which is considered one of the best years for gaming. This game was released around the same time asHalo 2, so they had to bring guns blazing to be quality-based competition. San Andreas delivers and then some. The whole \"gang in the hood\" storyline had me worried, but it turned out well. San Andreas has the same essential gameplay as theother GTA games, but this time has provided some tweaks to increase your playing pleasure. If you could only own one game for your Playstation 2, this needs to be it.Graphics- 6/10We all know the graphics in GTA have always been horrible. The reason for this is the insanely enormous levels and the PS2's graphical capabilities. This game's graphics are better than all the previous games though. Vehicles, people, and layout have all been done better in this game. There is also a blurring effect that happens when your speed gets high. This can be achieved by using nitrous or just driving a speed machine, like a Cheetah.One problem with the graphics is with the game freezing. Changing outfits can often cause the game to get stuck. I never use cheat codes and this still occurs from time to time. Saving as often as possible can make this problem not that big of a deal, but it still happens.This is the first game not to have a loading section between the level sections. You can drive from one point San Andreas to the complete other side without encountering a single loading screen. This is surprising considering San Andreas is larger than Liberty City and Vice City.Another problem has been inherited from previous games. As you begin to increase in speed, all the cars around you will begin to go extremely fast as well. This causes other cars on the road to crash constantly and switch lanes directly into you. Drivers in real life do not just speed up because you speed up. I have always hated this weird glitch in these games.Story- 9/10You are Carl Johnson. You have just returned to your family from a long hiatus in Liberty City. In San Andreas is a small area named Grove Street. That is where your family and their gang live. Your return brings mixed reactions and you need to prove yourself. You begin running errands for the Grove Street gang. The story rapidly evolves into one of betrayal and revenge. I cannot go into it further than that without ruining the story.Along the way, you meet many interesting characters. This includes a psychotic girlfriend, a crazy hippie, and the yakuza. You will do different missions for each one. Some will relate to the main storyline while others will feel like a small side-story. This is good for anyone that gets sick of doing the storyline missions constantly. Some missions you do not even have to do, but they will usually benefit you in some way.Sound- 9/10The sound is almost perfect in this game. There are a few small problems, like gun sounds and radio repeats. Let us talk about the good parts first though. The voice acting in superb. Every character in the game has a voice. The people you meet on the street will have conversations with each other. They are nonsensical conversations, but they are talking to each other. The main characters are done by great voice actors. Every person sounds interesting and unique. If someone calls you on your phone, you automatically know who it is.Gun sounds are horrible. Not one gun sounds realistic. They all sound like toy guns. There are a large number of guns though, so this is forgivable. The guns are not horrible; they are just not realistic.The radio is great. All the music is fit for this game. The game is based in the 90s, so expect music from that era. There is rap, hip-hop, rock, country, and even a talk show. There is a lot of variety there. Depending on where you are in San Andreas will depend on what the people are originally listening to. The problem comes in that the game is so long. You will get tired of hearing the same music over and over and over again. Talk shows get boring after you realize they repeat the same exact thing in a loop.Gameplay- 10/10This is the real meat of the game. This entire game is based on the concept that graphics do not matter. I agree with that. The gameplay usually makes up my mind on what to score a game. This game gets a 9.5/10 because of its awesome gameplay.This game plays similar to previous GTA games. You run around doing missions for others in an attempt to control San Andreas. Missions in this game are extremely varied though. While most are driving or shooting missions, you now have stealth missions and turret style missions. In stealth missions, you sneak around in the shadows and go through an area killing people from behind. A new knife attacks allows you to secretly take out enemies. Turret style missions have you in the back of a car shooting at enemies. These are wild and fun missions.Another new mission type sees you wielding a fire extinguisher. You go through a building and extinguish fires in order to get through a building. These are innovative ways to break up gameplay.The usual extra missions come into play. You can do police, fire truck, taxi, and other missions for extra cash. These are all useful if you need some quick cash. If not, completely the missions will gain you beneficial extras.There is also a new gang territory mission. You can create gang wars. If you win the war, you gain control over a portion of land. There are many different gangs you will have to defeat to win the land. Gaining the land makes some money appear at your house. The more you territories you control, the more money you get. However, your territories will come under attack and you will have to defend them. This is just another fun thing to do in this game.All the vehicles control good. This all depends on which vehicle you decide to jack. Stealing a huge box van will cause you do drive slow and crappy. Stealing a sports car will have you handling great at high speeds. Cars all handle differently. Grabbing some of your favorite ones and pimping them out at the new garage will only improve its look and speed.Shooting has been greatly improved. Aiming is very easy now. You will no longer struggle to stay on an enemy. You will automatically lock onto the closest threat. Your gun will move to the enemies head if they are close enough. It is all very simple.This game is plain fun. You want to jack and car and show every your road rage? Go ahead. Do you want to shoot everyone in sight? Fine. Do you want to play through the missions and finish the game in record time? You are an idiot, but you can.  There is such a variety in what you can do; I love you.Difficulty- 9/10 (Note- This is how much I like the Difficulty)This game is simplicity does not mean it is easy the entire time. You will have to try some missions repeatedly before winning them. The game gets increasing difficult as you go on. Just like a game should. The only problem is that there are no difficulty settings. You just play the game at one difficulty. It does not matter though since the game has good pacing.Overall- 9.5/10This game is near perfect. The only problem I see is the graphics. Every other aspect of the game is fantastic. The game has a strong story, fun gameplay, and the ability to do whatever you want. If you own a Playstation 2, you need to own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"The Perfect Example \"Buy Software, Play Online for Free\" MMO","reviewText":"I really tried to not like this game. I was part of the Star Wars fans hoping that Star Wars the Old Republic (SWTOR) to be my new World of Warcraft (WOW) MMO gameplay addiction. However, after it's bitter defeat to the free to play model, I was proven once again nothing will be ever as good as WOW. And the sad part is I'm a year sober from WOW, because 6 years of the same game I've played and paid for, enough is enough. In the past, I completely hated the original Guild Wars. Hated everything to how it's played to the end game, UI and control scheme, and the severe lack of MMO variety. The only thing that I held respect for it was the buy software, play online for free model and the stand alone expansion idea. Over the past couple of years, I got sick of reading about the sequel's hype comments from user forum posts and other threads on various game websites. Well, they weren't lying, because Guild Wars 2 (GW2) completely delivers.What you get for a $59.99 and NO later subscription fees is a complete breath of fresh air to the Massively Multiplayer Online market. I've played almost 40 hours of the game with a level 14 Asura elementatlist, 42 Norn warrior, and a 10 Sylvari thief. It doesn't seem like much and I'm sure I probably would be level 60 or above if I focused on one character, but GW2 has so much inside of it.The most notable feature is how you quest. No more running to an area filled with!'s,?'s, or Triangles above NPCs and doing fetch, retrieve, and backtracking to them. Each quest has its own variety involving the area you run into, and provide multiple ways of completion. No more \"filled quest logs,\" because each one is tied to the area they reside. All of them are public, meaning anything you hit and loot among other players become your own. You get XP for helping somebody kill something, and you don't even have to be in their party to do it! No more having to wait for something to spawn and getting frustrated because another player claiming that one item or killing that one NPC you needed for quest completion. Crafting material gathering is also in this same category! Everybody can hit the same node and receive the materials (also random bonuses) and XP they need. Cooperation and public are key word to GW2's level grind. Much like Warhammer Online's Public quests, there are a wide variety of dynamic world events where it just involves players showing up to and the area and helping each other get the job done...except GW2 does it better! There have been countless times other players and I completely drop what we were doing to run to the announced area and assist each other in a world event. Some of these can be small and then have a larger scale depending on what you are doing. I read that later on they become bigger and more epic in scale for later levels. Other players can even help you in your profession (class) story quests. Speaking of these, your profession's story quests can actually be branched out depending on choices you make. Near level 30, the player is tasked with deciding between 3 orders to serve, the Priory, the Vigil, and the Whispers. So to get the most out of Guild Wars 2, play at least 3 characters. If PVE is not your total thing and you don't like grinding levels to get to endcap PVP, then don't worry. You can do PVP to level up by partaking in WVW, where you are scaled to 80 with your current gear and skill unlocks, or structured objective PVP, where you character is scaled to 80 with high teir PVP gear and all skill unlocks....I think. I've only done a small bit of WVW, so don't quote me on that.Oh, another thing I hated about the first GW, you couldn't jump! It's almost as if the developers went crazy and added all of these vistas and plat forming jumping area puzzles to say \"we're sorry.\" The game rewards you more for completely discovering areas. Finding all of the Points of interest, vistas, skill challenges, waypoints and completing all quests reward you with actually good random items. Not some title, and a tabard but useful items, like stones to transmogrify gear, bank/trading post conveniences, XP boosters, and coins to craft high level gear to name a few I've received.The second most notable feature is that the presentation of GW2 is through the roof. From the character creation screen, viewing the races' intro videos, then to your first steps into visually pleasing environments; GW2 does not hold anything back. Yes, there isn't a pretty CGI cut scene to explain and introduce the world of Tyria to the player, but who really needs them!? The art scheme and design of everything for this game can be described like a beautiful watercolor painting. It truly is a work of digital art on an epic landscape scale. The character models and their animations are purely awesome. Unlike SWTOR, when you pick a race, YOU PICK A RACE and not some copy N paste with little difference of one character model. From the small floppy eared Asura, to the huge bulky Charr, or even the actual plantlike and unique Sylvari; all 5 races of GW2 are unique to each other. The dynamics of the UI astounded me of all of the different effects happening around the screen be it buffs, combat state, diving in water, and etc.  Combat animations, something that is plaguing WOW for years, are not bland what so ever. Spells and melee combat simply flourishes with amazing presentation. Even while swimming in water, there are unique underwater combat animations to the aquatic weapons you yield. What about the Sound and music of GW2? No sound in this game is below 11. The legendary Jeremy Soule, composer for the Elder Scrolls games, once again knows how to serenade the player with beautiful music depending on what area and player state. All races either male or female have wonderful voice actors that have a surprising amount of dialogue be it in combat, emote, or storyline quest cut scenes.Now, right here is the one feature that is really making it hard for me to reconsider re-subscribing to WOW again: GW2's skill based combat. Instead of choosing a class and being tied to down to obvious restrictions involving skills through a level grind, GW2 introduces weapon based skills.  At first I was scared that the basic Torchlight/Diablo 3ish action bars, But then I discovered this: Depending on what weapons your character can wield, a different skill set is presented for each. For example:  A warrior can use a rifle, does that mean he's not as effective with it? HELL $#%&ING; NO! A new set of skills pop up and depending on how you build the character; it's another example of effective DPS. At level 7 you unlock weapon swapping. So that warrior I mentioned could switch from their rifle, to their 1 handed/off hand, or 2 handed weapon for close quarters combat with a press of a button. The \"mage class\" the elementalist, can switch out his/her staff and duel wield daggers with completely different skills set that have completely different effects. Also, there is no designated \"holy trinity\" of the basic group design. No more designated tank, healer, and dps classes, BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN DO IT. If a fight gets too hard, back out, heal up, switch weapons, and try something else. It is literally up to the player how they want to play their game. The only real choice is what weapons to bring to the fight.There are many other awesome features in GW2 that that I could talk about, but this review is already long enough.  However, this review can't be complete without some negatives.1.  The first and obvious one is that you need a pretty good computer to view/play this game. The low settings provided turn the game into a fuzzy mess that really doesn't look...well it looks like Dark Age of Camelot to be honest.  But no matter what, expect lots of visual lag when you are doing WVW PVP.2.  PVP: On WVW, one of the main marketed features of GW2 is very huge and dynamic. I mean there are 3 servers fighting each other on a huge scaled map. No matter what PC you have, expect LOTS and LOTS of visual lag due to the player count and the nonstop combat effects on the battlefield. This kind of hurt WVW to me, because it turns into a giant clustercuss fast. It's nice you can participate in WVW PVP at level 2, be level capped with other players, but right now it's pretty overbearing. I have not done that much of it. I like the idea, but the lag fest and mayhem made me want to go back into the PVE more. This is literally Alterac Valley on Venom...WOW and Batman fans would get that reference.3.  I'm not really sure how successful the Auction House, or Black Lion Trading post is. For one, you can't initial trade with players. You have to use mail to trade. The trading post can be accessed anywhere your player is to sell items, but it can be laggy at times. And I know this may affect some players' views on game economy, there really isn't a \"pay to win\" situation parse, but you can purchase game currency through this.4. Speaking of game currency, mentioned before, this game is the buy software, play online for free model.  So there will be restrictions to it because of the non-wide array of server support most AAA MMOS have. When you pick a server, that's it. It becomes your home.  You only have 5 character slots to choose. If you want more, you have to buy from Arena.net's website. Want more bank and inventory space, got to buy it from them.5. New players to GW2 and even other MMO veterans will feel lost at some point. The game does have some tutorial sections and a help option, but nothing in your face telling you how to perform actions like crafting. I had to go to youtube to figure out where and how I begin crafting. But most of the time, issues like this become minor nuisances after you figure it out. The maps are very detailed, but almost too cluttered. Grouping with players might actually be more difficult to locate each other, because the light blue dot can get overshadowed by a map's many icons. There is also the overflow issue for the current server populations loads. Overflow is actually a nice tool allowing you to play the PVE game anytime during a server queue. But for grouping, it can be a nuisance to be in the same queue as your party member.6. (updated) The dungeons can be a clustercuss, especially if you are melee. I was labeled the obligatory \"u bad\" by my fellow party members because a boss fight scenario was literally hard for me to tell what's going on. Usually if the target/boss is going to do something area effect wise, a red circle appears as a warning where the area is going to be affected. With the dodge mechanic, one would simple dodge,...however each of the 5 professions in a dungeon group have flourishing effects with their skills. These, at first spectacular animations, do make things difficult to recognize what's going on; especially having the ranged and hybrid professions in your party. In WVW, it only gets worse. I love the design of the ability animations, but no matter what players will say, the fights in dungeons can just be wipe fests. Try a fight where there are more then one NPC to kill and red circles keep popping up. These dungeon encounters can start interesting then result with aggravation when your heaviest attacks are melee based and you are constantly dodging red circles (if you can see them)all the time. The good thing is you can respawn and run back to the fight from a nearby waypoint without the boss encounters locking you out or resetting. If any player in your party criticizes you claiming that \"well, I can see them, and I have 0 problems, you just bad\" comments, they are usually the ranged professions and have not played something mostly melee yet. I strongly suggest to group with players you know personally and use some sort of voice communication. I've done the 3 dungeons that my current level allows me to enter, and all of them have been exactly what I described. I appreciate Arenanet's \"to differentiate from\" approach with dungeons, but these so far only gave me headaches instead of enjoyment.This game has more inside its $59.99 package that meet the eye. I apologize for adding yet another long review to amazon, but there is so much to explain about GW2. For example, how easy it is to organize your crafting materials at crafting stations, banks, or through the hero menu. It's simply another example of the positives outweighing the negatives, much like a Charr and Asura on a titter totter; it's that grand. Classic Everquest and World of Warcraft MMO veterans really need try this game out. I'm pretty sure even the nit pickiest MMO game player would find something unique to it. To really explain GW2, is to simply play it yourself and try out the 3 ways to build your character: PVE, PVP, or simply exploring. This version of Tyria may not be the cup of tea to most, but for those seeking something new to the MMO market, Guild Wars 2 raises the bar in combat, exploration, and just pure immersion... and with no subscription fee!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2012"}

There's no plot-line to the game, no cut scenes with dialog to provide a story or characters, you are simply dropped into a level and start shooting.Sadly too, the levels you're dropped into have very little variety. Although there is the occasional shortcut, this is nothing like the RUSH series of arcade racer games. And, despite the fact that this is a destruction game, there are only 3 different sets of weapons, each with three \"levels\" of damage and functionality.However, for everything one that it lacks, Full Auto also delivers in other deparments! The game has incredible surround sound, and you'll often find yourself physically ducking machine gun fire as you play the game. The career mode has 87 different races in 17 categories, which provides some variety to make up for the lack of level design creativity. In addition, each race offers 3 awards including unlocking cars, paintjobs and \"skins\" for the vehicles. Finally, the game has 50 different \"achievements\" to earn Xbox 360 gamerpoints in the game, and although it appears as if they're easy to earn (when you start playing, you'll get quite a few) earning all of them is quite a challenge, and the game includes online ranking objectives.If you've already finished Need For Speed, Project Gotham and Ridge Racer, on your Xbox 360 you should certainly play this game to get a little more racing variety in your video game diet. Just realize you're not playing a racing sim, but rather an arcade-style racer with a combat component.

And this game brings me back to those great childhood memories but in better graphics and in more tricky controls.The only downside of this game is its gameplay length.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"For Payne fans!","reviewText":"After playing through the game on medium difficulty and going through again on hard difficulty I can honestly say that I love max payne 3.  I had been waiting many years since the 2nd one to play this game and I am not disappointed at all.This is one of the best action games i have ever played.  Rockstar has brought back max payne in the best way possible.  The story is great and makes you keep playing and compliments the action wonderfully.  Gameplay is pretty much perfected. Bullet-time is,again, the main focus in this game and it works better than ever.  Rockstar has truly outdone itself with physics and animation.  Bullets rip through bodies while leaving behind devastating damage and enemies will react realistacly depending on where they are shot.  This attention to detail also applies to max payne.  You really have to pay attention to where you use the bullet dodge in this game.  Your dodge will be cut short if you do it too close to a wall or other object.  Max will brace for impact as he is about to dive into an object leaving him vulnerable.The AI is something to mention.  It's some of the best I have seen in a game.  Even just starting to play the game on medium difficulty I was getting worked over simply because the enemies would take advantage of every opportunity when I was focusing too long on another enemy. They flank and charge and use team work to take you down.  It makes these encounters with them all that much more intense.  Intelligently using bullet-time is a must.This isn't the best looking game I have ever seen but it still looks really good.  Characters are animated superbly especially max payne.  The evnironments really stand out here.  Every location is chuck full of details big and small that make this game come alive.  Having a firefight in an office is thrilling when there's glass and paper flying every where and walls and pillars are breaking away while computers and tables are getting knocked over.  Rockstar definitely took advantage of the time they had with these environments to make them fun to play in.Like I said, the story is great.  This is due to excellent voice acting in the game.  Max Payne has some of the best voice work I have ever heard.  He really helps carry the story a long with his cynical and sarcastic comments that made me laugh constantly.This game was definitely made for max payne fans. If you loved the other games then you will most likely love this one as well.  If you didn't then it probably won't convert you.  I have heard negative comments about the game that I think are unfair.  Like this game doesn't have innovative gameplay.  I find this to be unfair simply because many games haven't had the most innovative gameplay.  Call of duty, halo sequals, mario bros. games, etc. are all great games but aren't exactly innovative when it comes to gameplay nowadays.  I think these games aregreat, for example, because it takes its gameplay but sets it in creative environments that make you play it in creative ways.  This is what I think rockstar has done with max payne.  They have taken the max payne formula and have added great visuals, animation, details, story, environments, etc. to make a new experience for max payne fans.Oh yeah, the multiplayer is a blast as well.  It will keep you playing after you have beaten the game.  I definitely recommend picking this one up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00C71034I","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381341 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Rick","summary":"Arkham Origins....","reviewText":"This would be a 4 or 5 star game if not for the lapses in logic and occasional control issues.  The puzzles are pretty clever, and the writing is good most of the time, but when it stumbles it just defies all logic.  In particular the Bane boss fight.  I should be more specific since it feels like you fight this guy about 2 or 3  dozen times before it's all over.  I'm referring to the fight near the end in Blackgate prison where Bane has a heart monitor that is rigged up to the electric chair Joker is in.  (By the way, this scene does have one redeeming feature - Bane has Batman pinned to the floor, crushing his throat beneath his boot, and Batman is futilely and hilariously pounding away at Bane's shin.  I couldn't help but laugh out loud, and I'm sure the writers did not intend it to funny, which made it even funnier - and a little sad at the same time)  Anyway, you beat Bane by electrocuting him and stopping his heart, then you get chastised for killing him by Gordon.  You know what? I think after all that's been done killing Bane should be perfectly acceptable (and I understand how killing Bane would violate canon, but honestly - how many times do prominent characters in comic books die and then reappear later??) But Batman has to be put thru a dramatic guilt trip and moans about how killing is not what he does, blah blah blah.  Whatever - ok so you're not gonna kill him - I can deal with that, but you'd think Batman would at least have the sense about him to drag Bane into a jail cell (should be one close by, you ARE in a prison after all) before you resuscitate him, or at least slap some bat-cuffs on him first.  Instead you bring him back to life and then you'll have to fight him again.  What follows is one of the most aggravating boss fights in memory, a battle in which you're not only fighting a new and improved Bane, but also some of the worst controls in history.  If you miss the prompt to hit they \"Y\" button you will instead perform a counter which will leave you in a vulnerable state in which the movement controls don't accept any input for a few seconds, you can't move and you're left a sitting duck.  You're supposed to \"sneak\" up on him, jump on his back by hitting the button when prompted and drive him into an electrified cell door.  Sounds easy enough, and it would be if not for the fact that you seem to move a lot faster when sneaking which makes it ten times harder to actually hit the \"Y\" when prompted, and the camera tends to jerk around wildly at times.  I finally beat him but not before my blood pressure went up a few points.  I encountered a few other minor glitches, such as completed tasks not being cleared from the map, and leftover \"ghost\" enemies that would not attack and could not be attacked, instead they would just follow you around until you reached the end of the level or if you went somewhere they couldn't follow.  For the most part it's a great game though, the story is a good one (again, for the most part).  Recommended for fans of the series.  Newcomers should start with the first one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The game features the astounding music, challenging adventures, and interesting storyline that are the hallmarks of the Final Fantasy franchise. Additional game elements also have been added to enhance the Game Boy Advance version.Players can expect 30 to 40 hours of playing time as they journey on land, on sea, and in the air, and explore new towns, caves, and mountains in their attempt to recover stolen crystals. Twelve different characters with new abilities, spells, and items join and leave the party at different parts of the quest to keep the game fresh.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Fantasy comes true","reviewText":"You know that a game has stood the test of time when, years after it was originally released, it gets re-released, and then still finds itself a hit despite its age. Final Fantasy VI, a legend on the Super Famicom/ SNES (as Final Fantasy II), is such a game. Sure, maybe it doesn't look as good as the games of modern era, but the intense storyline and engaging gameplay more than make up for the lack of sophisticated graphical presentations. Add a series of audibly memorable music, and you've got a game that makes you proud to tell others that you're a gamer.The story revolves around Cecil, a captain of Baron's airship fleet, and a man who's questioning his king's growing tendency towards bloodshed. When his suspicions turn verbal, he's stripped of his rank. There begins a journey that sees Cecil slowly unveiling the evil plans of the dark forces that are controlling Baron. During his adventure, Cecil will make many friends that will in turn join him in his quest for the truth.And this is when the real fun begins.Taking on the evil forces isn't going to be a walk in the park, so Cecil and his party will end up fighting monsters, ghouls, and the likes rather regularly. Unlike traditional turn-based combat systems that are commonly found in RPGs, Final Fantasy VI Advance features an active time battle (\"ATB\") system that combines the strategic element of turn-based fighting, as well as the spontaneity of active fighting. Essentially, the party members will still attack the enemies in turns, but instead of patiently waiting for their turns, the character that recovers his or her HP fastest will have the opportunity to execute a command first. This means that if a character has a speedy recovery rating, he or she can easily execute a command twice, consecutively, while the slower characters in the party are still building up HPs for their own command decisions. Meanwhile, enemies will also be charging their HPs for their own assault, so if the party so decides to stand around doing nothing, it will get hit real bad. This basically means that random fighting encounters will end faster, and as a result, the characters will tend to get level up faster. And we all love to level up faster, don't we?Final Fantasy IV Advance also features a colourful selection of characters. Apart from the usual melee fighters, who do damage primarily with the use of weapons, the game throws in magic users who can perform a variety of defensive and offensive commands. White mages, for example, can heal, or cast a wall to protect the members in the party. Black mages, the more offensive magic users, can cast powerful spells on enemies, attacking them with bout of fire, ice or even thunder. Summoners, the most powerful magic user, can even summon the abilities of mystical beings to aid them in battle. And if you think that melee characters can only issue the \"Attack\" command, you may be interested to note that some of their additional commands include \"Ninjatsu\", \"Power\", \"Jump\" and even \"Hide\"! Planning on how to use the abilities of these different characters is, therefore, an important challenge of the game - knowing when to heal the party, for example, can save the team from dying unnecessarily.It'd be boring to go through the entire game with the same party members, so at certain times of the game, characters may leave the party for one reason or another, only to be replaced by others. Characters who leave may also return after a while, thus keeping the roster lively and reducing repetition. The only character who's exempted from this is Cecil, but then again, he's the lead, so he has immunity. Towards the end of the game, you'll also be given the opportunity to choose your own team. This gives players a chance to challenge the final moments of the game with their favorite characters.The game is played through a variety of locations. The overworld, for example, is broken up into different continents, much like this planet that we're residing in. It's littered with towns, castles, mountains and caves. Random battles can occur anywhere on the map, as well as within dungeons. Dungeons, commonly found in mountains and caves, will usually end with a boss fight. Not all dungeons are immediately accessible though, as the paths towards them are blocked. As the game progresses, however, you'll get the necessary transport to bring you to these previously inaccessible areas. A transport late in the game will even take you to the moon! The sheer amount of locations basically means that you'll encounter a lot of activities, items and of course, enemies.About enemies, Final Fantasy IV Advance offers to a large amount of them - a whopping 253 in all. You'll fight blood-sucking bats, mystical dragons and even CPU-powered mechs (!). The great variety makes the fighting interesting. Summoning characters can also master the skills of some enemies after beating them, giving you an edge in future encounters. Some enemies are immuned to certain attacks, while others are weak against others, so understanding what command can cause damage to who will definitely help in your quest.  Thankfully, there's also a wide range of items that you can use to make things easier. You'll get your usual health and magical points refills, as well as weapons and protective gears. You can usually buy them from the shops that are commonly found in towns, but some enemies will also drop items for you, which also make fighting a little more purposeful than merely levelling-up.Final Fantasy IV Advance also has some extra features. The Bestiary menu, for example, is a list that shows the details of every enemy you've slained. If you want to see a complete list, you'll have to kill all 253 enemies at least once. Now, this should make completists glued to the game for quite a while. Even if you don't intend to kill every enemy, you may still find the unlockable dungeon offering you some great replay value. Unlocked only if you complete the game under certain circumstances, this very difficult dungeon boasts 50-storeys of action! On top of this, you'll also unlock individual trials for certain characters while playing the game, and you'll be rewarded with the most powerful weapons for these characters if you manage to complete them. Again, this will lengthen your playtime for the game.For all its goodness, the graphics for this game are perhaps a little dated. This isn't exactly a problem though, since most people will enjoy the gameplay too much to notice. To be fair, Square Enix did make an effort to make it easier to play the game. The wordings are enlarged for easier reading for the GBA, and a more realistic image of the characters will appear beside a dialogue box, giving you a more direct indication of who's talking. The game's minimal 3D graphics are also quite good to look at, but the real killer for its presentation is the musical score. The music is among the best I've heard for a video game, and it goes to show that good things never go out of date.In conclusion, Final Fantasy IV Advance is an exceptional RPG experience. Fans who've played the game from before will find it worthwhile to play it again, while those who've never touch a Final Fantasy game will soon find themselves being converted. Quite simply, Final Fantasy IV Advance is one of the best RPGs ever to appear on the GBA, and you'll find that, even by today's standards, it's one damn fun game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2006"}

You're an outlaw set on robbing a train - but suddenly you're turning into a vampire and joining up with a group of monster slayers.The atmosphere of the game is dark and moody. You are at times running along a dark, rusty train, or riding on your vampiric horse, or perhaps running through a graveyard. Along the way you absorb blood from your enemies, gain in powers and work towards your goal of slaying Lazarus - a vampire who has been around since the days of the Roman Empire.Primarily a first person shooter, you can choose from a number of \"period\" weapons - crossbows, rifles, handguns, etc. There are of course the traditional tweaks to add interest - the crossbow shoots dual rounds, your horseback weapons spring unlimited ammo that never need reloading.I'm intrigued and happy that both of your main friends are female, and are just as good at vampire-slaying as you are. Together with the Darkwatch, you move through Arizona slaying evil.There is slight \"customization\" as you go - you can choose to do good or evil actions to certain characters. It doesn't change the course of the game, but it does let you earn different types of powers as you go. Other than that, the game is primarily about shooting a lot, moving to the next map area, shooting a lot more, and so on.The game is definitely mature. When you fight the enemies, you can decapitate them, lop off arms, and generally cause a lot of bodily damage. There are sexual situations as well. The game is meant for and marked for adults.I found the graphics on the disappointing side for an XBox title - they were more in line with PS2 graphics. The sounds were reasonably good - I was amused that the title theme was almost a direct take-off from a certain classic western movie.All in all, the game is a relatively short play, and while you can re-play to try different good-evil combinations or try on different difficulty levels, it is primarily a shooter. If you enjoy shooters, the old west and a dark, undead atmosphere, you'll probably enjoy playing this as a way to relieve stress in a relatively mindless way. We all have our games that we enjoy for this sort of situation - tetris, gauntlet, etc. On the other hand, if you're looking for a more multi-threaded good-evil atmosphere like KOTOR or even Fable, Darkwatch will seem very linear to you.Recommended for adults who enjoy dark shooters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2005"}

For those of you who weren't lucky enough to play the game during its' first release, the story goes like this...The Gestahlian Empire is taking over the lands. Led by a trio of powerful generals & headed by its' namesake, Emperor Gestahl, they are gaining power. Having fused both magic and technology into something called Magitek, the Empire continues to take over the world one kingdom at a time. A group of people known as \"The Returners\" begin to fight back, and that's where the story begins. In its' day, Final Fantasy VI was one of the most epic games of its' time.

LikeGod of War Ascensionit was a release date purchase for me, but I just never got around to it until recently. So I'll try to keep this late review as brief as possible.If you like shooters or action games...Bioshock Infinite is for you. For chronology's sake I'd highly recommend that you play the first two games before you play this one. But chronology is completely unnecessary for Bioshock Infinite. Here's the good news: You get the original Bioshock free on the same disk (with the PS3 version)! So at least play that if you haven't already.I lovedBioShock; I became immediately immersed in it and spent well over 20 hours completing it during my first playthrough because there was so much to explore in the game. Bioshock Infinite is no different. While the game progresses in a linear fashion, it's a huge open world that is yours to explore and backtrack on with a few optional objectives or just to gather supplies.The scenery is immense and every town has more detail than the eye can capture. The structures within the towns are perfect and the rooms within the structures are as realistic and...well...just so detailed. I can't even fathom the amount of time and effort that went into putting this game together.The visuals alone in this game make it worth the price of purchase. And seeing everything in the game can be rewarding. Exploration is usually fruitful, because hidden throughout the expansive game are all kinds of weapons, perks and information about where you've suddenly found yourself captive. And this time it's not under the sea.The game begins very similarly to Bioshock. You're out on the open sea approaching a structure that seems to pop out of nowhere. But this time instead of entering a doorway to a city beneath the sea, you're propelled into the stratosphere to a city in the clouds called Columbia. And there you find roadblocks o'plenty to prevent you from easily reaching your goals. While there is certainly some familiarity with the game mechanics, the Bioshock Infinite creators have givens fans a remarkably unique Bioshock-esque experience. The main difference between Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite is that while the original was dark and very creepy at times, this third in the series is mostly bright and more action oriented.So is there anything bad about Bioshock Infinite? Not much. If I to find a flaw it might be that it's all auto-save; you can't just quit and restart the game wherever you left off. You need to make sure that you see it auto-saving, and if you're an explorer like me you could be in an area for a long time without realizing that you haven't auto-saved in some time.

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"A huge disappointment","reviewText":"Just to set the context, I am an AC veteran, I played almost all the AC titles (AC1 being the only exception). This led me to my feedback/thoughts below. I have some mixed feelings about AC3 which I will share below.Positives+ The world is crafted with fine detail. The visuals are generally very clean.Negatives- The pacing of the game at the start was a big issue for me. It got to a point where I was VERY close to quitting just because I was simply not having fun at all. I will explain further.- The first few sequences are excruciatingly slow in that they feel like a long, drawn out tutorial, which really challenged my ability to enjoy this game. I felt it could have been shortened significantly. I estimate (not scientifically, of course) that at least 80% of your time during the first 4 or 5 sequences will be spent watching cutscenes. You have the option to skip them of course, but then you risk losing out of details that you might need. This is by far the biggest issue I had with the game, as for the first several hours, you do not actually get to play much, and when you do play, there is no progression or continuity with constant skipping around; I won't spoil it for those who haven't played, but if you have played this you know what I'm referring to.- The open-world is not available to you until AFTER sequence 5, which is at least 2 to 3 hours from the start of the game depending on how many cutscenes you skip.- AC3 does a poor job of showing you controls and assumes that you have played the other AC titles. To exacerbate the issue, the in-game manual is cumbersome to use.- Plenty of glitches that on their own, are not deal-breakers, but since the bulk of the gameplay is so unsatisfying to begin with, every little glitch worsened the experience that much more. Some examples: missing objectives, invisible walls, missing markers on the maps, etc.Closing ThoughtsI can best describe my experience with AC3 as one with mixed emotions. I truly enjoyed the other AC titles and had high expectations for AC3, but this simply didn't live up to my expectations on many fronts. I felt the background/setup should have been shorter. The gameplay should have been more balanced and more developed. The combat system should have been more refined/polished instead of staying unchanged. If you are a diehard AC3 fan or a history buff, you will likely enjoy this game a lot more than I did. All things considered, I give this game a 2 out of 5 for unfulfilled potential and the overall value/enjoyment I got out of the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2013"}

The 3D platform renaissance started with the PS1 Bruce Willis vehicle `Apocalypse', was improved on with the jaw dropping Devil May Cry and puzzle play enhanced by Shadowman 2, comes to a head with GOW. GOW is not only one of the best PS2 games of 2005, but is a big PS2 game, lasting about a week with at least two or three full days play in there, starts off with the same flaws that Devil May Cry III had with a very hard to beat first level boss (keep trying!), that requires you to come to grips with the new split-second `mini-game' controls that you have not seen before. These `mini-games' require you to match the buttons displayed on the screen so that your character can perform a combo that results in a messy death. Not only are you required to button bash O to perform various actions (and this is real button bashing folks, so get that coffee table support ready), you must also follow through with various other button pressing timed moves, including analogue stick clockwise half turns and full anticlockwise turns that creates a very impressive array of moves to beat the beasties. Included are power-ups and magical secondary weapons, wielded by the dual blades on chains swinger, Kratos, a muscle-bound ghostly white mortal with supernatural abilities given to him by the God of War, Aries, explained about two thirds of the way through the game in one of the twenty or so action packed video sequences, a story that weaves in and out of the hero's past life, his current journey and bloodlust for revenge, all played along to a magnificent Dolby Surround chorus, the music is as close to that found in a movie like `Gladiator' and some of the best sounds the PS2 has had so far (up there with Silent Hill 3). Starting with the Aegean Sea, the beautifully rendered environments are littered with new enemies and plenty of puzzles, The Gates of Athens, The Road to Athens, Athens Town Square, Rooftops of Athens, Temple of the Oracle, The Sewers of Athens, Desert of Lost Souls, Pandora's Temple, The Rings of Pandora, The Challenge of Atlas, The Challenge of Poseidon, The Challenge of Hades, The Cliffs of Madness, The Architect's Tomb, The Path to Hades, Temple of the Oracle... literally this game takes you to hell and back. There is beam balancing, blade dodging, rope climbing (and along the rope battles), rock climbing (and climbing battles), orb collecting, item collecting, lever pulling, statue pushing, wall smashing and swimming. Although there is some backtracking in parts this does not reduce the pace which only seems to increase in fury with every new power-up weapon level and combo you discover. The ancient Greek mythological creatures and setting makes you wonder why game makers have not tried something like this before, with the Sony production team creating hugely expansive areas and arenas, exploration hungry thrill seekers will have almost full scale deserts to succumb too or a Mount Athos to climb, and all this never avoiding what is at its heart, a half way decent story that is much better than a lot of the tripe being pushed around by other labels today. Although there are some downsides (game has lots of crash bugs, coffee table button bashing is a bit much, video sequences are not quite cutting edge [see MGSIII:Snake Easter], anti-aliasing is not the best) this is really only cribbing about what is a PS2 essential. It is easy to fall under the spell of this `Clash of the Titans'.*Note: This game is strictly for Adults only. There is Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language and Sexual Themes.Pros:- Long gaming time- New way of using the controller to do battle- Great Story- Immense level designs- Explosive action content- Bloody video clipsCons:- Difficult first level boss- Sometimes requires coffee table supported button bashing.- Occasional crash glitches","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"3G is a Wasted Extra","reviewText":"Pros:Excellent gaming engine with the graphical capability to play pretty advanced gamesHigh-quality OLED touchscreenDual analog sticksEasy PSN functionality and download supportBackwards compatible with PSP and PS1 gamesRegion free gamesCons:Lack of good gamesNo internal memory and expensive proprietary memory cardsPortability issuesBackwards compatibility only applies on digital games purchased through the PSNThe PS Vita is an excellent system marred by only a few design flaws. The best part of the hardware for me is the dual analog sticks. These are a major bonus since fpss basically require them nowadays. Not only are there two of them, they are also of excellent quality. One of the things I always disliked about the PSP was the analog stick that was flat to the surface and rather difficult to use. The 3DS has copied this design, although they made it more ergonomically comfortable. The Vita however, has two that stick out from the system, just like on the PS3 remote, allowing much greater control and ease of movement. There are sensitivity issues since the sticks are smaller than their PS3 equivalents, but once you adapt to it the controls are almost as easy to use.The second best thing about the Vita is the OLED touchscreen. This touchscreen is absolutely beautiful and has excellent resolution. I thought the touchscreen aspect was just a gimmick, but some of the games have made excellent use of it allowing them to compensate for not having back bumpers (L2/R2 buttons). Well, technically they do have those in the rear touchpad, but it is so touchy and difficult to use that it might as well not exist. The big plus of this touchscreen is that it is much more sensitive and reliable than the 3DS's. You can type with fair accuracy using only your finger, and responses on one section of the screen rarely result in unexpected reactions from another. It does tend to make the screen oily, but that's the price you pay for all touchscreens.The graphics on the system are amazing, although all that talk of them being almost as good as the PS3 is garbage. They fit comfortably between the PS2 and PS3 level of graphics, with the result probably being a bit closer to the Wii than the PS3. With the smaller screen it is easier to hide bad texture maps and glitches. That doesn't take anything away from the system. On the small screen those graphics look amazing. I'm not sure where these graphics fit when compared to the 3DS, but they are definitely an improvement. It's hard to think of any 3DS games with high graphical requirements since they tend to aim for cartoony and exaggerated worlds, but I can't remember any that even come close to pulling off Uncharted: Golden Abyss. At a guess, I'd say that the 3DS reproduces approximately the same graphics as a PS2 (as can be seen by their virtually unchanged ports of PS2 games) while the Vita is a bit higher (as seen by their improved ports of PS2 games). The difference is more one of style than capability, with Sony focusing on realistic games that show off their graphics engine while Nintendo does what they usually do and try to create fun, cartoony games. The graphics leap between the 3DS and the Vita just isn't that high. Certainly not enough to recommend getting a Vita on that score alone. The biggest advantage they have graphically is that their screen is just better quality, and doesn't waste energy on 3D that nobody uses.I've heard some complaints about battery life but I don't know what all the fuss is about. My Vita plays for about five hours without recharging, which is a good hour or two longer than my 3DS does. I appreciate that the older systems lasted longer but that was because they had less graphics-intensive games. You can still play those games so it isn't a problem. A DS game on the 3DS can last all day, and playing a PSP game on the Vita is likewise. The Vita also has an excellent sleep mode. I found that the system drains far less quickly when asleep than the 3DS does. Besides, it was really only the DS generation of games that worked like that. Previous systems often had terrible battery life (see the two-hour long Game Gear).The layout of the Vita is basically that of a Playstation controller with a big screen in the middle. The two analog sticks are in the proper places and are reasonably sensitive. The PS button has been moved to the left corner and glows when the game is on. The start and select buttons have become a bit crummy since you have to push at quite a difficult angle to get them to go down. The two bumper bars are very responsive, and look quite stylish. The rear touchpad is useless. Comfort-wise the system is very nice, fitting neatly into your hand with some nice pads at the back to support your grip. The system is somewhat heavy, but that's never been a problem for me. The game does suffer dramatically in portability when compared to its competition. Not only is it larger than the 3DS-XL (or the PSP for that matter), it is also bumpier and less protected. With no DS clamshell front to protect it the Vita's screen is dangerously exposed to sharp knocks. I can also assure you that the two analog sticks, despite making gameplay amazing, mean that the Vita will never comfortably fit into anyone's pocket. There are cases for it that will alleviate the protection issue, but the best that you can do is carry it in your jacket. And for some people that just isn't enough. It all depends how you use it.Software-wise the Vita comes preinstalled with some basic programs of varied utility. The main screen is an ugly series of icons accessed by the touchscreen. Sony is trying to make their system into a phone and I don't understand why. Still, it functions well enough. The browser still sucks and the maps app isn't particularly helpful. Due to the presence of a touchscreen the messages app has become functional. The PSN is extremely useful. In terms of new software the main addition is Near. It's trying to do what Streetpass does, but it does it badly. All you can do with it is see what people in your city are playing. It connects through 3G so it bases its records of local Vita users on the last location they signed in on. No, it doesn't continue to sync with other devices when you put it on sleep mode. That'd just be silly. It isn't like the 3DS which communicates with other consoles via wifi.Hardware-wise the only major problem is the proprietary memory cards, which are so obviously money-grabbing as to be insulting. Especially given the Vita's emphasis on downloadable content this is just a kick in the teeth for gamers. After all, some of their games aren't even available in physical copies. And if you want to download any PS1 or PSP games (which look amazing on the new screen btw) then you're equally screwed. Worst of all, since there is no internal memory you need to buy one of these cards to play any game, whether or not you intend to download games. And a good card can cost half as much as the system itself. It's disgraceful.Another silly feature is the 3G option. There's no point to having this since there aren't many online games for the Vita, and most of the other internet functions will require you to connect to a more reliable wifi hub anyway. 3G is expensive and difficult to arrange with your local provider. Maybe this isn't the case in Japan, but it is in the US. And of course, even if you get service it isn't going to be as good as wifi anyway. Besides, what's the point of playing online games outside anyway? When you're in public you can't exactly shout into your mic to inform your teammates that they're being morons. Not that you could do that anyway since the Vita only supports 3G for turn-based combat and Near. Any first-person shooters will have to find some wifi. 3G also drains your battery in a heartbeat. Unless you live in an area that has no broadband internet connection but still gets 3G I can't see the point of it.To be perfectly honest, even this isn't enough to prevent people from buying the system. What might serve as more of a deterrent is the games catalog. The Vita has been out for two years but is still suffering from a lack of truly great games. The best new games to come out thus far areUncharted: Golden AbyssandAssassin's Creed III: Liberation. They also gave Persona 4 an awesome port calledPersona 4: Golden. All of these games came out in the first year, when enthusiasm for the new system was still fresh. There has been little since. The 3DS was suffering from this too until fairly recently, with the most popular games being ports from older systems likeThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Tales of the Abyss, andStar Fox 64. Now the 3DS is picking up steam withFire Emblem: Awakening,Pok&eacute;mon X and Y,The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, andShin Megami Tensei IV, but the Vita seems stalled.One of the major pluses of the system though is its easy access to the PSN. A gigantic library of PS1 and PSP games are available for download. Yes, these were available before, but only for the PSP. Now you can access them on the Vita's high def screen and use dual analog sticks for control. This can be really helpful even on PSP games that have replaced the right analog stick with the top bumpers. There are also demos and free content that adds greatly to the experience. Much better than Nintendo's eShop. Or maybe that's just the opinion of someone used to the PSN. Like the PS3 games are region-free, though DLC is region locked. You can also have only one account connected to your Vita which means no more copying games from different accounts. You have to reformat the card every time you change.To sum up: I really like the Vita. On a strictly hardware level the Vita is clearly superior to its closest competitor (the 3DS), even if that system has advantages when it comes to portability and convenience. Its biggest problem is the lack of good games, and that's hardly the fault of the hardware. Like the 3DS it's had a slow start, but hopefully it will pick up now that the price has gone down and a new and cheaper model has been released. PS4 functionality should also help them. If you're willing to bet on future successes then this system is well worth it and the backlog of PS1/PSP games should keep you occupied for quite a while. If you're waiting for that one brilliant game that makes the system worth buying... it hasn't come yet. But hopefully it will soon. If you are planning on buying this system though go for the wifi only version unless you can find this one cheaper. 3G support offers nothing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2014"}

Basically it is very possibly my favorite FPS of all time, including the PS3 games I've played & own.  It's the only PS2 game I'm going back to write a review for on Amazon.There are so many aspects I loved about Black.  You can go in guns blazing, or you can do stealthy approaches.  Head shots are clear and easy to get, unlike a lot of newer games where it's extremely difficult to drop a guy with one shot.  You can adjust each automatic weapon to either have a more-accurate single shot, a three-shot burst, or fully auto.  You can also locate suppressors for a lot of weapons, so again you can choose stealth tactics or just blowing people away.  There are more than enough different types of guns in this game as well, most are basics but they feel natural for each level.It's remarkable how many different things you can blow up in this game, and while difficult to describe the sound of things exploding, it's somehow a very satisfying series of almost firework-sounding explosions.Everything does what you expect in this game, and while not very many levels total, each feels unique and lasts a long, long time (a good half-hour if you're good, well over an hour if you're more methodical).  There are forests, docks, a gulag, a ruined town (you get to sniper a lot here, which is a fun & realistic weapon), and a bridge, to name a few.  There are some levels much more linear than others, but it is still fun as far as being able to have the freedom to negotiate the entire level however you want.The storyline is exciting, though perhaps a bit generic for these days of COD and the sort.  But you are still kept in it with the action.This was one of the most addicting and fun games I've ever played - many nights over the past few years I've turned out my lights, turned on music and my black light, thrown Black on, and just relaxed to blasting away.  After you beat the game the first time you have the option of unlimited ammo and level select, which makes it even more fun (getting a rocket launcher and magnum for most of the level = fun!).  As I said, if you're a fan of a well-conceived, good graphics, solid-plot-driven, unique-feeling FPS, then you should definitely treat yourself to this game.Note: this is just a one-player campaign mode game, no multiplayer of any kind (which was just fine with me!).If this were a brand new game I would've been very happy paying $50-$60 for it, so whatever price it's now at I'm sure is great and well worth it.Final note: Sony and/or Microsoft - MAKE A SEQUEL, please!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}

Unfortunately, since Nintendo has exclusive rights to the franchise, it also meant that I had to have either access to or own the proper gaming system with each generation of the game(s).  Unfortunately, this resulted in me missing several titles, in particular the predecessor to this game, Luigi's Mansion (Gamecube).Now, buying any \"Mario\" game from the franchise is always a guarantee of a quality product. There are several key aspects of these series of games that are present in nearly every title, and Dark Moon delivers in spades. These aspects, are, in no particular order:1) funny, with cute jokes and silly commentary, including puns galore,2) beautifully animated, especially the 3D sequences for the 3DS console,3) has puzzles that are challenging enough for an adult, but not so difficult that a child wouldn't get them,4) dynamic gameplay with excellent in-game explanations of how to use the Poltergust 5000 (Luigi's ghost-sucker) and the myriad of attachments that you gather,5) and last but not least, the characters are well-designed and have distinct personalities; Luigi is a timid yet determined hero, whereas his mentor, Professor E. Gadd, is slightly looney but cares about Luigi.With this in mind, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of this review, shall we?Graphics & SoundThe graphics and sound of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon are excellent, truly detailing the wide world of the Super Mario Brothers franchise. Backgrounds are varied and detailed, the characters all have a distinct look, the game has a vivid atmosphere that is comically \"spooky\", but silly enough that even the youngest fan of the game would not be afraid.The character animation is great, regardless of whether you choose to play in 2D or 3D mode. While I stuck to 2D mode most of the time, when I was in 3D mode I was amazed at just how great the 3DS renders the game. There is truly a depth to the world as you move through it, and while it looks great in either setting, some aspects of the gameplay just burst out of the screen in 3D mode. In either event you will be very satisfied with the graphics.Sound-wise the game is \"kooky\", for lack of a better word. It is lighthearted and a little spooky, suiting the ambiance of the game perfectly. Most of the music is a variation of the theme song; it is either sped up, slowed down, played with a different instrument, or has a few extra notes thrown in. In terms of speaking, as with all Super Mario Brothers titles there is none, per se. Think of Charlie Brown's teachers: most of the time the characters speak in jibberish (Professor E. Gadd chuckles and utters \"yabbo yabbo\", for instance), however Luigi does periodically utter single words, such as the name of his brother, saying hello, and various other phrases. All-in-all the communication between the characters and the player through text is great, with concise conversations that are descriptive without turning the game into a digital novel.Story & GameplayLM:DM is FUN, and addicting. The gameplay is simple: King Boo, the archvillain in this game, used a spell to shatter the Dark Moon. As Professor E. Gadd (returning from the first game in the series, Luigi's Mansion) soon discovers, the Dark Moon is responsible for keeping the behavior of the resident ghosts in check. After the moon shatters, the ghosts go crazy, playing pranks and creating all sorts of mayhem, going from the personality of Casper to the mischievousness Slimer (&agrave; la Ghostbusters fame) in an instant. After the Professor escapes to his secure bunker, he seeks out Luigi and uses his Pixelator to suck him through the TV and into the bunker; he needs Luigi's help in finding the Dark Moon pieces and helping to restore peace to the valley.To accomplish his task, Luigi must travel through several different environments (similar to how you must travel through different worlds in Super Mario Brothers games), investigating who is behind the destruction of the Dark Moon as well as collecting various items. Each world is divided into a number of scenarios, each one having a specific task that must be completed before you can advance to the next scenario and/or zone. Luigi must use his wits to solve puzzles by using the Poltergust 5000, his new weapon against the spooky bad guys. In addition to sucking up ghosts, the Poltergust is employed to collect items and execute tasks. For example, a row of coins may be on the top of a door frame. Since LM:DM is not a platforming game, meaning Luigi cannot jump, you would point your Poltergust up toward the door frame and suck the coins to you. Alternatively, you may need to reverse the vacuum in order to push an item across a screen. While a simple concept in terms of gameplay, the developers did an amazing job of not making the Poltergust a cheesy gimmick; you will find that each of the various \"powers\" that Luigi gathers throughout the game are used repeatedly for the myriad of challenges that you will face. Not to mention it is just plain fun sucking up ghosts!LM:DM is, quite simply, a great game with an engaging story and excellent controls to manipulate Luigi throughout the various environments. As you unlock new abilities and upgrade your vacuum, you can also go back to previously completed levels to access areas that you may not have been able to prior. This is because in addition to the baddie spooks, you will also collect money (used to upgrade the Poltergust 5000) and gems. Each environment has the same number of gems that are hidden throughout the area. Being able to go back to previously-visited locations allows the player to explore sections of the map that were previously inaccessible as well as to find gems that were overlooked, making the game VERY replayable.Finally, the puzzles in LM:DM are tricky, but not as ridiculous as some of the puzzles in other games, like Myst. In general these puzzles require you to manipulate the environment using the Poltergust and the many attachments that you find during the course of the game. For example, in one room you need to find a way to get past a man-eating plant. There is a sapling in the ground that needs watered so that it will sprout the thorny seeds to kill the plant (the seeds that you suck up and then \"shoot\" at the plant; the plant eats it and will die, allowing you safe passage). Since 99% of the puzzles in the game have the items that you need in the same room (you cannot transport them out of an area), you need to use your knowledge of the game mechanics to solve the dilemma. In this instance the bucket was invisible, so I had to use the Darklight to reveal both the bucket and the missing tube for the overhead water pipe. I then used the Poltergust to suck up the empty bucket, walk it to the running water, fill the bucket, then walk it back and use it to sprinkle water on the sapling for it to grow. I then drop the bucket and use the Poltergust to suck the spiny seed off of the watered sapling and turn around and fire it at the evil man-eating plant. It then eats the seed and chokes, allowing me to continue my quest! Phew!I know that seems like tedious work, but that is the beauty of LM:DM; you can always compete small bits of the game to come back later. The game is divided into several zones, each with individual chapters to explore. Clearing a mission only takes ten-fifteen minutes, so you could easily play during a short work/class break!Now, for the cons:1 - Professor E. Gadd bugs you way too often. At the beginning of the game he will give you a Nintendo DS (he calls it a DualScream), which will act as your phone.  During missions he will call Luigi to give him status updates or various instructions. Since each scenario usually takes only about 15 minutes to complete, the Professor calling you six or seven times is frustrating, especially because you HAVE to answer your DS or you will be unable to advance the game (you cannot move Luigi). Most of the time you can figure out the next step without needing a call from the Professor!2 - The gyroscopic movement of the 3DS can make Luigi look in the wrong direction or even fall off a ledge. In the case of the control issues, you can change where Luigi is looking (indicated by the beam of light from his flashlight) through two different commands: either the 3DS buttons, or by tilting the 3DS in the direction that you want him to look. There were many instances where I didn't realize that I moved my 3DS, resulting in my missing a target or even getting killed. There should only be one way to move the camera; having two causes too much confusion.3 - Lastly, the professor has a tendency to zap you out of your mission without giving you a lot of exploration. He uses a Pixelator, so along with being forced to leave a map before you are done exploring, you also get to see your character cubed and zapped into a TV (aka: the load screen). There is no way to override this. Once the phone rings, you cannot move anyway, and if the Professor says that he is bringing you back, you have to go. Now, you can go back later (and generally you have to anyway), it is just frustrating not being able to completely explore a location in one trip.OverallLuigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is an excellent game that is fun for all ages. The quirky humor, fun gameplay dynamics, beautiful graphics and atmosphere make this game truly a must-have for your 3DS collection. The story is suitably silly, but the various other things that you can do in addition to completing the main quest line guarantees a lot of replay value. Combined with the fact that you can play online against other players to capture ghosts in the \"ScareScraper\", there is a style of playing suited for everyone. In short, I highly recommend this title and encourage you to order it today!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2013"}

The action is intense and satisfying, the graphics are some of the best available for the PS2, and the production values are just top notch. The storyline is a bit underdeveloped, though, and the RPG stuff has been \"dumbed down\" in the assumption that console gamers don't like depth as much as PC gamers - but these points lose their luster if you have a friend to play with. \"Dark Alliance\" is easily one of the best two-player games available, as it allows you and an ally to hack your way through the campaign together. More games should offer cooperative multiplay if it's this much fun. If only there were a few more characters to pick from (you only get three, assuming you don't count the unlockable Drizzt Do'Urden - awesome!) and a little more depth to the roleplaying, this game would be the best available for the PS2.

{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"One of the best Co-op games around","reviewText":"When I bought Crackdown, it was on sale for 2 dollars when Hollywood Video went kaputz. I bought two, one for me, and one for my brother-in-law, who I have always been close friends with. We've always loved co-op gaming together, and if there's one universal truth about Crackdown, it's that its awesomeness is made even more so by co-op, but what is Crackdown? Essentially, it is Grand Theft Auto where you are the cops instead of the robber. Set in Pacific City, you play as an agent, a story-mechanic hybrid of super-hero meets epic, cheesy sci-fi clone. There is crime in Pacific City, you are unleashed upon it. That's pretty much it.The massive, open-world city is divided between three boroughs, and each has its own distinctive environment. There's the Mexican gang, the Russian gang, and the evil Asian run corporation crime syndicate. Gameplay comprises of collecting orbs that enhances your character's powers, beating up criminals, cruising around the city in cool cars, and pretty much anything else you would want to do in a Grand Theft Auto game. One of the original creators of GTA worked heavily on this game, so it makes sense. The more you use certain attributes, the more points that automatically go to leveling your character up. Shoot enemies, they drop orbs that enhance your marksmen category. Beat up enemies, your strength goes up. Run and jump around getting collectable orbs, your speed and jumping increases. It's simple, but very effective and cool to watch your agent level up to a true super-hero.The graphics are really neat. They have a decidedly more realistic, cell-shaded quality to them that screams comic book. In fact, a lot of the design in this game feels like a super-hero comic book. There's lots of humor in the writing, and the main announcer is hilarious and dynamic all at once. It's a great direction that really relies on humor more than seriousness, and its all the better for it.All of this is fantastic, but the multiplayer layout makes it even better. You and one other person can play together in the same world. You both get to keep the progress you make while playing together, avoiding the frustration of losing much progress you make while playing in other people's game world like other games have (*cough* Fable II *cough*). It's an absolute blast tackling the enemies and bosses with a friend.Crackdown has been out for a long time. In fact,a less than stellar sequelhas come and gone. I just figured I would review it now, as it really is a great game that deserves praise. It's not perfect: the melee system is flawed, the platforming isn't as refined as most open-world games and is sometimes almost broken even, the camera can be glitchy, etc. These problems are overshadowed by the sheer amounts of FUN this game has to offer, especially if you play it with a friend. Buy it, enjoy it with a pal, and let the good times roll.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2011"}

Paolucci \"Collector of Entertainment\"","summary":"Old School RPG Formula... TO THE EXTREME!!!","reviewText":"I've played and beat every Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior for the first four in the States), and I've come to expect certain things from these games. Firstly, you don't play Dragon Quest and enjoy it unless you like old school gaming (that's hyperbole but you get my meaning). All the games in the series have followed the same turn-based battle, constant grinding theme. Basically, you turn the game on, get a quest, fight, level-up, and buy the best equipment before you complete that quest. Then, get a new quest and do it all over again. Dragon Quest 9 isn't much different. It has given up on the random battles, something that all RPGs have been giving up over the years. Despite the graphical changes made to the battle system (the characters are dynamic and move about the battlefield), it's still turn-based DQ9 goodness. The story is itself kind of sparse and nowhere near as sweeping as other RPGs, but again, that's kind of a norm for Dragon Quest. Sure, you may be saving the world, but it's nowhere near as serious as world-saving in Final Fantasy games. And, despite the changes made to the leveling system, you still do tons of grinding. In fact, in this game, you grind ten times more....And, to be honest, everything mentioned above is what I expect from this game, so I'm not rating it based on that. So throw that out the window. I'm rating this game based on the additions Dragon Quest 9 has over the other games in the series. The first, most important change is the class system. And while I enjoy being able to make the party I want, it still works out the same: two fighters, a mage, and a priest. The class changes you make throughout are really made to help add points to the original class. Basically, you change classes to gain levels, save up skill points, then change back to your main class and invest points in the skills from that class. Later in the game, you gain new classes but by that point you're generally too far ahead to actually make a profitable change. Oh, did I mention that you must start at level one in every class? Oh, and lower level characters get less experience. That's where the class system becomes tedious. Granted you can always change back to your high-level classes but simply beginning the grinding anew can be a daunting task. Luckily metal slimes are far easier to kill in this game than any other in the series....Another addition they made is the quests. And again, very daunting for little reward. Most quests have you searching the world for a specific monster, fighting it until it drops a story item, and returning to the NPC that gave the quest. Other times you're just giving items you must alchemise (more on this later). And while it's not required that you finish these quests, it's very difficult to purchase worthwhile weapons and armor in the game so a lot of the quests help provide these needed items to get through later parts of the game. Plus, you can gain additional classes by completing some quests.Now, for an old addition revamped: Alchemy. In Dragon Quest 8, the alchemy process was generally an after-thought. Sure, you could get some amazing items, but the game itself was designed to get the best equipment (or close to it) during normal gameplay. Dragon Quest 9 is the complete opposite. In fact, when I completed the first playthrough my best character had a weapon that was only half as powerful as the strongest weapon in the game. Alchemy is the only way to get the best weapons. The problem is, it costs both time and money. It takes tons of searching to find all the ingredients and sometimes can cost loads of gold (a prime commodity in any Dragon Quest game). An example is the Agate of Evolution, which is required to make some of the strongest items in the game. You need a Chronocrystal, which can only be bought for 50000 gold. You're lucky to get that much in a single playthrough. So, again, very daunting.Now I'm not saying everything I mentioned is bad. No, I enjoyed the class system, and I liked completing the quests. I just know that I'm never going to be able to get everything done because of the amount of time it would take. And I'm basically satisfied with my equipment so I'll only make items when I know I can and not go hunting out the ingredients. Plus, this game added one more thing that I thoroughly enjoy, and makes completing the game worthwhile. That's the treasure hunts: these phenomenal little side-quests take you into deep dungeons and mazes, fighting and gaining items, and each dungeon has a boss battle and a reward of another treasure map. This brings memories of the old Dragon Warrior games back. I love this feature, and it actually makes the other additions less tedious since they--class system, quests, and alchemy--become apart of the treasure hunting.All in all, though, I got what was expected from Dragon Quest 9. I knew they wouldn't change their formula, I just didn't expect them to intesify the mixture. So while I do think a lot of what's in the game can become monotonous and, as said before, tedious, it's not like washing dishes or changing your oil. There is some reward, however small. If you're a fan of old Dragon Quest games then this will be a welcome addition to your collection. But if you've moved on to the more cinematic RPGs that have a little more pay-off then I'd hesitate to buy this. Unless you're willing to put time into this game you won't get nearly as much out of it as you would, say, a Final Fantasy game.Gameplay: 5 -- it's Dragon Quest; if you don't love the gameplay you won't play it.Graphics: 4 -- while it's not as good as 8, it's still a step above other Quests on the DS.Story: 3 -- sparse at best, but enjoyable enough to keep you interested.Fun: 4 -- the tediousness of some of the features takes only one point away.Replay-ability: 5 -- you'll be playing for hundreds of hours after completing the story.Sound/Music: 4 -- the Gameboy can only do so much....Overall: 4","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2011"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

Most of the glitches that marred the game for the early players are fixed now, so that's good. However, the pacing to the game is a little slow for my taste. Most of the game you are moving from point A to point B on some quest -travelling by foot usually and your character seems to move at a snail's pace. The cool thing is that since it's a sandbox-style role playing game that you are able to choose from a variety of tasks and quests to complete. And you can simply walk around discovering things and having conversations with people in the game that will then give you other tasks to complete.On the down side though, it seems as though I have spent a lot of time moving from point A to point B with sometimes not much interesting happening in between, aside from maybe killing a few mutant creatures.This is not one of those games that I have been so drawn in by either the story or the game play that I feel like I just have to finish it. And so after playing it for a couple of weeks I've moved onto another game, though I am planning to go back and play more of this game at a later time. Completing the little missions is fun as is interacting with some of the characters, but I just don't find myself interested by any aspect of the story enough to keep me engaged. And I have found the environments in the game boring, too. It's not that the graphics are bad, just uninteresting and dull like most of the rest of the game.The game might seem complicated when you first begin to play, as there is a pretty steep learning curve to understanding how everything works. Though some of it is covered in the game manual, it probably would have been better for the game developers to set up some sort of tutorial type of system to go over the PIP system and how to use the different attributes, for example. I also found the melee and the weapons disappointing. Though there are A LOT of weapons, one doesn't feel a whole lot different from another one.FINAL GRADE: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004CVQUGQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Don Squeek \"Don Squeek\"","summary":"A Champion Gets Back Up!","reviewText":"So I think most people will agree with the statement that Fight Night 3 was amazing and Fight Night 4 left a lot to be desired. But just like a good fighter, Fight Night bounces back big with this latest installment.- Champion Mode: Fight Night Champion mode is a blast. The story sucks you in and doesn't let go. At first I was a little disappointed you couldn't use a created boxer for the \"story\" mode but it the end the story makes up for it.  Instead of just fighting boxer after boxer you have to use strategy to get through the Champ mode. As you progress you get limited by story details. It's a little hard to explain and I don't want to spoil anything but let me tell you breaking your hand and having to fight one handed is a pain in the butt. The last fight is a blast, you can't just walking in and throw bombs you have to listen to your manager and stay alive.- Legacy Mode: I have to admit I was more than a little worried that legacy mode would suffer due to the awesomeness of Champion mode. I'm glad to report it doesn't, you still create a boxer and work yourself up the rankings but they have added some cool new features that help you forget you are simply fighting match after match. Training is better than ever before with more options and non-interactive options which I found awesome. Once you start becoming popular you can spend time at events to help raise popularity and the trainer will even help schedule matches against high ranking boxers you otherwise would not have access to. It's a big step up from Fight Night 4- Settings: I believe this is the first time you can do this, if it's not someone correct me but perhaps the best new feature is the ability to set power, speed and accuracy of all boxers in the settings. Another review was complaining that heavy weight fights only last 2 or 3 rounds until a KO. You can FIX THAT and its awesome. Turn down the power meters and your games are going 10 rounds no problems. If you are someone who wants to walk through legacy mode as a one man tank, turn up power, speed, stamina and accuracy meters and you can throw power hooks until the ring is covered in blood. (Not literally)- Controls: My biggest problem with FN4 was the punch controls themselves FNC goes back to the old school way of throwing with either the stick or buttons. Stick control punches are much more fluid and feel almost natural once you get use to them. Gone is the way of circular motions to throw punches, each direction you flick the stick throws a different punch making combinations easier than ever.- The Little Things: The Graphics in FNC are top notch. The rings, entrances and boxers all look amazing. The roster is huge and all our favorite boxers from the past half a century all make a return.- The Little Things I don't care for: For those reading this review later on in the year please take note that this is an EA game therefor if you buy it used you will have to buy an on-line pass. (Money grubbing suits) The other thing I wish was \"different\" is the new corner system. I always liked to idea of fixing my boxer in the corner with an interactive system. That is gone and has been replaced with an automatic system that works based on your last rounds results.All and all I would call Fight Night Champion a big step up from what Fight Night 4 offered. If you were a fan of the 3rd one you will love this edition. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have so far.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}

You move fluidly, chop effectively, and juggle enemies to death. The two weapon combo really helps to amp up your combo strings, for example using the sword to slash the enemy into the air, then filling him with a barrage of bullets until they die.The game also has quite a nice way of leveling you up. Through collection os red souls, you can pay to level up Dante's move arsenal. Everything from a power slash to a double jump can be yours, for a price of course!As for the storyline, it is worthy of a movie. You really feel like your accomplishing something when you run around the castle for the cause. Very few video games can pull you around like this one does, it can make you feel sad, angry, it can make you laugh, but over all it makes you feel cool!inc onclusion, this is a must own game for anyone who has ever liked action.

{"product_name":"B004X56PWK","description":"","reviewerName":"rodjoh \"rodjoh\"","summary":"A spin-dash in the right direction.","reviewText":"Sonic Generations is a celebration of the entire Sonic franchise in its 20 year aniversary. It plays like any other Sonic games, with several worlds each with two \"acts\", some boss levels and Chao Emerald collecting. What makes this game special is that you can shift between 2D classic side scrolling action (act 1), and \"modern\" 3D action (act 2) which is supposed to represent the \"best of both worlds\". Each world gets a 2D and 3D act, so regardless of what game it came from, you will still get to experience the same stage from a diferent perspective. And even in the same perspective as the original, the stage is not an exact copy... you will find new routes and obstacles in your way.The worlds in this game are also drawn from previous games in the franchise.  Be ready to relive stages and music from the classic Genesis Sonic games, the Dreamcast \"Adventure\" games, and the more recent Colors, Unleashed, Heroes and, yes, Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. The game actually provides a lot of fan service with music, artwork and references of the entire series. It even lets you play the original Sonic the Hedgehog game if you collect enough points to unlock it. The game also features skill upgrades that you can purchase and equip for your Sonics, extra missions, and an online mode with leaderboards if that's your thing.As far as negatives this game is not without them of course. Even if it is better executed it still suffers from that awkward feeling that Sega still doesn't know how to get 3D Sonic right. That's a whole different topic so I won't elaborate on that here. Also on 2D sections you will feel in several parts that things are harder than they should be. Also, a lot of people complain that the final boss is confusing and one can spend hours trying to figure out how to defeat it. I can certainly agree, tho once you figure it out it is not that bad honestly. And some classic Sonic staples like Casino themed stages and Special stages are also missing entirely. What the hell? Also I know they purposedly tried to keep this a Sonic only affair, but I would have at least loved to play as Tails and Knuckles, for old time's sake. Oh well, it is what it is.Any Sonic fan will truly appreciate everything that Sonic Generations offers. And if it took backtracking Sonic's history to get a fresh start on future games, then so be it. Hopefully things will only get better from here.Happy birthday Sonic!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

This is based on the multiplayer demo, which I downloaded 2 weeks ago.I first realized that the game uses the quake 3 arena engine. OK. Very good. Next thing I realize is the menu layout. It [stinks]. It is just plain terrible. I couldn't figure out how to get into a multiplayer game for atleast a minute. I then realized that multiplayer games were a sinch to get into. Very good. Then I realize, these graphics are terrible! I would have never guessed this game was on the quake 3 arena engine unless I had seen it loading before the game pops up. I was dissapointed to see the graphics so poorly taken advantage of.Besides the graphics, a few other things bugged me. I found the aiming mechanism to be quite inaccurate at times. With a pistol, i could crouch, and stand still, with the aimer very close to eachother, and then still shoot way off, sometimes at unbelievably inaccurate places. The next thing I realized is that the guns are all about the same. Machine gun, bigger machine gun, SMG, smaller SMG, sniper rifle, grenades (boring).The other thing i realized that I was VERY dissapointed about is that there is no violence!!! I shot someones arm off, and they just groan, and they fall down! I can not see limbs being blasted off almost all of the time, and I sometimes can't even see blood!!!

I had him run through the initial practice session first to get a feel for the 10 games that are available at the outset for single player.  Overall the games were easy for him to pick up and he finally got the hang of rhythm type games thanks to the RAIN DANCE game which has you hitting the red button in time to a song a la guitar hero but on a very basic level. His other favorite is the whack a mole variation.  We tried a round of multi player to see what other minigames there where for 2 players plus, but he enjoyed going through the single player mode which offers ten random games and a tally point system as your achievment.  There are unlockables for your monkey and the Quiz game that works with these controllers also sounds fun to me so even though there are alot of cables connected to the four controllers this game should earn its place in the library at least for the younger gamers and any age gamer who is intimidated by modern gaming controllers.

Sadly, I was not spared the glitches. I was about just about the play the final chapter of the game when I got stuck between two checkpoints in Norinbad, and unable to advance any further. Very angry about this.The game itself tells a story not detailed by either Tolkien or CGI-obsessed nutcase Peter Jackson, but does take place in the latter's expansive LOTR universe. It looks, plays, and feels a lot like a Dungeon Siege game, and for anyone disappointed with the lame Dungeon Siege 3 then War in the North would have been a perfect remedy had it not sabotaged my ability to actually finish it. Besides this particular bug I found the characters, movement and collision detection to be very clunky. You will often move so slowly that you won't be able to help getting massacred by orcs and trolls. Even if you want to run away from said battle and give yourself more room - forget it! The creatures and characters on-screen somehow take up more space than they should and there is an invisible bubble around them which you cannot pass through. Very frustrating indeed.The game is liberal with trophies, and I was going for the Platinum before my progression was put to a premature end. I unlocked 59% in total. Only one of them is for online play, and it's a bit of a tricky one too.

Truly A Game For Everybody!","reviewText":"Although this is not my favorite game of all time, this is the best game that the NES every released.  What's even greater about this game is that I believe that everybody can have fun with this game.STORYThere isn't anything really, other than plumber Mario is out to rescue whereever from whoever, however he can.  Not very detailed, I know, but the writing is not important and isn't treated as if it is.GRAPHICSI think this game still looks fantasic.  The colors are vibrant, the design of the levels is genius, the characters and enemies look detailed and move well.  This game wasn't supposed to look realistic anyway, so the fantastical approach increases the the fun.SOUNDThe music is very catchy and never annoying.  There are moments where it's truly heart-pounding.  From the suspense of the hovership levels, to the haunting mood of the castles.  Of course it's all done with 'bleeps/bloops' technology, but it doesn't distract or annoy.GAMEPLAYEasy to grab, and boatloads of fun to play.  There are dozens of items to use in this platforming benchmark.  Mario will traverse from one side of the screen to other, avoiding and eliminating enemies along the way, and escaping those fearsome falls of doom.  There are hundreds of secrets for the hardcore gamer, and plenty of surprises for those not necessarily looking for them.  The first \"Super Mario Bros.\" is more user-friendly because it's basic, but this game is twice as great.REPLAY VALUEUnfortunately, there is no saving, so you'll have to beat this game in one long sitting.  Better set some time aside, because if you don't find the shortcuts (which will pass up some creative levels), you'll be playing this game for at least 4 hours...if not more!  But you'll love every second of it!Of all of the NES games ever made, this is my absolute favorite!  I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys games!  \"Tetris\"...\"Pac-Man\"...\"Pong\"...\"Super Mario Bros.\" all games for anybody looking to have a good time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2005"}

When I was younger I would sit around for hours playing this game on my brother's PSone. Sadly, some of that fun I once felt has worn off in the wake of owning games like Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City, San Andreas, Saints Row, and Crackdown which have vastly improved the car theft and missions seen in games today. However, even though these games made the formula more fun I still like to go back and play this game just to crash cars, steal cars, and get chased by the incompetent police forces in the game. The controls are at times a little wonky, the camera kinda sucks, the character is slow at moving, and the music lacks any kind of pulse.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"More than solid GTA side story","reviewText":"Originally released for the PSP, GTA: Liberty City Stories is a side story returning you to Liberty City for the first time since GTA 3 hit the PS2 way back when.  Liberty City Stories puts you in the shoes of Tony Cipriani as you return to Liberty City to reclaim your place in the Leone crime family.  You do pretty much everything you'd expect to do in a GTA game: a free roaming city, steal cars, outrun or kill cops, mow down pedestrians, and partake in side missions and the like.  Now that Liberty City stories is on the PS2, the control issues that plagued the PSP version are gone thanks to having a right analog stick, but the graphics are grainier and blockier than any of the previous GTA console games (which is about what you'd expect when a PSP game gets blown up on a full-screen TV).  The biggest complaint of Liberty City Stories is that the game doesn't have that super big budget feel to it like the previous games had.  Frank Vincent once again lends his voice as crime boss Salvatore Leone, but there's no other big names to the voice cast; a first since the series has entered the 128-bit era.  Despite it's flaws, Liberty City Stories is more than worth the budget price tag, and it's a worthy distraction for fans until GTA 4 comes out for next-gen consoles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2006"}

These words have never crossed any serious gamers' lips and there's a good reason why. The GTA series are just simply FUN and addictive, letting you do what no other game does. It lets you handle a variety of missions in the way YOU want to. It's not linear like most games tend to be, but that's disappearing quickly. Now on with the show. First off, the graphics. Now the GTA series aren't noted for their graphics, but the game is pretty looking, even if the character models still need work. Still a lot of pop-up and technical issues, but that's expected almost of these games. Vice City has, without a doubt, the best soundtrack to date in the series. Soundtrack consists of classic '80s music such as rock, pop, rap, and talk radio. I didn't care much for GTA III's soundtrack other than the opera and talk station. But Vice City has music for everyone with the likes of Twisted Sister, David Lee Roth, Judas Priest, Michael Jackson, A Flock of Seagulls and much, much more. Plus, there are now 2 talk stations. One is K-Chat, a talk show with loopy guests and VCPR, a political debate show, which is my favorite, because Maurice Chavez and his guests are hilarious(especially the nudist and redneck wanting to seperate Florida from the North).Also, celebrity voice overs by the likes of Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, and everyone's favorite adult film star, Jenna Jameson. Controls are identical except now you can crouch and shoot. A bigger selection of melee weapons like katanas, cleavers, knives, brass knuckles, chainsaws, screwdrivers and guns like M-16s, AK-47s, MP5s, and the list goes on. The hand to hand combat has been improved, but still could use a little work. Now like the previous GTA, the replay value is off the charts. You can beat the main game but still have loads to do. Jobs to complete and packages to find, and trust me, you'll want to find all the packages(it's really cool). Still, you can waste countless hours just killing and blowing up stuff for hours. However the game is far from perfect. The character models could look better rather than having flipper hands. The targeting system tends to lock on to dead bodies rather than live targets. But I'm just nitpicking. This is an experiance no PS2 or Xbox owner should miss. In fact the only thing that is better is San Andreas(see my take on it), but that's besides the point. Highly recommended. 5 out of 5.Semper Fi, Carry On","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}

The game itself felt more like giving the players a more upbeat scenario for the character of Starkiller who suffered a tragic but honorable fate at the end of the first game,  the sequel felt like it was allowing the character to get a more romanticized destiny in this game.

Make sure you play it with your volume turned up, lights and phone off.The graphics are great and so is the storyline. Some folks here criticize the fact that it's too thin or superficial. That may be, but they're forgetting this isn't meant to be a soap opera.Those that say the game is a clone, or it borrows elements from other games obviously were born with Half-Life in their lap ...All in all, the game is worth picking up but it's a little expensive for what it offers. Single player lacks replayability appeal and multiplayer [as of this writing] is far below what other games out there have to offer. And there's the system requirements which are quite high. Before you purchase this title, make sure you read what the minimum requirements are so you don't have unpleasant surprises when you get home ...Personally, I expected a lot more from the engine given the fact it's been in development for what, 4 years?But the game did manage to scare me. It brought back some of the feelings I had when I was a kid playing Doom back in 94. Slept with the darn hallway light on for the first couple nights.

Yep, they look great... but not running as perfectly smooth as we've heard. I'm certain that they run absolutely stunning on a &quot;designed for Doom3&quot; video card and system, but if you don't have that system (bet you don't neither) you are going to be tweaking them and guess what... there's a HUGE difference between that high and medium setting.

If you don't have the mentioned &quot;Doom 3&quot; system expect out of sync lips and some crackling as your computer struggles with game. Lower your graphic settings.Immersion. Absolutely amazing.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"A \"Smashing\" Good Time","reviewText":"When it comes to multiplayer \"party\" games, fighting sims have usually been relegated to the older audiences for games such as Mortal Combat or other more graphic experiences.  With \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" for the Nintendo Gamecube, however, the contestants are none other than the colorful characters from Nintendo's cannon of crazy caricatures participating in some cartoonish smash-and-dash.Besides the tight controls and great visuals/locals, the true hallmark of this game is the attributes of each individual character, which provides \"something for everyone\".  If you just like mashing people?  Go for Donkey Kong.  Love to shoot a bow & wield a sword?  Then Link is your character.  The list could go on and on, as each character has abilities that make them unique to the game and allow for almost endless combinations.Overall, \"Melee\" is perhaps the most engaging multiplayer GCN game ever created (with the possible exception of Double Dash).  Literally hours of fun can be had pummeling your friends with Nintendo's characters and earning the bragging rights to go along with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2012"}

Think Grand Theft Auto/The Saboteur, except that you can destroy EVERYTHING.  (If you think the environments in Bad Company 2 are destructible, just play Red Faction: Guerilla).You play a demolition engineer on Mars whose brother has just been murdered by the totalitarian occupying force.  So naturally you join the resistance and fight to rid Mars of the despotic corporate scum.  The way you accomplish this is by destroying key installations and annihilating anyone who gets in your way.  Thus you liberate Mars, one sector at a time.There are lots of weapons and upgrades to make your explosives and guns more powerful.  You also have to be something of a structural engineer to figure out where to place detonations to bring down some of the larger buildings, bridges, etc.  The physics of the game are mind-boggling and fun to play around with.The pacing of the game is quick, and for each mission there is a lot of flexibility in the way you achieve it.  So you can be creative in the ways you take out enemies and enemy installations.And now that this game can be had for around $20 at your local game shop, there's no reason not to buy it.Other games I dig (to give you a frame of reference): GTA 4, Bioshock (1&2), Dead Space, Modern Warfare 2, Killzone 2, Brutal Legend, Heavenly Sword, Uncharted (1&2), Resident Evil 5...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2010"}

It sort of reminds me of how GoW was improved upon from one to 2 without missing a beat and it's really good.You really don't need to play part 1 of Uncharted per se unless you would like to better understand some of the characters in the game and how they all relate.Presentation and story wise, this game to me, so far, makes up for all of the sucky movies that came out this summer from the cliffhanger beginning to running thru the streets of Nepal avoiding runaway trucks, so far this game is a big thumbs up. And yes, some of the action scenes are a bit clich&eacute;d but then really think when is the last time you actually played some of those scenes in a game' Altho it may be barely noticeable (it's really noticeable to me however) the cut scences and overall visuals look much sharper than it's predecessor almost to a point that it does make you feel more like you are playing an interactive movie. Not to mention that these early levels really have you playing up to the game's starting point with crosses and double crosses really gets the blood pumping.AI Wise, I do enjoy the fact that just like the last game, your sidekicks will provide help but won't do all of the work which is good. Don't go thru the game expecting your AI buddy to do all of the killing. You have to get your hands dirty too. Not to mention I LIKE the dialogue (There's one above you! There's one below you! And `You follow all the `hose') that sometimes just randomly spouts up. Speaking of which, I enjoy how the game's new characters are introduced with the new faces and old faces and just when you think you can trust somebody, they turn on you and sometimes back again.Control wise, I think they have been tweaked somewhat with a few buttons moved and simplified but there is a tutorial that happens in certain sections that show you how to do things. The added `Stealth and takedown' mode really fleshes this out to keep this a run `n gun fest. Speaking of, you have to really plan a lot of your moves in this game especially in the Stealth portions as moving to rashly will almost always end badly for you. The shooting portions are similar to the first and are reminiscent of the GoW series. You can do more blind shooting and you can target your enemy as well and they are indeed smart. They will flank and pin you down if you aren't careful.All in all, Uncharted 2 is a top notch adventure game that succeeds where the Tomb Raider games had gone wrong and keeps it fun and interesting without all the frustrating puzzles and fizzle.5 or 6 chapters in, I am very satisfied playing this game and I can't wait to try the multiplayer!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Doesn't paint the Canvas Curse masterpiece, but still a treat","reviewText":"Kirby's Canvas Curse was a Nintendo DS sleeper and one of the highest-rated Nintendo DS games in early 2005. One of the first fully-featured Nintendo DS games, Canvas Curse showed what the DS could do with lots of touch screen innovation, creative graphics, and deep gameplay features. Kirby Squeak Squad, Kirby's sophomore DS effort, is nothing like its predecessor. It is instead much more like the NES, SNES, N64, and Game Boy adventures of this beloved ballooning Nintendo character, and as a result it offers much of the same.Strawberry shortcake is quite a tasty morsel. With this in mind, one must understand why Kirby is so inclined to tracking down and finding the thief of his delicious treat. After finding out that the normally devious King Dedede is innocent of charge, Kirby discovers the Squeak Squad, a menacing band of baddies, is responsible. This leads to his trek through eight cute, colorful worlds in search of his dessert. The story is so bare-bones that it's hard to call it anything but ridiculous and unimportant, but one must ask how important a 2D platformer's storyline really is in the first place.With the 2D platformer standards already in sight, Kirby hits on all cylinders: the levels are fun and have a great design. Enemies fill up every one of them, some hidden in walls for an extra challenge. Kirby's suck-things-up skills come in handy like always, and there are more than 20 abilities to help the little guy get through each level and defeat his countless enemies. These abilities are mostly familiar; you'll spit fire, blow ice, and even emit sparks. Rather than only destroying enemies, some abilities affect your environment-for example, blowing ice over lava keeps the molten substance from burning Kirby. Another perk this time around is that Kirby can keep up to five abilities or items stored in his stomach, and using the touch screen, the player can combine things to form other abilities or items. I'd have liked to see more abilities, though. This is where Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards really excelled; letting the player combine several different skills for really fun effects. How could I forget Fridge Kirby?Kirby Squeak Squad doesn't offer much depth to its formula and rarely strays from what's worked in the past. One could go as far as to say that it's simply an update from the GBA titles, and those that really enjoyed Canvas Curse will be disappointed to find that the amount of gameplay modes and the depth found in each is noticeably missing here. Kirby Squeak Squad is as short as any Kirby game, too, clocking in at about five or six hours for a trip through each of the eight worlds. In its defense, there are collectibles that serve as a bonus for exploring each level. By finding treasure chests scattered through the worlds, you'll unlock things like enhanced abilities (throw a bigger Cutter!) and even different Kirby colors (paint him Green!) This extends the length of the game a few hours, but I only missed a few treasure chests in each world, so they're not much of a pain to go back and get.Kirby has a distinct style and this style was preserved very well in Canvas Curse, despite the major functional change. Squeak Squad has no excuse to mess this up, and it doesn't. The visuals are crisp, clean, colorful, and are 2D greatness. Kirby and everything in his world animates very well. The abilities yield some decent 2D effects. I'd have liked to see some 3D here and there, though-if a game like Super Mario 64 DS can deliver a totally-3D experience, I'd imagine a game like Kirby could integrate some 3D into its style, and Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards looked great. The music and sound effects have Kirby written all over them, so series fans will find a lot of familiar sounds and such.Kirby Squeak Squad is no Canvas Curse, but it's another great platform effort for the DS and yet another solid Kirby title. Though they seem to come out by the year, Kirby games always generate some excitement with younger crowds (partially thanks to the television series) and I'd imagine that age group will really enjoy this title as much as the others. One might notice that I gave Kirby Squeak Squad the same score as I gave Yoshi's Island DS. Both are solid DS platformers, and I'd say they're interchangeable-if you're into the Kirby series, check out Kirby. If you're into the classic Yoshi's Island, try that one. If you want to try both, by all means, it's no mistake on your part. Despite its shortcomings, Kirby is a fun game that joins New Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi's Island DS for a very solid trio of Nintendo platform games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2006"}

A breat of fresh air!","reviewText":"At my first glance, I looked at BulletStorm and immediatly thought \"Another lame shooter that would be a waste of money.\" Eventually I saw a video on Xbox Live which led to me downloading the demo. I had so much fun playing this game!Gameplay- The gameplay was what I thought would bring this game down. The gameplay is surprisingly smooth though. Sprint with the \"A\" button (such as in Gears of War) and you have option to melee with the right stick. Made it easy to adjust to. The objective is to either leash, kick or shoot your enemy in different skillful ways. Example- leash your enemy near you and kick them into a cactus with very large spikes. You get skill points for this which you can use for ammo and upgrades. Also as another reviewer stated, You can get stuck in random place not being able to move. It's happened to me at least 3-4 times but I've just pressed A twice to slide out of that spot.Graphics- Graphics are nice. Not Killzone or Gears of War nice but they are good. The characters are huge kind of like Gears of War characters but it fits the over the top nature of the game. The environments are where this game shines. They are beautiful and creative. Waterfalls and mountains make for nice visuals along the way.Game Modes- Of course the story isn't the games strong point. The story isn't bad either. So that I won't ruin it with spoilers I won't go on but the campaign is very short but with the wacky gameply it probably didn't need to be any longer. The Echoes and Multiplayer are the games strong points. Echoes you play solo while attempting to ge the best and highest skill points and skill shots to earn more stars. Multiplayer you can play the Anarchy mode, which allows you to play with up to 3 friends and fight through hordes of enemies. Each round gets harder but it's not just about killing the enemy. You much kill them in skillfull ways and earn enough points to move on to the next level. That makes the game different and fun. From what I've played of the multiplayer so far. It seems that they are having alot of lag problems. Hopefully they can get this fixed soon in a patch or update. I have held complete matches just fine though.Conclusion- This is a very good game.

Zack and Wiki are two new members of the Sea Rabbit pirates, out to seek treasure to pay off the group's debt. One day, after a run-in with their rivals, the Rose Pirates, they discovered the talking skull of Barbaros. Wiki says that this guy is a legendary pirate, with a treasure ship hiding in Treasure Island. Barbaros promises to show them the treasure if Zack and Wiki put his body together again and break the curse on him.The game is a masterpiece. Although this is a point-and-click game where players explore an area with the remote, this also involves a lot of movement. In order to move all the items and switches, players need to perform the actual motion with their remote. So if the person wants to pull down a switch, he/she has to hold the remote sideways and pull it down.And there's so many items with different hand motions. The mole drill works like a crank. The saw operates in a back-and-forth movement of the remote with two hands. And Wiki operates as a bell which transforms animals into these items. Simply shake the remote, and they turn into items.There's plenty of secret items to find as well. I found everything from playable music to the Megaman sprite to movies from \"Zak and Wiki.\" Although they're hidden in the level, I sent out my rabbit minion, Madfrey, to find all the goodies for me.But the game is very challenging. In fact, it almost gets frustrating in the second-to-last level trying to swing that sword against mummies because the controls were frustrating. And I had to restrain myself from throwing a fit during the really long levels. The game needs checkpoints, because I really hated playing each level over and over again, just because I forgot to tighten the rope or I shot the harpoon at the wrong time.Thankfully, there are few complaints. The controls are extremely innovative for a game. I really hope Capcom continues this excellent puzzle series, because it is pretty groundbreaking. I never thought sawing trees or pouring liquids with my remote would be so much fun. Let's just hope that Capcom can fix those sword controls before the next installment in the series (in case there is one).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001COV1CY","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Takes online multiplayer squad based objective shooters to a new level","reviewText":"UPDATE:Ugh.  I picked MAG back up a few days ago to play it again, because of fond memories (see below).  There was a gigantic 658mb patch that had to be installed -- the installation and downloading, both, took forever.They've totally changed the skill and promotion structure.  What garbage.  If you come in as a new low level player forget about enjoying yourself at all.  It takes forever to get anywhere in regards to upgraded skills of any value and upgraded (by a purchase system) weapons.  You will be so outclassed that it won't be enjoyable.  I've put about six hours in on the new design -- frustrating, not fun, a total waste.The skills are now organized that you have to buy lots of mundane junk to get anything that is good -- and you get those points by advancing in levels.  Many, many levels are required to have skills of any significance.  There is also a currency system -- you earn money while playing/winning -- that you have to spend to buy better gear, guns, and attachments.  Sounds good, right?  There are crippling level minimum requirements.  It will take a long time before you have any decent gear.Essentially, this game now has a heavy \"late bird\" syndrome.  If you haven't been playing for long enough to accumulate a good character, or you aren't willing to be constantly brutalized for a very long time (20+ hours, minimum, if not much longer) then you should just pass on this game.It's too bad.  They ruined a good game.  Lastly, very few people play it anymore.  I couldn't get a domination game (256 player) going at all.  There are, maybe, a few thousand people playing at any time -- maybe not even that -- and most are spread through out the various game modes.ORIGINAL:Anyone who finally finds my review will probably have read through many other reviews which cover many view points which exonerate or denounce various aspects of the game.  I will plainly say that this game really does take objective based military style shooters to a whole new level.  Yes, the game has issues, and yes there are kinks with how it all plays out -- but really, when you play a good game of Domination (a 256 player objective based game that runs for up to 30 minutes), you will know what I'm talking about.  The game may strike you well right off the bat, but as you play more and more you'll be even more amazed.The game, when played with people who are even semi-serious (and believe me, there are more than you would think), can be completely immersing.  You play as one of a squad of eight, and in the case of Domination, you are in one squad of sixteen!  Each squad has a leader, which has unique abilities, each group of four squads has a platoon leader that has his/her own abilities, and finally when there are enough players in a game (such as Domination) you have an Officer in Charge who, also, has unique abilities.The command structure works pretty well, especially with someone with any experience in the leadership duties and commands.  Learning the abilities and commands is a little bit of a challenge the first few times, but over all it is fairly intuitive.  A microphone and headset, in my opinion, is imperative to not only enjoying the game but ultimately being successful.  Communication is a barn burner.  As a squad member your objective is clearly marked and relevant items/resources/positions on the battlefield are marked in your view.  You can use an overhead map to see the entire battlefield, if necessary.  Most of the time in larger games you end up in your own little sector doing whatever is required for your team.Here is what is amazing.  Let's say there is a lull in your particular sector, for maybe a few seconds.  You pan and scan and you see, off in the distance, intensive fighting.  Here's what gets me:  That is all real.  Those are other players in their own combats, defending or attacking their own targets, whatever.  You (or your squad, etc) can go engage that portion of the battlefield, if desired or necessary.  It's unbelievable.The chaos of battle is especially thick with many players on the field.  As defenders, if things go poorly, you may be squeezed into smaller and smaller sections of the map and the frantic aspect of the game will emerge.  Imagine forty or fifty people trying to fend off another forty or fifty people, all the while various forms of artillery and air strikes are going off.  Squad mates falling, calling for medics, enemies flanking, perimeters being established...I've said enough.  If you aren't enticed, if you aren't intrigued, if you aren't already figuring out where to buy a copy from then there isn't much more anyone can really say to you.  For those who sally forth:  enjoy!  There is much to be had.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Most over rated game and series of all time","reviewText":"I have been trying to like this series since the first game. I've purchased each and every title and tried to like it--I can't. But before I begin, let me say two things. First, this IS the best RE game ever made. Second--although its the best ever--that isn't saying much.For starters, let's go with what they got right, which was plenty. Bravo for coop play and a variety in terms of several campaigns to play through. Very nice.They also made an attempt at fixing the game's controls, though they failed miserably. Still, they tried to fix it and I have to give them credit for that.I enjoy the cooperative game mode outside of the campaign. Those always help to extend the life of a title for me, so thank you folks for that.Now to what they didn't get right. First, the controls are still terrible. Of course terrible controls is still a HUGE step up from RE5. In any case, the controls are likely to leave most players feeling far more frustrated than satisfied.The melee system is clunky and awkward.The cut scenes...I'm all for a good story. A lot of people complained that Gears of War 3 had too many cutscenes, but that didn't bother mea  bit. But this game--ouch. You spend very little time playing the game at times, which wouldn't be so bad at all if the characters were actually people I cared about in any way--they aren't. Another weakness of the game.The ammo issue is by far the most irritating (and that is saying something) part of the game. I realize they want it to be suspenseful and all that good stuff, but the implementation is beyond bad. There are parts of the game where you literally have half a dozen soldiers with you, all armed to the teeth--but you are always nearly out of ammo. On top of that, item drops and ammo don't even pick up automatically. You have to run around to each and every item and push a button--even to get your xp!It's not a bad game and probably worth a day or two playing if you've got a buddy to enjoy it with. But don't buy this title new. Even at 40 bucks the vast majority of consumers will feel ripped off, and rightly so.Frankly, I'm surprised that this series has garnered so much attention over the years. There are those that say the 'scary' elements are gone and this is too much like a shooter. Maybe they have a point, but one thing is certain--this game is barely average no matter which perspective you're coming from.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platformsChains of Olympusbinds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.Combat Moves, Both Old and NewNearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes allGod of Wargames andChains of Olympusis no exception.Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future.

The 5 games are: Tennis, Golf, Baseball, Bowling and Boxing. It also features a training mode to get you familiar with the controls and a fitness mode, which actually was a sneak peak as to what Wii Fit, another game, would turn out to be. Tennis, Golf and Bowling allows up to 4 players play either at the same time or alternately. Baseball and Boxing allows up to 2 players play at the time same.The training mode allows up to 4 players and is comprised of mini games. These mini games lets you earn medals and unlock new ones. The fitness test mode allows only one player to go through it and rates you level of fitness by measuring your progress after you complete 3 mini games chosen at random. As for the main sports based games, once you pick one to pay, it gives you the choice to add your Mii to play and after a few more prompts, you're set to play.The PROS: If you ever wanted to host a night of gaming at your place and you want all of your guests to get involved, this is the game you want to show. Hardcore and casual players can jump right in. The controls are spot on and once you learn how to use the Wii mote and Nunchuk, you can basically play against anyone you come across. Tennis, Gold, Bowling and Baseball are fun choices and are easy to get into and play. The training mode is perfect to hone in your skills for the different games while the fitness mode does get you on your feet and sometimes can give you a quick workout. The music and sounds aren't too overwhelming and fit the mood perfectly.Plus, all the Miis you created can be used in the game as well as any other Miis you have stored as well.The CONS: This game will not be known for having the best graphics. They are pretty basic overall as well as the presentation. Of all the games, Boxing is the only one that seems to not recognize when you throw punches as you flick the Nunchuk and Remote. You'll find yourself repeating the same gestures before the game registers it. This game is fun to play by yourself but it was went to be played with others. Lastly, since the Wi-Fi Connection wasn't up and running yet at the time of its release, you cannot play against anyone online, which would have been cool as hell.Overall, despite its shortcomings, Wii Sports is a great game to play and to get other gamers, hardcore and casual, to get off your feet and enjoy themselves. Even if this game did not come with the purchase of a Wii, it would have still sold like hotcakes. It won't set your world on fire with HD graphics or superior audio/sound effects but it shows that a game can be fun to play with. And gamers love to play games, whether by themselves or with other people. Give this game and chance and then buy the sequel, Wii Sports Resort.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2011"}

The plot is great and the voice acting is amazing and often humorous. The graphics and music are fine and the ability to create weapons in the factory and level them up adds a huge bonus to this game's fun factor. The synthesis is amazing, and searching for the legendary swords was exciting. Overall this game is a fun sixy-hour experience. I'd like to point out that, like many recent games, the back of the case tricks you into thinking that the game is 100+ hours. It is if you sit there and play it for 100+ hours, that is such false advertising (they say that on Disgaea 2 as well). Any game can be 100000 hours if you play it for that long.

However, this is not an AWFUL game, it is fun when it works! There is two different ways to play the game but in the end you kind of just wish this game was just FPS to begin with like the Metroid Prime games.

Need I Say More?!","reviewText":"Back when I was first researching Final Fantasy XII, I'd read reviews that would say things like \"I'm disappointed that this isn't more like Skies of Arcadia\" or \"I was expecting a Skies of Arcadia feel to this game\".  I even saw references to Skies of Arcadia when I researched Grandia III (yep, the Grandia III reviewers were also disappointed that the game wasn't more like Skies of Arcadia).  Eventually I got curious enough to actually research the infamous game, itself, and wouldn't you know it?  It's considered an RPG classic in some circles.  A classic and I've missed it?!  Well, I've played it now!  Is it any good?  Well, here's a hint - it's better than the other two games I've mentioned!Graphics (score 8/10): I don't have a whole lot of experience on the gamecube yet, but the graphics seem pretty average to me.  There aren't any fancy cutscenes here a la Final Fantasy VII through Final Fantasy X, as everything looks pretty similar to the actual in-game graphics during the scenes.  Graphics aren't everything, though; it's what you do with them!  Skies of Arcadia doesn't disappoint here; there's loads of creatively designed environments to keep things visually interesting.  I just love the look of Skies of Arcadia - there are all these floating islands in the middle of a vast sky and it's just awesome!  This is a lesson that Final Fantasy XII should have picked up on - it doesn't matter how technically gorgeous your graphics are if you don't give us anything creative and interesting to look at.Music (score 8/10): The music itself is pretty good - I have no complaints at all.  However, I do have some issue with the voice acting.  I don't mind the phrases they shout in battle - that's pretty standard in an RPG.  However, there is a sort of limited voice acting for cutscenes where the dialogue will be in text, but characters will occasionally shout a phrase during their turn of the conversation.  This really irked me at first because the phrase they'd shout was related to - but never the same as - the written dialogue.  For example, the text will read \"I'm really grateful to you\" and the voice over will say \"Thank you so much\".  As the game went on, though, I sort of got used to it so it didn't bother me as much.Characters (score 9/10): The main characters (Vyse, Fina, Aika, etc.) are fairly well-developed in that they have distinct personalities and back-stories.  They aren't the most complex characters I've ever seen, but that's okay.  They serve their purpose to the story and they are all likable.  As for the villains, they all possess their own distinct personalities and some of them show a bit of complexity to their character (like Ramirez, for example).  Furthermore, the side characters (such as the ones who join your ship's crew later) even have their own back-stories and likable characterizations!  If you consider all three categories of characters, this game deserves a high score in the character section.  As a side note, there's one side character who you can recruit for your crew named Lawrence who's always intrigued me.  I always got the feeling that there was a whole back-story to him that you never get to learn about.  I mean, he's rather introverted and antisocial, and keeps to himself, and at the end of the game (once you've beaten it), he just disappears to sell his services elsewhere.  He sort of reminds me of what it would be like if Squall from FFVIII were in this game as a side character and you never got to hear any of his thoughts.  Sigh...  Lawrence, I wanna know what makes you tick...Story (score 9/10): You play as Vyse (a sky pirate) who goes off in search of adventure but winds up chasing down magical crystals in an attempt to keep them from an evil empire that's trying to take over the world.  Yes, I know it sounds familiar, but the writers managed to make it feel fresh and fun.  I really enjoyed the storyline for this game - not because it's particularly complex (like Final Fantasy VII) or particularly deep and philosophical (like Xenogears), but because the pacing is phenomenal.  I don't normally comment on an RPG story's pacing unless it's dismally bad, but in this case, it's so good it's worth mentioning.  Even though the story itself isn't groundbreaking (it's filled with the usual RPG tropes, but just enough twists to keep it interesting), it moves along at such a brisk pace that I wasn't bored at all.  In fact, I remained completely eager to find out what was going to happen next.  So, the story basically is action-focused rather than deep and philosophical, but the game knows how to play up its strengths.  I mean, the story does a good job of keeping things from getting stale - just when you think you know what's going to happen next, the story throws you for a loop (for example, you think you're just going to go retrieve another crystal, but you wind up shipwrecked instead).  Overall, I'm quite satisfied.Battle System (score 9/10): There are basically two types of combat in this game: character battles and ship battles.  The standard character battles where up to four members of your party fight monsters in turn-based combat should be pretty familiar to anyone who's ever played another typical RPG.  There's the usual aspects such as regular attacks, special attacks, items, and magic.  This is fairly standard stuff and it works just fine.  The only little complaint I have with the character battles is that the strengths and weaknesses of the various types of magic aren't terribly intuitive.  In fact, I can never remember which element is strong against which without pulling out my notes I've written on it.  Now, let's talk about ship battles.  For the most part, these control similarly to character battles - you choose about four commands and then they are carried out that turn.  My only complaint with ship battles is that they can feel rather tedious.  The camera pans out every turn to show shots of the ships circling around each other.  While this makes the battles feel more dynamic and visually interesting and realistic, it also slows the battles way down.  I can't really complain about this too much because the game doesn't throw that many ship battles at you compared to the regular battles.  In addition, I can't think of any other way to carry out these battles that would look nearly as good.  Maybe the developers knew it would get tedious and decided to minimize the actual number of ship battles you have to do?  Well, either way, I appreciate it.Gameplay (score 9/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, first off, let's start with my random complaints.  The camera swings a bit too slowly for my liking, and it can be a bit funny in places, almost like it doesn't want to turn for me. The encounter rate at the beginning of the game is a little bit high, but you can remedy this by doing the moonfish sidequest and getting the White Map, which reduces the encounter rate.  Also, I wish the airship could fly a bit faster as it can feel rather slow going back and forth to places you've already been.  And, um, well I guess that's all my complaints!  Now, let's talk about the good stuff!  The game is nice enough to give you a fully functional and nice map!  Also, there are plenty of sidequests available to give you some replay value.  There's also the \"Swashbuckler Rating\" which is basically a point system that awards you points for proving your dashing adventurousness by correctly answering certain dialogue options.  This can give you some replay value since you can try out different dialogue options if you replay the game.  Lastly - and this really deserves mentioning - the game never feels like your being forced to grind.  Grinding is one of my least favorite parts of most RPGs.  I know it's sort of part and parcel to RPGs and it can feel very rewarding once you reach that desired level, but the grinding isn't really the fun part to me.  I haven't had to grind once the whole game, which really compliments the brisk pacing of the storyline.  In other words, it's been smooth sailing the whole way!Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  You know, I'm starting to understand why people refer to this game as a classic.  I don't know if I've been playing crap recently, or if this game is just awesome, but I haven't had this much fun in ages!  I understand now why people who played this previously were disappointed by Final Fantasy XII - compared to Skies of Arcadia, Final Fantasy XII is a grind-filled bore-fest.  This may not be a particularly philosophical work of art, but Skies of Arcadia knows how to keep it light and fun.  If you're a jaded RPG veteran who's played just about everything over the years but you haven't played this game yet, I strongly suggest you pick it up.  Even if you have to buy a gamecube just to play this game, just do it (gamecubes are pretty cheap now anyways) - it's totally worth it.  Skies of Arcadia will remind you why you fell in love with the RPG genre in the first place.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}

Yes, the games were a lot of fun and required you to think about how to go about proceeding with elimination of your target, but fail in comparison to the sheer enjoyment I experienced during my time playing Hitman: Absolution.There are no spoilers, but I will touch briefly on character situation types to explain the dynamics of the game.Of course you play as Agent 47, a surgical tool of precision as it pertains to assassination.  In this recent title, he is in top form, with a plethora of weapons and kill techniques at his disposal.  The game grades you as you progress and eliminate targets.  It also takes away points if you make errors, such as if you kill non-targets or civilians, or if you are spotted (identified as a killer).  There are a number of disguises in each and every mission for Agent 47 to wear in his current quest to eliminate his targets.  Herein lies my only real gripe with the game.When wearing, for example, a cop uniform, henchmen won't take too much notice of you, but other cops will - and if you don't have any \"instinct\" left, they can (and usually do) become suspicious of you.  Now, with most cities there are at least 100 cops - and I am sure it is impossible for them to recognize each and every face that is on their police force...so how would they know if a clean-shaven, bald guy is an imposter?  In real life they wouldn't, but, to make the game a challenge and not a total breeze to skate through, they had to make cops recognize you aren't a real cop.  While I understand why they did it, the feature ultimately just makes you shake your head.Aside from that, everything is stellar.  The soundtrack and ambient sounds, as well as speech and cutscene dialogue is of phenomenal quality and quantity, and the gunplay sounds like something out of a John Woo movie.  As far as a third-person action title goes, this game is phenomenal.  For me, on a few missions, I completely disregarded the score system and just went through the whole level determined to play it as a run-and-gun title.  It must be stated that, while the scoring system makes this discouraged, it is entirely possible - and outright amazing.Agent 47 has a number of ways to kill - throwing screwdrivers or knives, slitting people's throats with filet knives, popping someone's dome with a silenced pistol or knocking them over backwards with a shotgun blast to the chest - not to mention plastic explosives.The levels are varied and require much thought with how you want Agent 47 to proceed so as to get the best score - and how you want to eliminate his enemy - creatively, crudely, or silently.I am very picky with action games I play and hate annual, \"force-fed-type\" games.  Hitman: Absolution is not one of them.  It is a well-crafted tale of revenge and absolution, a tour-de-force of the Hitman himself, Agent 47, a true work of art.  Above all, it is a must-have action title that will have you playing for weeks after purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2013"}

As other reviewers have pointed out, black ops is modern warfare 2...set in 1968.  First, I've got to say that the sheer amount of content packed into this game is absolutely staggering, but just content isn't enough to fill some of the game's flaws.  My main criticism is that Treyarch have seemed to just copy-and-paste modern warfare 2 and make some balancing tweaks and add new perks.  Hell, even the graphics are slightly inferior, which is just odd.  The RC car is absolutely overpowered, worse than the predator missile found in modern warfare 2.  A few things I have to applaud treyarch for doing are no nuke, insane customization, and a more balanced game.  I've experienced a few glitches and infinite care package glitches here and there, which is just mind-boggling.  How could that specific glitch make its way back into black ops from modern warfare 2?  If you're just an ordinary call of duty fan that absolutely loved modern warfare 2, you'll either hate it or love it depending on what aspects of modern warfare 2 you liked.  The single-player is the second best I've played in a cod game, second only to infinity ward's excellent and brilliantly paced call of duty 4: modern warfare campaign.  The pacing in black ops is absolutely over-the-top.  There is never a time to catch your breath, the explosions just keep on coming, and bullets keep on firing.  For some people, this may be a good or bad thing.Now, the multi-player is the meat of the game as that's where you'll be spending your hours away.  For the most part, everything seems polished and balanced although the RC car has got to be the worst kill-streak I've ever had to experience.  Unlocked only after 3 kills, this thing freaking kills like a mad-dog.  It's just overpowered.  Other than that, I don't have any gripes at the moment other than that infinite care package glitch that some people are using all the time now.Overall, black ops is an enjoyable experience with tons of replay value packed just like any other call of duty game.I rate it 4.5/7 overall and I suggest you buy it when you can.  Solid game, although it seems too much like a copy-and-paste and refine job to me.  Also, the removal of campaign co-op mode was disappointing.  I don't know why treyarch would take that feature out when they first introduced it in world at war.  The strong familiarity of many aspects of the game along with slightly inferiority in graphics is well made up for with the large amount of content packed into this game including the beloved zombies mode which is an absolute blast to play!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
