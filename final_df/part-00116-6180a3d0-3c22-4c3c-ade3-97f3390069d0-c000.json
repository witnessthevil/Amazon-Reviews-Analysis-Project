I won't go into all the reasons why, since they've been covered in detail elsewhere. But there were a few things that kept me from giving this a five star rating...First, car chases are frustrating. They are sometimes driving these huge clunkers, and yet they can rip around corners three times faster than you and completely violate the laws of physics.But the major complain I have concerns the \"evidence\" when you are accusing someone of lying. I won't give away any spoilers here, but there were a great number of times when the \"correct\" answer and evidence did NOT in any way prove the person was lying. They really should have had someone go through the game a little more carefully, because anyone under the sun would have caught it. Seemed a little rushed in that respect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"Randi Morse","summary":"Fun, But I Miss Individuality","reviewText":"We are HUGE Mario fans in this house, but there's something about Mario Party 9 that bothers a few of us here. Our 11 year old son, the Mario fanatic, loves the game - our 7 year old daughter, is \"meh\" about the game - my husband hates the game and enjoys the minigames - I am torn.I love the new mini-games. They're fun and yet easy enough for just about anyone to play. My favorite so far is the most simple: you select a box that says something like \"you +3\", and it moves your platform up 3 spaces. Once you get up 10 spaces, you win! See? Simple!This time around, however, Mario and his crew are all together in a boat (or a car...or something else) taking turns together. The person who rolls is the \"captain\", and the others just sit along for the ride. So this means that you don't get to choose where you go on the board.I, for one, really enjoyed the ability to select where I wanted to go. I loved that there was a touch of strategy to the game. Now? There's really not as much.NO MORE ITEMS. THIS annoys me. I also enjoyed being able to go the store to purchase items. Yes, it may get frustrating if someone was taking forever (then you just whack them with a pillow), but again, you could strategize. Now the only item you get is a dice block. A DICE BLOCK?? Boring and definitely nowhere near as strategic as the old way.I realize that Nintendo may be trying to freshen up the series, but the problem is that they have solid, hard-core fans who loved the older way. There are all sorts of things they could've done (like on the ocean map the shark that can get you and take stars away - very cool), without taking away the player's individuality and ability to strategize.I give it 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}

It's similar in many ways, but better in none and worse in many.You have similar weapons like the shotgun and the \"Blacktail\" handgun. It is 3rd person, you have an inventory, and you walk around a mall doing missions. All missions are given out as subtitled blurbs.The graphics are bad. There is a Japanese influence to the way things look. Meaning that it is similar to that certain Japanese style where they dumb down the graphics/art to do it faster and cheaper. The items, interface, and subtitles in this game are done as such. Sort of like No More Heroes except without the excuse of being \"Edgy & Stylish\". So any item you pick-up, i.e. fruit (for health), will look blocky and pixelated.When you kill in Resident Evil: 4 it is fun and looks good and you can blow people's heads off, but in this game it just \"pushes enemies\" when you shoot them instead of having guts flying all over the place. A zombie (or whatever) in Resident Evil:4 would react to getting hit in the leg, in this game not so. The blood is super bright red, very fake and what you would expect from some older game.This game is actually a rehash from an Xbox title.The selling point of this game is killing a ton of zombies in a variety of ways. That's one of the problems right there. You kill a lot in this game. I racked up over 300 kills in 15 minutes not really even trying. There are a lot of zombies, just hoards of them. So what's the problem, that sounds good right? There are just too many zombies on-screen to render them all with good graphics. So it is quanitity over quality as far as looks go. Hence the graphics and game physics take a hard hit.If you've played Resident Evil 4, you're probably going to be disappointed with this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An imaginative, bizarre, and completely insane action masterpiece","reviewText":"I've been a fan of the beat em up genre for a very long time.  It started with Renegade and Double Dragon back in the NES days, and then continued with games such as Final Fight and the Streets of Rage series in the 16 bit era.  During the PS2/Xbox era, this genre took a huge leap forward.  With the release of games such as Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden, the combat in this genre evolved into something that became brilliantly complex and added an entirely new dimension of depth to the gameplay.  And now, with Bayonetta, the genre has reached what is perhaps its peak moment.  Bayonetta is an action game that sets a new standard with its fluidity and depth, and is wrapped in a package that shines in a way that is so outrageous and creative, that you can't help but admire it.The character you control, Bayonetta, is a witch with a mysterious past.  She's getting relentlessly attacked by angles and other heavenly forces, and it's up to her to fight back and destroy them in the most violent and creative ways possible.  That's pretty much the gist of the narrative.  There is a story here, but it almost seems to be intentionally convoluted, and also seems to purposely not take itself very seriously.  Instead, the focus is on the fantastical individual events that display an absurd amount of humor, sexuality, and creativity.  This is a game that delivers an onslaught of sense-overloading stimuli and never ceases to entertain.  The level designs themselves begin with somewhat standard fare, but soon progress into epic set pieces that will have you stopping in your tracks, just to absorb everything that's going on around you.  Your enemies are savage and ruthless, and give off an uncomfortable contradiction to their heavenly origins.  The boss fights are some of the absolute best of this generation...absolutely epic and intimidating, and really give you a sense of accomplishment once you bring them down.  Overall, the game is like nothing you've ever seen before.  A real feast for the eyes and ears that at times borders on TOO much, but never crosses that line.The heart and soul of Bayonetta is the combat.  I could honestly take up the space of 3 or 4 full length reviews when discussing the incredible combat system of this game.  In a nutshell, this game sets a new bar for depth , tightness of control, and just overall awesomeness to its fighting system.  Throughout the game, you'll be able to acquire new weapons, techniques, and accessories, but what is really stunning is that almost everything is available to the player right at the beginning before they even realize it.  Bayonetta's fighting techniques are seemingly infinite in the numbers of combinations you can execute and chain together in battle.  You will be forced early on to master the dodging technique, as not only is it necessary to survive, but it also triggers a \"Witch Time\" mechanic that slows your enemies down and allows you to unleash brutal vengeance upon them.  As you play through the game and your skills evolve, you'll start to realize that the more moves and combos you master, the LESS it is that you know about the combat.  You will realize the incredible possibilities that Bayonetta is capable of, and this will encourage you to play through the game again and again.  This is SO refreshing in an era where many similar games are way too button-mashy and don't reward/encourage skill and creativity in their combat.  As an incentive to learn more, you are rewarded after each battle, based upon how well you performed, with currency to purchase items, power ups, and new techniques.  The controls are wonderfully responsive.  Bayonetta will do what you want her to do, when you want.  And most importantly, it is always fun, no matter what style of fighting you choose to adopt.  This is the best combat system I've ever experienced in a game of this genre, and that is saying a lot.Not to say the game is completely without some minor flaws.  There are some camera issues at times in the areas where Bayonetta is fighting enemies in more narrow corridors.  One of the final stages of the game has some major control issues during a mind-tripping vertical walk across some disappearing/reappearing platforms.  The colors can appear to be somewhat washed out in some areas, and screen tearing occurs at times (both of these issues are, from my understanding, only on the PS3 version of the game).  But none of these issues are anything close to game-breaking.  In fact, they're barely minor annoyances.  You will be so wrapped up in this crazy game world, slaying the forces of heaven with the most badass fighter to ever grace a game of this type, getting completely caught up with the insanity taking place around you, and having an incredible time the whole way through.  Platinum Games has won a spot in my heart for delivering this blood-pumping action masterpiece that surely goes down as one of the best in its genre.  Buckle up and enjoy the ride!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2012"}

Hardly any \"HotKeys\" and most of the ones that are there, require you to hold shift.  Even the \"Trader\" (the place where you go to buy items from other players) has a horrible search system.The Good:  Combat is fun, and challenging.

(tell the Ouya gals and guys they need to use this for their slogan!)I have only been toying around with the Ouya for about 8hrs now, but one has to really appreciate that a small start up like Ouya actually understands gamers more than Sony and Microsoft do (Nintendo still mostly gets it). Here is a system that out of the box is easy to setup, easy to use and most importantly has tons of FUN games that are all free to try. But that's not all, Ouya actively encourages you to do more with their box:Want to watch movies in any format? Load up XBMC or Plex!Want to use Netflix? Load the App!Want to listen to music? Load Pandora!Want to watch TV? Load any number of TV apps!Want to play oldschool games? Load up an Emulator!... and there are so many more on the way!But what Ouya understands is not all of us want the above shoved down our throats like Microsoft is doing. With Ouya it's games first, everything else second and then only if you choose. And as gamer of 28+ years I greatly appreciate this!The system itself is tiny 3x3x4\" cube and the controllers (picked up extras) are tight and responsive. The initial firmware update finished in less than 30sec and setting up a new account was quick and easy, unless you back up a screen, then you have to put everything back in again >_&lt;. The home screen is easy to navigate and the amount of games available in the 'Discovery' area on day one is simply amazing. Games download quickly, load quickly and (so far) game play is responsive and fun! Dropping back to the home screen is nearly instantaneous and the over all smoothness of the interface make trolling around all the settings a joy. Side loading apps is a simple 1,2,3 guided youtube video away for newbies and a snap for gurus.Overall I am very pleased with the Ouya thus far as it has allowed me to retire a Boxee Box, an HTPC and nearly the Xbox360 all in one blow. Hardware is good, not next gen level mind you, but then it doesn't even come close to next gen price level either. Games are more hit than miss, and with the ability to demo every single one of them the chances of you wasting $5.oo ~ $15.oo (games are super cheap!) on a dud title is remote at best. Side loading apps (should you choose to do so) is where this device really shines as there will be nearly limitless possibilities for the foreseeable future.As an old school gamer I can truthfully say that this inexpensive little box of wonders is exactly what the console wars have been needing for years. Something that is fun, cheap and aimed at the hearts of gamers, not some fat cats stock portfolio.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2013"}

Raillard","summary":"Waste of a great idea","reviewText":"I was very much looking forward to this game, since I think that the idea is awesome.  Instead, I was let down, disappointed and frustrated at what might have been.  Here is the rundown:GRAPHICS: Mediocre.  Maybe the Xbox and my PC have spoiled me, but the PS2's graphics are really starting to show their age.  The grainy texture, meant to simulate a video feed, conveniently hides low-res textures and graphics.SOUND: Good, though I've heard much better.  Splinter Cell (a game after which Manhunt is patterned in many ways) does it MUCH better.CONTROL: Laborious.  Remember how fights in GTA 3 were somewhat laborious, especially with multiple baddies?  That's Manhunt.  The control is a little better, but still rather stunted and jerky, lacking the precision of Splinter Cell or Metal Gear.  The fights are button mashing affairs, with little difference between the hard and fast strike buttons.GAMEPLAY: Linear, repetitive and forced.  The game won't let you escape an area without killing, so there goes the stealth aspect.  You MUST gore the hunters in order to proceed.  The weapons vary, but be prepared for drudgery at the lower levels: you have your fists, a shard or a plastic bag.  Again, it's like Splinter Cell without the sense of purpose or mission, as you mindlessly dispatch yet another identical clone on your way to the next level, where you... mindlessly dispatch another identical clone.  The atmosphere is pretty good, though again the control and graphics conspire against this game.  If you want to run around and create havoc, get GTA 3; if you want stealth action, get Splinter Cell.  If you want to waste money, get Manhunt.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2003"}

This game is racy and violent and is definitely not intended for anyone below 17 or so, particularly today's teenagers.  Manhunt, the disturbed spawn of Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, is alive and well.  Cash utilises radar, sound and shadows of both respective games, Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell.  Like one of its brothers, whenever a stealth kill is performed,  the scene is broadcasted (like Tenchu).  The controls are nearly perfect, and the sound is exceptional, particularly with the use of the headset.  The Director is an interesting character.  He is more or less a wicked version of Otocon or Lambert, and he guides you along the way.  The use of ratings is particularly unique but not new.  But the use of the headset as a distraction device for the hunters, those attempting to kill you, is fun to use.Now to the bad parts --The graphics is bland, and I mean, bland.  The textures are horrendous, and the use of the same old greys, reds, etc. should be banned.  Second, the enemy AI is inconsistent sometimes.  Sometimes, the enemies are brilliant and soemtimes, they fall short of fellow Pet Rocks.  Next, the mission objectives are sometimes quite obscure.  Additionally, the missions can get tedious after a while because the story does not move.  Cash is dragged from one place to another without revealing much in terms of story.  Lastly, the level design is very linear.  Cash can not hang or jump onto objects.  The only thing he can do is hide...that's about it.Overall this game is good, but this game is not intended for children or teenagers.

I have to say, overall it's a lot more fun.  For the current low price, you are getting all six episodes.  The cute lego animation has improved somewhat, they particularly cleaned up episodes 1-3, the older of the two.  There are a couple of segments that run a LOT smoother (example number one is anakin's Pod race - completely annoying with the original, so much more zippy with this one - the original is included as a bonus race in this set just to show you).  There are a couple of extra segments added, as both bonus races and story segments.  Unlockables abound, which is the true challenge of the game and will probably keep you looking for hours and hours, and again if you set the game aside for a year or two.  controls are very beginner friendly and not the challenge of the game.  Yes you can wave the wiimote around, but don't expect fancy Jedi moves, just basic saber waving.

{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Fantastic Game, and a Trend that I hope continues","reviewText":"So this was one of the Wii U games I was very much looking forward too. I loved what they did with Donkey Kong Country Returns on the Wii/3DS and had High hopes for the new one. But did it meet my expectations? Let's see! (At the time of this review I've half or so of the game)-Graphics- 9/10The game is beautiful, it just shows that the Wii U isn't as weak as people think. The characters look great, the environments are lively and have a character to them and I just love the atmosphere of it all. It's great to see the game in HD, it's just fantastic all aroudn on the Graphical front.-Gameplay- 8.5/10DKC is of course a platforming game, you roll, climb, jump, swing on vines and shoot yourself out of barrels to get the the end, all while avoiding painful traps, sneaky enemies, and pitfalls to nowhereland. And as with DKCR, this game does it wonderfully. Adding in the fact that they added swimming and you have yourself a fun platformer. The levels in DKC:TF are longer than I expected them to be, but they don't feel like they are too long. One of the smaller issues I had with DKCR was that yes there were a lot of levels, but they felt short, some VERY short. This may have less levels, but there is far more substance to them and each level feels different. One level I'm dealing with Windmills, another I'm dealing with leaves being blown around by wind, etc...There are still the Mine Cart levels that have become so &#34;popular&#34; in DKC. These are some of the most brutal levels on the grounds that by the time you realized you needed to be on the upper rail to get that puzzle piece, it's too late. But still they aren't so unforgiving that it's unfair... yet. I know how quickly DKCR Ramped up, and I look forward too it.Apart from underwater stuff, new Kongs have been added! Well I say new but they are some old favorites they are just now playable.Dixie Kong - Probably the most useful of the kong Family in the older games. She had the ability to spin and glide to hard to reach ledges and areas, and save you from dieing most of the time. But since Diddy Kong gives that power in this game, her's has changed to an interesting new one, it's almost a double jump and it's quite helpful. It does take some getting used to though, but I've found it to be my favorite of the three at the moment.Cranky Kong - He's old and.... *gasps* Cranky. He grants you the power of the pogo stick. If i'm not mistaken this style of jump was also used in Duck tales, but having not played that game I can't confirm or deny that it's similar. It is however useful. It allows a higher jump (provided you have a ground/platform to bounce off of) it also is usable on normally dangerous terrain such as spikes or thorns. It can also be used on enemies. Of the three I think this is my least favorite, but I still like them all.Team Attacks - Each Family member has a different type of team attack, a bar will slowly fill on the top left of the screen, once it's full you can unleash a powerful attack that has a different effect depending on which Kong you are partnered with at the time.Diddy - Turns all enemies on screen into a Red Life BalloonDixie - Turns all Enemies on screen into a golden Heart (Golden hearts act as Extra HP that stack on your current life)Cranky - Turns all Enemies on Screen into a Banana Coin.By far the most useless is Cranky's. You get so many Banana Coins in this game it's ridiculous. Dixie and Diddy have useful skills though, I actually like Dixie's the most as it helps get through the level a bit more. Either way, all the skills kill all enemies on screen so no real loss for activating it!In some levels the game forces you to use one of the Kongs because they make sense for the level. In other cases you get to chose. THe barrel rotates and you can select which of your family members you wish to aide you. It really does chance how the level plays and I enjoy it, I have killed myself using Cranky Kong's power many times now.Most of the other stuff from DKCR is here again, rolling, ground pounding, etc... they took out the ability to blow on flowers and things, switching it instead for items you grab on the ground and pull them out. I like this change because I felt blowing on every flower I passed by was... frankly annoying.So why isn't gameplay 9 or even 10? Because while I don't mind the underwater Travel... they just HAD to put in a breath meter. I hate breath meters, I don't care about realism they just make water levels annoying and more stressful than needed. And yes, I'm bitter enough to bump it down to 8.5!-Difficulty- (No real rating to give)The game starts out fairly easy, as most games do, teaching you the controls and the things you have to do, how to do them etc... Fairly quickly though the difficulty does rise. The game does throw lives at you like crazy. I have something like 50 at the moment, despite having died on one level about 20 times. (Mine cart levels are my bane... cause I want all the puzzle pieces...). I hear the later levels aremore brutal and I look forward to it.A lot of my deaths are also contributed to me hitting the wrong buttons. I'll forget to hold ZR while going on a zipline and just fall to my death, I will press A instead of Y and jump to my death etc... So I can't blame the game fully on my deaths... I still have it in my head that i need to hit and hold Y to run like in Mario but... no you don't have to do that. I need to stop doing that because pressing Y means I'll roll off a cliff... which I do with alarming Frequency.One thing I will add as a note here are the bosses. This game, and DKCR, have some of the most unforgiving, brutal bosses I've gone up against in a platformer. You have little room for error, and if you fail you have to start all over from the beginning. This can lead to some Aggravating moments, but like Dark Souls, some great pride in beating that boss. Even the first boss beat me a few times.-Music- 10/10Something I have always loved about DKC games was the music, there are some fantastic tunes in the old games and they brought some of them into the new ones, remixed them and of course added plenty of new ones. And they are all amazing. The second I jumped into the water and heard a new version of Aquatic Ambiance I... OK I actually drowned because I was listening to the song, but I loved it and it made me smile. Each level has it's own song and they are all quite amazing. I would love to get a copy of this games soundtrack is possible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"J.

Over 120 plus hours of total combined gameplay, numerous additions and enhancements, and critically-acclaimed game and art design.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Good fun","reviewText":"Well here's a new one on me...RPG meets The Sims.Well not quite but it does mix RPG mechanics with a very heavy element of keeping up your social networking. The story of Persona 3 sees you as a young male student, new in town and joining a new school. You find out early on that something very odd happens to this school every night at midnight: a tower called Tartarus which is filled with monsters appears, and you (along with a few school chums) have been assigned to explore it and climb to the very top. As you go higher and higher in the tower, the monsters get tougher and there's a boss fight every few floors. You find items along the way and gain experience.Now this is all pretty standard RPG stuff. Fighting is turn based, and you have a arsenal of spells and physical attacks at your disposal. As in other Shin Megami Tensei games, all the enemies have certain weaknesses that you can exploit to get extra attack turns (and in the same way, so can they). Spells all have similar names as in the other games of the series (Agi, Mamudo, Rakunda, etc), and the usual status ailments still apply. This is all good fun and makes for battles that you usually have to think about rather then run in blindly every time. Monsters are visible in the tower so you can choose whether to attack or run past - whack them from behind to ensure your turn comes first! And if they catch you first they get the first turn in battle which can sometimes be lethal. In fact towards the end of the game, any time the enemy goes first can spell Game Over. Another thing to understand is that you can have a team of up to four people but apart from your own character, everyone else acts on AI. So you have to issue \"general\" orders to your team mates (ie Heal Only, Full on Attack, Save Magic points, etc) and let them decide how to interpret these. The good news is that the computer AI for the team mates is fantastic. Even when I left everyone on \"Act freely\", they always did really sensible things. And if you use the \"analyse enemy\" support function, they remember the enemy weaknesses in all future encounters and only use effective attacks. Very clever. I found this one of the best computer controlled team-mate games I have ever played.Apart from this, it's pretty similar to other Shin Megami games, especially in the annoying habit of enemies using far too many instant death spells which is cheap and REALLY annoying!The series also retains the process of monster fusing. As in previous  games you keep a team of monsters (called Personas in this game), and as your collection grows you can fuse them together to make better ones. The slight difference is that they are not captured in battle any more (all the monsters you fight are different to the Personas), but have to be \"won\" as random rewards at the end of battles. These will be familiar to fans of the series, as Pixie, Ganesha, Sati, Angel and all the rest are back to entertain you again, plus a few more. You can keep a stable of monsters with you at any time and try them all out! In contrast your team mates only have one permanent Persona each, but they all have interesting abilities and weaknesses, so you'll be choosing carefully who you take with you into boss fights.So now, here are the differences. And they are mainly in what happens when you are not fighting your way through the tower. Well, when you are not fighting monsters, you spend game time leading a pretty normal life as a teenager in modern day Japan (game-world Japan, of course!). The game has a very big emphasis on time and dates. Unlike most RPGs where time is just kind of generally moving forwards, here it is divided into days on a calendar, and each day has it's own morning, daytime, evening and night-time sections. You'll soon find out that the times of the day dictate what is available for you to do, for example, every week daytime you are at school (boo!), and in the evening the shops are closed. On Sundays and school holidays you are free to do whatever you like, but during exam weeks, you can't do anything. And in the evenings you can go out, chat to people, or explore Tartarus. What will take up most of your attention during the days, though, is trying to establish lots of social links. This means making friends with lots of people, and making clever choices in conversations so that they start liking you more. It sounds a bit lame but this is actually a requirement of the game, as the monster fusing is more effective depending on how strong your personal relations are. So get on with everybody and you'll find you get stronger monsters! In a rather mean twist, the hero can have unlimited male friends, but be careful with the girls because as relationships grow, you'll find that they get jealous of each other so you can only ever have ONE strong female relationship at a time. Kind of limiting as there are about 6 girls in the game you can potentially create social links with. I guess there's no such thing as \"just friends\" with girls in the Persona universe.The game is fun and very addictive, but to my disappointment, it did verge on being repetitive at times. Each day that rolls past is pretty similar to the one before it. And climbing the Tartarus tower can start to lose it's novelty too, because the floors all follow a single standard design (it changes every 20 floors or so but still!), and some of the bosses can be tough, so you really do have to explore the same floors multiple times just to level up (the characters even call it call it \"training\"), which can really get tiresome. However the growth of personas is always a great lure to keep edging those levels up (what will be the next skill they learn??), and the battles are generally good fun, so I didn't mind too much. The story is also pretty good. Even the after-battle item rewards are fun: you get shown a choice of tarot-style cards with rewards on them , which are then shuffled before your eyes face down, and you have to watch carefully and then try and pick the one with the best reward on it! As basic as that sounds I found this NEVER got old!  Oh yes, and one very odd part of the game overall is that in battle, the way to summon a persona is to shoot yourself in the head with a special gun! Let's hope no impressionable kids try to copy that one eh?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2009"}

I can't think of anything else (besides dancing itself) that I could do for hours and never get bored or tired.  Dance Central I was a great game, but Dance Central II has improved on it in many ways.  I love that you can dance with a friend.The game now has a Crew Challenge mode where you can progress through dancing with different dance crews, either solo or with a friend.  When you earn enough stars, you can  move onto the next crew.  Or you can keep refining your technique to unlock the crew's \"street\" outfits.There are already some great songs available for add-ons to expand your gameplay, but the game itself comes with some classic hits, ranging from disco through hip hop.  Favorite songs from my era were The Humpty Dance and Baby Got Back.It costs about 5$ to convert all your songs for the original game, but if you had purchased songs for the original game, you can re-download them for free. At least, I was able to but it could be because I put this game on a new XBOX.I have a two year old who loves to watch me play and he even now does some of the dances - albeit not perfectly well.I can only offer one suggestion for Dance Central III. They should make it possible for users to record their own dance choreographies and challenge others, offering up their dances to the community.  I suppose song licensing could be an issue, but they could offer a few songs for dances.  I see so many possibilities for this technology, as a dancer.

{"product_name":"B000PS4X7S","reviewerName":"Gareth Mc Bride","summary":"My Pick for Game of the Year","reviewText":"Valve Software, the creators of the ground breaking and incredibly successful Half Life series have crafted one of the most addictive and enjoyable interactive experiences ever with their new release Left 4 Dead.The game began development at Turtle Rock Studios who had previously worked with Valve on various Counter-Strike projects before becoming part of Valve in 2008.Harkening to the classic George Romero Zombie movies, Left 4 Dead is an interactive 3D shooter that allows players to play as one of four \"survivors\" as they attempt to flee hordes of infected that have overrun the surrounding city and surrounding areas.Playing as either Louis, Bill, Zoey, or Francis, players can play along with the A.I. taking control of other the other characters or they can play along with friends or other gamers online. I found this to be a fantastic feature as I have always been a fan of being able to play a game in co-op mode and being able to play through the entire game with your friends adds greatly to the games enjoyment and replay value.The game is broken down into 4 chapters, each a mini movie that casts players in the role of a character. As the game loads, players see a throwback movie poster that complete with tagline, tells the name of the segment and the parts that each player will be playing.Each segment contains five levels and concludes with a finale that forces the survivors to face waves of enemies as they attempt to escape. The opening chapter, No Mercy, starts on a rooftop and tasks players with moving through apartment buildings, city streets, subway stations, hospitals and more as they attempt to reach the roof of a hospital for a possible rescue by helicopter.Armed with pistols, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles, and explosives ranging from pipe bombs and Molotov Cocktails, players will need every resource at their disposal to survive, as the infected are not the sluggish zombies of old. Instead they run, jump, and swarm, and never once let up their assault.Aside from infected, there are deadly forms of infected such as the Witch who alerts you with her child like crying before unleashing her fury. There are also Hunters who leap out of nowhere, Boomers, who coat you in vomit that attracts hordes of infected, Smokers who snare players with a long tongue, and the massive Tank who pummel anyone and everything in their paths.Players are able to load up on weapons they find during the game, but are limited to one explosive, one rifle, and 2 pistols but there are things such as gas and propane cans and other items that can be dropped and ignited to create a very satisfying wall of flame to bake advancing enemies to a crisp.There are also mounted weapons from time to time when forced to make a stand, and the rapid fire function of a mounted gun can help turn the tide against superior numbers.Another nice touch is the ability to push enemies away with your weapons as when surrounded or trying to reload, it helps to hit enemies with what your player is holding in order to dispatch them or gain needed space to deploy your weapon.As chapters unfolded, I was amazed at how well the look, tone, and feel of a Zombie movie had been captured. Other games have tackled Zombie infections before, but none have added the level of immersion of Left 4 Dead, and that includes the recent Dead Rising.The story of the game is cryptic, as there are some clues scrawled on the floors and ceilings of the maps, as well as on the walls of the safe rooms that conclude each level of a chapter.The graphics and sound of the game are first rate as aside from various quips and statements that the characters make from time to time, the game has some vast amounts of gore that allow you to mark the walls with everything from the blood of the infected to your bullet marks.Another nice feature is the use of health packs which are limited to one per character at a time. When a player is wounded, they may need another player to help them up, and bandage them. Since much of the game is based on cooperation between players, gamers may wish to use their health packs to aid teammates in much worse shape than they are, even though this will leave them without a pack until they can locate one later.If a player dies in game, they can be revived later by other team members provided at least one of them survive which is not always possible from the relentless attacks by overwhelming numbers.Players are also required to use their heads as shooting everything in site will only attract more enemies and while some may like this feature in order to earn more achievements, I prefer no setting off car alarms with random shots and bumping.Players also can play as the infected and in a 4vs 4 match pits four human survivors against 4 player controlled infected.My only regret with the game was that it can be completed in 5-6 hours, but thanks to randomized features and different skill levels, as well as the highly enjoyable game play, I do not think gamers will tire of this game anytime soon.Valve has once again set very high standards for others to reach to and have crafted a new franchise that not only will help pass the time until the next chapter of Half Life, but will also have gamers clamoring for more chapters.Left 4 Dead is highly addictive and enjoyable and is the leading candidate for our Game of the Year award.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2008"}

Ok now that i'm done advertising i'll just skip talking about the game.  You can probably read several other reviews that might even give away the story.  But i'll say this... after playing it about 6 times i've fainlly used every character to my hearts extent, but am too curious about the rumored endings.  Ok, i know that some games have several endings, just as Chrono Tirgger (the prequil to Cross, also available on Amazon).  It all depends on which characters you use to beat the game, at what point you beat the game in NewGame+ mode, and if you use the Cross or not.  There's too many variations on it, and i still can't make Harle stay!But what i'm going to talk about is the Sound Track.  That's right.  Ok you know the Boston Pops, right?  Well i'm sure they'd do much of the Chrono Cross music if there wasn't already a sound track for it.  I mean seriously, my own mother, a few friends, professor, and colleagues all could not believe that the music came from a video game!  It was immpossible to make them believe it, well some of them, until they heard it from the game themselves.  That's true, this has the best music that i've ever heard, besides the tracks in FF7 (probably becuase i loved that game and it didn't matter if it had no music).  It's also just as singsongy as Xeno gears(despite the fact that the music wasn't that great) and it is what drives the game along as well.  The polygon characters, which are great by the way, cannot really express saddness, desperation, hope, anger, all those things etc. but the music fully conveys that fact.  The combinations of the guitar and percussion instruments (harsh) against the flutes and Violins (soft) give it a really great &quot;fantastical&quot;.  I got it all off Napster (before Napster turned Tollroady on us) and burned it.  It's the only music that actually keeps me awake in the car on those long 8 hours drives (in excpetion to Star Wars).  Ok, so the music is great!  Get it just for the music!  And beat it so you can hear the ending theme and the credit music!  Ok... and get it becuase it's a decent game with many options, not really linear and not really open for your chosing.  There are hundreds of sidequests and the secondary character you don't even have to save or use after a certain point.  There's no silly side game like cards as complex and useless as FF9's or... that's all i can think of.Anyway, i have a PC and had sold my PS becuase FF7 and 8 came out for PC.  But then Chrono Cross came out and i immediately bought another POS/PS1 just to play Chrono cross.  Though be warned, theres a problem with older PS's about the second disk's startup... try turning the PS on its side or even turning it over.  I finally got it to work after 20 minutes, but i didn't mind as long as the background music was playing along  :-)Yes, worth buying, playing and listening to.  Enjoy a great game with many possibilites, all depending on what decisions you make.  Play it through once doing what you think is the &quot;linear&quot; path of the game, and then play it through with a more daring mind, trying to break away from the Linear method.  You'll be surprised at how different the game can be.  Of course it all comes down to the same thing in certain places... but even the second character in your party can differ between two characters, and the third can differ between 4... get the picture?

If you own an Xbox, you should own this game. It is not only the best Action RPG on the Xbox but one of the best RPGs played in recent memory.For those who have played KOTOR, this game will be instantly familiar. At the offset, you pick a character and are thrust into a world of moralities. Unlike KOTOR, the morality system is a little more complex for the most part. Instead of focusing on good and evil, your character has the choice of being endlessly helpful, understanding and tolerant of everyone (in other words believes in the power of the human spirit) or someone who reveres strength. As an example of this strength concept, there is a decision early on about a dam that is open and has caused problems for a town because the sailors are land locked. A wine merchant wants the dam to remain open so he can make a killing off of the sailors. If you follow the Way of the Open Palm you would probably close the dam so that the town can prosper in what is should be doing. If you follow the Way of the Closed Fist, on the other hand, would decide that if the town were strong they will survive this current hurdle and that it is only that, a hurdle. It gets a little more tricky than that and does open some areas for roleplaying your character and deciding what you would really do in that situation. Bioware is also wonderful at making you think about your decision as they give you new information just as soon as you make a decision that might change how you feel about the situation.My only complaint with the system is that while they say that the two paths are different from looking at things as good and evil, there are still some instances where there is a \"good\" and an \"evil\" way of doing things. I might have rationalized why I would be doing something that way, yet I would get points from the side I didn't want because it was clearly delineated as \"good and evil choice.\" So, that's a bit frustrating given that their system isn't supposed to be good and evil. But, overall the system works well and really makes you think.I didn't really care for KOTOR because of the battle system and that is probably the reason I'm enjoying Jade Empire much more. The fighting system is simple yet deep. As you progress you will learn different martial arts style that you can map to the D-pad for quick and easy access. And you will be constantly changing your styles as the techniques to defeat enemies will constantly evolve. Some monsters are immune to certain attacks so you will have to experiment and find the best ways of devastating your foes.On the simple side, the combat is really about rock, paper scissors. You have a quick attack and a time-consuming attack (and a knock back attack that really only helps when you are surrounded and need some space). When someone blocks you use your time consuming attack, otherwise you mostly use your quick attacks to offset their own long attacks. It's pretty simple and easy to used to. However, some battles can become a button masher either way you look at it. But it's still exhilarating and fast with many ways of deciding how you want to play. Do you want to focus on using weapons, martial arts, magic, transformations? A little of the above? It's all up to you.The game is beautiful most of the time. The art style is impeccable and really helps create a full-flesh universe. Since it's based on oriental myth, it doesn't take place in the Orient as we know it but a mythical world that incorporates themes from oriental culture. Because of this, the desiginers are free to create whatever their imagination can make. And it's beautiful. There are some places that I stood for awhile and just looked because it was so surreally beautiful and soothing. It made me wish that sometimes our world wasn't so industrialized and that we could go back to what was a more simple beauty. It was that affecting. However, sometimes, the backgrounds look painted on. Some of the hills and areas that act as blockades for where you can't go aren't that well designed. Also my character's body type makes me laugh because his pecs are super large and his abs are indented in his body that I laugh whenever I see it.The game moves impeccably fast as well. Your character runs and I mean runs through the areas. The framerate is great. But, like KOTOR before it, the game stutters sometimes when you are running and turning the camera. When the camera pans, the game flutters sometimes as it tries to take in everything that happens. In battles, the game hardly ever stutters. And the battles can end up having a good dozen or so enemies fighting you and your partner so they can get pretty hectic and the graphics engine does a great job keeping the motion moving.Aurally, the game is a treat. You will find some cameo voice actors that are immediately familiar (look for John Cleese in a hysterical role). The music is well done and has a wonderful oriental bent to it (of course). Also, Bioware hired a real linguist to help create the fictional language used in the game. It is very familiar to oriental language but isn't real. It was created solely for this game. And that's amazing.Unfortunately, my problem with the dialogue in the game is the same problem I had with KOTOR. It's great and all but all too often the plot developments and dialogue becomes a \"talking head\" type situation where anyone who has something important to say gets a close up of their face while their lips move and the dialogue is heard. This is unfortunate for me because I get impatient sometimes and will just read the subtitles and skip through most of their dialogue. It's never \"dynamic\" in cutscenes like in some RPGs I've played (hands down the best use of dialogue in an RPG goes to FFX that used dialogue to move the plot but it wasn't a novel dialogue, it was like movie dialogue). The dialogue in Jade Empire is sometimes like a novel. So, for those who aren't interested in talking heads delivering dialogue this might get annoying after a time. But the dialogue is genuinely well voiced and excellent.My only other complaint is the load times.  While not as annoying constant as Fable where each and every small zone no matter how small had to be loaded for a good 5-10+ seconds, it still is a pain when you have to go through zones for a quest.  For instance, in the beginning of the game you have to go through the town to the school (a load screen) to get a quest, go back to town (load screen) to talk to someone, then back to the school (load screen).  And it's unfortunate because the actual quest takes maybe a minute, but a good 20 seconds of the time is spent in load screens.  That's a uncharacteristic load time though as generally the areas are big and don't usually require many loads.  Although another incident where it is very noticeable is in an arena combat situation where before and after each arena battle it has to load for a good 5-10 seconds.  The kicker is, some of the arena battles are over in about a minute or much much less and yet you have to deal with two load screens comprising a good 10-20 seconds.  So, in some areas it can be annoying and definitely pulls you out of the game when you should be pulled further in.  And, it becomes especially annoying considering that games like Halo 2 are seamless after the original load.Overall, though, this game is gold.  It's perfectly plotted and paced and has Bioware's trademark in excellence stamped all over it.  It ranks as one of my favorite games this year so far along with God of War and Psychonauts.  I would definitely recommend buying this game.  There are some problems that I have noted but you know regardless of the problems, this is an excellent game with an excellent story.  And, at 22+ hours, this adventure is worth taking.**NOTE: You should definitely pick up the Limited Edition of it if you can still find it.  For the initial run they are all Limited Edition and after they are gone, you will only be able to get this, the standard game.  The Limited edition has a new character and weapon style and a making of as well as some other fun things.  Same price, so definitely check out the limited edition over this version if you want the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2005"}

So here's the solution?  Kinda.  The layout, size and overall design owes a lot to the controllers of the Xbox 360, which is a good thing.  The analog sticks also share their location with the 360, which again is a good thing in my mind.  So far, so good.The rest is a mixed bag.  The build is ok, but not great (you'll know it's a 3rd party controller), the texture is less than ideal, the button & stick (big dead zone) quality is a bit sub-par, and the required dongle is also a minus (it's more of a Sony semi-proprietary issue than anything).  The built in rechargeable battery and straight-forward USB charging cable is a plus, and battery life is respectable, as is charging time.Overall, it's a solid buy if you're looking for a 360 style controller for the PS3, but it's not perfect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}

But, most of the game takes place in darkly lit rooms, so you don't really notice.  However, the graphics are good enough to creep you out.Gameplay 8/10For a survival horror game, the combat is very good!  It's much better than the Japanese Survival Horror games (minus Resident Evil 4).  Most of the combat takes place with melee weapons like boards with nails in them, pipes, or sledge hammers.  If an enemy attacks, you can deflect its blow with a well timed block, allowing you to land a counterattack.  You can also play aggressively by attacking enemies and moving back and forth to dodge their swings.  Overall, the combat is very satisfying and the animations are great.  You can find guns with very limited ammo and head shots are lethal.  Expect to fight 1-4 enemies at a time, so watch your back!Sound 8/10The sound effects and music set the mood really well. You hear psychotic whispers and shuffling footsteps followed by maniacal shrieks as some psycho runs out of the darkness and tries to cut your face off.Levels 6/10The level designs are good, imaginative, and very creepy.  You can get lost, but it's pretty easy to get 'unlost' if you pay attention.Replay Value 5/10You can replay the game to find collectibles and get achievements.  There are also 2 different endings and different difficulty levels.Scary 8/10Condemned is one of the scarier games out there and it even rivals Silent Hill Homecoming.  Having a maniac run out of the darkness, trying to crush your skull with a lead pipe, is pretty scary.Condemned is Rated M for language, blood, gore, mature themes, and shouldn't be played by kids.  This isn't a zombie fantasy game, it deals with psychotic criminals and mutilated victims.Overall, if you want a scary game for a very cheap price, this one delivers.  The gameplay is good, the story is ok, and it is Very Scary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2009"}

The first half of the game is very entertaining, and there are options to delve deeper into Deadpool's history.  There are 8 different weapons Deadpool can unlock & use (4 melee & 4 guns) and the combat is all about using combos to increase damage.  For the first half I didn't want to stop playing.  The locales, level structure, and enemies were varied, and the dialogue was hanging me in fits of laughter.A little bit past the midway point, however, things began to get a little stale.  The same enemies would keep popping up and the button mashing combos became a bit too much.  In fact, I was moments away from the final confrontation, when the game became unfair.  I was not having much trouble defeating clones and not dying all that much, but the penultimate scenario threw too many waves of enemies that I didn't even care about the ending.  At one point, Deadpool himself comments about the ridiculous amount of waves of enemies.I was renting the game, so I didn't want to keep it TOO long, but if I had owned it, I might be tempted to revisit it some day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

I bought this game from them and ended up with a used copy. I still havent checked if the online pass code still works because I'm switching internet services and have no internet right now. I'm using my phone to write this review. Anyways the game is as good as ever, story, graphics, and gameplay. The story of the Uncharted series always makes me wanting more and more. Though I'm only on chapter 7 it feels as though little has happend. I've played for a couple of hours and then I'm already on chapter 5? WHAT?! But dont get me wrong there's plenty more story. As always the story seems realistic, believeable. And then takes a turn and throws something entirely different. In UC1, the dead monsterly Spainards, in UC2, the Guardians, and i wont spoil it for you in UC3. The graphics are still the best I've seen on PS3. Most times I just walk around and look at everything. One scene when you and Sully are in a French junlgle, the amount of detail is incredible. This game is more of eye-candy as it always is. Still one of favorite games of all time.*Update*So I take it back about Empire Games being a bad seller. The online pass code did work. I love this game but being so used to play FPS this game just isn't my type. The multiplayer just doesn't interest me.

{"product_name":"B000A76ZNO","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Enjoyable, but not outstanding","reviewText":"For those not in the know, Peter Molyneux is responsible for many of the greatest computer games of all time, from 1980s strategy classic Populous and its superior sequel through Powermonger, Theme Park and Dungeon Keeper. As the creator of Bullfrog Studios, Molyneux is also responsible for giving us the godlike Syndicate (although he didn't have that much to do with it, which may or may not be telling; okay, it is telling). In the late 1990s Molyneux left Bullfrog, which had been absorbed by the glutinous mass that was and still is EA Games, and set up a new studio called Lionhead. At this point Molyneux decided that having his hand in several of the greatest games ever made meant that any game he automatically created in the future would also be blindingly amazing and thus announced that his new company's first game would be a work of towering and astronomical genius which would force anyone who played it to explode from the sheer awesomeness of playing the game. Unfortunately the game design department didn't get the memo, as instead they made Black and White, which was not very good, although it did allow you to feed people to a giant cow and then beat it up.Undaunted by the mauling of his bovine-abuse simulator, Molyneux unleashed his hype on the company's new RPG, Fable. The game would have immense moral consequences, where every NPC had a different attitude towards you and would remember your actions towards them, where it would be possible to get married, have kids and a home life between adventures and the game would subtly adjust to the choices you made. Needless to say, very little of this actually appeared in the game, which turned out to be BioWare-lite.So ignoring the hype, what about the actual game? Well, you start off as a young scamp in your home village where peace and happiness spread until bad people turn up, torch the village, kidnap your mother and sister and butcher your father to death in front of you. Luckily, a wise old mentor/wizard Obi-Wan figure turns up, rescues you, and whisks you off to the 'Hero Guild' where you get to train your sword, archery and spellcasting abilities until you are ready to face the world and take on some quests. The 'twist' is that you get to decide whether you are a good person or a bad person. Erm, you know, the 'twist' that RPGs as far back as 1996's Fallout had pretty much included as a matter of course? Of course, the game doesn't really allow you to turn out to be a really evil SOB and follow the ramifications of that logically, so you can butcher your friends, torch multiple villages, kill hundreds of innocents and still be allowed back into the Guild to pick up a new quest, level up and follow the main story, which is pretty forgiving of them.The additional stuff is pretty much worthless. You can get married, but all that does is give you a different home base and an NPC wife (the game doesn't even allow you to play a female hero, although the sequel does) who just parrots random dialogue at you. You can't have kids, and all this scene-setting gubbins really does is distract from the meat of the game, which is performing quests. You gain quests from the guild (and occasionally other places) which require you to head off into the wilderness and perform convoy, protection or rescue missions for various people. There are also very occasional 'evil' quests as well, but these are few and far between. The main story picks up at fairly frequent intervals and draws you along a path of self-discovery as you learn more about the world and your background.At this point Fable kicks into life. The story is unoriginal, but nicely executed. There's some strong voice acting and a decent sense of humour. The combination of combat and spells is nicely done, although ranged combat turns out to be a waste of time. I think I used my bow about four times in the whole game. Swordplay and magic will get you through most circumstances. The game is also interesting in that it doesn't force you to become a fighter, mage or archer as you divide experience points between the three as you choose, allowing a decent level of customisation. There's also a nice variety of enemies to fight. However, towards the end of the story you become so ridiculously powerful that even the extremely tough new enemies introduced in the 'Lost Chapters' at the end of the game (not included in the original, X-Box-only version) do not present much of a challenge.Even with the addition of the 'Lost Chapters' material the game is also fairly short for an RPG, coming in at the 12-hour mark including all the side quests. However, the game's relative easiness as well as its more light-hearted approach does make it a decent RPG for beginners than something more hardcore like Baldur's Gate II or even Fallout 3, and more experienced gamers will find it stands up quite well as an enjoyable game, though not one that is breaking any boundaries.Fable (***) is a fun, light and amusing game which is pretty entertaining.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

I have been gaming since I was 7 years old, but I've been losing my hearing a little at a time since I turned 30 - over a decade now. I own a nice pair of Sennheiser headphones, but I hate being tied to my stereo by the spiral cord - that is only 6 feet long. I've been less than impressed by the sound quality of other cordless headphones, and so I've been turning the stereo up and using the (not-always-available) subtitles option on my games. Nice to be able to read, but darn distracting during hours of Mass Effect.These headphones, however, blew me away. The response is excellent, and the stereo effect is incredible. I've only experienced a few scattered moments when the headphones crackled or briefly lost connection, but those have only ever been minor annoyances. The sound settings (tone and effect) offer many options depending on the particular game I'm playing - even if it is a little annoying switching to the best options each time I switch games.The charge lasts a long time, and the USB cable is plenty long to allow me to game and recharge at the same time. The microphone can pop off when I'm not using it, and I can walk quite a ways from the game before I lose the wireless signal.Overall, these headphones have been a wonderful addition to my gaming, and I don't ever want to go back.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2012"}

Your character, a convicted murderer, must contend not just with a rapacious, merciless, and potentially explosively violent group, but zombies as well. The suspicious, selfish nature of the other survivors with you serves as far more of a device to move the plot forward than simply a run and gun collecting of supplies.The gameplay is classic adventure game, with item interaction and the ability to explore and discover solutions to a variety of problems. Combat with the zombies is more of a button masher, but the drama of the situtation works far better as the button mashing doesn't make the whole game a long running quick time event. Also is the ability to lose correctly. You can make every correct decision, mash every button correctly, and still lose. While its frustrating on first glance, it does add a sense of realism, and adds emotional weight to the fact that you just can't save everyone. The puzzles are similar, in that you are rewarded for common sense.The other characters are actual human beings, and most look to manipulate you or use you to protect themselves, if not just being sullenly suspicious of you and your motives from the get go. The interactions feel fluid, and while you're not rushed, you're not able to just sit and catiously weigh every option, as the game will pick one for you in that case as you make a knee jerk reaction. Voices and acting are also very well done.A few nits do abound. You are railroaded somewhat, and while the plot line does require it, it doesn't make since to bend over backwards to save the guy you hate if you don't want to. The social aspects aren't as easy to spot, and pickups are a bit slapdash. The story itself does have a bit too much deus ex machina, with you winding up exactly at your parents old pharmacy, rather than a random location in town. A couple of the decision points are pretty stupid, such as leaving a safe haven without so much as a hammer for protection, and the traditional horror movie stupid person behavior of dropping every useful weapon 45 seconds after you pick it up. It doesn't matter that you don't have shells, you take the shotgun with you.Overall, a well crafted, tight story that delivers all the horror and drama as effectively as the comics do, with the added bonus of a fwe cameo interactions without feeling like you're following behind the original WD group. And with more episodes on the way and custom crafted trailers, the upcoming episodes looked well poised to do nothing but improve on the initial foray.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}

Smith \"otherthani\"","summary":"Simply Not Fun","reviewText":"I am not an expert reviewer, however I will do my best to convey what is on my mind. Please feel free to let me know your thoughts.As I was looking at the reviews, I was surprised at how none of them... especially the negative ones missed the biggest problem with the game... IT JUST SIMPLY ISN'T FUN. The charisma, ingenuity and arcade style of the previous games is no longer here.I have been a huge fan of entire \"previous\" NEED FOR SPEED series, except for maybe NFS: Shift. I was never looking for realism from the games. I always found the \"over the top\" racing incredible fun... the idea of outrunning the cops exilerating and the idea of reversing your role and becommming a cop was ingenious.I've also had a great time playing The BURNOUT series as well. It was addictive seeing how much damage you could cause causing the biggest pileup scenario possible. It was a nice touch to give you a choice by winning races by either straight up racing or simply eradicating the competition through take downs.Very satisfying indeed.The above mentioned things were my favorite parts of NFS and Burnout. I was incredibly excited with the merger and couldnt wait to see what this game had in store. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. The racing is still \"over the top\", but it is so incredibly difficult that I dont know how anyone can be having a good time. After 20 times doing the same race and not even placing 3rd, it becomes more frustrating than it does fun. Navigating the track is mindboggling at times, there are no arrows to help guide your way, youre expected to keep your eye on your gps to know the right way. One wrong turn, or crash once and forget about it, you might as well start over... you will never catch up. Even if you are able to navigate the track effectively, the AI cars are always miliseconds behind you. Taking out an AI car can place you ahead of them, but they miraculously recover and spawn right back on your tail. The \"cop chases\" are here too, however it becomes quickly apparent that it will be more challenging than it will be fun. Still not sure how to lose cops... extreme speed doesnt work... taking side roads doesnt deter them... crazy routes keeps them on your tail... taking them down just causes more to spawn and any combination of the above is no more effective.Gone are the possibilities of winning a race multiple different ways including takedowns, short-cuts and/or speed, only to be replaced by undefeatable AI... No more sole TAKEDOWN EVENTS... Eradicated are the events where you get to play the cop and chase the street racer... Destroyed are the events where you simply try to create the most mayhem possible... and Demolished is my faith in the new franchise.I see what the creators are doing here. There is an attempt to make the racing seem like a simulator by making it extremely difficult... but I personally found this game so challenging, that it seems more like a chore than a pleasure. Not sure why the franchise is trying to be like every other racer out there when this merger gives the oppertunity to be so much more. Why not enhance what made the prior games so great instead of being like everyone else?Aside from my disappointment, I do need to say that the graphics are exceptional. and there are a few glimmers of fun here, but they are few and far between and were consistentaly interrupted by the vulgarities that exit my lips as I loose another race for the 20th time in a row.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

You want to interact with them, talk to them, learn their story and accept their ridiculous quests because they reward you upon return. What you probably don't want to do, assuming they're a crucial part of the story or the only f'ing vendor that sells that one spell in the game is kill them in the face. While there might be some very marginal reward for doing so, like gold or a picture of their newly orphaned children, it's usually not as beneficial as say, letting them give you the dragon sword or slaying the mighty herpes beast. FROM Software has decided this is all crap, and if you happen to, I don't know, set the controller down to refill your scotch and accidentally hit the bumper button in front of the NPC there's a chance you'll upset them, defend yourself, and remove them from the game forever.But it gets better.While I managed to unintentionally kill someone that was apparently going to leave / die later anyways, it wasn't a huge deal. However, in the game there are a handful of NPCs you essentially rescue (or kill) from various situations. See, some of these NPCs are extremely important. As in, you'll never be able to cast vital spells or purchase story-based required items if you decide to hack open the barrel they're trapped in like a normal person when you're supposed to actually roll into it to break it (seriously).I realize there are similar NPC vendors (two or three) throughout the game that sell similar items, but there are some very unique inventories and even if you couldn't get the super fireball from the first guy you slaughtered, the other guy you can buy it from is waiting patiently ... about 25 god damn hours from now in a place that's really hard to reach without the super fireball. Do you see the issue here? If you don't, I'll be happy to email you pictures of the first four controllers I broke with my face.Range is Better Than Melee. Almost Always.Some of you might remember games like Oblivion, or Morrowind (which I hated), where you could exploit the range attacks quite well. You know, go buy a few thousand \"Child's Crayon\" arrows and shoot them for two hours into the Lava Dragon Monster Demon Sandwich who wouldn't notice he was getting slowly pelted to death as long as you were more than seven feet from his face.You can do the exact same thing in Dark Souls.But that's exploitation, and doesn't mean the game sucks because people figured out they could take advantage of dumb AI and mechanics. Besides, those fireballs and arrows are only good for taking a shot or two at Bald Bull as he charges little Mac. Right?Wrong.Not only is the game incredibly cool about you eating through massive creature's health from range, but if they actually notice you, you're better off strafing and firing lightning bolts and stuff instead of ever pulling out a sword.If you think that's an exaggeration, go ahead and look up every boss in the Dark Souls wiki - careful though, a lot of spoilers there. You'll notice 90% (again, seriously) of the \"Boss Strategies\" involve words like \"range\" and/or \"fireball\" and/or \"arrows\" and/or \"seriously, if you don't have spells or 200 dexterity and a crazy bow made out of baby skulls, you're going to die.\"That's kind of a problem if you have a PHD in snapping necks and a minor in Kinding of Shooting Arrows Barely 101 or the closest you come to casting spells is making fun of LARP videos on YouTube.Just Go Get the Thing from the Guy and You'll Live Through ThisFROM Software thinks that the more vague something is, the more adventure it provides in the search. For example, if you asked for directions to a landmark while hiking beautiful mountains with a loved one, this is a feasible philosophy. But it's nothing like that. It's more like falling out of an exploding airplane without knowing where to find a parachute.There is actually a part in the game, seriously, where an NPC says something like, and I'm paraphrasing, \"you'll actually die if you go into (spoiler location) without knowing how to traverse it. There's this guy that knew how to traverse it. You should talk to him. Good luck, a-hole.\"Yep. And guess where this \"guy\" is? First of all, it's not a guy. It's an object, and second of all, it's in a location totally f'ing unrelated to anything you've done so far. You'd basically have to go exploring in an arbitrary location far away, fight a boss you may or may not be prepared for (and if you're not, clearly you're in the wrong place, right?) kill it, and get the required object.I only figured it out because it was a fluke - a total accident. I was so pissed off at the boss I was stuck on I decided to go exploring and killing everything I could. I just kind of stumbled into this and got lucky. I can't imagine how angry I would have been had I found out the hard way.But that's not all.There are certain parts in the game that require other items - for example one item is absolutely essentially to even hit the monsters in the area while another is required or you'll stumble through pitch black. I know you're probably laughing and saying to yourself \"while you're brilliant and attractive, Homebrew, it seems like if it's dark you can just go buy a torch or use a Light spell.\" Oh really? Who sells torches? Are you sure they exist in the game? Do I have to go attack a tornado and piss on a dragon's face to send him crashing into the roof of the pitch black area so it opens to sunlight? What if I am literally unable to cast spells? Who sells Light? DID I ALREADY F'ING KILL THAT GUY ON ACCIDENT?I think you get the point. Pretend you're playing Castlevania 2, but remove any semblance of NPC instruction / dialog and make the things you're required to do slightly more obscure and less obvious.It's not only vague, but you could have possibly ruined yourself and you just won't know it until 40+ hours in the game FROM Software gets your mom pregnant and sends death threats to your grandparents. At least that's what it feels like, considering the investment.There's Some Grinding InvolvedAnd I say \"some\" the way Keith Richards took \"some\" drugs. I don't care how exceptional your reflexes are. It doesn't matter that you won a Starcraft competition or \"intentionally\" wrote off dating women to win a Ferrari in a Doom tournament. And even if you play on a 90\" TV on your tenth play-through using the Nintendo Power Glove, you're still going to grind your balls off. The game is designed to be reasonable about reaching a boss, but once you get there on occasion you'll have a rude revelation: those monsters on the way to the boss were reasonably easy because you're going to have to kill about five thousand more of them in order to beat the boss.The only saving grace here is that the game is insanely beautiful, combat is somewhat fun and the death animations are great, so at least you'll be mildly entertained until about Undead Zombie #47,103 dies to your counter-animation #23,558.FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUYou'll notice that my writing went from structured and informative to sloppy and rant heavy. My sarcasm seemingly went off the charts, and you could probably feel the rage emanating from every other word. There's a reason for that.That is exactly how this game feels.At first you'll be in awe and wonder, reveling in the beauty and adventure the world provides. You'll notice a few issues here and there, but nothing soul-crushing (no pun intended). There will be moments of mild annoyance and irritation, and when you inadvertently slaughtered that guy you meant to greet you'll assume the consequences are limited.Then things will get dirtier. You'll start forgetting where to go, stumble into places you're not sure you're supposed to be, wonder where to buy spells, items, and make stronger weapons. You'll start putting points into stats you're not sure are important, lose a monstrous amount of souls falling off cliffs, and trying to figure out what the hell a covenant actually means and how you gain reputation with one.Eventually, all of your seemingly innocent \"mistakes\" will catch up to you, you'll be inundated with terms, items, and NPCs that make no sense whatsoever and provide little to no explanation. You'll start wandering aimlessly and failing at different locations you may or may not need to be exploring just for a change of fail scenery.Then you'll be me. One broken controller, a $240 rug stained with Scotch, a bloody knuckle (not a joke), and neighbors that consider calling the cops every night around 8pm, when you're finally home from work, playing this god damn piece of crap game that you can't seem to stop torturing yourself with.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00007UHPJ","description":"Primalfollows the story of Jen Tate, a modern woman who must face the demons of an immortal universe to discover her own supernatural origin. As Jen, players learn to unleash and control four different demon-fighting forms, each possessing unique skills and attributes, as they are immersed in a fantasy world joined inextricably with our own. This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub. A dynamic loading system allows for uninterrupted gameplay between levels, and magical portals act as links and windows into other worlds. Additional technological achievements include seamless character morphing between Jen&#146;s human and demon forms, extravagant particle effects, and environmental effects such as fog and mist.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Decent enough but sparse and sometimes boring","reviewText":"There's a good game lost somewhere in the maze of often-boring puzzles and confusingly huge map areas that is 'Primal'. An excellent, original storyline, likeable characters and a good control system can't save it from its flaws, however, and unfortunately this game never gets past Mediocre.In terms of general atmosphere and game-environment the closest comparison I can make is with 'Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver'. Like LOK, Primal has an involving, gothic storyline, and lush, detailed areas to explore. The addition of a 'Buddy' system in Primal is also a welcome change, particularly since you can change between Jen (the protagonist) and Scree, her gargoyle companion, at any time. Similar to LOK, the game employs a Warp-Gate system because of its vast size, and to a point, this also works will, becuase the map system is so good. The graphics are sumptuous and the sound and voice acting is top-notch.So far, so good.Where Primal fails is in its over-ambition. It's a huge, sprawling game, and the first half of it is full of dangerously-difficult enemies and confusing arenas. This is remedied somewhat by the inclusion of a save-anywhere feature but I defy all but the most dedicated players to complete Primal without resorting to a wlakthrough. Also, because the difficulty levels are so steep (until Jen gains any kind of power worth mentioning) the enemies are sparse, and this is somewhat boring. The puzzles are plentiful, and none are too difficult, but a few more bad guys to waste would have been a great addition. Technically, there are some minor glitches, but in a game of this size, it's no big deal.I can really only recommend Primal to people who love a good story and are willing to put up with some very dull gameplay to hear it. It's a beautiful, original game with some excellent qualities, but sadly can't compare to LOK in terms of action or interest.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2003"}

I love the way the cross sounds when he throws them out.  When your in hell, you'll never stop hearing the sounds of the tortured souls wishing for salvation.  Its very errie.

But punishing is a fast and lethal blow that rips your enemy apart.

While its true that you can approach the game in different ways, you are penalized for killing so you are clearly steered down the stealth path unless you want everyone looking at you like you are a maniac and getting the dark/bad ending.  The problem is that playing strictly stealth can be very tedious and frustrating.  In fact, I found the game in general to be rather repetitive and boring.  You spend so much time hiding, then searching every nook and cranny and reading boring book excerpts that I was about ready to scream.  I finally just ended up killing anyone that was in my way and while this did make the game a bit more interesting at least, it still wasn't that much fun and of course you are penalized for it in the end.  There were a few frame rate issues and periodic lags, a few bad character models with giant hands completely out of proportion to the rest of them, an overall washed-out color scheme and very bland atmospheres in general but the actual gameplay and controls seemed fine for the most part. There were definitely some interesting ideas with the powers but overall, this game just wasn't for me - maybe I'm just too impatient.  Glad I got it for under $15.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Such a let down","reviewText":"The first Darksiders told a great story and had fantastic gameplay to accompany. Darksiders 2 continues the great story, but the gameplay is an enormous let down. There's much more of an RPG feel, as you can level up and explore a skill tree to develop your own style of play unlike the first game. You can collect random items dropped by monsters and \"feed\" normal items to \"possessed\" items in order to power them up.This is where the fun ends.The game is mostly played through combat, and the combat is poorly executed. Because of the random quality of the items that enemies drop, the attributes you take into combat are a grab bag at any given time and they rarely work for whatever monster you happen to come across. Pausing gameplay to switch your equipment to make up for this is just a disaster. It takes the pure adrenaline right out of the gameplay and just dumbs it down to... I don't even know. You have to stop, go through an equipment menu that's a pain to navigate because of how long it takes the game to actually frickin' respond to your input, and then find something that will work against your current opponent. It's just a disaster.Then there's the controls themselves. I've never played a game before that makes me constantly use the entire controller. I have had my hands contorted into some bizarre physical structures just trying to enter all the commands necessary to dodge, strike, use potions and/or use special skills, all of which have to be done pretty much at the same time or Death gets killed. You can dodge quickly, but you can't use it to cancel your current action (a SERIOUS disappointment given the utter non-ending frequency of enemy attacks). You can also only dodge three times in a row before Death decides to stop and catch his... breath? Really? The Nephilim called Death who is known for killing his entire kindred who are supposed to be the most powerful beings in existence needs to catch his breath because he did a few backflips? What? How DID this whimpy gasbag kill all his brethren?Then there's the fact that enemies attack almost constantly. Death - the aforementioned supremist of the supreme - has to stop regularly to catch his breath. Enemies? No so much. Most enemies in the game just keep on attacking, rarely doing anything that exposes them that doesn't result in an almost immediate counter attack that will catch Death before he can get back out of the way. They also don't stagger when you hit them - even with the most powerful weapons - if they're already in the middle of an attack. No so for death: no, mysteriously the supremist of the supreme gets interrupted very easily when attacking supposedly inferior enemies that don't share this flaw. A lot of the larger enemies attack in a series that not only follows Death, but outlasts and outstretches his ability to triple-dodge. Because combat is reduced to glorified button mashing, you'll frequently get stuck in one of the stupidly-long animations where Death throws his scythes in some spin out in front of him (seriously, if they magically come back, why can't they magically return to him wherever he dodges away to?) or does something else that leaves him vulnerable for an asinine amount of time.Combine the facts that the large track-you-down-and-hit-you-no-matter-what enemies almost ALWAYS appear in groups with other smaller wall-of-never-ending-attack type minions, and that Death can't cancel actions to dodge and can't block at all and you're guaranteed one thing: Death is going to take damage, and he's going to take a lot of it.Combat also takes a lot of time. Enemies just absorb ridiculous amounts of damage. It doesn't matter if you have the most powerful weapons you've seen so far. You have to hit even the most basic enemies a truly absurd number of times. Even if you go back to the very first stage when you're level 20 with Super Powerful Weapons, you still don't have one-hit kills because the enemies just have a ridiculous amount of health at all points in the game. The Crucible is a nightmare because it's just wave after wave of groups of enemies that take serious punishment while each being able to kill Death in a mere couple of hits.Seriously. Combat in this game is just horrible. It's like it's designed to piss off the player. I wouldn't have minded CHALLENGING. But this isn't challenging. It's just purely frustrating. And it's a huge part of the game, because it's an action game. And that makes the whole game suck.Moving on from combat, the controls suck just as bad when doing puzzle solving and platforming. When wall jumping, timing is everything, but you often have to jump around corners or through bizarre camera-shifts that change the meaning of the direction you're pushing on the controller. However, when the screen shifts like this and you haven't taken a moment to let go of the directional stick, the controls will not update to the new camera context. So the direction Death moves in on-screen makes NO sense from any context, and he usually ends up falling to his death. Despite the fact that he takes no damage from long falls, he still falls to his death... When the camera switches, you have to take this bizarre moment out of your critical timing to completley let go of the directional stick and start from scratch, or the controls just end up being completely random when the screen finishes moving.This is also true of jumping from hand hold to hand hold. If you know the exact direction you have to move next and push the jump button the moment you land on the new handhold, it's a completely random event as to whether Death will continue to jump in the same direction or will - for unknown reasons - jump straight up from the hand hold you're on. But it's almost NEVER the direction you intended him to move in. It's like he just ignores the directional pad altogether and does what he feels like. And since there's no often a very robust choice of directions to move in, this random-but-not-what-you-told-me approach means he jumps to a non-existent handhold and falls to his doom. You HAVE to pause, even briefly, on each ledge and let the controls catch up before proceeding to the next. This. Is. Stupid. Especially when you can see and know exactly where you need to go. Why make me artificially wait? Why?Also, you're supposed to be able to push a button to automatically drop from your current handhold to one below it: whether or not this works as advertised is a crap shoot. Most of the time, you have to hold up - but only AFTER you drop from your initial perch, otherwise what Death does is completely random! He may just decide to jump from the wall altogether rather than just drop down even though you didn't push the button to jump! - or he won't grab the ledge below. And even then, whether or not he Actually Does What You Tell Him is another random event. Sometimes, no matter what you do, Death just sails right on by that lower ledge and falls straight to his doom.Sometimes you have to swing along a series of hoops like Gabriel Belmont does in Castlevania. In Castlevania, if you were in mid-jump the grapple points would always take precedence over any other available target because the game designers knew that if it didn't, Gabriel would fall to his death and that would be that. No so much in this game. There are a few places where there will be enemies near Deathgrip points. Even if the enemy is behind that point, Death will grab the enemy instead of the grapple point, which usually results in him pulling the enemy to himself. So great. Now you're in mid-air and have a pulled an enemy up to yourself so that it can die along with you as you both fall. Awesome.These crappy, unpredictable controls make a nightmare out of one particular scene in which the developers torture you with a camera-swinging climb up a tower that involves dropping to a lower ledge as a floor of fire rises to chase you, but is almost always right behind you no matter where you are and how fast you've moved. The controls are just awful in this scene. Half the time, Death will do something random despite the fact that you're pressing the direcitonal pad in the correct direction - which you determine to be the correct one by taking a moment out of your precious little available time to let go of the controls and try from scratch. Sometimes, Death will need to go to the left, and you'll be holding left, but when you press the jump button he goes straight up the wall for some unknown reason. This wastes a lot of precious time as this stupidity CANNOT be cancelled once started and ends with some bizarre, useless move where Death just hangs on the wall for an extra super-long moment at the height of his jump. Sometimes, despite the fact that you would never, ever push the controls in any direction to cause this, Death just jumps straight out from the wall and into the middle of the tower and thus unto the firey floor and thus to his end. And because of how fast the floor moves, and the fact that the camera in the game CONSTANTLY fights against you, you can't get a good look to know the whole stage. You have to play through it repeatedly, dying becuase Death won't do the right thing and you're afraid to take the time to pause to make him. I hate scenes like this. Just a fraction of a second more on each hand hold would have made it a comfortable, challenging experience, but the way it was done made it frustrating because it's just too friggin' easy to makes mistakes and it's all due to the crappy controls. I had to replay this scene more times than any other in the game because the platforming is just so poorly done.This game just lacks the polish that made the first one great. It's almost unplayable at times. I'm no longer looking forward to the rest of this series. I might still play them if Darksders 2 wows me with its end, which I haven't gotten to yet because the gameplay is so horribly \"That's Not What I Friggin' Told You To Do\" frustrating. But right now, I feel like I wasted my money. This game is just a serious disappointment on the heels of its predecessor, which made it to my favorites shelf.EDIT:I've beaten the game, and as such I decided to add some detail.The game forces two playthroughs to get all the achievements, as one achievement is level-based but there's a level cap on the first playthrough. However, if you played through the first time on Apopacalyptic, the second time through will be much easier. There's no achievement for the Nightmare setting you unlock after the first go, which is great because Nightmare just makes Death's death permanent should you fall in battle. That would be controller-chucking frustrating since, as I've stated earlier, the controls are horrible and you WILL experience the game-over screen more than once no matter what you do.When you start New Game+, you get to keep all of Death's items, which means you start the game over with your end-game gear and thus a huge advantage. Toward the end of the first playthrough, you'll be offered weapons with health and wrath steal, which are pretty much required weapon attributes to make it through the end of the game because of the sheer amount of damage Death takes. The wimpy little heal-over-time health potions - and the fact that you can only carry 5 - just don't heal like weapons with health steal. Like I said earlier, enemies absorb ridiculous amounts of damage, often only losing a fraction of their health bars when Death hits them with a critical for nearly 3 times his own full health. So even a 10% health steal will usually replenish at least 20% if not nearly 50% of Death's health with a single attack, and it does so instantly. By the end of the second playthrough, that health steal will max out at 30%, which is insane life-granting ability for Death. You can stand among the waves of enemies, not even bothering to use the crappy dodge because your attacks will almost always heal back what enemies dish out. It really does take a huge edge off the combat, even if it absolutely incredibly stupid that the combat is set up in such a way as to require it.This leads me to talk more about the items themselves. Throughout the game, you'll find or be awarded \"legendary\" weapons. Most of the time, these weapons are many levels below the level Death had to be just to get to them. They also tend to have very limited attributes, and their \"special ability\" effects are laughable compared to the effects you can create with a possessed weapon. Most \"special abilities\" don't really do anything that you can tell is happening, rendering the weapon less apparently effective than even the most basic current-level random enemy-dropped weapon. There is exactly ONE in the game that you'll ever find useful: Achidna's Fangs. These have the only health-steal ability you'll get that's worth anything until really late in the game, and they also have an increased critical chance. On your first playthrough, you'll find yourself leaving them equipped until you can make your own more effective health-steal weapons because they really are a life-saver. Aside from that, every other \"legendary\" weapon hits for less damage, has incredibly weak attributes if any, and has a neglible and ineffective \"special ability\" compared to the possessed weapon you probably had to make to get through the quest or area to get to said \"legendary\" weapon. I tried every single one I could find, and usually reverted almost instantly to my existing weapon because it was always considerably more effective.Even with these vastly superior weapons and armor, Death can still be interrupted by just about anything while almost every enemy has some attack sequence that is really, really hard to stop once it starts. Even in the middle of the second playthrough, I was hitting enemies with criticals so high it was taking 1/3 of their health, and they would still just drop back and begin charging up some attack and let it loose as though I didn't exist and wasn't laying into them. Meanwhile, the supposed supremist-of-the-supreme hero of the story gets interrupted by the smallest of enemies dealing so little damage you can't even tell his health bar changed. This makes combat in the first playthrough just excruciating and annoying, but doesn't really come into effect in the second playthrough since enemies aren't really any more powerful but Death is both a higher level and has even better equipment. However, because Death is so much more powerful, it's just a gnawing annoyance and an asinine \"feature\" of combat that even basic enemies can't be interrupted without actually being killed because, well, eff you that's why.There's also this annoying achievement for sending a gift to a friend. None of my XBLA friends play this game, or many of the same games I do for that matter. Fortunately, I have a handful of profiles on my box from times when friends have come over and played Halo, so I just loaded one up and started the game to give that \"player\" an inbox and then went back to my real profile and sent \"them\" an item just to get the achievement. Seriously? I don't like when games try to force multiplayer on you to get achievements because it usually results in time-wasting like this. I just don't like games that force some kind of multiplayer - or even replays - becuase I strongly believe that these things should stand on their own merits and your in-game achievements should be your own. You shouldn't have to rely on other people to get their lives in line with yours so you can fully enjoy a game you bought for yourself.Overall, the second playthrough makes up for much of the furstration from the first. Thankfully, you don't have to play all the way through to mop up those final achievements: you just have to get to level 30 and beat Wicked K. Even so, it's a forced replay of an overall poorly executed game and it would have been better if I could have been one-and-out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2012"}

I've purchased and enjoyed other on-line only multiplayer games before, such as Left 4 Dead 2 and Team Fortress 2, but those were sold at low price points to make up for the fact that they offer limited experiences (in fact TF2 is free now). $60 for an on-line only shooter is asking a bit much in my opinion(-) The graphics aren't good. In fact it looks like a last gen game that happens to have impressive art direction. Many of the textures look outright poor and muddy, and the lack of any kind of interactive environmental physics feels dated. The game grinds down to single digit framerates when several Titans get into close combat (i7-2600 3.4Ghz quad, 16GB DDR3-1333, two SATA IIIs mirrored, GTX 660 2GB OC, 75Mbps Internet connection)(-) The maps are small and confined, particularly when there are giant robots stomping around with scores of bots (computer-controller characters) scurrying about underfoot. I find myself often spawning right next to enemies, or having only several seconds to get my bearings before being fired upon from above. And for a game featuring jet packs and parkour, the ceiling/height limit of every map feels really low(+/-) Team sizes are very small: 6 players per. To offset the lack of human players, matches include a large number of computer controlled AI opponents along with the featured giant robots. This design decision helps in some ways: the AI bots serve as fodder for players, making it easier to call in the titular Titans, but also alleviating the frustration new players often feel when playing a FPS for the first time. Unfortunately the AI is rudimentary and often makes poor decisions. This includes unmanned Titans, who have the tendency to wander away from their teammates when left to their own devices. It feels underwhelming and lacking challenge when the opposing team is comprised primarily of mindless automatons(+/-) Despite the small, cramped maps and limited team sizes the general gunning and gameplay is sound. The controls are rock solid - you'll fluidly run up and over obstacles, scale walls, swoop down into your Titan or go sailing out of a window while blasting away at your enemies. It's fun figuring out ways to flank the enemy position or work with teammates to take down Titans. Unfortunately the gameplay looks and feels extremely similar to Call of Duty - right down to the cadence of combat as you maneuver and take aim, or the tell tale visual queues as your bullets find their target. This may actually be a positive to many players, as the fanbase for CoD is huge and enthusiastic - but for me I was hoping for gameplay that felt new and fresh at its core(+) No issues with the nuts and bolts, like hit registration and client stability","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"space_hamster\"","summary":"Not recommended for AOE2 fans, but still a decent game","reviewText":"When I first played this game a few months ago, I immediately wrote it off as a complete and total failure. Compared to its illustrious predecessor, AOE3 is extremely limited in scope. Where's the awe and wonder in seeing your cavemen being transformed into pikeman when transitioning from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age? I was hoping for a sequel closer in majesty and scope to Rise of Nations or Empire Earth 2. The developers certainly have the expertise and the ambition to do that.Instead, Ensemble Studios, sensing that Stainless Steel and others had already trodden that path, decided to explore a more contained and eventful era - the exploration of the new world. The result is a game lacking in the scope and grandeur of AOE2, but surprisingly fun to play - providing you can get over or dismiss the lack of realism.The most important issue to overlook is the more self-contained and utilitarian building choices in AOE3. For instance, Instead of 3 separate buildings for refinding your gold, metal and wood, you have a single market building in which you can research resource gathering refinements in all 3 areas. Or having your villagers gather resources without having to travel to a resource gathering point. This makes it easier to coordinate gameplay, but isn't as realistic. In fact, there are quite a few areas where the developers have sacrificed any sense of reality for gameplay convenience.Another minor nitpick I have with AOE3 is the way the \"City Cards\" concept was presented. Instead of having a limited view of the City Harbor, I wish they had implemented a majestic view of the entire city instead.In conclusion, it's obvious that Ensemble Studios have turned AOE3 into a much faster paced game, in order to compete with Dawn of War or Warcraft 3. Instead, the result is a game lacking in that sense of reality that made AOE2 such an in-depth and lengthy experience to play. I wouldn't call AOE3 a classic, but it has enough merits that it can stand on its own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2XK","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"Good But Lacks Serious Depth And Replayability","reviewText":"The WWE universe is very familiar to the Yukes developers as they have been in partnership for years with the massively successful Smackdown series of games. Because of this long standing business relationship, you would have expected a game created based around the WWE legends roster, that it would essentially be the same game just with a different lick of paint. In some ways it takes a lot of inspiration from the Smackdown and in others the developers have tried to go for something completely different. Some of the new things were an interesting concept on paper but ultimately failed when it came to playing with that particular concept within the game.Let's look at the positives before we move onto the negatives which plague this game and ultimately drag it down to a level you wouldn't expect of a game like this, especially considering the experience they have with the WWE brand and the type of player that buy the WWE games. By far, the best idea presented in this game is to have the ability to import the wrestlers from WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009 into this game and allow you to pit your current favourite WWE superstars against your favourite legend. Ultimate Warrior vs. Batista anyone? Another cool feature is the utilisation of favourite of mine from classic WWE, and that is the Managers. Jimmy Hart and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan show up in this game and act as your manager if you select them. Alongside Jimmy and Bobby are Mr. Fuji and Paul Bearer which you can select to accompany you to the ring and will interfere in the match in a number of ways by distracting or even hurting your opponent to help you get the win.Other cool features in the game include Wrestlemania Tour, revamped arcade style control system and a mode known as Legend Killer. Legend Killer mode is a good idea. In it you embark on a gauntlet of legends in which you are to work your way up to the highest ranking legend such as Hulk Hogan. Wrestlemania Tour is the most interesting and redeeming feature of the game in which you are given the ability to Relive, Rewrite or Recap memorable matches in Wrestlemania history. In Relive, you have to take the role of a particular legend that won the match of the particular Wrestlemania. Within the match, along with winning, you will have to undertake a number of tasks in order to complete the particular challenge. Rewrite means you take the role of the opponent and have to win in order to Rewrite history. This also gives you the opportunity to play said legendary match in a new scenario, say Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart; instead of an Iron Man match, would it have been cooler if it was a Hell in a Cell? Recap simply allows you to view videos which show you the build up to the original feuds and clips of the matches themselves.The revamped control system both works and doesn't. For those quite happy with a simple control system then it's certainly for them, but for me, I found the new control system fairly irritating and a bit too simplistic for my tastes. One cool feature I will give praise to the new system is the chain wrestling system which can simply be engaged by pressing the X in front of a groggy opponent. When you enter into this system a cinematic style view is taken of the in ring action and a small circle in the middle which will display a particular button which you should press in time in order to initiate the next move in the wrestling chain. It's an interesting concept and does work really well and is certainly something I can see being incorporated into the Smackdown games at some point in the future.Overall, however, the game is let down quite a bit due to a good polished look but complete lack of substance and replay ability. Getting started with the control system is difficult to get the hang of but when you do you can enjoy the matches you're playing in but I ultimately found myself feeling like I'm never wholly in control of the character and the match. I would have much preferred if it was the same in-depth control system of the Smackdown series and allowed for a switching of control styles depending on your preference would have kept everybody happy. The lack of any sort of season mode is another massive let down and although the Wrestlemania Tour and Legend Killer modes are interesting, the lack of depth and substance really mean that you play them once and don't want to bother again. Create a superstar mode is something literally copied and pasted from the Smackdown series but is something that again lacks any real depth.Overall, the concept was great. The Smackdown series decided to make a change this year and just have current superstars on the roster which would allow for more interest to be generated for Legends of Wrestlemania. It's really great to be able to play as your favourite legends for the first time in a game on this generation of consoles, specifically for me, Ultimate Warrior. And the ability to import the Smackdown vs. Raw roster to the game is an added bonus, but there's nothing really there to make you want to go back and play it again and again as one complete play through to get all the PS3 trophies or XBL achievements are really the only real reason you would spend any excessive amount of time playing the thing. Good, but would have only been better if it had mimicked the Smackdown games more closely.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2009"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Peter \"aragorn318\"","summary":"Beautiful graphics but a short campaign!","reviewText":"I enjoyed the solo campaign but short.

CC offers and original game experience and, well, here's how. First off, people who HATE turned based RPGs can relax. We get a whole new real-time combat engine and no it's not like FF12's. When you engage in combat you can select attack, your materia (more on that later), and your items with the L or R buttons. You attack with X (combat is VERY simple and pretty easy). Now for the new original hate-it-or-like-it idea: The DMW. It looks like a slot machine up in the corner and this is how you choose your power attacks (overdrives), level up, and your Aeon. This is also random so it mixes up gameplay, yet for micro-managing freaks they will hate this. Each character's face is on the wheel and as you meet them they are unlocked. Each character has a special move either offensive or defensive and they are pretty neat. You also have numbers as well and for example if you get three 7's you level up. If you get two of the same number you level up your materia. Another thing, you don't have magic and all that anymore.Materia are things like Fire, Thunder, Vital Slash, and even Graviga. You also have AP now which is for materia like Vital Slash, Jump Attack etc. You can also fuse materia together to make different materia. This is really fun to do and there are TONS of combos and different materia too collect. There are plenty of enemy types so don't worry.Now for the story is picks up after the movie where you play as Zack (yes just one character through the whole game...yeah so...deal with it). You have to save the world from the evil Projects that people are doing and stop Genesis from taking over the world. While the graphics are AMAZING and the voice acting (first time in a FF game) is great you also get beautiful pre-rendered FMV's. Now for the issues. The DMW wheel is great and it's very fair on leveling you up (I finished at level 38) and balances your character very well for you.The combat is very simple with just a one button hit, block, and dodge. This could have been revamped more. The game is pretty short for FF standards. I beat the game in 17 hours and I did 15% of the side missions as well. Speaking of that the side missions get dull real fast. You access them through save points and it's just a \"kill every enemy in the room\" type thing and it's for getting more items. You can't get new weapons either...you're stuck with what you got. You also access shops through the menu at any time which is convenient but makes the game even more easy. Overall if you love FF you'll absolutely LOVE this. If you hate FF then try the game and I'm sure you'll like it now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

For one thing it wasn't scary in the least. Sadly RE 4 was the portent of things to come as RE 5 and RE 6 continued the move away from survival horror and into pure action. I'm happy to say that Revelations moves the series back towards survival horror at least as far as the handheld experience is concerned. I assume this is because of the greater processor limitations compared to the consoles but whatever the reason I'm glad to see RE moving back to its roots.My biggest issue with the game is control and much of it may be limitations of the 3DS. You can't lean or strafe or move sideways. Revelations can use the Circle Pad Pro to improve the movements but why would I pay $30 for an add on that works with just a handful of games, only one of which I own. I got used to the retro movement but the turning remains a sore spot. Imagine knowing that an enemy is right behind you and the best you can do is perform a slow tank like turn to defend yourself. It makes the game more challenging but for all the wrong reasons.Graphically Revelations is amazing. Everything is fully rendered with a mixture or claustrophobic hallways and large open areas. It also makes heavy use of lighting effects including flashlights shining around dark rooms. Very impressive and spooky. However there are some sacrifices to get this level of detail. You can tell when the game is loading up an enemy because there is a brief pause so it takes away the surprise. Also, there are frequent loading pauses as you move from section to section and a noticeable dip in framerate when the action gets very heavy with multiple enemies. It's not an unreasonable sacrifice given the beauty (and creepiness) of the background graphics and character modeling but there is room for improvement. I ended up shutting off the 3D effect after about an hour because I found it too tiring trying to line up the 3DS with my eyes. In the games defense this is what I do with all 3D games. It's a cool concept and looks neat for awhile but in practice it's not worth it to me.The Campaign mode is great but what I found most addictive was Raid Mode. In Raid Mode you need to fight through enemies in order to reach a target location. You can play with one other person or alone which is how I played. You can gain experience and level up as well as gain new weapons and weapon upgrades. I played the Campaign on Normal mode and found it decently but not overly challenging. I think Normal is my sweet spot as a moderately decent player. I don't have any problems with the storyline and it was nice to see Leon Kennedy and Jill Valentine returning. In Revelation the enemy is Veltro rather than the old Umbrella Corporation which I assume is defunct at this point.All in all the game was quite a bit better than I expected and far more addictive particularly the Raid mode. I've probably logged more hours on this game than any other RE except perhaps RE4. Hopefully Capcom will continue to produce more games like Revelations and less like RE5 and 6.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2013"}

From the highly acclaimed adventures of Mario, to the puzzled-maddening addiction of the classic Tetris games, many of them have gone through a great, and driven transition. For the Star Fox franchise, many gamers felt that the appeal of the game series was a diaster from the past few games. Although the game system handled well on the revolutionary Star Fox 64, for the Nintendo 64, many felt the game franchise missed out completely from the Nintendo Gamecube era: 2005's Star Fox Assault, and 2002's Star Fox Adventures. Can Fox McCloud and company reclaim the fame so many thought missed out before?Star Fox Command for the Nintendo DS, tries to go back tothe original appeal Nintendo captured with it from Star Fox 64, and the original Star Fox from the Super NES system. This edition is all about flying, and plenty of it. The object though this time is you're battling against the clock, and how fast you have to shoot down several enemy combat planes. This time, the manuverability is really all from the stylus, which is unfortunately the biggest flaw of the game. It takes much more time to get used to, especially with trying to unlock missions, and several characters. The music for the game though does have the high-flying action, except for when Fox and company and trying to talk. The combat action though is very challenging, for anybody who wants a challenge, but for others, they might feel this is a turnoff.All in all, I just wish Star Fox Command could've been a better Nintendo DS title. It is a challenge for die hard fans of the franchise, but for others who've backed away from the Gamecube games, they'd might want to reconsider going back. I suggest you try the game yourself, and let the force hopefully be with you.Graphics: BSound: CControl: C 1/2-Fun & Enjoyment: COverall: C","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2006"}

Uncharted has been the game to finally show what this system can do, and much more important, what quality Naughty Dog is capable of.  Much of the in game graphics equal top PS2 cutscenes.  Sound is great with fitting music, realistic gunfire and blasts, and most of all, the best voice acting and dialogue I've heard in 25 years of gaming.  You'll care about the characters and laugh numerous times at their one liners.  There's even a VERY realistic ear ringing sound if a blast is close to you.  Only control issues were rolling & taking cover being mapped to the same button, and it's hard to pick things up sometimes.  Nothing that really hurt it though.  No health packs, instead you take cover and buy time to recover.  Aiming is well done, with both manual targeting & 'blind fire' which is less accurate but works in a pinch.  Nothing bad to say about this game.  An absolute must own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2007"}

{"product_name":"B005IMVP0O","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Price point may scare some, but game quality is hard to resist.","reviewText":"Out of the boxSony did a good job at giving you a lot of useful items in the 1st edition bundle.  You get of course the Vita itself, a very nice carrying case, power adapter, memory card and a pack in game.  I was slightly disappointed in the fact that Sony didn't include something a little more beefy gamewise like Wipeout or even swung for the fences with Uncharted as the pack in. The PS Vita at first glance looks just like its predecessor and it took me awhile to figure out that all of the buttons and switches have been moved. It doesn't feel heavier than the original PSP but at the same time it doesn't feel plastic like and cheap. This system isn't for the casual Angry Birds or Plants vs Zombies player.I was impressed that upon startup, there was at least a good  charge to get you off and running.Set UpDespite some negative reviews that claims that it took forever to get setup, I only took 15 minutes to get up and running and although I got caught in a snag trying to log in to my PSN account, I found that if you go thru the trial period, the Vita will allow you to finish the set up and then you can go back into the settings and put your PSN info in. I had no problems connecting the Vita with my home network and since I have no plans on using AT&T;, I had no problems hooking the Vita up to my mifi device.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the screen itself is bright, thus far, I have had no problems at all jumping right in. Near is setup and could prove useful as well as Google maps although it won't replace your GPS. Netflix isn't available yet but from what I hear, it will be out next week at launch. However Sony's video rental service is already up and running should you want to get some movies on the go.Playstation storeGoing into the store, I noted that it's sectioned off for Vita games only, PSP games and PSP minis. If you aren't all that crazy about the launch lineups or want some older games, they are all there for you.  My only concern however is that 1. There were hardly any FPSes in the store. Games like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty weren't in the store on the Vita side.  2. Some games like God of War: Ghost of Sparta were still full priced at 30 bucks. I am hoping that as time goes on, Sony starts to cut prices for their PSP games especially if they are asking consumers to spend that same amount on PS Vita titles.PortabilityMe not being one of those people that feels like I have to have the Vita in my pocket had no problem throwing it in the protective case and then in my bag that I take to work. I was slightly concerned that the carry case didn't have enough room to fit the charging cable. But everything else fit neatly into the bag.Quick tidbit of the gamesUltimate Marvel v Capcom 3 - Very nice graphics and a ton of action to keep you busy. You have a variety of control literally at your finger tips. While you can use the touch screen, it does tend to take some of the fun of watching what's going on in the game because you can't see it all. Purists will no doubt not like the controls because the touch screen may be too `easy'. But for any player that wants a nice fighting game, it does boast a nice roster and plenty of unlockables.FIFA Soccer - Almost identical to its console brother, FIFA has a ton of features in it for it to come out of the gates as one of the best mobile sports launches in awhile. Some may be disappointed by the absence of the Ultimate Team mode,  and others may not be excited about the touchscreen passing, but the rear touch shooting makes up for that. Occasionally there is a dip in framerate but as far as game play itself, it's almost as slick as the consoles. The commentating is still there, as well as the likenesses of players. Now it's time to see what happens come baseball and football season.Uncharted: Golden Abyss - This game is the reason why people will want to get the Vista. Graphically, it shows off what the Vita can do and it does feel right  for this system. It has nice tutorials that really show you how to use the touchscreen and so far it really feels like a nice adventure game that was sorely lacking on the PSP. Does anyone remember when years ago, an Indiana Jones game was supposed to come out and then we got that sloppy game for the PSP? This makes up for it.God of War: Ghost of Sparta - This is a good way to see how PSP games hold up on the Vita.  A little secret; If you hold your finger on the touch screen you will get a few extra options to help upscale the game to Vita standards. In some instances, it still looks like a PSP game but it's a little more smoothed out and the colors are a bit brighter. It's a 2 year old game that has held up well and will likely tide you over until a Vita version is announced.So far, this system has made for a nice launch, but I do have a few concerns:1. No HDMI out port.  Almost all phones and mobile devices have some kind of port to allow you to hook your device to your HDTV and it's kind of sad to see this not included in the first iteration. Maybe in future releases it may be but my guess is that Sony didn't want a system that could potentially compete with the PS3.2. No remote play - At least not yet, but hopefully Sony will push that feature on this system this time around and give us something that will allow you to play your PS3 games remotely. There are rumored hacks out that already supposedly allow this.3. Memory card price and Battery Life - It's not enough that Sony is doing proprietary cards but what they charge is a bit high considering just how much memory stick have come down in price since the original PSP launched. As far as the battery life is concerned, with the little bit of time that it's supposed to last, I am considering making a purchase of another so I can at least have one at home and one to have on me just in case.4. System price point - Sony is really testing the waters with this price point and looking at what happened with Nintendo's 3DS price drop last year, one can only speculate if the same will happen with the Vita if it goes through the same sales failure that it's suffering through in Japan. I would advise that anyone getting it, hold on to your receipts  and be prepared come July.I don't think Sony will fail in this country selling Vitas it's just a matter of what other games they can put out that will sustain it between now and the holidays.  It's a good system coming out of the box but with a prohibitive cost on the system and peripherals, some people may not immediately jump on board with the Vita so eagerly. However with a few of the launch titles looking and playing as good as they do coming out the gate, it may be hard to resist passing on the Vita.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

This is both beautiful and fun.CONS:- re-mix electronica track of the Doors - Break on Through to the Other Side. What the hell were they thinking?- if someone bumps you, then a few seconds later you drive into a wall because you turned wrong, they get credited with a takedown, even though it was really you taking yourself down.- many circuits are more city-oriented and more contained so when you do a takedown, the other guy just crashes rather uninterestingly into a wall. Prior versions of this game had them shooting way up into the air maybe off a cliff or something. Much more fun.- low angle view of car only. Many other games give you multiple view options.- they new \"revenge\" gimmick element adds little to actual gameplay (offline). You takedown the same car that took you down last. So what.

{"product_name":"B001PKHRUK","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"Great Game But......","reviewText":"I had a great time with this game, but I tend to rate my games on more than one play-through.  After all, what is the point doling out 60 bucks on a game if it lacks the second or third time through?Overall, the game is really well made.  The graphics are solid, and the gore is a nice touch.  However, it takes more than some flashy graphics and flying blood to make a good game.  Especially today, the game needs to EARN its sixty dollar price tag.  To be honest, the game really IS well made.  The controls are easy to pick up and barring a few annoying tendancies, such as being mid-combo and combo-ing yourself right off a ledge, the game allows you to hone your feral senses.  It really IS like playing Wolverine.  The voice acting is excellent and the \"puzzles\" are just challenging enough to give you time to pause and think.That being said, this game has almost NOTHING to offer you once you beat it.  It reminds me alot of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.  Once you unlock the alternate costumes which amounts to a handful......  there is nothing else.  Just more of the same.  I have been down this road before.  The Force Unleashed was a fun game the first time through, now sadly it collects dust.  To be honest it takes more than trophies to keep me going.  Either the game has to vary enough each time through that it allows you to at least pretend it is bringing more to the table, or it has to be SO much fun each time through that you don't care that it's the same.  Unfortunately, it is a pattern of kill a group of baddies, run to the next part, kill a group of baddies, kill a new type of baddie, run to the next group, rinse and repeat.  Occasionally it is broken up by some pretty spectacular boss fights such as gunships or just very BIG baddies.  I hate to go against the grain on this but I do not consider this to be a 4 or 5 star owner.  It is a 4 or 5 star renter.  A very well-made game with plenty of action to satisfy your bloodlust, but until this game hits the twenty or thirty buck mark, I'd recommend renting it when the need for violence takes you because on that ground, you'll find few better than this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Grand Theft Gotham","reviewText":"After thoroughly enjoying Arkham Asylum, I found myself wondering how the \"sandbox-style\" take of its sequel Arkham City would play out.  Arkham Asylum had a fairly straightfoward storyline, and the environment changed to control how you stepped through the story:  breaking down that linearity might not go so well.I'm happy to say that this game succeeds in every way.  It makes me wonder how I settled for something as small as Arkham Asylum and I see a huge amount of replay potential as I try a variation or two in this rich open world.For those of you new to the Arkham games, the concept is this:  the first game portrayed a failed attempt to put Blackgate Prison and Arkham Asylum (the prison for the violently deranged supervillains that plague Batman's universe) together on the same island. After this colossal failure, a bizarre turn of fate leaves a flood-damaged section of Gotham walled off, filled with bad guys (and political dissidents!) who are left to fend for themselves, and the whole environment patrolled by a paramilitary security company.  What this means for you is that while there is a core storyline that needs you to go through some side stories to keep the main story moving, you are also free to tackle these challenges at your own pace.  You can spend the rest of the time wandering the environment and choosing what you want to do.This could lead to some confusion and missed opportunities, so the game gives you a bit of a knowledge boost in the form of a map, a radio, and some tie-in events.  Your map will light up all sorts of items related to the 'quests' you've picked up and will now let you tag the one you want to work on.  Your radio (and microphone in your suit's cowl) will pick up chatter as you pass through an area and you can decide to look into what you're hearing or just move on.  And last, there are times when you see a group of thugs might have one member who can be pumped for information:  if you take out his companions first and finish him last, you can get an XP bonus and a lead on the supervillain he works for.I called my review of Arkham Asylum \"The Batman Simulator\", and that's exactly what we get in Arkham City:  just about anything you've ever seen Batman do in movies and in the comics is something you'll have a chance to do here.  Unlike Arkham Asylum, you don't have to start from nothing.  You get several gadgets to begin with and more seem to come along fairly quickly.  I won't spoil all the surprises, but I'll say that some of your gadgets can be used in multiple ways:  for example, early on there is an electrical weapon that can be used to stun an opponent, to control machinery by zapping it with a charge, or to create a distraction by making a device fire up from a distance (and cause your opponents to run towards it while you lay a trap or get away).There's another new twist in Arkham City, and that's the introduction of Catwoman.  There are times you can play as her, and when you do there are secrets that only she can unlock.  There are also times where the two of them need to work cooperatively:  for example, a trophy Catwoman can pick up might be behind a wall that Batman needs to blow up with his explosive gel.  Catwoman doesn't move or fight like Batman, but the differences don't limit her greatly:  for example, she might not be able to grapple onto a roof, but she can use her whip and her claws to pull herself up, leap, and climb to the same spot just as quickly as Batman's grapple.  Her combat lacks as many gadgets, but has more elements of surprise and speed.Overall, it's as if everything in Arkham Asylum was closely examined and the game's creators figured out ways to make them better.  Clues on the map can now be tagged for later so you don't have to go searching for them again.  Your cape's glide capabilities are drastically improved, giving you more distance and the ability to do all sorts of aerial maneuvers.  Skills that you upgrade can have their 'tutorial activated', which means that when the opportunity comes to use the new skill, you'll get tips on how to do so on-screen, with suggestions like \"too soon\".  Batman has an alternate mode of viewing the environment called \"Detective Mode\" it looks sharper now, and while it has always popped up relevant information in your HUD, in Arkham City it tends to do so more when you need it instead of constantly flashing in the corner of your vision.  Catwoman has this too, in the form of her goggles (though they aren't quite as good).There are only two flaws to Arkham City that I've uncovered.  One is that there is a side story that Zsasz has gained control of the payphones and is using them to taunt you.  When a phone rings near you, you need to answer it or he will kill someone.  Then he may send you off on a mad rush to find the next phone.  These can get really annoying when they cause you to get to a destination, get a phone call, backtrack, return, get another phone call, go somewhere else, and have to come back.  They're optional, but I can't see myself skipping them.  This is a minor flaw because at a certain point the phone calls settle down and I stopped getting them for a while.The other flaw is in the 'Augmented Reality Training'.  This is an optional set of tasks you can do to get bonus items.  For example, you can improve your gliding skills by taking 5 challenges of gliding through increasingly complicated series of hoops.  Some of the maneuvers are downright tough, but you really find yourself getting better at the game's mechanics if you complete them.If you're new to the Batman games, Arkham City won't be the easiest to jump into, but you can pick it up.  Take the easier difficulty and over time you will be rewarded with a great game.  If you've already played Arkham Asylum, \"More of the Same\" is nowhere near as accurate a description as \"Better Everything.\"Either way, Arkham City will be one of my favorite games for a long time to come.

Earily realistic in some spots. Kratos is simply the best character model ever...by a wide margin. The flight scenes look real. Not just for a video game either, they look like live action, super HD reality. Amazing.- Easy to play, difficult to master. Great weapon selection and each of them are fun to use and serve a purpose. I find it especially enjoyable to go crazy with the L1 and X button and watch all of the weapons fly around. Very pretty, very cool. The platforming can be a little wonkers and the fixed perspective isn't my favorite, but this is easily the most playable game of this type I've ever gotten my hands on. Generally the camera is right where it needs to be.- For adults. I have a 14 year old and he is not allowed to play this. The level of detail does not only apply to Kratos, but the female characters as well. It is also really bloody and gory. Violence is expected, that's kind of the point. But I was suprised at how violent some of the boss battles were. Especially the killing of the gods and some of the things that you do to female characters. Watching someone get there head kicked in from a first person perspective is a novel idea and admittedly, pretty cool, but not something for the whole family.- Short on story. It's not bad, it's just not deep. If you haven't played the first two, expect to be a bit lost and just along for the ride. I know I was.- Short in general (and the reason I gave it four stars). Having never played the first two chapters, I went easy the first time through. Beat the game in 7 hours. Played through again on medium, in 8 hours. I'll probably play through it just to see if I can get the platinum trophies, but truthfully, I'm only playing through that many times to justify having purchased it at full price.All  in all, a great game. It is on the same level as Drake 2, without the dynamite story and likeable characters. If the game were a bit longer, less linear, and the puzzles were not as lame, I would have given it 5 stars. Definately a must play for adult gamers, but you can see everything it has to offer in a weekend rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}

Although little has changed in the gameplay since GoW1 and 2, there was nothing wrong with the gameplay so why change it?  The graphics are vastly improved, and I would dare to say it is the best looking PS3 title yet.  The story is pretty good, although Kratos can be off-putting, always growling at everyone he meets about his burning desire for brutal revenge.  The character is like a broken record, and despite warnings about how his actions will negativly effect the entire planet, Kratos selfishly continues his rampage of total destruction.  Despite the rather one dimentional lead character, the rest of the story is interesting, taking the player from one gorgeous locatation to another.  The voice acting is good, and the animation is excellent, combining to create believeable characters.  The music is also top-notch and memorable.  The entire production is polished to perfection here.The most important aspect of any game is the gameplay.  For me gameplay consists of three parts:1. Controls2. Level Design3. A.I.All three are excellent, with the controls being the best.  I have never played a hack n' slash game with controls as fluid, responsive, and natural as these.  The controls are perfect.  The level design is great, although there were a few moments I became lost and didn't know where to go, but it never hurt my enjoyment of the game.  The enemy A.I. is also great, expecially on the harder difficulty settings.  They will block and counter attack and swarm and flank you, forcing you to keep on your toes and formulate a strategy.  You can't just go in tapping the attack button over and over and expect to win.  You will have to look for openings and weaknesses and exploit them with split second timing.  It's not easy, but man is it rewarding.  The other great thing about GoW3 is the variety.  Just when you think you've seen it all, they throw something new at you.  This goes a long way to keeping the game fresh the whole way through.Overall, you really can't ask for a more perfect game.A word of warning:  This game is not for anyone under 17.  Parents, do not buy this for your children.  It contains nudity, sexual content, strong language, and extremely graphic depictions of violence and gore.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

This is the 3000 model. I used to have a 1000 model and the differences between the models are noticeable. The 3000 has a new display which, from what I've heard on the net, some people like and others can't stand to the point that they think Sony has released a bad product. Let me try to clear this up. The old PSP screen from the 1000 model had noticeable smearing when objects move. I mean, it's worse than LCD blurring. It usually didn't matter, though, because a lot of the PSP games just look great anyways. The new 3000 model does not blur at all. Instead, people have complained of an interlaced effect. I do believe this is why there is no more blurring. What's important to know about this effect is it is noticeable when your eyes first adjust to looking at the screen. So if you look away and then look back, you will see this interlaced effect initially. In some other games that feature rapid light flashing(like casting a spell in Final Fantasy) the interlaced effect is also noticeable. I can see it being a deal breaker for some but honestly I think the brighter colors and no blurring far outweigh this interlaced effect. Also, this model features a video output(connectors sold separately). Just plug it into a projector and your good to go big screen style without interlaced effect or blurring! Just note that the image wont take up the entire screen so it really would be good for a projector and not so much a tv.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Loriann Moreno \"Optimist\"","summary":"Excellent Bundle, but at what cost?","reviewText":"I truly wanted to get the move, and i finally did, i think it is a perfect answer for the competition, because it is really precise due to the camera tracking your movement and the controller enhancing the movement of the player as well. Funny enough you can auctully use the move controller to move throughout the menu like a magic wand which i thought was a little bit funny. But let us get to the real questions people want to know and need to know. Do you need to buy anything extra? Is the move worth the cost of buying alone or in a bundle? and it is it auctully going to benefit the future of gaming down the road?One important thing i want to say is if you have the PS3 Eye and Move Controller(or baught it in the bundle), you need to buy the Move Navigation controller with it(it is sold seperately), it is like the Nun chuck for the wii, in the sense that it is to move your character and acts like the other half of the controller, more games are going to require this down the road and right now NBA 2k11, and Heavy Rain use both controllers. Trust me it will save you time and money if you buy it with the bundle. This is the only extra you need really. This is why i deleted a star because it should be all 3 things and a game, not 2 things in a bundle, but Sony will learn down the road and repackage again.When i looked at the Move Controller on it's own it was 69.99 alone, and the PS3 eye was 40 alone as well, so in total you might auctully be spending 110$ on two things, but if you buy this bundle it is a 100$(Move Controller+PS3 Eye) plus a game which is fun for the family and way better than Wii Sports, that demo only had 3 games, but Sports Champions has Volleyball,Archery,Bocce(imagine disc throwing golf), i have played Sports Champions and even a few games with the move, it is really precise and it is surprisingly worth the money in the bundle because sold seperately it is expensive. I also forgot to mention there is a free disc of other game demos as well if you buy the bundle new and not used.Last thing i do want to answer is if this going to benefit the future of gaming, as in, is this going to be an alternative to the controllers we have now. In my personal opinion the demo games i have tried on the PSN store such as TUMBLE which is incredibly fun, Heavy Rain it adds a whole new experience to an already breathetaking game. But down the road we will see, but i still stand by my opinion and say it is the future, and if Sony can capitalize on all fronts of the Move's capibilitys on Socom 4,Killzone 3, we are in business on a futuristic motion coaster.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001X5YN4","reviewerName":"Dagger One Bravo","summary":"A VERY HARD GAME","reviewText":"It's a good game but it's much harder than it needs to be and it has it's fair share of bugs. Really the hardest thing about this game is that at almost no time are you not fighting something. If it's not armed bandits it's packs of wild dogs or pigs or mutants or \"anomalies\" or radiation. And it's one of those games that has enemies that can withstand enough firepower to bring down an elephant. This, to me, is stupid and a cheap way to create a challenge.As for the bugs you can expect frequent crashes, totally unrealistic (and maddening) enemy respawn rates and getting shot through block walls and steel plates. This would be okay if you, as the player, were capable of doing the same to your enemies but you aren't.Why do I give it 4 stars you ask? Simple. The setting and storyline are second to none. The Zone(where the game takes place) is an absolutely miserable place; run-down and abandoned except by armed hostiles and irradiated abominations. The game does an excellent job of instilling fear and a sense of desperation in the player. Every second is a fight for your life, eventhough the developers went quite a bit overboard in getting that point across.It ends up being one of those games you continue to play because you want to know what's over that next hill so badly. It does a good job of that, better than any other game I've ever played but you should expect to get killed constantly so frequent and strategic use of game saves will be something you'll need to plan on doing. If not you often restart at a point pretty far back and this can get aggravating when you have to refight through the areas you barely made it through the first time.For some reason I really love this game. I think it's biggest flaw,and it is certainly not alone, is that it tries to be ultra action-oriented but the developers fail to recognize that there is only so much action you can cope with with a keyboard and a mouse and still have an enjoyable experience. Making it through a horde of mutants, wild dogs or 15 armed enemies in this game IS rewarding. What is NOT at ALL rewarding is the fact that after you do you'll have to do it all again in 5 minutes against another enemy or enemies of whatever sort. Basically, all your deaths until finally beating the immediate threat accomplished nothing except a depletion of your ammo and healthpacks so that you're that much less able to fight off the next horde. Don't think you can sneak around it either. Try that and you will always run into a radiation zone or some other threat where you will fair no better or get pushed right back into the original threat.Still though, I say 4 stars and I recommend it unless you have an anger problem because it can be, more often than not, very aggravating. The frustration caused by the games bugginess pales in comparison to the unnecessarily high level of difficulty programmed into the game.Even on the easiest difficulty setting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2011"}

The graphics are too \"cartoonish.\" When you shoot, you \"see\" the bullets flying through the air. When they hit their target, he is often throw back 10 feet. If you've ever played SOFII, or even Ghost Recon, you'll immedietly notice the lack of realism in the violence. I'm not asking for TOTAL GRAPHIC chaos as in SOFII, but some realism adds to a shooter, and htis game lacks that. The sound is another issue. Nice music, but the gun shots and sound effects overall are weak. Not the mention the fact that you can barely save your game when you want to, and often times repeat whole missions several times.The BOTTOM line...good graphics, weak sound, weak relism, GOOD STORY GOOD IDEA.

The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details. The action is relentless but the frame rate never falters, even when the screen is packed with dozens of enemies that explode into showers of coins when defeated.Wario Worldwill test both your brains and your button-mashing skills.","reviewerName":"Gift \"Supersonic\"","summary":"WARIO TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"Awwesome game to play Wario rules not better than Mario but he still rules and he has got his own game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

Players will discover expansive environments and deep character customization options as they delve into an epic conflict between the Homs (humans) and Mechons (robots) and uncover the secret of the ancient Monado blade. With richly detailed role-playing elements, Xenoblade Chronicles offers an extraordinary experience for veteran gamers and genre newcomers alike.","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"Open world meets J-RPG","reviewText":"As one of the people who signed that petition and pre-ordered it, I'm so glad this game came out!Xenoblade is an amazing game. It's not perfect by any stretch but it does so many things right.The environments are amazing. The areas you explore are huge and rendered in great detail. Whole sections stretch for miles all around with barely any noticeable loading or graphical pop-ins as you move around. The grass, the bushes and the trees all sway in the breeze. Animals move around, doing their daily routine, making the world seem more alive. Panning the camera around gives you some spectacular shots of distant mountains and cliffs.Unlike games like Fable or Kingdoms of Amular-which I've never played but have heard about-your character IS NOT limited to corridors or incapable of jumping around to other areas! Huzzah! In this respect, it feels more like Skyrim in its freedom of movement. FF XII had great environments but boring corridors gameplay. This doesn't, and it feels great!The gameplay is intense and exciting. Similar to FF XII, you take control of one character while the other character auto-attack. However, unlike XII, the game cannot be pre-programmed to play itself. You have to think constantly about what you can do to help yourself and your team-mates. Your character, Shulk, will gain several abilities along the way which allow him to help out his friends in various ways. Teamwork is of utmost importance in this game. Knowing when to use a certain move and in what position, whether to the side or behind an enemy, is key to survival; playing in this way, easily selecting your next move while positioning your character makes sure the game seldom becomes mind-numbing or repetitive. You can even issue commands to your allies, such as \"Focus your attacks!\" or \"Come to me!\" As environments may help or hinder your fighting, being able to rally your friends beside is very important.The music is spectacular. It is composed by veteran Yasunori Mitsuda, the man who once threatened to walk out on Squaresoft if not given an important project and latter went on to compose the legendary score for Chrono Trigger. As always, his music is brilliant and instantly recognizable as his own signature brand. Additionally, the music was composed by five other composers. Obviously, they went all out with the music and it shows. I find myself thinking of these catchy, yet symphonic beats all the time. Most tracks are at least four or five minutes long and far from simplistic. Also, the tone of the music changes from day to night so you will hear different variations of the same song or sometimes a different song all together.Unlike the over-rated FF XIII, this game's music isn't boring or forgettable. It easily finds its way into your subconscious right along with all the other great tracks you grew up with.Overall, gameplay combines several different elements. It plays like an upgraded version of FF XII but gives freedom of movement like in Skyrim. However, unlike Skyrim, you still move from one area to the next in a linear fashion as the story plays out so it feels more like a traditional J-RPG but with modern Western RPG elements thrown in for spice. The story is fascinating and fairly compelling, with a lead character who is thankfully not in the emo mindset we might have come to expect. Shulk is a guy you can respect and enjoy controlling.So with all the great things about this game, why do I give it only four stars? Several reasons which I will now discuss.The graphics in this game are sadly dated. Yes, yes, I know before I said the game looks amazing and it does, but when I say that I only mean in terms of imagination and design. Up close, everything looks like PS2 era graphics. This game would have look amazing by 2004 standards but it is 2012 and the graphics are noticeably behind the times. This may not bother you so much, it really doesn't bother me that much, but it bears mentioning, especially when we're on the threshold of eighth gen. gaming and this looks like it's still back in the sixth gen.The voice acting is terrible. As soon as you play you'll notice they're obviously using the same voice actors for the PAL release of this game. British voices don't bother me so much, and actually think it's refreshing to hear European accents. However, I can't listen to these people speak without seeing them reading from a script in the recording room. They don't sound the least bit convincing except for one or two instances, and it seriously detracts from the story line. Speaking of story, part of the reason the voice acting is terrible may have something to do with poor dialogue. Had this game been in greater demand they may have spent more time in translation and voice work. In the end, this is all we have to work with and really makes it hard to connect with the characters.I saw en entire village get ravaged by flesh eating robots. Not since Spielberg's War of the Worlds had I seen something so chilling. I saw the hero's friend get killed by these machines. I completely forgot myself and felt what the character was feeling. I heard him give a blood curdling scream and say \"I'll kill you!!!\" and felt perfectly in that moment.Then the moment was gone...In the following minutes I was subjected to some of the worst, most clich&eacute;d dialogue and voice acting ever. What a buzz kill. I suddenly didn't care that much about the hero's quest for revenge.This is what you have to look forward to if you want to be invested in the story.Getting back to the gameplay, the menu system is also a little klunky, particularly when buying and selling items. It's way easy to score item in this game and while it certainly helps in better equipping your characters and making money, selling items not needed quickly become a chore and this is a chore you'll have to repeat many times. There's a neat town building segment latter in the game but building up the town is a bit of a pain in that you have to front the materials yourself. When I decided to invest some time into this I found some of the necessary item were ones that I once had but recently sold >.&lt;In conclusion, while this game has some flaws, it is definitely worth getting if you own a Wii and are looking for a good RPG to play.Thank you and happy gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2012"}

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"The End of History, the Beginning of Patches","reviewText":"The *Civilization* series comes a long way since 1991. I'm proud to say I discovered it at the beginning, and I shamed to say the one *Civ* title I did not play was *Alpha Centauri*. I caught everything else on release, and like many longtime fans, I deal with the ebb and flow of sequel quality.The latest entry might not be considered the greatest by some, but *Civilization IV* evolves the series more significantly than any other entry I played. From interface to game mechanics, it ain't your older brother's *Civilization*. I like it, but there's a famous Gary Larson cartoon with God pulling the Earth out of an oven and thinking \"Something tells me this thing is only half-baked\". I also think Sid Meier's *Civilization IV* needs to spend more time in the oven.---A Look at Civilizations Past---*Civilization II* is probably still regarded as the best in the series: having the most units, technologies, improvements, wonders, and ease of modification. For example, players could terraform terrain or build advanced farms-something none of the other titles permit. The game even included a graphics program so you could draw your own units, and I generally find the modding features the most user-friendly of the lot.Activision's spin-off series *Call to Power* isn't as beloved, but it certainly raised the time bar by adding entire future ages, complete with new units, wonders, and improvements. It also greatly expanded the tactical and strategic warfare aspects: such as adding watch towers and sonar buoys, stealth units, and propaganda units. It also streamlined the terrain management (no engineers or workers).*Civ III*, for it's part, streamlined the whole show-a sort of Civ-Lite. With so many features removed and an increased dependency on menus and charts, it could have been a disaster on the scale of *Masters of Orion 3*. Fortunately, *Civ III* imported the Cultural Borders concept first seen in *Alpha Centauri*. It also imported the Strategic Resource concept, which I think was used in *CtP* (though previous games used resources on a more limited scale). And it boasted the best animations and sprites of any turned-based empire building game I knew of. Overall, *Civ III* became a decent tide-me-over `till the next big entry.---At Last, The 2005 Show---Here it is. With *Civ IV*, Firaxis and 2k Games kept the core turn-based, city based, tech-tree gameplay. But just about everything else has been turned on its head.Beginning with graphics. Surely everybody has heard by now the series finally made the big leap to 3D rendering. The terrain tiles remain 2D sprites, but the developers modeled all units and buildings, and many of the improvements and resources. The camera can zoom down to individual buildings and animals, it can pull back to reveal an entire 3D globe, or somewhere the player prefers in between. Players can also view the map head on, or at 45 degrees angles left or right; no full rotation. The game even uses particle effects for smoke, wonder construction, and fireworks displays.Speaking of displays, the maps sparkle with detail. Zoom in on an American Infantry garrison and hear the Marine Corp Hymn playing in the background. Pass over a lumber mill and hear buzzing saws. Watch tiny 3D pigs root in a pen-or an F16 circle a city in a real-time Fighter Engagement Zone mission. That lumber mills and pig-pens can be built-along with farms, windmills, quarries, rigs, plantations and even small towns-livens up the civil aspects of Civ IV. No more generic mines for any resource!The new Terrain Improvements also combine with the resource systems to grant each city a unique identity. The proximity of resources, more than in previous titles, compels cities to specialize production without severely penalizing them for doing something different. Indeed, each tile has at least two different improvements to choose: for example, players can Farm grassland tiles for food, or build over grasslands with Small Towns for commerce. With the right technology or wonder, these improvements can even eek out a bit of production. And grasslands hosting a herd of cows can be developed with a Pasture Improvement instead of farming--once the appropriate technology has been discovered, of course.Of course the technologies revamped as well. The game still uses a pretty simple tree and the same simple system of generating research points to unlock tech. Now players can skip technologies indefinitely, thanks to a new \"either-or\" system of perquisites. In other words, more than one technology can unlock most future tech, and the player need choose only one. Thus, you can skip entire blocks of machine technology to focus on an agrarian society, for example.Technology uncovers religion, another hyped featured. Ultimately, religion in *Civ IV* might seem like window dressing; no religion victory condition exists and the religions all have the same effects. Of course, those effects include increased Culture and Commerce for each city converted to the player's state religion. And foreign cities converted to the player's religion are supposed to provide intelligence about their garrisons... Thus religion becomes another strategic element as civs flood the world with their Missionary units.I could witness all night long to the Civ choir. A lot stuff has changed-mostly to reduce micromanagement and \"less fun\" elements. A new health element affects worker productivity and happiness, but doesn't require any additional management. Pollution no longer affects tiles, it just makes city dwellers sick and angry (radiation poisoning and global warming still affect terrain, however). Cities also no longer riot, and unhappy citizens merely slow production instead of grinding it to a halt. Corruption effectively no longer exists, and cities built far from the capitol suffer production penalties much less extreme than in *Civ III*.---The Apprentice Civ---I wish I could say the game as a whole doesn't suffer, but damn if the bugs aren't extreme. If you have heard this game was rushed out the door in time for the holidays, then consider your hearing sound.I found out just how rushed when I discovered that the disc marked \"Play\" was the install disc, and the disc marked \"Install\" was the play disc! And while a lot of new units exist, I found some noticeable, even anachronistic gaps: the MLRS rocket unit no longer exists, so the player's modern battle tanks and helicopter gunships fight alongside World War I era artillery to the end of the game.And for all of the hype about modding, I found the tools lacking. For example, there is a \"worldbuilder\" tool which permits only limited modification of an existing map (read: \"I cannot add new civs nor change victory conditions, leaders, barbarian scale, event seeds, or the time scale). No map editor shell exists either-if I want to mod a map, I have to load or start a game! Experienced modders should have no problem manipulating the code, provided they can find them: the installation scatters files all over my hard drive, and I still haven't found any core files other than a basic .cfg. In many respects, *Civ IV's* mod tools are the least user friendly to noobs of the entire series.The big giveaway, of course, is the massive memory leaks, video corruptions, and game crashes-even with the latest patch. My PC runs an AMD FX-51 64 bit 2.2 ghz processor, a 128 MB ATI 9800 Pro video card, and a gig of PC2700 ECC RAM. The wonder videos tend to stutter. On the larger maps, as the civilizations spread and advance, the desktop crashes become more and more frequent: of late I cannot play more than about five turns on my current map before the program encounters a problem and needs to shut down. Just to spice things up, I also got a few Blue Screens of Death.---The End of History---I guess all good things come to an end. Firaxis seems to have learned a lot about the series since it first dawned in 1991. The lessons show in *Civ IV*: collating many of the best ideas in the series and mixing them up with new features. Unfortunately, it also features a tremendous number of bugs and missing elements, and *Civ IV* frankly needs some tremendous patches to cope. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this title as it stands. Wait for patches and for an expansion set, or at least wait for the price to drop and stick to playing the smaller maps.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Chutzpuh \"The last PC gamer\"","summary":"Finally, a PC RPG that is worth it","reviewText":"One of the best PC RPG's I have played to date. So far, I have blown a good 15 hours on it and I see lots of my life being drawn in.Pros:Massive amount of content.  The shear number of quests, side quests, NPC interactions makes this a game with huge play and replay value.  Skills are useful and it is nice to finally get a game where dual weapon fighting is not instantly gimped by massive requirements.Voice acting is well done if a bit too medieval sounding.  I still turned on subs and skipped most of the conversations.  NPC control is well done, going back to the Baldur's Gate days of micromanaging actions.  The use of advance tactics/macros makes having additional characters a nice thing.  I love having a healer set up to do buffs and heals depending on the hp's of the party, no more having to pause, switch, click, switch back and continue.Battle looks good as well.  I recall a sequence where I took down a large creature and got to watch a very impressive sequence where my character jumped on the thing and stabbed it with olympic style gymnast motions.Realistic looking battles, unique looks to weapons and armor, huge story depth and simple plain old enjoyment all make this game worth picking up.Cons:Load times, load times and more load times.  Honestly, I haven't seen loads like this since The Witcher, pre-patch.  Not sure if it is DRM related or what, but sometimes you wait over 3 minutes for a load.  Not even for a cut scene or anything amazing, just a regular old city map.  Some players claim they get loads in the 5-30 second mark, but I usually see times at least over 30.This took some of the surprise away from cut scenes and encounters. When I am going along and the game suddenly freezes to load, I already know something is happening and I have actually started to become more annoyed than interested (especially in replays) to see what all the processing is about.The one I hate most is the world map load.  The game takes a solid 30 seconds to show your footsteps on the map (while doing nothing in the background) then it hits a load screen.  Really? What about that chunk of wasted time I just spent looking at that static map screen?  Couldn't you have at least started loading then?  On rare occasions, I have also had the game never recover from the black loading screen.  I just sat there for a while then finally gave up and killed it from the task manager.Aside from loading, performance is another issue.  After reading the specs for this game and seeing the advertisements on TV, I expected something incredible looking.  This is not so much.  It doesn't look horrible, but it is only a minor improvement on Neverwinter Nights 2 (post graphic fixes).  It is rather depressing going from a maxed setting, DX10 game of Far Cry 2 to this game and getting stuttering frame rates at sup par (comparitive) graphics.  An internet search found mentions of this as well as some patch fixes for AMD processors (sadly I run on an Intel).In all, A very good game.  I miss the massive customizable list of classes from the Neverwinter Nights world (this game follows more in the path of Knights of the old Republic for charater development) but you are still given the freedom you want to play how you want.  I see myself dropping countless hours into this game and I am willing to bet that you will as well.Completely worth the investment and like most PC games, expect a patch soon.Just as a reference, here is my system.  Should be more than enough to get me good performance on this game as it is more than enough to run Crysis, Assassins Creed and Far Cry 2 at amazing quality.Dual core 2.4 Ghz processor, 4Gigs DDR3 ram, nVidia 9800 GTX with 1 Gig of ram dedicated, running on Vista 64bit sadly.  Haven't seen if 32 bit XP handles it better.****UPDATE December 10 2009****Just wanted to add, I killed Vista and installed 7 on my machine and got major improvements.  Load times dropped.  Some were still around 15 - 20 seconds, but for the most part they are gone.  Studdering video is gone as well.  Not sure how Vista does it different, but just seeing the change on 7 sole me on the upgrade.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2009"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Very Difficult to Place A Finger...","reviewText":"...on how one feels about this game...We do indeed live in a different era of video gaming, don't we...I did a little research on this title before writing this review.  I could have sworn that this was a remake or a sequel of another game, but apprently it is not - this is a stand-alone title.This makes it a bit tougher, because I was hoping for some history to explain how the story of the game became to be.  You start off on a small boat, heading to shore, and learn quickly that you're the legendary bodyguard to the Empress (that's nice; think I can get a bigger boat next time?)  You're looking around and notice right away the odd graphics.  At first I thought they were just shoddy.  I learned later that this was intentional - \"steampunk\" I learned it was called.  Similar tactics were used by Borderlands.  That's nice, but frankly they bothered me.Anyways, you're quickly kicked to the curb as a bunch of magical beings appear, kill the Empress (rather easily - nice job there, bodyguard) and a few well-dressed blokes appear and blame you.  Now you're in prison, and you're going to be murdered.  Cool.Of course, you escape with some anonymous help, and are wisked away to a safe area where you learn of a coup in the works.  Seems simple enough, right?  You're going to have to kill some bad people, and then all will be well.  \"Why don't you go take a nap...\"  Got it.  Don't mind if I do.Then you awake, and things are...  weird...  Within minutes you're learning magical powers, you're hunting for musical runes and are handed a beating heart...  Wait - WTF is going on here?Dishonored is a strange, strange game.  You have to be ready for the weird.  Don't expect it to make sense, and don't expect to find a lavish backstory.  You're kinda tossed into an action film at the start of the car-chase scene.  Oh, and the cars fly.  Just accept it, k?Bottom line is, you're a magical masterful assassin with plenty of tools and tricks to go and kill some people.  (Even though you showed up on a tiny little boat.)  But...  then the game keeps suggesting you shouldn't kill people.  It actually makes it rather apparent - hints at the bottom of loading screens, stats at the end of levels that show the \"panic\" level induced by the number of people you've killed.  The game makes it apparent that a \"better ending\" is achievable if you keep the kills low...  Oh and here are some grenades and exploding crossbow darts and skills to rewire electrical fences to kill people and hell have a gun or two and......wait, aren't I NOT supposed to kill people?And it gets even better - players tell stories of freezing time and leaving grenades in the lap of an NPC.  Dropping people from roof-tops mid-sentence.  It all sounds very fun, but the game literally tells you \"don't do this stuff - it's a no no!\"Dishonored gives you tools to do things it doesn't want you to do.  It's like having a sports car in a well-policed community with a 15-mile-per-hour speed limit.  You can knock people out from behind and hit them with tranquilizer darts.  That's about it.  If they see you and you're fresh outta ammo, you either have to reload, or use a bond-like slew of assets to render them dead - and be made to feel guilty for it later.And with everything Dishonored does, there's plenty it doesn't do.  Physics are phoned-in at best.  In one level I was carrying a valve knob, trying to find out where I had to place it to access a hidden room.  Around the corner I found a guard-dog who I wasn't expecting and who wasn't pleased to see me.  Almost on instinct I hurled the knob at the dog, hoping for at least a spare second to switch to a weapon.  Instead the valve bounced off the dog and into Oblivion and the dog, much to my dismay, launched at me without even a sound-affect to hint at what I had done.  Later, I picked up an unconscious body with the intent of hiding it.  I turned around to realize that another guard had appeared behind me.  I threw the snoring body of his accomplice at him, expecting to see the two tumbling across the floor.  Instead the conscious guard turned towards me as the lifeless body simply fell off of him as if striking a wall.  He wasn't too pleased to see me, either...I didn't finish Dishonored - I was renting it.  I was a little bummed to make my final game-save and eject it from the console.  But I also can't say I was eager to pick it up again later.  The entire experience was...  bewildering.  Confusing.  Awkward.  It was also rather creepy - almost Fallout'ish in it's tone (Don't misread: this game PLAYS nothing like Fallout - it just \"feels\" like it, somewhat.)At the bottom of every adventurous car commercial is small text that reads, \"Do not attempt.\"  That's kinda how Dishonored treats ya.  \"Does this look awesome?

The premium pack comes with the built in hard drive, which allows you to save games, gamer profiles, music etc...its a worthy option if you plan to use your xbox often.The built in control center is nicely done. When you turn on your 360 you get a bunch of menus from system settings, to audio, to games played and gamer tag profiles.The biggest plus to me is the wireless controller and included headset. No wires is a plus. Also comes with the DVD remote and DVD player built in, no more 30 dollar accessory like with XBOX 1.Graphics are equivalent to a high end computer if you are priveleged enough to own one with an ATI X800 or higher. Very detailed, shadows and the rest. However, it comes with a component AND a regular video connection.

{"product_name":"B0053B7ICO","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Over the top fun on the Wii originally...even cooler on the PS3!!!","reviewText":"\"Are you going to tell me what the (bleeping) G stands for?\" - Detective Washington\"Nope.\" - Agent GIt's been said 100 times over on reviews, but I can't get over how fun this game is to play. Take your typical grind-house movie, throw in a House of the Dead vibe, and some tunes that Quentin T. wished he could have used on Pulp Fiction (here and there anyway!) and you've got the makings of a laugh-out loud funny game.I was wondering how far the TV-MA rating would be taken. Rest assured, SEGA leaves no room for doubt...the profanity in the game (rumor has it that it made Guinness for the most profane game ever), the violence, and the somewhat near \"was that what I think I saw\" Janet Jackson moment definitely does NOT make this a game for the family. It's fun for me, though, when I would like to unwind after a hard day at work and want to do something else besides play Super Mario Galaxy.The banter between the straight-up well-tailored G and the foul-mouthed Detective Washington (who sounds like a dead-on Samuel L. Jackson impersonator) is great. G has his foul moments as well which makes it even funnier. The scene with the ice cream truck cracked me up beyond belief where G and Washington are debating music choices.Another fun moment is when Agent G and Washington find themselves on a little kiddie amusement park ride that moves around like Disney's Snow White through a haunted house...Washington blurts out (after G admits that he's a little scared to be on the ride), \"Are you holding my hand?!?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let go of me (string of expletives).\"So how does the remastered version of this game compare to the original Wii version?  It's well worth the ride in my opinion.  This is not a mere upscale exercise, mind you; they actually went in and dressed up the sets and characters completely.  Agent G had dark sunglasses in the original Wii version; in the PS3, he has yellow-tinted gun glasses and actually looks pretty decent with eyes for a change.  While the frame rate used to take a hit on the Wii if you had loads of zombies and rapid gunfire, the PS3 handles it without a fuss. Like the Wii version, the simulated film scratches and pops actually add to the feel that you're watching a real 35mm B-movie that occasionally jumps as if the film were about to tear loose of its sprockets.  The environments are pretty well done and the variety of gore does take into account where you're hitting the zombies...and the gore looks better than ever.Better still, Varla Guns has a couple of additional levels along with a stripper sidekick - it helps to tell the story between the stories in the original and often with hilarious (and quite adult) results.  I haven't laughed out loud at a game in quite awhile.  While the original Wii version was pretty funny, these additional levels didn't feel like they were tacked on.  They looked great...and man, they are funny.Yet another aspect to the game was the Move controller implementation.  The original Wii version had a similar point-and-shoot approach (and occasionally shaky at that), but the Move controller felt very tight and extremely responsive.  If you're fortunate enough to have the Playstation Move shooter, you're in even better luck because you don't have to swing the Move controller \"off-screen\" to reload.  Simply pump the shooter and you can reload without ever having to keep eyes off target.Sadly, I don't have a 3D screen to evaluate that aspect of the game, but it is 3D enabled if you so choose to play that way.If you liked the original Wii version, you'll LOVE this one.  If you own the Move and the official PS3 shooter attachment, trade your Wii version in and pick this one up.  This was really how the game was meant to be played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

This game also has a few disappointments init like it is not a very long game. Some of the missions aren't as exciting as the previous games some of the guns are not as cool as they used to be and Soap dies. Those are the sucky areas of this game. Also there are some good areas of this game like Makarov dies and Captain Price lives. Overall this is a very good game I not one who only cares about playing multiplayer online. The special ops are good they are cool.  The best thing about this game though is Survival Mode better than zombies if you ask me.

Those of us that were playing the pre-release beta could not believe that Slant 6/Sony were going to release this buggy, laggy game that you could not stay connected to.However, most problems with the game have now been fixed. The problems that remain are due to game play issues that are quirky, like not being able to throw a grenade around a corner or shoot over a railing you are standing against. Many of these issues are seen in a series of hilarious videos on Youtube entitled \"SOCOM is Dead\".Overall its now as good as any of the older SOCOM versions. Graphics are on par with other FPS Playstation 3 games. It's a game where team play is important.Many people try and compare SOCOM, a non respawn Third Person Shooter, to Call of Duty, a First Person Shooter, mostly respawn game. To me, COD is more arcade like as evident with people not using their mics to coordinate.If you liked any of the old SOCOMs, you will probably like this new version. It finally has the feel of the older games. There are still some things that don't work in the game play but overall, its a fun game.If you haven't played SOCOM, its less of an arcade game then the Call of Duty games and less involved then Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6 games.ProsClansExciting game playMany game type options (suppression, escort, etc)Great graphicsServer and room are shown on Friend's ListLower PriceConsCan't throw grenades around cornersRoom and Server info doesn't include room numberRoom names are on the server list are not alphabetizedStill some lag/frame rate issuesClan battle scheduling/rank not live yetNo offline playControls are not as good as other shootersNeutralThe last update includes MedalsUPDATE June 2009Slant Six and Sony have really dropped the ball on the SOCOM franchise. 8 months after its release we are still waiting on downloadable maps from the PlayStation Store. While the vast majority of bugs are gone, the wait on downloadable content is being blamed on testing a massive patch that will fix just about everything and add a clan war system. In the meantime, perhaps SOCOM's biggest competitor Activision releasedCall of Duty: World at WarAFTER SOCOM and last week released its SECOND Map Pack. SOCOM has a following, one that Sony truly has put through the wringer with its releasing this title 2 months before a playable patch was released. I saw industry reviews on the initial bug plagued offering as low as 6! Anyway, this patch, 1.5 that has been promised for months may be out any day or as some have joked, in time for the PlayStation 4 system.

The spin dash move is introduced2. 7 full zones with 3 1-act ones.3. Tails4. Different Special StagesThe special stages are entirely different from the first game. Now you must run through a halfpipe, collecting rings to get Chaos Emeralds. However, this is easier said than done. The sound and music are, once again, excellent. The graphics are also great, as they are an improvement of Sonic 1's.What's really great about this game is the multiplayer mode. While you do have to compete against the other player in finishing the levels first (or getting higher scores), you guys also have to beat those 4 multiplayer zones altogether!Overall, the game is awesome and challenging. This is the Sonic game all fans should get.UPDATE: I found out a really cool Easter egg. In 1-Player mode, someone can actually control Tails as the second player! This is pretty much the closest thing to a 2-Player co-op mode. Although Sonic still hogs the camera, your friend can help collect rings, defeat the bosses, get rings in special stages, and he/she can just plain goof off.

This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

Aside from a graphical update many of the problems I had with the original Counter-Strike are still alive and well in the Source update.Let me say that the graphics are good. Not F.E.A.R. good, or Doom 3 good, but still a huge improvement over the original Counter-Strike. The blood sprays across the enviornment very well and after a room full of people shoot each other up it's a site to see. Also the wounds look really good on the corpses. I especially like shooting people in the face now. The detail on the guns is pretty good, some look better than others on the source engine, but none look bad.Still, there are a lot of problems with Source (more personal problems of mine than actual ones) that remain from the original. For instance, the AWP can still kill a person with one shot to the foot. I know Counter-Strike doesn't tout itself as having realistic action, but that is still pretty pathetic. Furthermore I would still like to have a fire selector to put some guns to semi-auto, I don't think it's too much to ask. I would love a game wide stats tracker while Valve's at it but I won't hold my breath.If you liked the original Counter-Strike you will like the Source version. The graphics are much better, theres still user created maps, and the physics got an overhaul. Some nagging issues remain, but they're minor for the most part. My main problem at the end of the day is the graphics is all this game really has on the original. I wish they would of put something new in. A new mode, some weapon balancing, stats, something. New guns only go so far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00007KQE9","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Awful camera, repetitive controls...what else is new?","reviewText":"The concept had seemed interesting ever since the first Dynasty Warriors game hit the shelves, but it wasn't until now that I tried actually playing this game.As with all other one-against-many fighting games -- like Final Fight or the granddaddy of them all, Double Dragon -- the computer basically keeps trying to get at you from the back to disrupt your moves.  That's fair game and to be expected.  What I hadn't expected was that you would have a game camera that steadfastly refuses to look where you want it to.  Sixty per cent of the time, I'm swinging at enemies behind me when I can't even see them, because the camera idiotically stays in its own angle, so that when you're battling a particularly powerful enemy, he could all of a sudden land someplace you can't see and you'd have to run around begging for the camera to go back to a 3rd-person perspective behind you so you know where you're going.  Also, the 360-degree pan when you execute a super move only serves to disorient your controls.  Maybe these camera problems serve to fulfill the game designers' feeble fantasies of being filmmakers, but in a game, it's just irritating.  The fighting &quot;system&quot; is pathetic -- lots of button mashing in all directions.  Most of your combos are useless because you're receiving attack from all sides, so you end up using one combination over and over because anything else would be suicide.  So I played through the entire &quot;Shu&quot; story by doing one combo.  Yeah, I'm passing levels, but it's monotonous as hell.As the Amazon editorial review noted, there's also a lot of running around in this game.  The programmers love designing level maps chock full of dead ends, forcing you to run all the way around to get where you want.  Even on horseback, it takes friggin' forever.  And then there's the game's charming tendency to magically make three powerful enemy platoons appear right beside your commander whom you're supposed to protect...if you happen to be launching an attack against the enemy base at that time and can't find a horse, good luck.  Oh yeah, and the enemy can do the ol' &quot;block you to death&quot;.  I had Cao Cao cornered with only 5 per cent of his health left, and all he did was put his back to the mountain, hold down block against all my eight bodyguards and myself, and waited for five minutes straight until troops from his side appeared right beside my commander and took him out in a flash.  This was 95 per cent through the level.  Call this fun?I've been able to advance very well through this game, but it's really not a good gaming experience.  And I'm willing to bet Dynasty Warriors 5 is just on the horizon...with the exact game mechanics.  Koei has made it a habit of releasing the same game over and over without making any real improvements on sequels, so I seriously doubt I will ever play another Dynasty Warriors game again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2004"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

Starting with FF8, every game in the FF series is very epic in scope, but fails to fill the framework of its design with sufficient plot and character-related details. In Final Fantasy VII, there are so many tiny, optional events which round out the mythos of the game's world in ways that may be unappreciated at first, but collectively contribute a sense of groundedness to the fantastical setting. Take the discovery of Gast and Ifalna's videos in Icicle, for example. Final Fantasy VIII still has these types of details, such as the ability to read about GARDEN on Squall's workstation terminal. It just doesn't have nearly enough such details to flesh out the world, and after FF8, this element of the series only gets worse. Upon reaching Esthar, the largest city in FF8, the player almost as quickly leaves it, and less seems to be happening there than in the small island-town of Balamb.FF8 is a great game. Although somewhat ruined by the story of FF7, FF8's hero does have dynamism and personality, and the ability to read the hero's thoughts is a great enhancement to the game's storytelling. Many recurring symbols emerge through objects, equipment, and special effects in battles, to represent the characters: the cross, the lion, the angel wing. The abstract \"flower field\" scenes lend significance to the literal ones, and the significance of Laguna, Julia, Raine, and Ellone's story lends a sense of inevitability to Squall and Rinoa's attraction. Figuring out and using the junction system is lots of fun for the player, although the gameplay could have been improved significantly with one or two simple changes, such as limiting the amount of magic that the party may draw from each monster.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

However Platinum Games is trying to resurrect some life into this beast with The Wonderful 101. But is this a game that will make Wii U owners cry out in happiness or is this going to be another title that just falls short?Earth has come under attack by a group of alien terrorists calling themselves GeathJerk. The superheroes of the world answer the call to protect their own planet. But alas as each of them are not as strong to take on the hordes of enemies. It is clear that they must unite to rid the world of the alien infestation. As you move through the levels you need to recruit more and more people so your force will grow larger. Once you have enough people all the heroes can combine to become an object to lay the smack down. From whips to guns and other items that can interact with the levels and solve puzzles these are just a small selection of the items at your disposal. The more people you collect the stronger you can become and unlock the unite morphs of the various main heroes in the game. Swords, Fists and other devastating weapons are some of the tools you can unlock to lay the smack down. The enemies that you defeat will drop O Parts that will unlock items and upgrades to abilities.You control your group of heroes with the gamepad and can group them by drawing on the gamepad or using the right analog stick. This relies on simple shapes so you don't have to be accurate to get what you want. My only problem with this game is that we will probably not seen it released on any other console.

Newcomers to gaming might be put off by the RTS learning curve, but veterans should have no trouble adjusting to the multiple game types.  Virtual explorers will have plenty of ground to cover and hidden treasures to search for and there is even multiplayer if you feel like battling you Xbox Live buddies for metal supremacy. Given the extreme brevity of the game, I'm glad I got it for only $20; but at that price it's well worth it since this is the kind of game you are going to want to play more than once. Brutal Legend opens with one of the funniest cutscenes ever. While watching this brutally sweet intro, you have the options to PG-13ify your gaming experience to bleep out the swearing and do away with the dismemberment. If you are a loser, that is.Eddie Riggs is the best roadie in the business, but he is not pleased with today's popular metal scene. He longs for songs about vikings and album covers with demonic monsters on them and singers who shriek as if they were being dragged into the bowels of Hades. Well, he's about to get his wish. Finding himself transported to a savage land filled with demon nuns, rocker chicks, and medieval weaponry, Riggs finds is true calling when he encounters a group of human rebels waging war against the Tainted Coil race of demons. All they need is for somebody to show them the ancient power they lost. The power of METAL!  Brutal Legend is really more like 5 games in one. It's a hack-and-slash action game that has Eddie wielding his two weapons (guitar and battleaxe) to mow down the baddies with cold hard steel, pyro, and of course, heavy metal thunder. He gets around the world in his highly customizable hot rod The Demon Plow (affectionately referred to as The Deuce) which he can summon anytime by busting a sweet guitar solo. These solos are activated in a Guitar Hero-like sequence of timed button-presses and serve many purposes throughout the game from uncovering relics to delivering orders to troops or slaughtering large groups of baddies (by melting their faces, see). The landscape is littered with side quests that earn you Fire Tributes (aloft lighters), which indicates favor with the Metal Gods and is used for currency to upgrade your weapons, abilities, and vehicle. Waiting to be uncovered in every corner of this epic land are chained stone beasts who will grant you power and tales of the history of the world you now inhabit if you can figure out how to release them. Plus there are bonus songs and powerful new solos to discover and unlock. Most of your time will probably be spent just cruising around smashing random hordes of demons and staring at the amazing landmarks while you search for more hidden hotness. Exploration is very important in this game.The meat of the game's primary missions revolves around the \"stage battles\", where Eddie sets up a rock show war machine to run the enemies of their group Ironheade out of town. These large-scale battles are a simplified version of the classic real time strategy format, but can also incorporate the other aspects of the game for a unique experience. Flying above the battle on wings of a demon, Eddie can summon and give orders to his troops or he can get personally involved by kicking tail on foot or in The Deuce. He can also activate powerful double-team attacks with any member of his army, which is very cool. My personal favorite has to be the mosh attack, where Riggs thrusts a devil horns hand sign in the air and calls his troops to gather around while they bang their heads in unison and bowl over enemy infantry. It makes for a very cool and funny gaming moment. Brutal Legend has a lot of those. Over the course of the game, Ironheade will not only take on the Tainted Coil, but the evil forces of Lionwhyte (representing for hair metal) and the emo/goth-tinged Drowning Doom. The way these armies and their leaders are presented is extremely satirical and is a blast for music fans familiar with the countercultures they represent as they trashtalk their way through each fight.Now all this is well and good, but what really makes the game a must is the story, the cast, and the music. Sadly, the story is short enough to easily play through in one sitting, but it is funny enough that you'll want to play it more than once and you will have to spend significant time to see everything there is to offer. The soundtrack is MUCH longer than the game and I still haven't heard all of the ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN songs included. The music is a diverse sampling of various styles of metal featuring everyone from big names like Black Sabbath and Rob Zombie, serious death metal like King Diamond and Loki, 80's pop metal from bands like Def Leppard and The Scorpions, industrial from Ministry and KMDFM, power metal from Dragonforce and Manowar, and a hell of a lot more. Naturally, the metal gods who lent their voices to the game also lent their music and Jack Black's folk/metal band Tenacious D is on hand, of course. The way certain classic songs are used in the narrative is pretty awesome too. Now, I keep telling you about how great the characters voiced by the legends of heavy metal music are so you're probably wondering who they are.  Well, do you want to lead a cadre of headbangers flanked by Lemmy and Rob Halford on choppers to smash up an emo pity party?  Yeah, you do.  Do you want to ride out of the underworld with a brand new batch of weapons while Ozzy shouts \"Go f@#%ing CRAZY!\" after you?  But of course. Sadly, the late great Ronnie James Dio was stricken from the game due to a tantrum by a certain Prince of Darkness (or more likely, his wife) and his absence in this is HUGE. I'm sure Jables was devastated by this criminal omission and the fact that I played Brutal Legend mere days after his passing didn't help. Still, Dio or no, one cannot underestimate the awesomeness of battling a giant chrome spider to secure the steel webbing necessary to string Lemmy's bass so he can heal your Lita Ford-inspired ladyfriend (Ford also voices a character). That's right: Lemmy Kilmister's bass-playing heals the sick in this game. I always suspected he could do that. The story is only a few hours long, but its' packed with awesome and a surprising amount of emotion for what is essentially a spoof. The game does a masterful job of slowly introducing the various elements and it never gets particularly challenging on normal difficulty. The only way I really died is by carelessly driving off of a cliff (or ten).My biggest complaint with Brutal Legend is that it feel as though it's just getting started when it's already over. By the time each game element is brought to bear, you are at the final confrontation and already anticipating the next big battle that will never come. This is just plain wrong. There's only one battle in the whole game where you have your entire selection of units to utilize. What the hell? On the other hand, multiplayer allows you to challenge the computer or another player to rock as many stage battles as you like as either Ironheade, the Tainted Coil, or The Drowning Doom, which is an excellent addition. However, the difficulty is ramped waaaaayyyy up on these so the clumsiness this RTS veteran showed integrating into the different aspects of the main game's stage battles did not go over well.  The multiplayer AI plays to win. All in all, the only real problem with Brutal Legend is it's extreme brevity and failure to integrate the entire world into the story. If you want to see all of the great metal-themed visuals, music, and powers that the game has to offer you are going to have to spend a lot of time just driving around. The main game's stage battles are few enough that it feels like they are more of a tutorial for the multiplayer (which is NOT the reason to get this), and that's a big wrong. But still, at a discount price and with all the great music and heavy metal coolness of this game, it's still a rockin' way to kill some time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2010"}

It is understandable that a moogle is the only race that can become a moogle knight. But why can't a moogle be a green mage or arcanist if they can become a black mage? It really limits the customization aspect of class building. It also limits many of the abilities that could and should be accessible across the races, such as safeguard and counter-regenerate.Many of the classes have been nerfed. Ninja skills do next to no damage, but working through ninja long enough to gain the two-weapons ability is worth it (but no more sticking with the ninja class like in FFT). Green mages are nearly useless and most of the spells they use were originally given to black mages or white mages in previous games. I did like the Arcanist, Blue Mage, and Alchemist jobs. And time mage got a little boost as well with some interesting spells.Also, you gain EXP per battle based on the average level of your team vs average level of the enemy team with a slight bonus in exp for those who battled well. Each level requires 100 exp to advance. So this means that you can pop in a character, have them do nothing and basically gain 60 exp per battle. The AP and gil are also set. Each can be given a slight bonus with additional 'clan privileges' but again, it means that everyone is sharing the wealth. I did prefer FFT setup where each attack/spell/ability use gains xp and jp.Another aspect removed is the steal weapon/armor skills. Now you can only steal loot, gil, or an accessory. I understand this may be to prevent the player from gaining access to more powerful weapons too early, but that is what the safeguard ability is for.What all of this means is that the system is definitely dumbed down a bit from FFT, probably to make the game more accessible to all ages (and non-Japanese players apparently). And in keeping with the all ages theme, the story is watered down and given a good dose of 'all ages appeal'. There are some fun moments, but it seems that the story is rather lighthearted despite the fact that the crew runs around killing helpless rabbits and fairies. (Okay, maybe those rabbits are rather annoying and not helpless...). The story does pick up a bit towards the end and when you finally discover there is a mastermind. It's nice to finally have a central villain.A huge plus is the pub where you accept jobs. The jobs are varied and generally fun. Many of the missions have interesting little twists, such as \"reduce the mark to critical while slaying the others\", or \"protect this NPC while eliminating the opposition and not allowing them to pass beyond this boulder\". Some are more difficult to others. Add to it the judge system where you receive a clan privilege as long as you uphold the law. The laws also vary but might be 'no attacking' or 'Viera can only perform basic attacks' or 'prohibited from doing more than 20 damage per attack'. These add a little difficulty and add a few nice rewards (extra loot, plus later you can use privileges to increase the amount of AP or gil after a battle). To receive new privileges, one must complete clan trials, which are increasingly difficult.Another minor annoyance is scrolling through the purchased weapons and armor. Once you start acquiring more weapons (and keeping them since they have abilities for learning attached to each), the list becomes insanely long. There is really no way to quickly scroll the list and they only break the lists into three categories. So scrolling through over 100 bladed weapons to find which one you want to equip next or which one might have an ability you want to learn can become a chore. And L/R only move the menu to the next category. Ugh! Minor annoyance though.Overall this is a great strategy game and well worth a purchase. It isn't as deep or serious as Final Fantasy Tactics, but it is an improvement on FFT Advance. If you want deeper there are others on the DS, but not many as polished as this game.Pros:+ Great Clan setup+ Interesting item acquisition and bazaar+ Lots of classes and races to choose+ Graphics and music quality push the DS envelope+ Replay value and many extra (optional) battles+ Ease of movement with world map+ Challenging clan trials and judge systemCons:- Thin story- Some of the same music from FF12 and FFTA- Some battles way too easy- Some classes uninteresting- Bazaar system needs tweaking- Easy last boss","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Anderson \"Robbin505\"","summary":"Good, But Not Great","reviewText":"If you want a pretty decent and somewhat reasonably priced dedicated headset for the PS3 I would recommend this.  I am not sure what the BassImpact thing is supposed to do, maybe mine is broken, but my headset sort of rumbles and and sounds like a blown speaker.  I would best describe my BassImpact experience like this:  You know that sort of rattly sound that cars with really loud sub-woofers make?  That's what its like to use the feature for me.  It adds nothing and actually detracts from my ability to hear what is going on around me.  I just turn it off, I assume this will also help increase the incredibly poor battery life.  I charge it every time I quit playing now just to avoid losing power mid game.  I know I have been making this thing sound pretty bad so far but those two things, BassImpact and short battery life, are the only two real drawbacks.  The sound is really good.  The voice levels can be adjusted using a slider on the headset.  All of the sound levels are changed using sliders instead of buttons actually.  The voice levels are changed by increasing the level of game sound or voice sound.  I found this useful for when you are talking to someone that you can't hear well.  I can move the voice level up and then use the master volume to turn everything up so that I don't have to choose between hearing them or hearing the game.  This is a very heavy duty headset, very sturdy and seems well made.  The dongle has a plug built in so that music players can be used also, I like this feature because most game music is either repetitive or just non-existent.  I do find it to be too tight, and I have a small head, so over extended play time I get a bit sore in the head.  I figure it will stretch out over time and the benefits of it not falling off outweigh the short term discomfort for me.  I really like the headset so far, I plan to update this review at a later date.Update 12/20/2012I found another drawback and adjusted my rating due to this.  The headset needs to be plugged in to a device that is on in order to charge.  You might be thinking,\"so what\"?  How else would you charge it?  Think about this though.  It means that your PS3 has to be on the entire charge cycle.  You can't finish playing for the night and just turn everything off, you have to leave the PS3 on the whole time it charges.  I tried plugging it into a wall charger that I use for other USB devices and it doesn't charge.  I either have to plug it into my computer while it is on or my PS3 while it is on but I always, ALWAYS, have to make sure that I have a device running to charge this headset everyday.  This was a whole star loss of a problem for me so I changed my rating to 3 stars because of it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B008XMSR6G","description":"Neo-Paris. 2084.Personal memories can now be digitized, bought, sold and traded. The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"Awesome Story, Terrible Gameplay","reviewText":"Intro:Remember Me is an action-adventure video game released in 2013 worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.  It was developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Capcom.  Remember Me was originally a PlayStation 3 exclusive titled &#8220;Adrift&#8221; before it was cancelled in 2011.  It was later purchased by Capcom and developed as a multiplatform video game.If I am being completely honest, I was never enamored by Remember Me.  It never stood out to me for some reason, so I never paid attention during its development or after its release.  It was last month when I read something about the premise of the game and decided it actually sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.Story:They game is set in Neo-Paris in the year 2084.  A corporation called Memorize invented a brain implant called Sensen that lets people upload their memories onto the net and share them with other people or even delete their bad ones.  Memorize has turned into a giant corporation that now has most of the population under surveillance because everyone relies on Sensen.  Some humans have become so addicted to using their Sensen and absorbing memories that it has started to degrade and has turned them into mutant-like creatures.A group of rebels called the &#8220;Errorists&#8221; did not agree with what Memorize was doing, so they started to fight back and have been trying to bring them down.  The character you play as is a young woman named Nilin, who works for the Errorists.  The game starts out with Nilin in a prison and she is about to have her memory completely erased by Memorize.  The memory wipe doesn&#8217;t completely work, so she is being escorted to have the last bits erased when she is saved by an unknown man named Edge.  The rest of the game is about Nilin&#8217;s crazy fight to take down Memorize, all the while discovering more and more about her startling past.Does that premise not sound amazing?  The story stood out to me more than anything else in this game because of how crazy it is.  I am fascinated with science fiction and this seemed like a new take on how the future could end up.  Eventually we start to see the same basic stories over and over in our books, television shows, and games, but this one was so out there that I was intrigued.  I have to say, I really enjoyed the story of this game.  There were twists and turns that I didn&#8217;t always expect, which is hard to say for games these days.Presentation:Having played several Capcom games before, this game&#8217;s graphics fit the mold that I expected.  What does that mean you ask?  It was nothing flashy.  I mean it was a very interesting setting: Futuristic Paris.  But they did not go out of their way to make anything extremely pretty.  Most of the settings were made up of different shades of gray with neon lights everywhere.  It never had any frame rate issues though, so that is a positive.  There was nothing very catchy with the music either, which is not really a bad thing.  It just doesn&#8217;t add to the experience unless the music is something special, which is rare.Gameplay:My biggest issue with Remember Me is the combat system.  It was so ridiculously monotonous that I found each battle to just be tiresome.  Combat is made up of a series of combos.  Combos are made up of stringing together a series of buttons.  Not every series can be a combo.  There are only a handful of combos, and they are a preset button series.  This means that you have to memorize what each combo is.  You have a three, five, and seven hit combo you can use throughout the game.  But there is a catch, you can&#8217;t use them unless you have unlocked each button in the combo.  You unlock them by earning experience points from kills.What all of this means is that you may only have three buttons unlocked that you can use in your five hit combo until you unlock more.  The only cool part about the combo combat system is that when you unlock buttons you can choose which kind to unlock.  They come in four categories that will reward you each time you use them, such as healing you or doing extra damage.  The other way Remember Me adds to the combat system is the use of special moves.  They are unlocked naturally through the story and are very useful.  They are regulated by having cool down timers so that you can&#8217;t spam these more powerful moves.Battles just seemed to drag on.  Sometimes they would last two or three minutes, but sometimes there are groups of enemies that make battles last five to ten minutes.  This is entirely too long for the ridiculous button mashing style of combat.  My fingers were aching by the time I was done with each battle.  This was one of the most annoying combat systems I have ever played.One of the more interesting parts of Remember Me is when you get a &#8220;memory remix&#8221; section.  This means that you are able to change someone&#8217;s memories for better or worse.  You basically hack into their memory and have the ability to rewind and fast forward through it as much as you like in order to find different objects to interact with.  Each object you interact with will adjust the outcome of the memory just a little bit.  Accessing the right items in the right order will lead the memory to have a good or bad outcome.  This was a fascinating idea, but it wasn&#8217;t done enough.The rest of the game is made up of a series of running and climbing, much like Assassin&#8217;s Creed.  This was actually my favorite part of the gameplay.  During these sections of the game you will be able to search for a number of collectables that are in the game.  These collectables will award you with more health, information, etc.The Verdict: 7.0 out of 10If games were only judged on their premise or story alone, Remember Me would be an outstanding game.  Sadly, we know that is not the case.  This game will forever be remembered for its dry, monotonous combo system.  See what I did there?  If you are into a cool futuristic story with plot twists, I say go ahead and play this game.  If neither of those applies to you then I advise you to stay as far away from this game as possible.  The simplest way I can describe this game is it was not fun to play.  I would have rather watched a movie or read a book with this story instead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006GEX2","description":"From the makers ofAge of Empirescomes a strategy game where the line between history and mythology has been blurred. InAge of Mythologyheroes do battle with monsters of legend, and the gods intervene in the affairs of mortal men.Age of Mythologyplayers wage war as leaders of a Greek, Norse, or Egyptian civilization with a customized pantheon. Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challengingAge of MythologyAI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.Age of Mythologyoffers something for everyone: a fun game for any playing style or skill level.","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Starts great, gets repetitive, not a real whole pile to do..","reviewText":"The game starts well much like any of these RPG Sim games do. Build your town, increase its population, build more structures, updrade everything, develop an army, send them all off to war. Direct who they should fight along with some strategy.However for all its upsides and fun the game has a lifespan of about a week or two at best and unless you really love it you may find yourself quickly looking for another game for variation. To be honest I enjoyed 50% of this game but then it just got too repetitive to continue playing it any more and the point + click... see how it works, sometimes becomes just straight forward button bashing and sending men off in droves to fight some war and really, that is it. Create buildings, create creatures, create men and send them off to war and keep an eye on the basic utilities so that you do not run out of wood, food and gold.Good but not exactly a ground breaking RPG game although it is a lot better than other RPG games out there, but sadly the initial joy becomes bordom. This was actually one of the few highly-rated 5 star games that did not live up to the hype for me and I wanted it to.

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"An impressive game","reviewText":"Grand theft auto 4 is one of those games that makes me marvel at how much detail got put into it.  It's such a big game but so much close attention was paid to make it play well and look good as well.The graphics are great.  Liberty City is fully realized city with tons of people and traffic.  Its one of the most impressive cities in a game that I have seen.  It truly feels alive.The story is great overall.  The main character is Niko Belic, a russian immigrant that arrives to the US on a ship.  From there you pretty much work with all kinds of shady folk in order to make money.  Niko has his motives that he works toward throughout the game.  He's an interesting character and his story is an interesting one to play through.  Its a lengthy one as well.If I had to say the one thing I think rockstar nailed down almost perfectly in this game I would have to say the physics.  From the people to the vehicles in the game everything reacts in such realistic way.  It's very apparent to how much attention went in to making everything act realistically.  Each car has its own kind of physics.  Trucks are heavy so they will plow through other vehicles a lot easier than cars. Different cars have better handling than others making it so you have to adjust to the weight of each one to get turning down.  When a pedestrian is hit.  They will react realistically.  If you clip their leg or arm they will jolt and whip around in a violent way.  If you hit them straight on they will fold on top of your hood in a very gruesome spectacle.  To put it simply its the best ragdoll effect that I have seen in a game.  Even today.If you shoot an enemy they will react accordingly.  And each weapon has its own power to it.  If you shoot someone in the leg while they are running they will topple to the ground.  My favorite is shooting their leg while they are climbing steps.  What follows is an amusingly realistic topple down the stairs.  If you take advantage of the physics in the game you will have a lot of fun watching what happens in each segment of the game.The missions in this game are very well done overall.  Some of them aren't that great and sometimes leave you wondering what the point of it was but for the most part they take advantage of the strong points in the game. My favorite mission of all time is in the game.  It involves a bank heist and has you running from the cops trying to escape.  It's just awesome.There is a great addition the the gta series that helps immensely in missions: the cover system.  This mechanic works well.  Niko is able to snap into cover easily almost anywhere.  Behind cars, dumpsters, walls, etc.  While in cover he can aim, pop up, shoot and repeat.  This makes firefights a lot more enjoyable than the ones from past gta games.Once you have completed the single-player campaign you can hop into some of the most entertaining multiplayer available.  There are a bunch of different game modes to play including team deathmatch and you can play them throughout the whole city or you can choose a section of it to play in.  You can have up to 16 players in a match.I did give this game 5 stars but I don't think this game is perfect.  There is pop in every now and then that can get annoying sometimes.  Combat in tight spaces doesn't work all that well and can result in some frustrating deaths.  And Nikos movements are a little too stiff for my tastes.  These complaints are minor, however.  This game is just an awesome package.  I recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000059Z7G","description":"When longtime Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut on the Dreamcast console inSonic Adventure, gamers were stunned. Sega had not only used the game to show off the tremendous possibilities of the then-new hardware, but they had reinvigorated the platform-style arcade adventure genre with massive, intricate levels, gleefully distracting minigames, and even a new kind of virtual pet, called a Chao, that could be combined with other pets, traded with friends, and even exchanged over the Internet.Sonic Adventure 2ups the ante of its predecessor with all-new puzzles and levels, and even faster action reminiscent of the early Genesis-era games. Knuckles and Tails are back, as are the Chao pets (who can now talk!).","reviewerName":"nafysmiley","summary":"Sonic is Cool","reviewText":"Sonic Adventure 2 is all around a decent, although somewhat disappointing game.  It had a lot of potential, and got surprisingly good reviews, but it did not live up to the hype.  Don't get me wrong, Sonic/Shadow levels are awesome, and really fun despite being easy.  I would even have to say that Sonic levels by themselves would nab a 5.  The game's major fault, however, is the different levels for different characters.  It would be fine to play with Knuckles or Tails in levels similar to Sonic ones.  They are cool characters.  But instead, Tails (as well as Eggman) are put into inane shooter levels.  They are bearable, but detract from the games essence.  The Knuckles/Rouge levels, on the other hand, are downright horrible, and possess almost no redeeming value (other than you get to be Knuckles, and glide, punch, and climb on things).The storyline is surprisingly good and well thought out, as well as non-cliched, for a simple action game.  Having a Hero and Dark sides of the storyline is really cool, and they help color each other in.  The cut scenes are plentiful and well done, though the English voice acting is terrible (Japanese voices with English subtitles is preferable).  The bosses and boss fights are interesting and added a special flare (at least the ones that weren't other playable characters).  The graphics are nice.  A little outdated, but good enough that it doesn't detract from the game.  Though the camera is bad enough for it to be impossible to see any of the graphics anyway.  On a side note, I think that is exactly how Sonic and Eggman look.  I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about.  The music is amusing at first, but seemingly not very well done (the menu screen music, if left running for ten minutes, is enough to drive one insane).One last thing to mention: Chao World.  It is a nice, adorable, well programmed, fun little diversion, but is ultimately pointless (especially without a working VMU).All in all, Sonic Adventure 2 was cool, but with some infuriating flaws, like non-Sonic/Shadow levels, which pulled it down from 5 to 3 stars.  Still, I would suggest buying it if you're looking for a little action or adventure.  Have fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2002"}

I played this game over and over again just to play it.  It's a fun game, but out of all the times I played it I could never defeat the Ruby Weapon.  I think he's like impossible or something! LOL  But even so, that wasn't much of a let down because the rest of the game was so cool.  And Sephiroth... what a perfect villan.  He looked pretty cool!

{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Classic GameFan1991","summary":"Most Influential RPG of Its Era.","reviewText":"While this game may not be the very best RPG in my opinion, I must give this game credit for being able to finally throw the RPG genre into the mainstream for two gaming generations. This game was the first game in the series to feature stunning FMV with 3D character models in pre-rendered backgrounds, which was a major step up for the RPG world, considering that any RPG released before this one either only had 3D models during battle sequences or none at all, but of course graphics are not everything. Gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game; it is the sole reason games are played, to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itself.This game still maintains the fast-paced ATB system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles. One of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles, and very few other RPGs at the time.This game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as \"materia\". Materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is used.Overall, I would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike, as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral I have mentioned above. This should last one a good 50-70 hours, depending on whether one decides to undertake the various sidequests offered in the game or not.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2012"}

I played quite a bit of Forza 2 and have been anxiously waiting the arrival of Forza 3.Firing up this game the first thing you will discover is that to get all the benefit of the game you MUST have a hard drive.  If you do not you will not be able to use all of the cars nor race all of the tracks.  Thankfully I upgraded to a 60GB drive a few months ago and don't install alot of stuff so I had room for both the mandatory content install and a full game install.  The benefit is much shorter loading times and I have yet to see the drop in frame rate that other have mentioned.The game itself is a blast.  While I do not use a racing wheel I've heard many of my friends mention that the game plays much better with the wheel than Forza 2 did.  I also like the new simple menus and the less-hardcore menu music.  I do miss some of the information that could be found via-menus from Forza 2 though.The graphics and sounds are both top notch.  Whether it be the sun beaming in your eyes while racing at Sedona Raceway or the detail of the town on the coast everything looks great.  Car damage modeling is still not perfect but it's better than it was in Forza 2.The new storefront is absolutely fantastic, one of the best ideas I've seen in a video game in a while.  You can create designs for cars, vinyls, and tunes and post them for sale on the storefront.  People can search for them and buy them and the credits go directly to you.Now to what matters, the racing.  If you've played Forza 2 (or any reasonably simulation-like driving game) the overall mechanic will be familiar to you.  Pick a car, upgrade as needed, race.  The cars seem to handle much better than they did in Forza 2 and thankfully having aero upgrades is no longer mandatory to make a drivable car.  I really like the new season mode, it gives a sense of flow and progression to the game.  With the AI on medium if you are a decent racer the game will not be much of a challenge.  Slip it up to hard difficulty and you'll be fighting just to win.  I wish there was a difficulty setting between the two.  The seasons seem to progress relatively quickly, I got the game a week and a half ago and I'm in the middle of season 5 sitting at driver level 46 (out of 50).  With each level earned you are given a new car for free, a nice touch as overall I feel that in-game cash is more difficult to come by this time around.One feature of Forza 3 that I totally discounted before the game was released is the rewind feature.  I thought surely it would be a \"newbie tool\" and had no place in a serious racing game...I was wrong.  Rewind is a fantastic idea.  More than just correcting mistakes in races (which is nice when you nearly total your car on lap 27 of a 32 lap endurance race) the rewind feature can help you learn tracks.  Having trouble taking the corkscrew at Laguna Seca?  Run the section and then rewind to the beginning of it and try again.  Keep trying until you get it down, your braking points, your turn in point, etc.  Instead of having to wait an entire lap to try it again you can run it 5 times in the amount of time you would normally do 1 lap.Another feature I didn't think much of is the auto-upgrade feature.  I've never been the best upgrader/tuner but having the computer do most of the work for you can be really helpful when you just want to get out and race.  It has a few shortcomings, it will not install engine, aspiration, or drivetrain swaps and it will not change your rim style, but overall it does a pretty good job.I don't play much public-lobby multiplayer but a group of guys and I get together almost every Wednesday night and race.  We've been doing it in Forza 2 for over a year and a half great fun.  While I can't comment on the public lobbies the private matches are fantastic and the lobby system works really well.  There are so many finite setting you can adjust (if you wish to).  Want to only use front wheel drive cars from America between 240 and 260 horsepower?  Easily done.  Want to set the game up so that people are released from the starting grid at 2 second intervals?  There's a setting for that as well.  Also, the cat and mouse and tag game modes are alot of fun.There are a few negatives with the game but overall I really enjoy it.  Alot of the content (both tracks and cars) is pulled straight from Forza 2.  The cockpit view (to me at least) is a bit of a novelty/letdown.  I saw the screenshots of beautifully detailed car dashboards and when I first fired up the demo I was a bit surprised to see the low-poly almost cartooney looking cockpit.  There are no shift animations in the cockpit but when using the 3rd person view you can see the driver shifting.  Also, the view angle of the cockpit is pretty bad (on most cars you can't see any of your mirrors) but there are very simple ways around this (you can adjust your viewing angle by changing some setting in the multi-screen setup even if you don't use multiscreen).While I know the game is brand new and they are still working out all the bugs, the auction house is painfully slow at the moment.  Searching for a car or looking at cars you are bidding on may take 30 seconds to load.  Once again, I know they're ironing out all the bugs but it can be frusterating if you're an auction house junkie.As for multiplayer public lobbies, there are reasons to complain.  BUT with that said Turn 10 has stated that they are planning to constantly update the multiplayer playlists.  Within the next few weeks you'll see the ability to race in cars below A class and a whole host of new features.Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase.  Is it perfect?  No, but it is alot of fun and well worth the price I paid.  Now I've gotta leave, time to get back to racing!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Cinematic shooting gallery","reviewText":"Boy, did this game turn out to be a HUGE disappointment for me. Loved the series when Remedy had the reins.... should've known that Rockstar would change things up for the worse.To begin with, as many other reviews have noted, this game is about 40-50% cutscene. A few of them are interesting and fun to watch, but even these drag on for way too long (sometimes as long as 15 minutes each). Even worse is how some of the longer ones aren't skippable (seriously?) A good number of them are meaningless and add nothing to the story. For example, upon reaching the exit to an area a cutscene will start which shows: Max slowly opening the door, peeking through, walking through the door, carefully creeping down another alleyway or hallway, stopping behind a wall while guards walk by, moving across the road and down some stairs, hiding behind another wall, waiting for a vehicle to drive by, crossing another road, and then dropping into the next area. This is the kind of stuff that the player should be doing. Why in the hell are we sitting here watching the game play itself?I found the gritty, depressing story mysterious and interesting at first, but once the game tells you what is going on (which wasn't too far into the game), I started losing interest. There's also quite a bit of brutal violence, drug use, dance parties, bikinis, and the occasional racial slur, which confirms that this is a Rockstar game, if you had any doubts.The graphics are nice, but so what, a lot of games these days have great graphics. The animations are also well done. The voice-acting is top-notch, especially Max, but his lines of dialogue feel really forced this time around. In the previous two games, Max's comments about his environment and situation were snappy and witty, which I generally didn't find to be the case in MP3. Most of the time I found myself just ignoring what he said, which I found surprising as I used to hang on his every word in MP and MP2.But of course, what really matters is how the game plays and whether or not it is any fun.Well, if you filter out the excessive cinematics, the rest of the game is basically one giant linear series of rooms and hallways filled with bad guys. There is the occasional on-rails shooting scene (what's new...), but the rest of the game is the same repetitive shooting from room to room. At least the first two games had larger areas to explore like apartment buildings that gave you the illusion of nonlinearity. There's no illusion here: Walk into a room, kill 15 guys, enter the only hallway available, kill 5 guys, enter the next room, kill 12 guys, etc/etc. Every level is the exact same experience, except for a different locale and enemies that take an increasing number of shots to kill. It got really old for me really, really fast. And these stinkin' levels seemed to go on forever, which only added to my exhaustion and loss of interest.For some reason, the developers also felt the need to add in cover-based mechanics, which is curious, as there really is no place in the Max Payne universe for cover based shooting. However, as it turns out you're gonna need this cover, because the enemies in this game are so effin' accurate you'll be instantly taking damage any time you step away from it. Even in slow motion WHILE MOVING you'll get lit up, which is irritating. Hanging out behind cover and blindfiring is often the best choice when faced with up to 10-15 guys blazing away at you, but even when you do your arms will still get easily hit and you'll fill up quickly with damage. This does not change on lower difficulties (easy/medium), which is dumb.I also found the controls to be of VERY poor quality for a third person shooter. I tend to enjoy the genre and have no trouble with most of its games. Dead space 1 & 2, uncharted 1/2/3, etc, all have very well- and carefully designed analog responsiveness and control. I don't recall ever having major issues with the controls in these games, even on their hardest difficulty levels (hardcore/crushing), but Max Payne 3 was an absolute nightmare for me. I tried every sensitivity option available and could find nothing that works. Even in Bullet Time I found myself constantly overshooting my aim back and forth trying to dial in my shot. Why some people have this problem and others seem to not baffles me, but I consider myself an experienced player of 3rd person shooter games, and I found the aiming in this game horrendous. Beware.Other game design flaws include shoot-dodging that is now completely nerfed in that it leaves you openly exposed after landing, with the player watching helplessly as Max struggles to get back up while the army of enemies fills him with lead. A newly added mechanic known as \"last man standing\" allows you to get an instant revive if you can shoot the guy who just \"killed\" you; however, it is not uncommon for an enemy standing 75-100 feet away to be the one who shoots you, which makes shooting him unnecessarily difficult. Alternatively, if an enemy shoots you from your side or from behind and puts you into this mode, you're pretty much hosed as the game only gives you a limited horizontal range to hit your target and you may never even get to reach him. More flaws include a tiny white dot reticule that makes aiming incredibly difficult, particularly against a light color background or when trying to hit an enemy from 100 yards away, a grenade launcher that farts out grenades 10 feet in front of you instead of shooting them 30-40 feet ahead, a useless AI teammate who almost never provides any help in combat, NUMEROUS insta-kill moments that require you to make a perfect shot under time pressure, and widely spaced checkpoints that have you replaying long stretches of gunbattles over and over again. I also still can't figure out why it takes 2 minutes for the game to load the title screen, similar to GTA IV.And who could forget the numerous glitches, audio bugs, and crashes? I had the game freeze on me 5 different times, each one forcing a complete reset of my PS3. I remember GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption having similar problems. For comparison, Mass Effect 3 (which I had played through right before Max Payne 3) had not a single crash, and that's a big game. I love beta testing a team's game for free instead of having them do the necessary QA work. Nothing a series of patches won't fix after the fact, right? Thanks for crapping out another a half-tested product, Rockstar.If not for the overall quality of the animations, voicework, and music, I would've given this game one star. There really are some cool set piece moments in Max Payne 3, but unfortunately I was so burned out on playing the same damn shooting gallery experience over and over and dying from boatloads of cheap, divinely accurate enemies, I didn't even care. I think I only smiled once during the entire game, which was in response to Max reflecting that \"he had killed more cops than cholesterol\". And once I saw the short, disappointing ending, I was sorry that I pushed myself to even finish the game. I should've quit on Chapter 3 like I had wanted to. I can't even honestly say I had any fun at all.I know I'll never buy another Rockstar game, but now I think I may never even rent another Rockstar game.So long, Max. Your good days will live on in my memories.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2012"}

You'll get 2 regular sized figures and one giant figure plus, the portal, trading cards, a poster, sticker sheets and the GAME. I think thats a great bundle of Skylanders stuff for this kit and the price.  If your kids have any of the other Skylanders toys they all work with this kit so its completely universal. The kids said that their old portal works with all the figures but you have to use the new game disc not the older one or it won't work.The game plays pretty much the same as the original version so I won't get into detail on that, there are plenty of other reviewers who've done a great job at that. The giants are basically the 2.0 of this game so the whole craze starts all over again and the kids want all the new figures because they all have different powers and are stronger too. Thankfully Christmas is right around the corner (at time of this review) so they will be playing this game for quite a while. They love switching the figures out and know exactly which ones to use for which parts of the game.As for the new figures, they have more detail and the kids really enjoy playing with them without playing the video game so its a win win for us because they can take the figures with them in long car rides to play action figures.When ordering just make sure you are picking the correct version of the game depending on your game system ex Wii, xbox, PS3","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"An okay finale for an outstanding series (campaign review)","reviewText":"I'm a huge fan of developer Insomniac, and Ratchet and Clank is my favorite series of all time. Therefore, it pains me somewhat to criticize the final entry of the Resistance franchise, but I must be honest with how I felt about this game. You should probably play it if you've come this far in the series, but it's a step backward for Resistance.Somehow, the graphics in this series keep getting worse, which is confusing. Resistance 1 looked the best (and it was a launch game!), Resistance 2 took a step backward as it became grayer and muddier, and #3 is the ugly duckling of the bunch, continuing the downward spiral into the \"bleak\" style of graphics that have been so popular for this console generation. There was one segment where I could just barely, barely see where I was going for a PROLONGED period of time, as I blindly stumbled about in the dark. It wasn't scary or suspenseful- it was just frustrating.The other HUGE letdown for this game was that Insomniac threw the one feature that really set Resistance apart right out the window (with the exception of Halo): They make you shoot human beings. I understand they were trying to create the desperation of a post-apocalyptic world, but one of the best things about the world of Resistance is that it's an FPS series where you get to shoot nothing but aliens and monsters (up until this point). It's fun to cut loose in an FPS without getting hung up on the moral quandaries of battling those of your own species, simply because you happen to live in different countries with opposing agendas.Finally, the ending feels rushed, and quite frankly, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. For a series that started out with such a fascinating and gripping narrative, it's disappointing to experience such a lackluster finale. I had hoped for so much more.Resistance 3 certainly has its moments... the standout, for me, was your experience in a Pennsylvania mining community, where the religious locals have become convinced that Satan inhabits their mine (it's really a giant Chimeran alien, as you can imagine). You should certainly play it if you've come this far in the battle against the Chimera, but if you're new to the series, stick with #1.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2012"}

It was my first Elder Scrolls game, and although I had heard that the series was very time-intensive, I was quickly overwhelmed at the sheer number of possibilities.  As a completionist, I quickly got nowhere and gave up on the game after only around a dozen hours of gameplay.  For those who are in the same boat and are considering Skyrim, I would recommend giving the series another chance.  I've approached the game differently this time around, trying my best to negate the effects of my ADD.  With a more focused approach I've been able get into and appreciate this game.  The sheer scale of everything is, once again, daunting.  However, with objectives fairly clearly laid out, I've had a much easier time navigating the landscape.  There are numerous memorable experiences.  Namely dragon attacks, which are awesome when you're in a group, then terrifying when you're alone.  Everything is customizable.  Everything is explorable.  That mountain you've walked by 20 times?  There's a cave entrance above you on some path that you never saw.  The dungeon crawling is varied enough so that I haven't gotten bored yet.  I've stumbled into enormous compounds on side-quests (picking up necessary story-related items unintentionally...  BTW, if it looks important, it is!!!), and happily discovered shorter jaunts on what I expected to be grueling, multi-hour long quests.  The game so far has provided many surprises, all of them good.  It isn't quite as polished as, say, Red Dead Redemption (which I am constantly reminded of for some reason), but the scale and scope of the game make some buginess acceptable.  If you're into RPGs even somewhat, I would recommend giving this incredible game a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

But since there are so many people giving it a 1 star rating when they haven't even played the game, I'm giving it a 5 in order to make the overall rating look as good as it should. This is certainly not a game you're going to put away anytime soon. But it isn't perfect, and I have to point that out. Rest assured however, this is no 1-3 star game.I'd like to address some of the comparisons to other games that I'm seeing here. Firstly MAG: The similarities between the look (and sometimes the feel) of these two games is striking. Imagine MAG was third person, slightly better looking, with smaller matches and tighter controls and you'll begin to see what I mean. Prior to playing Socom 4 I dusted off the PS2 and replayed all of the campaigns for Socom 1, 2 & 3 (didn't get to Combined Assault). By comparison, Socom 4 looks light years ahead of the first 3. It isn't as pretty as, say, God Of War III. But it's still a gorgeous game. What the older games did that I wish the newest one does is offer a wider range of control over the camera and your team. Having three camera options here would have stopped a lot of the negative chatter that's going on. The camera is still exactly as far away from the back of your character's head as it ever was. But the option to jump into first person view is not going to meet well with lots of gamers out there. The tactical map (which used to appear on screen, showing enemy locations, etc.) can now only be accessed by pausing the game. Another noticeable change is that health regenerates over time. We also no longer have certain options, such as ordering a cease fire, and that's going to be missed by many players who love to take out the enemies on their own until the difficulty becomes so great that they need to tell the team to help. It takes a little away from the tactical bent of the game. They still don't do much killing until you tell them to or unless they're in danger of dying though. So this is nothing too major.Uncharted is another comparison I'm reading about. And the cinematics of the story mode are certainly similar, as is the fluidity of the levels. But that's where the similarities end. Uncharted games are not professional shooters. There's not even a reticle present in those games until you aim down the sights. And the cover system in Socom 4 works much, much better than in the Uncharted games. Much of what you do in this game also requires very specific attention to how you choose to go about killing enemies. In the tactical department, Socom 4 is much more similar to Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 or Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway than it will ever be to the Uncharted series. Uncharted is more like 50 Cent: Blood In The Sand in that it's a pretty mindless shooter with extremely linear stage design (both of those are cool games, I should add however).The comparison does bring up another one of the things I think Socom 4 does wrong; and that's the fact that it's heavily and cinematically story oriented. The days of getting a mission briefing and a team loadout, letting you pretend you're actually the team commander, are gone. Instead Zipper has decided to implement a story into the campaign, as well as an assortment of characters. While this is interesting at times, as with other games that focus on stories and characters, if you don't like the characters or the story then the game won't be nearly as absorbing as the old Socom games.The reliance on a story is about the only commonality this game shares with the final comparison you'll read about; Call Of Duty games. In Call Of Duty you get a first person perspective in always frenzied war-time, during which you don't have to worry about anyone else on your side of the war and decisions regarding tactics are not even ones you get to make; not to mention that guns and kills in those games tend to be unrealistic and unbalanced. With Socom you're getting a third person perspective that requires you to pay attention to your teammates and actually forces you to realize that you will almost never get to rely only on yourself during war time. The game forces you to take your time and be cautious when making moves and it feels more realistic and engaging because of that than any game with a better look ever could. I have enjoyed some aspects of the Call Of Duty series. But there's not much to compare between the two camps. There just isn't. Something I will say that I like more about the Call Of Duty games is the knifing mechanic. Knifing certainly works better now than it did in the beta, but it's not nearly as satisfying as those unrealistic knife kills you'll get with Call Of Duty.The campaign initially looked like it was going to be shortlived; by which I mean very shortlived. But the days begin passing slower as you progress and the game gives you more and more free reign over the areas in which you find yourself. I'm pretty sure that I'm drawing close to beating the campaign mode, but what has really taken most of my time where this game goes is the online portion. And it is every bit as addictive as they come. When it comes to the multi-player, there's not a very high learning curve to the game types. And maps are something you'll get down rather quickly, since this is one of those games which require you to take your time and pay attention to your surroundings. The ability to play Classic Mode is a welcome addition. And the respawn is as good as anything else out there. I'm still not crazy about the way the engine recognizes friend from foe (with the colored name tags appearing above the enemies head), but it's a very minor complaint. Since most of the characters look pretty similar in multi-player, it's a little too easy to end up killing a teammate at close range, because you aren't sure if they're on your side or not (as they're too close for the tag above their head to be showing). The cover system works better than expected, although I was hoping for the kind you'll find in Vegas 2 (where you hold a button to cover and stop covering when you release it). Again though, a minor complaint. What really surprised me here was the addition of co-op mode. Much like in Read Dead Redemption, you play through actual missions online with friends. And it's a huge incentive if you're looking to buy this game.Many Socom fans will be upset by the weapon system in this game. After all, you don't have all weapons and attachments available to you in the beginning. You work for upgrades and this draws away from the realism older Socom games delivered. But the new system does reward players for using specific weapons more and therefore encourages players to try out different guns. So I can't complain much about it. I actually really like the new system. What bothered me about weapons was how the screen won't tell you what weapon you're picking up off a dead enemy while you're playing. You have to look at it and be able to recognize it in order to know what you're getting. This is a bit too realistic for my taste.A very welcome change here is the inception of the solo stealth missions. Think of the sneaking tactics required in most Metal Gear Solid games and you'll have a good idea of what these missions are going to be like. You have to hide bodies, time silent takedowns, etc. But this element of the game could use a little improvement. It's still really fun, but it's often difficult to realize when an enemy will or won't spot you, once you're caught there's almost no chance of shaking the alert, and the game feels a little too linear during these missions. It would have been much more fun (for some, I should say) if the game just dropped you in an area and let you figure out your own course for infiltrating. Instead it all but forces you to follow a set path. Perhaps the creators simply wanted us to know how frustrating it must be to follow all orders, such as the fire-teams always have to do. These missions provide a high degree of both excitement and tension, but they also feel slightly amateurish at times.Getting back to squad commanding; you'll probably notice and miss the fact that you can't really order a squad beyond your range of vision. In older games you could order them just about anywhere on the map. But that doesn't exist here. Still, what Zipper sought to do with commanding was to simplify it and make it intuitive. And they've done that beautifully. Ordering kills and singling out multiple targets has never been this much fun and easy for me in any game, ever.The enemy AI in this game (not counting the stealth missions) is phenomenal. They'll often spot you before you spot them, they rush intelligently, and they'll also fall back to regroup once your team has their numbers dwindling. It's surprisingly easy to be killed in this game and that really will make you play the game in a smarter, more patient fashion.I also really liked that, once you kill someone, they don't just disappear. These dead bodies actually twitch, move as you run over them, and will shift realistically if shot once they're on the ground. A lot has been made of the non-responsive foliage, but I couldn't care less. As long as the enemy acts as you'd expect (even after death), then I am sold. What I do miss, however, is the accessibility of almost all areas and buildings. This game is fraught with doors that can't be opened. It's a minor gripe, but those sorts of things always dumb a game down in my opinion.I, unlike a great many others, got addicted to Socom: Confrontation. And I only bring it up here because of another thing Socom 4 makes me appreciate; which is that Socom 4 is not a carbon copy of any of the other Socom games. Too often when a new game in a series is released, the online community for the older game goes to pieces. That isn't going to happen with Socom 4 and Socom: Confrontation. Both games are very different monsters. Clearly Socom 4 offers much more where content is concerned, and that is why I would recommend it to most people. Unless you hate third person games or can't stand games which require you to do more than mow down enemies mindlessly, then you will probably enjoy this game as much as I do. Just don't go into it thinking that it is an extension of the PS2 Socom games and the experience is much more enjoyable. Here's hoping that someday Sony gives us all 4 of those PS2 games in one HD bundle for the PS3! In the meantime, pick this game up and support what Zipper is doing; which is giving gamers tactical shooters in a time when the gaming world is starved for them.If my review wasn't long enough for you (haha), be sure and check out the YouTube review of this game by Gamespot. It seemed pretty fair, in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"WhitWire Reviews \"Ryan\"","summary":"I Thought Sonic Adventure Would Never Be Rivalled; I was Wrong","reviewText":"Yes, I was well aware of all the praise this game received. Yes, I knew of its features. Yes, I knew of its new characters--but I never thought any thing would even come close to the greatness that was the original Sonic Adventure. Its smooth controls, enticing storyline, and sense of speed drew me in with ease. But that was before I played Sonic Adventure 2.Earlier this year in May, I finally received Sonic Adventure 2 Battle in the mail. I knew I was in for a treat, but a part of me silently shouted at me, \"This CAN'T be as good as the first Sonic Adventure.\"Within a minute I was greeted by the opening cutscene. Seeing Sonic jump out of that helicopter made me see him as an insane maniac. Moments went by and the game started me off at City Escape. But enough about my experience; what about the features. I should proably talk about the story.The story is set up into two halves: Hero and Dark. For the Hero story we get to play as Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails. For reasons unknown (until later), Sonic is being chased by the military--and he has to escape. Meanwhile Knuckles is busy guarding the master emerald when Dr. Eggman and a new character named Rouge the Bat want to take it from him. Before they can get away, however, Knuckles shatters the master emerald and scatters its pieces across the game. Finally there's Tails: who simply wants to find out why Sonic's being chased and what Eggman's up to.Next is the dark story--with Shadow, Rouge, and Dr. Eggman as the main characters. Shadow is a hedgehog with a dark, mysterious past--and will do anything to stop the images of his past from tormenting his mind. Then there's Rouge: a jewel-hunting bat who works for the government, yet also seeks to work for Dr. Eggman. Finally there's Eggman, who has devised a new plan to take over the world. His plan is to take control of a space colony known as ARK and threaten the people of Earth with death by the Ark's laser if they fail to meet his demands.While there is a \"Final\" story, it's very spoiler-heavy--so I won't even bother with it. But let's move on to the gameplay.Sonic and Shadow both play through speed levels. The homing attack, spin-dash, and platforming sections are all present in these levels. What I find different about Sonic Adventure's Sonic stages, however, is how Sonic and Shadow control much differently.Simply tapping the spin-dash button will not send either hedgehog spin-dashing; instead it will make them do a somersault unless the button is held down long enough. In addition to a differently-handled spin-dash, we also get different upgrades--one of which is the light dash, which lets you zip through a trail of rings at light speed.In the end all you're doing in these speed stages is simply making it out of the level and heading to the goal ring.Next are the stages with Knuckles and Rouge--which hold a lot of similarities compared to Knuckles' stages in Sonic Adventure. Basically you're just searching for treasure with your handy radar. Along the way you can glide by pressing the jump button twice and attack enemies with the B button.Finally there's Tails' and Eggman's stages. These two characters do no more than go around shooting enemies with their robotic mechs. By chaining together groups of enemies can you receive a large amount of points. But--like the speed stages--your top priority is to simply get to the end.Plenty of gimmicks are spread throughout Sonic Adventure 2 Battle--the likes of which include the Chao Garden and even Kart Racing. Try them out when you get the chance.With tons of variety in gameplay and story, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is definitely something you should add to your wishlist. But is it better than Sonic Adventure 1? You bet it is!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

I am sick and tired of the Gran Turismo's and Forza's where you need to plan every nuance of how to build your car, and then start racing and realize its going to take you days to simply figure out how to drive straight. This game does none of that. It does have the cool feature of letting you build your own ATV, but its not overly complex, and once you get into the racing aspect this game is FUN.

Blow off the arms...and they're done, son.","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Several \"jump out of your skin\" scares throughout the game+ Upgradable weapons, armor, etc.+ Unique method to dispatch Necromorphs+ Greatest Hits pricing makes this game a bargain- CONS:- Only takes 3-4 days to complete (on easier modes)- Scare factor is diminished with repeated play-throughs- Some missions feel like repetitive fetch-quests- Slight glitch with object pick-upsPLOT:The year is 2508. The Planetcracker ship USG Ishimura sent out a distress call; and the crew of the USG Kellion was dispatched to get them up and running again. Unfortunately, the landing didn't go too well. Upon entering the station, all was quiet...or so we thought.My shipmates and I were savagely attacked by some kind of monsters. I can't explain what they looked like...not without sounding completely insane.We're alone out here. No help is coming. We'll have to fight smart if we want to stay alive.GAMEPLAY:We take control of Isaac, an engineer who starts out with a basic suit of armor and no gun. As the game progresses, various weapons and schematics can be found all over the ship.Each level has ship repair objectives to complete and two of the levels have mini-games, but the main gameplay focus is combat with the alien infestations known as Necromorphs.Isaac learns quickly that shots to the body only stun, and even decapitations are ineffective. Using the sage advice of \"cut off their limbs\", he strategically dismembers each enemy until there's nothing left.Ash Williams would be so proud.The game is presented in a over-the-shoulder-shooter format almost identical to Resident Evil 4.Killing Necromorphs earns credits, health items, ammunition, or power nodes. Players can buy and sell items at an in-game store; and there are upgrade benches to maximize effectiveness for weapons and armor. Mercifully, the game spoon-feeds us objective locations by using the R3 button so we're not back-tracking for hours to find door keys and such.A power-up called STASIS can be used to freeze Necromorphs while Isaac uses them for target practice/dissection, and another power-up called KINESIS can bring objects to Isaac or hurtle them away with lethal velocity.Some rooms have zero-gravity where Isaac can jump from floor to wall to ceiling and stay attached with magnetic boots, and there are a few boss battles thrown in to keep the game even more intense.BUT IS IT SCARY?The creators of Dead Space did a PHENOMENAL job creating feelings of uncertainty and fear and panic - the phrase \"survival horror\" is very appropriate. The hallways are dark and cramped, the echo of the floor plates in an empty room gives the player a feeling of dread, and some rooms can only be lit up by the gun Isaac is carrying.This game lulls you into a false sense of security...If you see a Necromorph disappear into the ventilation system, you might think you're safe...but then the music sharply changes and the Necromorph flies out of the vent cover right behind you or above your head, and that delicious moment of gameplayer panic makes you either shoot blindly or you get cleaved in half at the torso.Isaac's spacesuit has a very claustrophobic design to it: the helmet suggests that he has a limited range of vision, we hear panicked gasps and wheezes when he starts getting low on oxygen, and whoever decided to make the \"spinal cord health bar\" deserves much praise...everything about his outfit is designed to invoke a fear response when he gets attacked.When you play through this game on the easier settings, you might think you've got it made. However, when you try playing on hard/impossible mode, that's where you have to carefully plan out each attack so you don't run out of ammunition.TROPHIES:There are 49 trophies to earn here. Most of them are fairly easy, such as 12 trophies earned for completing each chapter. There are 8 hidden trophies that may require players to make attempts while playing on an easy difficulty setting.Without a doubt, the hardest trophy to earn is to complete the game on the \"impossible\" difficulty setting. Conservation of ammunition and avoiding damage is paramount, and you'll find yourself doing things like moving dead bodies out of a room so infectious Necromorphs can't create more enemies for you to fight.CONS:The first time through Dead Space will take a while because you're going to jump at everything you see (or don't see). If you play again to earn more trophies, you'll start to memorize the gameplay and you can fly through the levels in about a day or so. Things get a bit easier and less scary, until you try the more difficult play modes.The fetch-questing and revisits to previous levels does get a bit repetitive...each chapter starts with something broken that Isaac has to fix, so we fix it. A junction box turns off, we turn it on. A room loses gravity, we have to restore it...and so forth.To stave off the repetition, the developers borrowed a tactic from Resident Evil 4 and put 2 mini games into Dead Space: One is a Shooting Gallery, the other is Zero-G Basketball. Both are fun to play, though a 2-player option would have been excellent for the basketball game.The only other item I noticed was an occasional error trying to pick up objects. I had to restore my game to the last save point when I couldn't pick up the Captain's RIG, even though it was clearly at my feet. Another time I couldn't take credits out of a hallway box, there was nothing blocking me but it wouldn't register as a clickable item.This only happened to me twice in 3 playthroughs, so just save whenever you have the chance.FINAL VERDICT?Being a horror movie fanatic, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Killing Necromorphs was fun, upgrading my weapons and armor was fun, but being scared of the unknown was the MOST fun. I found myself strategizing more and more when I played on the harder difficulty settings.Dead Space feels like the perfect offspring of The Evil Dead, Event Horizon, and Resident Evil 4. If you're a fan of those movies/games, you will definitely enjoy this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2011"}

I was excited to buy this for my wife and son, but when I bought it from Gamestop and brought it home I was really let down. When I open the box and saw it for the first time I liked it with the gloss and matte look but thats all it was LOOKS. I quickly set everything up and had to sit through a day on update which is ridiculous for them not to include out of the box and the worst part is the update is required to do even the most basic thing like play video games. The man I bought this from at gamestop also told me that a subscription fee of 59.99 was required to play games online and use basic services like Netflix and other video streaming apps. Now I was livid, but the best parts comes after the update. I inserted a game disk into the game console and it told be that that disk is unreadable even though it is clearly an Xbox One video game called Dead Rising 3. I tried another disk from Zoo tycoon and the same thing happen. I was frustrated at this point and contacted the Microsoft and they told me that they had no idea what could be causing it and that they will replace or fix my console for a fee if I don't have a warranty. I have never been so angry at a company before for such a shamble of services. I just returned the console to the store I bought it from and receive a partial refund and thank the stars I didn't buy into the whole subscription bs. I had bought the console expecting full gaming and video service but instead I got a proxy for a money making scheme. The camera was a great device but for a 100 extra towards the cost it was not worth it. My son was really sad his birthday present this year was a total disaster so I went and bought him a seemingly partial competitor gaming console that isn't as high end but supposedly on par with the Xbox One. Which a Sony Playstation 4 gaming console which was much cheaper and had less restrictions although it did require a subcription it was only 49.99 which also gave out two free games and didn't restrict video streaming apps like Netflix, and a Nintendo 3DS.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

Hands down the launch titles appeal to me more. Zoo Tycoon, DR3, and Son of Rome look awesome, and are all my cup of tea.The new Kinect, it's just amazing.Seems to have better ventilation (opinion).I do like the PS4's new controller better, but I think the Xbox 1's controller is great too. Though mine came with a rattle, like a tiny piece of plastic is dislodged, but it hasn't effected performance. I also don't like the Xbox One controller seems to go to sleep... And it isn't recharble unless you use a seperately purchased charge and play kit, which, of course I did buy... It just hasn't come yet.I think the Xbox One's interface is a little smoother. PS4 is nice, but I had a lot of problems connecting to the PSN network on launch day and night. The Xbox One connected without issues and allowed me to download all of my software and apps flawlessly. It was a much, much smoother launch experience.I'm very happy with this purchase and I think the Xbox One actually looks nice too, perhaps not as sleek or fashionable as PS4, but it definately has a beauty all its own.Overall, I love the XBox One, love the launch titles, and I'm a very happy customer.

K \"Esco\"","summary":"There's Two Ways to get Into the RPG Genre","reviewText":"Two ways that are comparable in principle to this game and FF7. Both are easy games to complete and feature nice lengthy quests (well, this is decent for its time -- 15-25 hours), but it's the maturity level that makes them different.Being a college film student who isn't one trying to get into film to make more \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" type movies, I'm one for the cinematic and dramatic flairs. FF7 is a great game to introduce people into the world of RPG's with, but like the ESRB knew, it isn't a game to play when young. It's heartbreaking, and full of killing; both good and bad. This game here is more of the innocent story with very simplistic locations, interface, story and dialogue.However, if you're a seasoned RPG veteran who's used to FFX and such, don't expect much from this game. It'll just be a shallow set of battles and treasure chests where you'll gain little more than just saying that you beat another RPG in the world. The graphics were no better than FF4 in most respects, the battle system and interfaces as simplistic as one can comprehend (apart from the jumping, which helps you with some really complex mazes), and there is vurtiously no character development.However, keeping with the Final Fantasy tradition (until FFIX, or maybe VIII), the music is phenomenal in almost every way, which is something that to me alone adds tons of replay. Play 15 hours of monster-killing with a cool soundtrack every year or two; sounds cool, huh? Also, if you're interested in every buying RPG Maker or one of those professional RPG makers, this is a good style of game to make as a first entry.This game has charm as it's more simplistic than even the most imaginative person can imagine. Weak entry to the series? You'd better believe it!! However, my rating more reflects when this was one of the only games I had to play, and with it being so, I came to appreciate it. -- Besides, it has a plot at all, unlike some of Square's slightly more recent titles like Legend of Mana and Chrono Cross; just don't expect anything remotely that of Kingdom Hearts, Front Mission 3 or the more professionally made Final Fantasy's.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2002"}

Its in the news, its on tv, its talked about at work, school, college etc. Families play the game together and the game has even contributed towards breaking of relationsips, falling of grades, people losing jobs etc but inspite of all these facts World of warcraft is still the best MMO out there. Lots of MMO's have come and gone trying to compete or take over the throne from this game but none have suceeded thus far. I have personally over the years have switched back and forth between wow and others mmo's to only come back to wow. This game has some strange and almost majical allure to it.This all being said I throughly enjoy the game. It's very solo friendly. Has top-notch graphics and the biggest aspect is the huge world which truly does justice to the words 'epic' and 'massive' when its comes to mmo's. The game has both a good and a darker faction to play. The classes are numerous and well thought off too. You have everything from pure specialized classes to hybrids. Choose your faction, pick a class and off you go. The game caters to different playstyle too...for pve oriented people you have pve servers and for hardcore pvp oriented people you have pvp servers(full of gankage and griefing if thats what you like). However, the great thing about the game is that even being on pve servers you have various option to pvp and test your mettle against real players. A person can flag themselves for world pvp or participate in instanced battlegrounds(my favourite)to pvp at your time and choosing. The game also has the feel that there is a constant war going on among an epic struggle between different factions for resources and philosphies. Cities gets attacked, players gets attacked and there are constant raging battles going in battlgrounds.But aside from all this the game offers some of the most fun questing that i have ever come across in mmo's. If you want to just quest and better your character via leveling it up than the game will grip you too and no wonder people are known to loose a part of their life to this game. But my advice....'Moderation' and you will be all happy both in real and your virtual life.In conclusion....I will advice this game to anyone who is intrested in playing a great mmo that is not a bore also. A testament to this is my 2 years with this game among all the other posters who gave this game high marks too. Check it out yourself but 'BEWARE'..they are lots of 'clones' out there but none have even half the majic or charm or fun which is the hallmark of a game called World of Warcraft.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2007"}

I use a Cradlepoint 500 with a wireless broadband card to play my games and the biggest annoyance was it's lack of ethernet ports since it only has one.  I had to keep switching between my XBOX 360 and my computer which wears away at the plastic clips on the wire and eventually it breaks not to mention how annoying it was to keep switching them out.  I was really afraid it would not recognize the adapter but it did the very first time I hooked the adapter up to my 360.  I set it up in probably less than five minutes.  I set it up on my 360 in a heartbeat and everything was recognized perfectly.  The one thing I forgot for mine was I had to log into my routers page and allow the 360 on my router which is why it would not connect to the router at first.  So far it works just as good as wired and I would know since I have been using a wired connection on my XBOX for the last year or so since I got on XBOX live.  I have read people nagging on wireless connections but so far no lag no nothing just doing what it said it would.  I can't comment on upstairs and downstairs by the way since I am in a one story house so your satisfaction may vary.  As far as price it is kind of steep but if you play quite a bit then its value will shine a little easier.  Personally I love it and enjoy having all my consoles wireless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2009"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Dull Auto","reviewText":"Between the release of Dead or Alive 4 and Full Auto, 49 days passed without a single on-shelf Xbox 360 release. I added \"on-shelf\" to that sentence because several Xbox Live Arcade games were available, but those games couldn't appease the attention spans of deprived Xbox 360 owners looking for something new to play. February 2006 came, and the first of two Xbox 360 releases was finally available: SEGA's Full Auto, a racing game with a taste of chaos that combines elements from Twisted Metal, Spy Hunter, and Burnout. But is Full Auto really the fix that 360 gamers desperately needed?Mixing Twisted Metal, Spy Hunter, and Burnout-three successful franchises-would seem to be the perfect formula for a fast-paced racing/shooter. At least I thought so. But SEGA simply missed on a few important elements, and because of that, Full Auto probably isn't the fix you're looking for. The first problem isn't something I should sugarcoat. Thirty minutes into Full Auto's main mode, Career Mode, I was actually bored. I was bored of blowing everything up, bored of plowing through glass windows and stone pillars, bored of seeing spark-filled, fiery explosions. I was bored of something that would normally spark my action[...]attention span. Full Auto's selling point is that you can blow up almost everything in the environment-buildings, storefronts, water towers, pedestrian cars, flora and fauna. If you can see it, chances are you can see it explode and shatter beautifully into particles.While Full Auto is a racing game, the gameplay revolves around three different factors that \"assist\" the actual racing. First and foremost are your tools of destruction, which range from missiles to machine guns and bouncy grenades. These goodies can be used to blow things up and fend off opponents, of course. Second is the \"Unwreck Meter\" that fills up as you destroy the environment. The \"Unwreck\" ability is similar to The Prince's ability to rewind time in Prince of Persia. Basically it allows you to undo your mistakes by rewinding the events that just unfolded and seamlessly putting you back into the game. Last of all is the no-frills Boost Meter. This system is similar to Burnout's boost meter; it fills as you power slide, ramp, and perform acrobatic flips with your vehicle. When it is full, you can pull off a fast boost that blurs the screen.The Career Mode is the main mode of play and it features dozens of events. Some of these events are straightforward racing events, while others force you earn destruction points by obliterating as much of the environment as possible. Other modes include Head-to-Head, which allows you to play split-screen with another player; and Arcade, which is a no-frills mode that lets you play with unlocked vehicles and tracks.I must commend SEGA for their visual work. Full Auto is very impressive in terms of explosions, particles, and destructible environments. Since (literally) everything can be destroyed, there are usually tons of little fiery pieces flying around the screen. It's too bad the sense of speed doesn't hold a stick to Electronic Arts' Burnout. I'd go as far as to say that the game feels slow in comparison to Burnout and even Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The music in Full Auto is generic techno and rock music, and the most frustrating part of Full Auto aurally is the bug that shuts off your Xbox 360 Custom Soundtrack between loading screens. If you're tired of listening to the cheesy in-game music, press mute, because you can't enjoy your own music.While Full Auto isn't a bad game, it isn't really the best choice for a $60 purchase. I'd say that it makes a great rental, as most of the game's enjoyment can be found in the first few hours of play. If you're a fan of Burnout or other destruction-based games, I suggest that route, check Full Auto out for yourself and decide, because it's a decent game that doesn't require much effort to enjoy, though the enjoyment is short-lived.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2006"}

The graphics are great, the story is great, but the gameplay is not quite as great.  The entire game play concept is an action game, you have a lightsaber, and a bunch of force powers.  You start with hardly any, then move on to more and more, which invidual force powers having different levels of strength.  The action is great, and you can break anything and kill anyone as you pass through a level.  The problem is that that's pretty much all you can do.  The best analogy is to the grand theft auto games, when you first get it and go crazy killing a stealing.  Its great at first, but eventually you'll need something else to keep playing.  In Grand Theft Auto there's tons of other things to do.  Here, not so much.  But if you play a few levels every once in a while it is a lot of fun.  I just wish there was more to do, as throwing an enemy off a ledge is fun for only so long, and then is just another thing to do.  Really this game is a more force heavy version of the jedi knight games, with far less interest in the lightsaber. I imagine when the inevitable sequel hits, there will be a slew of improvement to every aspect and be the great game this almost was.So, if you're looking for some fun involving feeling like an all powerful jedi this should float your boat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2009"}

Why?  Cause I always ended up copying the stupid complicated password down wrong and could not continue.

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"P. Hardy","summary":"Bioshock Infinite wants you to accept a city floating in the sky as your savior. Will you accept?\" (MAJOR SPOILERS)","reviewText":"\"Bioshock\" is not a series I'm at all familiar with nor have any affinity towards. I've heard it touted as one of the greatest First Person Shooters of this console generation (maybe it is, I've no real footing to criticize), and a game with one of the best twists in a story EVER (think \"The Cake is a Lie\"). That said, going into \"Bioshock Infinite\", there was no need for any sort of familiarity with Bioshock's universe, let alone what happened in the previous two games or tie-ins unless you're the audience which Easter eggs, strewn about to find, are dedicated to. WARNING: this review is full of spoilers and is pretty long on examining the narrative element (which is the last segment). Got a problem, but aren't willing to be constructive? Find another review.STORY:\"Infinite\" weaves a perplexing tale of a former Pinkerton agent named Booker DeWitt and his mission to rescue a young woman (Elizabeth) from a floating city purporting to be a Eden above Earth (\"Or as close to one before Judgment Day\"). His reasons, of course, are not of the noble type; he's looking to settle some debts with some folk and if the girl is his only way of settling all those I-O-U's in one fell swoop, then of course he's going to take the chance on a blind shot.Spirited away to a floating city among the clouds, the \"promised land\" segregated from the \"Mysterious Sodom below\", Booker's expectations for an easy bag-n-grab are dashed when he chooses to go against some \"helpful\" advice by his benefactors and stirs up hornet's nest of trouble.GAMEPLAY:A great deal of the time \"Bioshock: Infinite\" feels and looks like a glorified shooting gallery. Environments are blatantly set up for enemy encounters and depending how deft you are at evade, charge and cover, dying multiple times during these encounters with the enemies (especially on harder difficulties) will be a royal pain. Honestly, the combat in the game, while almost smooth as a whistle, doesn't break out of its mundane FPS mode until you're allowed to combat enemies on the skylines; even when enemies like the Handyman can use them against you, skylines keep the combat from at least becoming a shoot-from-behind Chest-High-Walls exercise of repetition. Lord knows running out into the open doesn't work unless you plan on maiming the enemies when in few numbers.The weakest levels of the game are undoubtedly the Vox Weapons Quest and the Ghost of Mrs. Comstock encounters; one never seems to end and concludes on a sour note; you appear stuck in Fink's warehouse for an eternity fighting and trying to rescue a Chinese man and his weapons by stepping through one dimension after another. The other is exercise in tolerance as you'll be spammed with undead enemies who'll divide your strategy between them and the ghost you ultimately need to obliterate until a cinematic stops you in the name of parent and child reconciliation. On top of that it just feels so completely useless in the grand scheme of the game's story.Another least favorite level is arguably the one nearest to the end; separated from Elizabeth, the game puts you through the ringer with an almost random enemy known as \"The Boy(s) of Silence\"; their background is never is delved into, but the fact of matter is that you can't escape them. Their bell shaped heads spot you no matter what and they hound you with pasty-faced ghost children that can kill you quicker than anticipated. The entire level has obviously been created to show the player just how much they've come to depend on Elizabeth as a partner and lifesaver.In regards to AI, Elizabeth is by no means the \"Revolutionary AI\" the press touted her as, but she is undoubtedly a product of developers who cared enough to grace their NPC with something more than just invincibility. Elizabeth's character animation is a joy to watch; I do enjoy watching her interact with things via scripted event or just standing around, triggering idle animations; however janky they might come off at times. There were several hilarious moments in combat where she announces she has something and when I pressed the button to interact with her, she appears up from below me (Booker) and hands him whatever he needs. Like, what were you doing right under me, Elizabeth? Regardless, she is the crucial life saver of the game; she aids Booker in battle by throwing weapons/ammo, salts and vigors to the player if they're in need with recover. She can't be killed, and she knows how to stay out of the way at times.General NPCs cannot be interacted with, thus they provide little to the environment or character interaction. They just stare at you with those odd cartoony-but-realistic faces (at their most exaggerated in Elizabeth, who reminds me of a creepy female character from a Tim Burton film) until you decide to move on. They don't even interact with each other convincingly either, which is a stark contrast to how they were animated in the 2010 and 2011 demos. Their lack of presence basically renders the environment of Columbia artificial in every way possible as a result of Levine's fear of having robotic responses that point you to an objective or scripted event. You never get the sense that people live there, they're like props that appear at any given moment to liter the environment.Enemy AI is a hit or miss; they're either overly zealous in their attempts to kill you or you can walk right up on them and get no reaction until they feel like acknowledging there's an enemy sniffing at their heads. I mean, its hilarious how bloody close you can get to some of them and fire off several rounds; some will even casually reload weapons while you shoot at them.Strategy can be applied to the game's combat with the use of vigors and gears. Vigors are mystical powers of some sort that are never really explored in the game, further illuminating their gameplay-only-necessity. Abilities like \"Bucking Bronco\" and \"Devil's Kiss\" can be used to set aflame enemies or send them flying through the air (or just levitating them into the air). Feeling overwhelmed by enemy turrets? Just use \"Possession\" to take control of their weapons and use them against them. Passive abilities known as \"Gears\" are the game's version of RPG upgrades; you gain bonus points, boosts for abilities you already obtain and so forth. I barely used them.Overall, the gameplay is pretty enjoyable; however, there will be times wherein you will find yourself falling into the tedium of a grind as a result of almost heedless enemy encounters the further into the game you get; which is a shame, because it distracts from the narrative of the game and if there's anything I don't like, it's when a story is interrupted for a shootout.My biggest disappointment, gameplay wise, is that a great deal of the neat moments --- far more interesting than most scenarios in the actual game --- from the demos is never included in the game or merely rewritten for purposes to serve the gameplay in a way the developers were comfortable with. I wanted to see Elizabeth dancing around with a Lincoln head in my game, man.PRESENTATION:\"Infinite\" benefits from strong production values, fantastic audio and a strong cast of voice actors. Performance wise, it takes a while to get use to Troy Baker as Booker DeWitt; the problem being you spend most of your time thinking \"that's Troy Baker trying to speak with a Southern-ish/old-timey twang\". Yet despite the constant recognition that sometimes detracts from the character, he gives a fantastic performance nonetheless. Jennifer Hale and the likes of Yuri Lowenthal provide their talents to some rather quirky and deplorable characters. Keith Szarabajka seems to be running the gambit of fantastic character voices lately since \"Halo 4\"; it takes a moment, but once you catch the ping that is his tone, it's hard to shake. Kimberly Brooks gives one of the more surprising performances as Daisy Fitzroy and Courtnee Draper does a stand up job as the budding Elizabeth. Basically, there is little to complain about, performance wise.The environment of Columbia is something else to behold and works well within the analogy of a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\". Everything about the place makes you wish you lived there; from the sunny vistas, the cloud shrouded environments, the skylines, the vigors.It's an amusement park; one that holds an unfortunately creepy take on American history and embodies everything I hate about how this country tends to romanticize and erase its own history for the sake of immortalizing a few key individuals and their deeds, most of which would were made to benefit them, the true foreigners of the \"America\" they founded on the backs of the minorities, native inhabitants. You'll want to stay in until you see the back of the trailers anyways.Gary Schyman weaves a great score that compliments the setting and the characters; pieces such as \"Songbird\" and \"Lutece\" are two tonally different themes, but represent the core of their characters perfectly; odd and not quite there, threatening, inspiring urgency and fear in those on the receiving end of its warpath.NARRATIVE:The game's environment relies heavily on the context of American romanticism of some important figures of the Civil and Revolutionary War era. It borders on, or rather is, revisionist fiction or mythology. White supremacy and racism are all wrapped in a pretty bow of in a steampunk universe. A seeming paradise in the sky where everyone is happy and nothing hurts becomes an obvious nightmare for the people who are seemingly unwelcome, both as humans and residents, but remain prisoners as a result of misguided belief that the other party is entitled to their servitude. Unfortunately, the game is not about any of this; in fact it, like so many other things, glosses over it, but in a far more upfront mentality.In the face of the highly publicized themes, the game's narrative is focused on a human story: the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth as they hustle through Columbia in the combined search of escape and a way to stop Comstock, the fanatical prophet of dubious origins. The narrative asks you to sympathize with a man of degenerate morale; he's a Pinkerton (corporate lackey who steps on the downtrodden and underpaid), he's a racist despite his actions in one particular scene, he participated in massacre that was Wounded Knee and enjoyed it. He's a deplorable human being and like any War protagonist of a fictional tale he's looking for some kind of redemption for his irredeemable sins because he knows he's done wrong.Regardless of his foibles, you sympathize with Booker because of his endearment for this young woman; Elizabeth. He rescues Elizabeth from a thinly veiled white supremacist paradise in the sky; he goes against the ideas they and he follow because he disagrees, as you do, with locking a young woman up and robbing her of her agency and this is only after he's spent time with her after a blow to the head with a wrench.Elizabeth herself is a great example of what happens when a writer treats a female character as person; for the most part she avoids a great deal of the pitfalls that embody pretty much everything that most with the good sense God gave them can identify as problems with female characters (objectification) in video games. Granted, she fulfills the role of damsel-in-distress (x2) and she unfortunately never quite climbs out of the bucket known as the male gaze (the developers could stand to abandon the low cut dress), but the game nor the narrative never restricts her to these roles.There are times where her enthusiasm of escape, her spontaneous breakdowns and her sudden acceptance of her environment tend to break the immersion, but they don't diminish her as a character. Elizabeth is very much defined by how much she isn't Ashley Graham or Princess Peach. \"Infinite\" is Elizabeth's story, how she grows as a person and takes control of her situation as Booker breaks down in the face of it.Most will misinterpret their relationship as romantic because that's how they've been educated; men and women cannot function on a heterosexual level as allies without the libido taking priority. But, while it doesn't touch Clem and Lee from the \"Walking Dead\" or Ico and Yorda from \"ICO\", it is without a doubt one of the best relationships I've seen depicted in a video game this year. Especially when you realize just how connected the two of them are; it's not necessarily equal, but the characters respect each other and in turn, so does the audience.As far as the human story goes, probably has very little to complain about; it's probably one of the few games I could probably slap on the hand and allow to walk by because the attention to detail in regards to its characters relationship was that good. Yet, but is not without fault and there are moments where I found myself wondering what exactly the writer (Kevin Levine) was attempting to do by balancing a bunch of heady subjects and one human tale about a man and a woman.The crux of the tale relies heavily on the art of deception through all too common visitation of the concept known as \"multiple dimensions\". It's the illusion of choice that brings this tale to an end; it leaves you sitting on place just to mull over what you just experienced. The idea that no what the player does, no matter what Booker and Elizabeth do, everything is as it should be; you can't change anything. Be that a commentary on game developer's constantly declaring: \"your choices will matter\", is, like the game's ending, left to the interpretation of the player. On one hand, it's a great idea, on the other, the side of me that like some type of conclusion to my story asks, \"Well, what the hell was all of that for then if everything is fated to repeat?\" This is seemingly brought closer to home by the fact that \"Infinite\" offers no \"New Game+\" option to its audience.Secondary characters, antagonists and political/human rights themes are painfully underutilized and almost never realized within their own right in the story; this extends to the NPC that loiter the environment of the game to breathe some type of life into the landscape you, the player, traverses. Everything the game hits you with in the beginning to give Creedence to its environment becomes irrelevant in the face Booker and Elizabeth's relationship and the multiple universes idea. While I acknowledge Levine's supposed intent was never to be a game strictly about racism, white or religious supremacy and fanaticism, its tends to brings to question why any of this was ever brought to the forefront if it was ultimately going to become a ghost (unimportant) in the narrative itself. If you removed almost all of this stuff and merely had a game that was focused on Booker rescuing Elizabeth from a religious nut that kept a girl locked up in a tower, noting would change. So why is it there to begin with at all, Levine's sloppy soapboxing and victim blaming aside? Basically, don't attempt to dress the windows of your story with these themes unless they will come to play in a major way in the story itself. Otherwise, you're just doing all of it a major disservice and \"Infinite\" does by just poking it with a stick and dropping it the next instant.Comstock never rises above the model of \"antagonist\"; like Talia al Ghul's role within the narrative of \"The Dark Knight Rises\", Comstock is sacrificed especially for what you discover about both Booker and Comstock's relation to each other. He almost never appears in any great significance beyond those two instances you meet him. Everything else is racist-laden audio logs and agitating voice overs. Yet, for the life of me, this shouldn't have prevented them from creating some kind of character beyond your prophet's quote of the day; the most I could say is that they succeed in making you hate the character, he is truly repulsive.Another failing within the narrative is the Vox Populi and more importantly, Daisy Fitzroy. The latter, the leader of the Vox Populi, is a young Black woman who was framed for the death of Comstock's wife and forced into hiding. She, along with every Person of Color or foreigner who migrated from places such as Ireland and China, are treated with acute distain and are seen animals or some lowly thing undeserving of the generosity of \"America, land of the Free\" or Columbia. Naturally, at some point she and everyone around her gets fed up, the last vestiges of \"suffer and bear it\" die out and she leads a revolt against the mass discrimination as experienced by them. They take no prisoners, deeming the only way to get to the root of the problem they experience is to \"kill all the weeds\"; everybody dies, men, women and children (this is a problem, but more on that later). Fitzroy and the Populi are ultimately the \"voices of the unheard\" pushed to the predicted limit.Fitzroy and co. couldn't be more justified in their anarchist actions against the populous of Columbia, but the game attempts to paint Fitzroy as just another Comstock with a different agenda (\"they're perfect for each other\", Elizabeth comments), as if to say the actions she takes against her oppressors is just another form of unjustified fanaticism. It bugged me, almost as much as the moment the game gives you the option of stoning the Black woman in a relationship with a white man. Only, here, there's NO justifiable context. It comes off as dismissive of the boiling pot of minority's anger. Fitzroy, like Comstock, is never fully realized as a personality. She shows up a total of two times; once to send the Player (Booker) on a fetch quest that puts to poor use the Vox Populi as allies and enemies; the second to be used as the jumping point for Elizabeth's descent from the nave and virginal character she's portrayed as for most of the game.The worst part of it is how it's executed; Fitzroy goes from justified rebel to extremist within moments and its all to serve Elizabeth's role in the story; because how unfamiliar we are with Fitzroy, her 180 decision to come back and kill Fink's kid after she leaves comes out of left field. It never feels like a natural progression for the character and its only then that Elizabeth's earlier comparison attempt with Comstock feels appropriate.Elizabeth had a nice perch to look down on other people from before she stabbed Fitzroy. Designated virginal heroine of pure heart, doesn't approve of violence. It's an annoying trope, and I don't like seeing it unless it's followed with a nice rebuke, something along the lines of \"spend a day in my shoes, lady.\" Fitzroy falling from grace, is a character arc (a sloppily told one, but an arc nonetheless). Beth going from completely right to completely right, is character petting. All-in-all, Fitzroy is a wasted character in an otherwise great game and it diminished my enjoyment of the game a lot.Songbird, the game's second equivalent to the \"Big Daddy\" character, appears sparsely in the game and is largely undefined as a character within the context of the game's narrative. Anyone expecting a \"Haunting Ground (2005)\" type encounter with the character wherein Booker and Elizabeth are sporadically chased through Columbia by the enemy type will be disappointed. He's pretty wasted. The most I could say about Songbird is that, it, like Elizabeth, was wonderfully animated character and makes the strongest impression in its introduction as far as enemies go.RESULTS:Overall, \"Bioshock: Infinite\" is an great game and despite its problems, one that I don't doubt I'll continue to enjoy, if only for its benefits the story has by enhancing the replay value.

But while this game might be extremely solid and well put together it is not without a couple of problems.First off, the graphics, movies, sound, voices, and controls are all superb. Every single thing in this is seemless and smooth. Kratos has a ton of moves and yet none are difficult to pull off. The quality and time spent polishing this game really show.But where the game starts to slide a bit is in its gameplay.The boss battles in this game are awesome yet they are so few and far between. After killing the hydra in the first level you will probably play 6-8 more hours until you hit the second real 'boss' battle.In between those 7 hours you will fight about 5 different enemies; Skeletons, harpies, minotaurs, cyclops, and medusas. THATS IT.Fighting the same 5 enemies hundreds, if not thousands, of times does get old very quick.And while some of the moves are awesome to behold the first time, you will wish you could skip them later on. Pinning a minataur to the ground was cool the first few times but after the 200th minataur i just thought of the move as a chore.And what game designer thought those underwater traps and spinning towers of spikes were fun? It is NOT fun to die 30 times in a row at some of those ridiculous traps.And seeing big bad Kratos tip toe across balance beams was funny too.In the end, i had a good time with God of War. It was a very solid gameplay experience. However, i find this game to be highly overrated because of its repetitive hack and slash nature and a few of its overly difficult traps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2006"}

Once you start this game, you basically belong to it anytime you have a few minutes to spare. So if you want to flush time away on a long flight, there really isn't any other option than this.Fire Emblem: Awakening on the 3DS is a pretty solid travel game.  Deep too.  But it's a kiddy pool in comparison to Persona 4; Golden.  This game is what the term \"time sink\" refers to.  For the first four hours the only thing you do is just scroll dialog prompts.  That's it.  Then you get to Yukiko's Castle and find out you're not leveled high enough to make it three floors.  So you grind it out for another two or three hours up and down the floors to collect personas and get somewhere around level 14 or 15 to get through.  Congratualtions, you have about 7 hours under your belt and that's pretty much the tutorial.  You're not even started.  You have to choose band or drama.  Basketball or Soccer.  You have to read books and fold envelopes.  You have to buy weapons and sell metal to craft new ones.  Don't forget to juggle Yukiko, Rise and Yumi.  If you're not laughing after the first nurse connection, you're better off with checkers.This game is freaking crazy and crazy massive but excellent entertainment in the exact same way chipping away at a huge book is.  Make no mistake, the difficulty spikes are brutal in the middle of the journey and a lot of the overall play time is grinding out levels, but that does not take away from the unbelieveable size and depth of Persona 4. Later in the game grinding becomes less necessary than fusing tough Personas.  If you never got around to touching the original PS2 game and you really want something to play on the go that borders on endless, this is worth buying a Vita for.  You can pick one up for less than $200 on eBay.  If you want something besides a book to read on the go, the game is totally worth it.  After three full play throughs in more than 100 hours over the past few months, I can say Persona 4 is pure monster collecting, level grinding, J-Pop booming simulation Nippon Mythology Scooby Doo weirdness, but it will melt away static hours like nothing you've ever seen.  Here it is:  I've been playing video games since Star Raiders (look it up) and it's easy to say Persona 4 is one of the best games you will ever play.Advice.  Stick it out.  Grind it out.  Keep multiple save files all the way down the list and go for the full ending with a minimal of spoiling yourself.

Rhodes","summary":"Now that I've played more than the Demo...","reviewText":"As promised I'd post an actual review of the game after beating it to a pulp.Needless to say that this is an amazing game with a gripping story, and defintely a worthy sequal.  To say that it has perfect top notch graphics and music that will blow you away. Not to mention its great character development and plot twists.I won't give away any of the story where as to me (and a lot of other people) this game has some of the best Plot twist in history.  All I will say is that the game is divided into two parts.  The &quot;Tanker&quot; chapter and the &quot;Plant&quot; chapter.  They both link in everyway and you can see if you play through the game.The characters are a true treat in this game.  There are several new characters introduced and they all have their own reasons for being where they are.  However the main villian...compared to Liquid Snake isn't the best.  Next to Kefka (FFVI) Liquid was probably the best villian of all time.  In comparison, the main villian didn't live up to Liquid.The music is breathtaking done by Harry Gregson-Williams (The Rock and Enemy of the State if you don't know him).  The music will really catch you, and that intro music is just awesome!I'm not much for graphics but I will say that the graphics are so good that when watching the cinema scenes they look like real people!  Can't go wrong with that.  Also, the voice acting is sheer brilliance.  They actually show emotion and they have a change in tone when they're upset or sad.It'll take you about 10-15 hours to complete the game your first time through but it is worth it.  However, movie cinemas make up at least six hours of the game.  This may bother some people as they said the first one was short. Sorry to say that the game is NOT short.  But that means you actually HAVE TO WATCH THE CGs!!!!  Also, watching the CGs is the only way to understand anything thats going on.The game doesn't really present any BIG challenge.  In fact with the new gear and stuff you can do I'd say it makes the game EASIER than the first (is that possible!?).  To say the least though the new gear isn't much different from the old gear in MGS.Lastly the fun factor.  The game is very fun if you don't take it too seriously.  What I mean by that is don't be ashsmaed to break some of the stealth rules and have fun with the guards every once and awhile.  That was the funnest part of the first one.One final note.  In the HARD and EXTREME difficulty setting you can choose to have a game over if you're spotted.  Being that you take so much damage I'd probaly suggest that you take that oppertunity on EXTREME.OVERALLGraphics: 10Plot/Story: 10Music: 10Gameplay: 9Fun Factor: 10Overall score: 9.9You won't be disappointed","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2001"}

Could be vastly improved if used for a Nintendo DS","reviewText":"This case gets the job done, but the overall design...just isn't very good.While it might be a good size for the massive 3DS, this case is WAY too big for a DS. The elastic straps will hold a DS in place, and the foam padding certainly gets the job done, and the whole thing is sturdy and seems well-constructed.However, the case is too small to be used for a DS, power cable, and game collection, and too large to be used for the DS alone. It's nice that it has three slots for DS games, but as you can't see the face of the game while it's in the slot, and if you use the system seriously you likely have a dozen games or more, it's just about useless.In short, this case will do what it's supposed to do (protect your DS). What it WON'T do is fit a DS snugly, or fit all of your games, power, accessories, and DS console. I do not own a 3DS so I cannot comment on usage for that system or how well it fits (but I imagine it fits the massive 3DS considerably better).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004X56PWK","description":"","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"I missed you buddy","reviewText":"Sonic the Hedgehog was my first game ever, I loved all of the titles on the Genesis/Mega Drive, with that said I've also hated most of his 3D games with the exception of Colors and strictly the Day levels of Unleashed. Most of my resentment for the 3D games were the dumb characters they tacked on which typically played poorly or were given boring objectives. Then the attempts at a serious story with our favorite cartoon Hedgehog, it just didn't work (with the exception of Sonic: SatAM). Sonic 06 being the peak of awful rushed out the door trash combined with a awful serious story trying to move us with ...what's basically cartoon characters, buggy controls, horrible loading times and lots of other nasty things.In the adventure titles the only levels I found I enjoyed were Sonic levels while even Tails and Knuckles got just dumb levels which was fairly irritating and half the characters I wanted to find the deepest portion of Chemical Plant Zone and die under a spring (I'm looking at you Shadow, Chip, Silver). It's not that I'm against Sonic going for a new route, or you know meeting new friends it's simply the controls weren't tight enough or the game was just buggy and awful (sonic 06) and probably the weakest gripe is my dislike for Heroes, because you just can't shut the characters up, 10th time through a level and they're still talking. And on the 'new friends' note, it'd be okay if they didn't make just dumb characters or characters that are taking the darker and edgier route, it's just unneeded.Now that I've got my reasoning for hating past games out of the way, let's start why Generations isn't garbage and why it's getting a review. Tight controls, simple and fun storyline, great platforming, lots of things to do and unlock, fun to endlessly replay levels, cheesy little jokes referring to things fans have possibly wondered and the side characters play very little roles in the overall story. Now the thing that's interesting is you go through titles from the previous games now as I said, I loved the Gen titles and Adventure was okay and (day) Unleashed was fun and Colors was great, but this game also has levels from games I hated, however they are nothing like they were and are redone to be a blast to play. Best part is they really tried to get memorable parts from levels in to parts of the redone levels and they blended them in very well.It was quite funny to tell my cousin that I enjoyed playing a level out of Sonic 06, because they clearly listened and made the levels to pay homage but more importantly be fun. If you haven't already figured out you play through the game with Modern Sonic who plays like Sonic Colors and Classic Sonic who plays like a mix between Sonic 2 and 3 (strictly 2D gameplay), they're both playable in all levels you just play as them in different 'acts'. Both play really well and tight which is the most important thing since it's a platforming title and all the levels have many routes to take...just like the classic titles.-Modern Sonic gets the boost, homing and stomp attacks, rail grinding, and some level specific powers like wall hopping and ring dashing-Classic Sonic gets little more than jump and spin dash, though you can unlock the fire/water/lightning shields from Sonic 3. Though this is a good thing because his gameplay remains true to what it was, no homing attacks, just 2D platforming and speed.Basically what I'm trying to strain here in  this review is that in the years of failure in Sonics 3D titles they got their act together and put out a game that's amazing. There's lots of side-missions, optional music to unlock, the game is simply pretty as it's ever going to get. If you missed Sonic, this is the game to get, there's no gimmicks, no stupid serious story, no playing as dumb unpolished characters.Note: I am by no means saying all his 3D games are bad, I'm saying that I personally hated them, if you disagree feel free to however this is my thoughts on it. So keep that in mind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

New powerups, new levels, new experiences, etc!2-Player mode was incredible compared to the one in SMB1. As you both play as Mario and Luigi, you guys can clear levels for each other (Or just die on purpose so the other player can play the harder levels), and you can battle each other in a recreation of the Mario Bros arcade game. You either knock down 5 enemies, get 5 coins, distract the other player, or jump on him/her to take the panels they collected at the end of the regular levels.So I'm pretty sure this game has enough for you to sink your gaming teeth in.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}

Well, I'm hitting myself pretty hard right now. While I will admit that XBox has had a very small handful of noteworthy titles my PS2 and GameCube have been giving me a lot more pleasure and good games to choose from. Obi-Wan stands as a testament to the type of over hyped garbage that the XBox has been pushing down a perhaps gullible consumer markets throat for almost a year now. To think that I bought the system for this game... Let me attack every aspect of it that is wrong.The graphics are Playstation 1 quality at best, granted running in high resolution, but the character models, frame rate and animation are all terrible. The control feels clumsy, the story is boring, and as an Obi-Wan fan I was more put off by the way they portrayed Obi-Wan than enthusiastic about it.The voice acting was terrible. The voice actors sounded nothing like their movie counterparts, and Obi-Wan came off as being very smug, and unlikable simply because of his voice alone. The sad part of this game is how great the game could have been if A) the graphics were more in touch with what the XBox CAN do, which is a lot more than this, B) the story and dialogue were a lot better, and C) the controls were not so clumsy and were a bit more precise. It is amazing to me that this game made it to the market like this. It was the reason I bought an XBox, it is a good thing I'm broke and could only afford to rent the game. Consumer beware! Rent this game before buying it!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2002"}

It is kinda similar to the old XCOM meets Sailor Moon! There are neat things to purchase, like full unit upgrades and tank parts, very cool. One down side, is that the player has to refight old battles in skirmish mode to get experience points, but that is ok. The story unfolds in 2 ways, full video and space-bar select video.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Anthony J Sasso","summary":"How much fun?  2 stars.

The graphics are a nice taste of things to come but the gameplay is pretty lame.  It doesn't have the feel of the original Doom games and it's not supposed to.  As I'm sure you've heard, the storyline is crap.  That is very true.  The characters are cool and the voice acting is great... but the overall story and the way the game plays itself out is rather dull.  The graphics in Doom 3 put games like Halo and Ut2004 to shame... but those games are much more addictive and will stand the test of time.  Doom 3, sadly, will not.  If this game took 4 years to make, 3 of those years were spent on the engine.  Doom 3 is cool at first, but when all is said and done, it's just not all that much fun of a game.*Doom 3 looks great even on lower end GPUs.I ran the game on a 2.8ghz machine with 512mb of ram.  I used a Geforcefx 5200 (bottom of the barrel as far as the Fx series goes).  - The game looked amazing and ran smooth at medium quality graphics with an 800x600 res. -*Update your drivers.The game ran terribly until I went to NVIDIA's site and updated the video card's drivers.  Once updated it ran great.*Play Doom 3 on Marine (medium) difficulty your first time through.The lowest difficulty is way too easy and you wont get the full effect of the game on account of the monster's being so simple to kill.  Adversely, playing the game on Hard (Veteran) the first time through isn't recommended either.

{"product_name":"B006ZPAXYW","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Some polish required, but mor than worth a look","reviewText":"The Secret World could've been improved in a dozen little ways, but it still stands apart as an MMO that is not only a uniquely enjoyable setup, but it actually makes you use your brain to solve quests.The general storyline is awesome. Across 3 starting guilds (The Templar, Illuminatti, and the Dragon) you're a normal human thrust into a world of magic and mystery, spanning Heaven and Hell and the realms of the Dark Gods and the Other. You're conscripted/recruited by your guild of choice, and packed off into the wonderland behind the veil of the real world.The system is classless, meaning you can literally be whatever you please. Grinding is almost non-existant. You may play over the same area doing multiple quests, but I never had to mob monsters to get a level. Quests are scaled to provide enough experience to make it, but not make it easy.And quests are unique, inventive, and genuinely exciting. Red herrings abound as you struggle to crack a puzzle or subtle hint as to the next phase of the mystery you are exposing yourself too. Or go out and collect ammo for survivors and fight hordes of the undead. Fetch and slay quests are still present, but the mysterys are by far the best. You actually use an in-game browser to search for clues, crack passwords, and research famous historical and fake-historical figures and places. I've never had so much fun being frustrated by trying to figure out a nerd fan boys password bsed on his love of a fake horror novel serial.Graphics are a solid C-. Your torso turns so much as you psuedo skate across the landscape it looks like you should be able to hear your spine wailing in protest while you scream in terro at looking like you're going to shoot off a cliff like a hockey puck. Monsters later on appear cripser and more realistic, not to mention more visceral and gross, but overall they could've done better. Environments are a B+, with hidden findable items in at least logical locations, hidden passageways, and otherwise confusing and maze-like worlds, which I actually enjoy, as unless you're in a city, you shouldn't have quests at 3rd and main street.Audio is great, just for characters. Its actually worht it going back to lower level areas to play through the side-story of the native american shamanic chosen one whos a 16 year old high school girl who's more interested in playing her game boy than fighting a wendigo.Connectivity is a little dicey. I wasn't on the best connection in the world, but lag problems abounded at times, though to be fair I was at the mass opening, so the deluge has certainly petered off.Equipment is kind of a puzzle, and well fabrication is far more worthwhile, is still far too strange for me to figure out. Basically pick your two favorite weapons and try to group periodically. If your group mates are doing double your damage, its time to upgrade. But luckilly, this has never been a real issue for me, as you get scaled equipment often enough for it to be obvious what you should be using.PVP is awful. Unless you have purple equipment, it's not even worth the attempt until you're at maximum level.Overall, its a tragedy Funcom is taknig a bath on this. Some more polish on graphics, full voice acting for male/female main players, and this would be five stars. As it is, the uniqueness of the setup and the engaging main storyline pull this up from 3 to 4 and manage to keep it there.

At first, I often had so much troubles with trying to decide what a great racing game really is like. That has been the cases with games like Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot Tag Team Racing, and the classic Need For Speed series. Since it came out in the late 90's, it has been one of the most driven and outrageous race games of all time. That has shined in so many different ways from its Underground, adn its Hot Pursuit days as well. Arguably fans of the Underground series have really seen the madness of street racing at its fullest. Now, the madness has returned.Need For Speed: Underground 2 for the Playstation 2, is a wicked, wild and outrageous game for all gamers alike. The object is simple, you have to drive your way to become the best of the underground world throughout the city of Bayside. As you travel in the city, you can unlock cars like the Subaru Impreza WRX, the Mazda Miata, and SUV's like the Hummer H2, and the Lincoln Navagator. But it is not just the speed of the car, it also is about how you design your cars that also can make your experience as extreme as you need it to be. The graphics and gameplay are absolutely amazing, and deliver for Playstation 2 owners. As for the music, it really can be wild at times, ranging from Rap and Hip Hop, to hard driven Rock. The control is very simple to get used to at times, but when you play the drag races, you have to make sure your cars are on manual transmissions instead of automatic. Otherwise, you's lose your way in the drag races. That is one disadvantage, and another one is that you sometimes spend too much time trying to discover the races in the Bayside area, where it can be frustrating to uncover and meet certain challenges for gamers.All in all, Need For Speed Underground 2 for the PS2 is a great buy for die hard race fans. While so many are considering the recent Need For Speed Most Wanted over Underground 2, this might be a batter game for those who might not be able the master the fierceness of the most wanted era. This definitely is a must buy for Playstation 2 owners, or anybody who has the need for speed.Graphics: B+Sound: B 1/2+Control: B 1/2-Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2006"}

The entire world ofGrandia IIis rendered in 3-D, with over 1,000 characters to interact with. Audio voice-overs accompany cinematic cutscenes and serve to reinforce the strong cast of characters.","reviewerName":"Jewels \"bookgrrl\"","summary":"A Mixture of Great Things!","reviewText":"More than just a few good Sonic games came from the Dreamcast.  Grandia II, a compelling RPG by Game Arts is not only for the Dreamcast anymore, but also Playstation 2 and PC.  The Playstation 2 version also includes all new, never seen before cinematics.  If that's not enough, it's certainly okay because Grandia II has much more to offer.First of all the battle system: I find many RPGs to be quite similar to one another.  Their battle system is overall the same.  This is not the case for Grandia II.  It is a mixture of active time and turn base battle.  There is one time bar that enemies and allies share.  Everyone has his or her own icon on that bar.  When they reach a certain point on the bar, a menu appears for that character.  This is when the turn base battle takes place.  You can take as long as you like to carefully choose your attack.  Pick the correct attack and you could even destroy the enemy or send them back to the beginning of the time bar.Overall, the battle system makes this game unique and addicting.  Not only that, but the much dreaded \"random battles\" is eliminated.  You see the enemies before you go into battle with them.  And if you wish, many times you can simply run from them.Next, the graphics and sound: In Grandia II, there is voice acting during many of the cutscenes.  Voices are also heard during battle.  I find them to be well done unlike some of the cheesy dialog in games.  It's not the best voice acting around, but certainly didn't make me cringe as much as in the first Grandia.  The graphics are also done well in the 3D world.  Everything is colorful and carefully done.The only complaint I have in this category is some of the battle animations were long and drawn out for what they were.  Even the skill of poison had a long animation.Finally, the story: I think that every RPG needs to have a decent story.  Grandia II definitely has a deep story.  It starts out with Ryudo the GeoHound and his bird companion Skye.  They meet up with the talented vocalist named Elena, (part of the Sisters of Granas) who needs to be escorted to another location.  From then on, the story unfolds.  The story touches a lot on being yourself, the lighter side of evil, a church betrayal, love triangles, and alter egos.  Even if it is a little predicting, it is still satisfying.Pros:Innovative and addicting battle systemWonderful 3D graphicsGreat level up system for skillsGreat story and charactersCons:Seemed pretty short, (took me 34 hours to complete)Long battle animations","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2004"}

{"product_name":"B008GEH9HO","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Great system - terrible pricing on Amazon ~","reviewText":"Purchased 3ds XL Mario Kart Limited Edition version on Target.com for $199.99.  Yep.  With Mario Kart 7 pre-installed.  Beware these unscrupulous 3rd party vendors.  Target also retails the 3ds XL for $199.99 normally, and the other bundles for around $239.99.Adding to the positive reviews for this system.  I recently upgraded from my DSi XL, but will be keeping the DSi.  Here's why:  the backwards compatibility works fine.  But the screens on this system have a tendency to distort the image.  So the game looks like you're watching a video online, then blowing it up to a larger size than and getting the grain.  It is okay, but playing side by side, it is VERY noticeable.  So I will be playing only 3ds titles on the 3ds since the resolution is wonky.The 3ds has a sliding 3d scale which can be toggled at any time.  This was and is the most important feature to me.  If I am getting eye strain, or if I'm playing a game and just don't need the 3d depth, I can lessen it or shut it off.  Perfect!Turning the system off is a bit different than the DS.  You have to quit the game, then go to the menu, then hit okay to turn off system.  No more of just holding the power button.  Still, the games go into sleep mode if you just close the lid.Battery life is good, but it takes a lot longer to charge than the DS did.  Probably twice as long (judging by charging time on each when the low battery indicator comes on).The volume is still on the side... yes you will still probably hit it with your hand when using the L trigger.  Headphone jack still at the bottom (not a huge deal, but I like to lay down and rest the bottom of the system on my torso... can't with headphones in.  The direction pad is lower, and in an odd place.  Just a note for those not a fan of the analog circle pad.In summary: It's not perfect, but it's pretty great.  The titles being released are amazing.  I went for the 3ds due to price and selection of quality games over the PS Vita.Note: 3ds is ready to play out of the box (unlike PSP and PS Vita which require Sony memory sticks).  The 3ds uses an SD card and comes with one already.  And it has a charger, the same as the DS, so that's nice if you have DS charger already.Also, the 3DS XL fits perfectly in my DSi XL pouch:Official Nintendo Travel Case for DSi and DSi XL - Wine.  The blue is nice and it has a metallic look and is fingerprint resistant.  Graphics are pretty amazing for most games, and though it has less impressive hardware than a Vita, I can't complain about the entire package.  A great hand held system, even for someone like me who is not big into 3D.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

It uses the same dumb insta-kill \"press this button to win\" mechanic known as mark and execute from conviction, as well as the same dumb running and \"Panther\" stealth system, where it's expected for enemies to find you and focus on your last exact seen spot.They claim that it has very wide open levels but it doesn't. At most there's maybe 2-3 solutions, or slight derivatives in the order you are required to often kill people.The story is short as hell coming in at around 5 hours. I'll spare the voice acting change rant because it's been said a hundred times before(even though it still sucks)A lot of moments are in it that you can tell were made by a board of people going \"This will shock people! Lets do it!\" There's nothing that's really contributing to the story from these moments but the gamers they're obviously targeting with this kind of thing will thinks it's deep and emotional and that it made them cry or whatever.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

The game is overly ambitious and makes a lot of boasts, such as a claim that there are hundreds of thousands of weapons.  For the most part, the game succeeds and creates a satisfying and addictive experience best shared with friends.PROS:+++ Emphasis on co-op play+++ Gorgeous cell-shaded graphics+++ Tons of different weapons+++ Missions and quests look to be modeled after World of Warcraft.  It is easy to tell what missions you have and what you have to do.+++ Character customization options are abundantCONS:--- A lot of the weapons, about 95%, are generic forgettable junk.--- Vehicle controls are hypersensitive at best or a sloppy mess at worse.--- The story line is fairly weak--- The enemy designs get really repetitive after a whileGAMEPLAY: At its core Borderlands is a standard FPS with lots of guns.  The emphasis on multi-player encourages up to 4 players to join forces and basically loot the place much in the way that Phantasy Star Online worked.  You can choose a brute, a hunter/sniper, siren/assassin, or soldier.  Each class has a specialty, but anyone can use any weapon.  Characters gain ability points as they pass levels and also improve their skill with individual weapon types by using that type of weapon.  Missions are nicely handled in a very World of Warcrafty sort of way.  While I'm not a fan of WoW personally, the system works.  Enemies in the game are randomly generated and sprouted from set spawn points.  After you have played the game for a while, you'll know WHERE you'll find enemies, but you may not know exactly what variation of enemy you'll find.  Ultimately, what drives the gameplay is the urge to build your character up and their quest for bigger and better loot.  Yes, it is level grinding, but the level of action.PRESENTATION: Amazing, but it could use a few improvements.  On the good side, the game is stylish and slick with a Fallout/Mad Max feel neatly put together with some of the nicest cell-shaded graphics I've seen in a long time.  Menus work nicely and setting up a multi-player match with friends is a snap.  The game's HUD works nicely and gives you almost all of the information you need, but an onscreen mini-map feature is noticeably missing.  Instead you must open a menu system to access a map.  The other issue is the lack of variety of enemies, which fall into a few small groups.  There is fair amount of variation in the strength and abilities of individual enemies within those groups, but you'll mostly find yourself battling Skaggs (dog-like critters) and bandits.GRAPHICS: Gorgeous.  The cell-shaded graphical design works nicely and the representation of the blasted wasteland is almost as good as Fallout 3.CONTROLS: The controls are tight and responsive.  The auto-assist feature that helps keep enemies in your sights is subtle and doesn't hold your hand too much.  My only complaint about the game controls is focused on the vehicle controls, which are acceptable when you're in open spaces, but navigating any tight environment with obstacles is a profanity inducing chore.  My friends and I have accidentally Austin-Powered so many vehicles it stopped being funny and just angers us now.  The problem is that the camera position determines your driving direction and the left stick only handles your acceleration.  At higher speeds the controls work better and the vehicle responds more predictably, but navigating slowly and carefully degrades into an awkward experience at best.  Luckily, vehicular combat is only a small portion of the game.AUDIO: The music in the game is good, although not particularly noteworthy.  The gun sounds are standard fair and the voice acting isn't bad.  The little quips and insults tossed out by the enemies get old after a while, but this is the case with most games where common enemies are allowed to speak.VALUE: This game is big with tons of missions.  Many players will probably feel compelled to max out at least one character of each of the four classes.  I understand the level cap is 50, and I wouldn't be surprised if future downloadable packages raise that level cap by another 10 or 20 levels along with new zones, levels and missions.  I fully expect to get at least 30-50 hours of gameplay out of this title, quite possibly more.Overall, this is a very strong game with only a few flaws.  I recommend Borderlands on any platform, but especially to any FPS fan that wants something slightly different from the standard Halo and Call of Duty fare that is so popular.  Fans of online RPG titles such as WoW and Phantasy Star Online may also enjoy this game.  The emphasis on multi-player co-op puts this game in good company with Halo: ODST and Left 4 Dead, so fans of those games should definitely consider this title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

Thank goodness for that because I would have felt ripped off if I had spent money on this game.Mind you... this game is not terrible.  The graphics are ok and the gameplay has some moments.  But to spend the same amount of money on this game as COD4 or Crysis or even Left For Dead is a travesty.  The AI is not smart enough to open a can of beans, when they, for instance, do exactly the SAME THING over and over during a scripted event no matter how you change your tactics.  The story is heavy handed and obvious by comparison to such great WW2 games as Company of Heroes.  Not to say the story itself is bad... only the way the game goes about portraying it.  When you whole squad stops in front of a door no one can open and sits there while your captain walks up to it... it does not take a brain surgeon to see where that is headed.This game is not worth choosing over the many better games out there today.  Its probably better on an X-box or Playstation because it is obviously leaning towards them anyway.  But if you walk home with COD5 instead of Fallout 3 or even a used copy of COD4... you are going to feel the fool.  But that's just my opinion.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2009"}

Lerch","summary":"Want to lose a best friend? Buy them this game.","reviewText":"Recently one of those brick and mortar shops had a sale on Turning Point where I purchased it for $10.What a waste of $10. I'd have been better served buying anything else. Maybe a CD with 1 song I want to hear. I'd have certainly had more fun with that.Hit detection is extremely poor in this game. When I shoot an enemy 20 times and they are still sitting there shooting at me, I get annoyed. There are also spots where you can clearly see an enemy in the distance but, despite aiming at his head and pulling the trigger on his head, he won't die, simply because the game hasn't decided this character is \"active.\" As soon as the enemy is active, THEN you can kill them. Annoying.Why does the game need to be so DARK? I had to turn gamma correction up all the way in the video options in order to be able to see many of the enemies.One thing I can't stand in a game is when enemies \"pop\" into the game. I understand wanting to keep the 360 working on other tasks to give me a tight frame rate and split second controller response, but WHY do I need to suspend my disbelief enough to allow enemies to POP UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!? I shouldn't have to disconnect myself from the action to accept pop up as this then destroys any immersion you might have in the game. And how about having enemies appear behind me when they clearly had no ingress into the area behind me? Perfect example. The most annoying section of the game, running the catwalk onto the blimp, you have come up an elevator to the catwalk. When you leave the elevator (which you can't go back down), there are several rooms to clear. I went into every room, killed every enemy and then ran down the catwalk. At about the 3/4 mark of the catwalk, I have enemies pop up BEHIND me, when clearly they can't be there if you look at the environment. I've watched them pop in.Let us now look at the \"use\" function when it comes to certain items in the environment. Sometimes you have to pull a lever or open a door. For whatever reason, the programmers have decided on very narrow or very broad hit detection for this. Some doors you can open from yards away. Some levers you have to have the lever just to the left of your character to pull. Then there is the close combat actions. Sometimes you will run up on an enemy and the hand icon appears. Sometimes you'll be on the same spot of another enemy and instead of the hand appearing, you're filled with lead as you try to find the .00000001 centimeter area the programmers decided you need to hit this one enemy on. Consistency is the key and unfortunately this game fails miserably there.The game is not fun. At all. It is tedious and boring.Another way the programmers have decided to make the game difficult is to change the accuracy and the damage enemies do as you progress further into the game. This is fine, if it didn't also mean it took only 3 shots to have you meeting your maker on the later levels, where everyone seems to have a gun capable of shooting off 100 rounds a second.The only other way they could figure out how to make the game difficult is to add the above accuracy and damage, then also make the areas between check points longer and longer the further you get into the game. And some of the areas are controller throwing anger inducing that you'll spend hours replaying because, despite the fact that the areas are tough as nails and you can easily make your way through them after all the repeat runs, there's always an unexpected enemy popping up just before a check point that will shoot you three times with a 100 bullet per second gun and you die.If you're looking for ~500 \"easy\" (assuming you are good at the game and can stomach it long enough to play through) gamer points, this is a good title to pick up (for $10; any more than this and you're being ripped off). And the 500 can be achieved without playing on-line.The concept behind the game intrigued me as it has others. Unfortunately the throw away any interest in this when it turns into a simple, poorly done first person shooter with little to no story and nothing really keeping the action cohesive.So is this the worst game ever? No. There are moments of fun to be had. Is it the worst game I've played in a long time? Yes. Usually my good/bad game radar is pretty good. My \"bad\" radar was blipping when I picked this up, but the $10 price point muted any protestation my radar may have had. Every once in awhile I need to have a kick in the pants to remind me not to ignore the radar.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2009"}

The problem is just that as the game continues the story becomes more and more predictable and sappy. I think there was one plot twist but you could see it coming a mile away (heck there were cutscenes in every location directly telling you it would happen).That said, the combat system is fun, it's a mix between Secret of Mana's action based battling and Final Fantasy's random battles which may or may not turn off people to the game. I found it to be refreshing and, for the most part, enjoyed the battles. I did find, however, toward the end, you could rely on casting one skill at the beginning of each battle and pretty much kill all the enemies in one quick blow, time and time again.There are plenty of side things to do ranging from a bug arena (pretty interesting idea) where you bring collected bugs to battle to be the best to a factory where you arrange materials collected with set recipes to build new items for the stores you frequent.Unfortunately, the game's story is horrid and there are other flaws which take this almost wonderful game and turn it into something less than exciting. One of the main flaws with the game, I'd say, is the constant need to grind away at enemies to survive at all. You'll beat one area and instantly be thrown into the next where the enemies seem nearly impossible. I mean, it makes sense to increase the level of the enemies but so dramatically? It just forces you to sit at the beginning of each stage, build up enough of a level to survive the battles, and then move on out.There are also weird items you get in your inventory that seem to have no purpose after their initial use and are downright silly. You're given a glove that increases your strength at one point to break something in your way... but then the glove is never used again. Oh wow, we're very lucky that glove was in the area for this predicament.Anyhow, the game is pretty and if you can stand the somewhat sappy empty story you will enjoy the game. So if you do see it on sale, I suggest buying it and giving it a try. Don't jump into it thinking it'll be on the level of any other RPG series (Suikoden, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy) because it just isn't.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2008"}

It was cheap and got good reviews.  It's a well put together product, but has some issues that hurt it.The biggest thing wrong with this game is the save points.  You cannot save anywhere you like, only at certain shrines.  Normally that's not a big deal, but in a couple sections of the game you'll literally go two to three hours without a save point.  It's less if you know what you're doing or use a guide, but if you've done it before there's no way to fast forward the cut scenes so you just get frustrated watching them again and if you use a guide you lose out on the major purpose of the game, puzzle solving.  If you have a job, a life, a kid, etc. then just stop reading and pass on this game.  There's not much sadder than getting almost to a save point and having to stop because it's time to walk the dogs or change the baby.  I ended up having to finish it up over a three day weekend because I could never get time to play in one stretch during the week.Cut scenes are both a plus and a minus.  They tell a very compelling, if confusing, story and make you want to move forward so you can trigger the next one.  They also sometimes give you hints your going the right way or how to solve a puzzle.  Where they fall flat is that they're all in game and none of them can be skipped.  If you have to quit before you reach a save point, you will be sitting through the same dialog and clues.  It gets very old very fast.You covering the same ground repeatedly.  This may or may not be a concern of yours.  If you've playedMetroid Primeand didn't mind the backtracking you're probably OK.  The only catch here is there's generally just one way to get from point A to point B.  Mostly this is a good thing, because those weak hints could have you wondering around forever.  It also helps you figure out when you've left an area you should be in.  However, at times it makes the world seem really small.It seems like you lose health constantly, though at a slow rate.  If you die though you go to the spectral plane and can recover health.  There are usually different enemies there so you can still die and have to go back to a check point, but generally they're easy and you recover health there.  A few enemies can also travel there to chase you, so that's your real risk of dying for real.Combat is OK, but mostly just pressing weak or strong attack buttons.  You can mix it up with weapons, which you're really better off doing than hand to hand.  You also have the Soul Reaver which you can call at will and attack enemies.  It's extremely powerful, but more than a little use and you start to lose health.  Also, kills made with the Reaver won't allow you to eat the enemy's soul to recover health.  As you progress and solve forge puzzles you gain elemental powers that say with you until you go into the spectral plane or find another fount of energy.The spectral plane is also used to solve some puzzles.  You can push against most gates to pass through them when you're a spirit.  Also, you cannot climb, water has no effect on you so no swimming, and sometimes the landscape changes.  The puzzles range from pretty cool to annoying.  There are some where you're just forced to run back and change Reaver powers or go collect items and cover the same ground over and over.  Mostly though, they're fun and satisfying to actually figure them out.  Sometimes they're tricky because the game's training helpful hints are very much hit or miss to show you how you should approach a puzzle.  I'd suggest having a guide available just in case.  Especially if you can't save, it will help a lot in the frustration department.Overall, the game is really solid and fun.  I'd easily give it at least four stars if it wasn't for the lack of saving.  It just ruined the game for me, because I don't have that much time to devote to a game in one sitting.  Oh well, still had some fun with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2010"}

The missions are destroy this, escort that, etc.  Fun, yet repetitive after a while.  Whenever you take out enemies, you collect their money.  Money is used to upgrade the different planes you commandeer.  Stealing new planes and comparing the differences in handling speed and firepower is fun.  The game's environments are huge and have hidden icons buried throughout, giving the single player reason to explore.  These icons are used for upgrading planes as well.  All this said about the 1 player game, I give it a 7 out of 10.  I only played it for about a week (25% complete 1 player) when I purchased Live.**Open doors**Crimson Skies on Live is utterly amazing and gave me no reason to return to the 1 player mode.  Modes such as Dogfight, Team DF, Capture the Flag, are all great.  16 players are allowed to join in one game (with a little lag, but not much at all).The XBOX Live menus are so simple to use (when compared with Rainbow Six 3) and I have never waited more than 2 minutes to get a game of at least 10 people to join.  In other words, a lot of Xboxer's are playing this on Live, kids.It is on XBox Live that Crimson Skies allows you to see the vast handling and maneuverability of these planes.  Live also keeps each pilot's stats, allowing the player to put everything in perspective compared to other Red Baron's out there.The environments on Crimson Live are completely huge and amazing and the battles that ensue are nothing short of utter mayham.I give Crimson Live 9/10 dumbfire rockets.  If you are looking for a reason to purchase Live, look no further.  This game to me, was worth the money.Look on the horizon for the wispy flames coming out of my engine, for I am BOO75.  :o)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FRVCAA","description":"Forza Motorsport 2, the sequel to Microsoft Game Studios' award-winning, fully customizable driving simulator Forza Motorsport, speeds its way onto Xbox 360 this holiday. With authentic simulation physics, bone-jarring damage, photo-realistic graphics, and licensed tuning and customization options, the franchise improves on the unprecedented features gamers enjoyed in its debut installment. Loaded with more than 300 of the world's hottest cars for you to collect, personalize and tune, Forza Motorsport 2 gives you a complete racing experience.","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Well Done, Gran Turismo has Serious Competition","reviewText":"Being the only simulation racing game on the Xbox 360 and the closest thing to GT4 since 2004 it is going to be difficult to compare this game to anything currently played. Because of this I will compare it to the game it is quite obviously trying to steal fans from. Forza 2 is unique from any other racing game currently on the 360 simply because it is well executed. It has most of the features of GT4 and none of the problems that franchise had.The actual racing is very simplistic in its approach. Making the car drive how you want it to is not, especially at the higher levels. At the beginning you can win without tuning the car hardly at all. Go and drive fast and you'll most likely win...on the standard difficulty setting. The difficulty setting unlike the driving is fairly complex and adds another dimension to the game. One is able to toggle on and off the traction control, ABS system and active stability management. Difficulty of the opponents is adjustable three ways. Also available is a suggested driving line which tells when to brake, let off the brake or hit the accelerator. This is adjustable as well. I really like this feature because it really eases you into the racing instead of making you take those ridiculous license tests from GT. Everyone remembers these; they are frustrating and time consuming. What prevents you from getting to the higher level races in Forza is your driver level which you level up by winning the purses from the races.The graphics in Forza 2 are average at best. The cars look very dimensionally correct but everything just has that game feel to it. Not once would you confuse this for reality. In fact I'd say it is only about one step up from GT4 in graphics. With the capability of these 7th generation systems you should be able to create a real sense of awe. What most likely happened is spending so much time making sure the dimensions of the car were incredibly detailed they ran out of time to really enhance the visual aspects of the metal and the backgrounds. It is almost like the lines are too sharp to make it seem real. This is quite a dissapointment for a game that took five years to create. I can only say that racing simulation games have to be the most time consuming expensive type of game to produce. What other type of game do you have to purchase the rights of 300 different products, numerous tracks and make them mesh together. For true gamers that are concerned with the essence of the game, the graphics will be an afterthought. I have to admit, I wouldn't mind having an HD version of Forza 2 in the future.Cars in Forza 2 are literally the crowning achievement of the game. You will have a difficult time finding two cars that drive the same. Much like real life this is true. I, myself have not driven anywhere near the caliber or number of cars on this game. However common sense says: the 1969 Camaro is going to have a considerable amount of over-steer, the AWD vehicles have amazing grip, the Elise handles like a go-cart and the Lamborghinis as always are faster than the speed of light. You would expect this type of behavior in most racing sim games, but in Forza 2 every single car has a signature driving style, engine sound, braking ability and overall feel. In fact mechanical and aerodynamic engineers were hired to make sure the physics were correct to real life.A big step that Forza 2 took was having real damage on the vehicles. This can be adjusted for the level of damage you want. Cosmetic-gives only cosmetic damage and no mechanical or electrical parts can be damaged. Partial Damage-body and suspension can be damaged and the car may pull to one side as well as reduced braking performance. Simulation-full blown damage as close to real life as it gets. Here you can damage the body, suspension parts and even lose power in the engine and transmission.  However, if needed you can go to the pit area and all the damage except cosmetic can be fixed. This step of realism really adds another dimension to the game. Bravo.Customization is a very large part of the experience in Forza 2. My favorite feature is the fact that you don't have to pay to change the color and there are about 150 regular colors, 150 metallic colors and probably 50 special iridescent colors. You are able to add hundred of vinyl shapes in any color and any size. Body kits and spoilers which actually improve the cars ability are able to be purchased and even adjusted. Mechanical parts on the car that can be upgraded are:  brakes, all suspension components, plugs, intake, super or turbochargers, complete engine swaps, tires, wheels, engine, ignition, transmission and a few other things. You get the point. All the things that really were annoying with GT4 were remedied. Also upgrade parts can be resold back for half price.Another amazing aspect of the game is the sheer amount of information available. I really enjoy this because while not being quite as technical in scope as GT4 it doesn't inundate you a lot of esoteric specs. I say available because you are not forced into viewing all of it all the time, but it can be accessed. A really nice feature is the \"benchmark\" which gives you various datum on the car you are currently in before you drive it. This includes 0-60 times, 60-0 times, skid pad, top speed etc. When purchasing a car you can find out horsepower, torque, weight etc. Detailed information on the car more so that this can be found as well. While racing you are able to view advanced telemetry such as lateral and vertical g's, tire heat, vehicle damage, engine and transmission running characteristics, shock damping amounts as well as a few other things. Later on in the game this technical information will really help out in determining how to tune your car. Tuning in Forza 2 is very close to GT4 in that the same things can be adjusted here. The difference here is when parts are adjusted it is much more noticeable, especially when combining multiple parts to be tuned. For example, when two or three parts are adjusted you get a synergistic effect. There isn't really much else to say about the tuning - a necessary part of a racing sim.Understandably the game is not perfect. First off the load times are amazingly long for a system that has four processors-probably 30 seconds on average. Along with that is the time it take just to get to a race from starting up the Xbox. It is at the very least 60 seconds if you have the car you are going to drive ready. I'd say you'd be closer to two full minutes just to get into a race. Once you reach the upper levels of the game you notice one serious downside - the tracks. What I mean is the selection of tracks really goes down from fifteen or twenty to basically five. You have Mugello, Laguna Seca, Silverstone, Suzuka and  The Nurburgring. These are all really interesting and real circuits. However, when you've raced them literally 30-40 times previously it ruins the experience. The game becomes monotonous. There are fake/synthetic tracks if you will that I find to be pretty exciting to drive including the King Cobra. The King Cobra is an amalgamation of hairpin turns, zig-zags and just downright malicious driving conditions. There must be four times the number of turns in this track as in any other track other than the Nurburgring. My belated point is for some reason the Forza programmers felt these fake tracks unfit for the professional races. Bad idea in my opinion. The only other real problem I had with the game is that there were not any F1 or open wheel cars in the game. I cannot fault them too heavily however because I imagine the rights to the other 300 vehicles were expensive enough to get. The driving conditions also never change. These faults are fairly easy to overlook if you really love racing sims however.Graphics 5/10Features 10/10Gameplay 10/10Difficulty 5/10 (on default settings)Music 5/10 just a bunch of rave musicReplay Value 7/10Overall 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2007"}

Ulreich","summary":"More of the same just new maps really....","reviewText":"This game feels EXACTLY like Modern Warfare 2 with a few less features.  Zombies is great but gets old after awhile.  As players have stated there was alot of lag last night online for multiplayer & zombies so I hope this is fixed as well but that didn't bother me because I jumped in to campaign mode.  Now as far as campaign goes this is Treyarch's best campaign yet.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the World at War's campaign because I thought it dragged a little and I loved Call of Duty 4's campaign so that could of been a factor.  But I digress in this installment it is actually better than MW2's campaign which I also liked but felt it was way to short.  Whoever said the graphics weren't as good as MW2 is a lie, its actually 10x better than MW2.  Its also the first installment in the COD franchise to include 3D, although I haven't been able to test this out because I don't have a 3D TV I can see that it would actually be a pretty cool game in 3D and I am not a big fan of 3D.  The only problem I have with this game is they seemed to have copied Halo Reach and call it there own.  Voting for maps, leveling up, character customization, and video recording all features that Halo Reach had and previous Halo games had for a long time and now its just being put into a COD game.  Also I forgot to mention split-screen online COD has only 2 player while Halo has always had 4 player split-screen and campaign coop.  Now speaking of campaign coop this is the reason I gave Black Ops 4 stars this game DOES NOT have campaign coop or even a special ops mode thats like campaign coop.  I would think with a $60 price tag they would of gave us more than just zombies as form of coop.  The campaign would of been really fun with an exta player and an arcade style campaign they had in World at War which I thought was fun.  I guess they call it single-player for a reason o well.  The multiplayer and zombies are exactly the same from previous games so if your a COD veteran you will see no difference in gameplay.  The only thing that is different is getting money from matches and buying your guns and or attachments.  So all in all this a great game and a great time killer.  If you liked previous COD games you should definitely pick this up but if you can wait it out and pick it up on sale I'd go with that route.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
