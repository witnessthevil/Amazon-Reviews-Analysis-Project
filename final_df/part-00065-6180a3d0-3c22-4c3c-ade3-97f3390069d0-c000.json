{"product_name":"B0000664JE","reviewerName":"Seppo Helava","summary":"Maybe not what you think it is","reviewText":"A lot of people are talking about DTR as though it was a Max Payne clone. Aside from the issue of \"bullet-time\", or the slow-motion diving-while-shooting, DTR and Max share virtually nothing in common. Ok, so both are stories about ex-cops out for revenge, but that's where the similarities end.Dead to Rights has a lot more built-in diversity in gameplay than Max Payne does. The character can fight unarmed, have his sidekick dog attack enemies, disarm enemies and steal their guns, and hide against walls and kill people stealthily. That's not to mention the plethora of minigames, which take most of their gameplay from the venerable Track and Field series of button-mashing to some specified parameters.DTR doesn't have half the atmosphere that Max Payne does, and that's largely due to the art direction and cinematography, rather than anything else. A lot of the cutscenes are done in-engine, and while DTR's not ugly, it's not pretty, either. Visually, it's about half-way between Halo and a Dreamcast game.The most important thing to consider, however, when trying to decide whether to purchase DTR, is that it's staggeringly difficult. The biggest problem with DTR is that the difficulty comes not from a legitimate, skill-based challenge, but from a lousy camera, and poor auto-targetting.At times, you will dive at a person with a shotgun, who is standing not far in front of you. You might be armed with a shotgun as well, so range would be an important consideration, since you'll do more damage to something closer to you. But rather than targetting the guy in front of you, where one hit would kill him, you end up targetting someone off-camera, to your left, who's behind a truck. Of course, after flying through the air like an idiot, you land at this guy's feet, where he kills you with one close-range shotgun blast.The problem with DTR is that it's so full of potential, and so full of neat ideas, and they're mired in this half-baked mess, where you can't DO any of the things that you *want* to do.It's a neat game, on paper - full of potential, full of excellent ideas. But as it stands, it's frustrating not because of a legitimate challenge, but because every couple of minutes, you'll be killed by something you couldn't possibly avoid.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2002"}

I have family members who have played and adore the original games and got me in to it, but I've never personally played one.  I picked this one up on a whim and LOVED it.  The past few years, the game market has been flooded with forgetful FPS games and even some of the once great games have turned from RPG to Action RPG to just FPS games.  What is cool about this game, it's not linear in the sense that if you lose you have to restart a mission.  At any time you can abort an attack to go back to base.  You can choose to help a country under attack.  That made me happy to have bought this game.Other stand outs are the graphics.  Whenever you attack or move, it cuts in and the aliens look so amazing in this game.  All the building you do, too is just amazing.  You're in an underground base and have to build facilities to research the aliens, train soldiers and just all around prepare yourself for the worse.  The amount you have to manage impacts the fate of the world.  This game I would compare to a chess game in the fact that if you're not 2-3 moves ahead, you're gonna fall on your face.

{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"D. Roberts","summary":"Amazing system, don't know what your missing","reviewText":"The PS3 initially got some slack due to a large price point and lack of exclusives. In reality the price point was not big compared to the XBox 360. It's kind of like comparing a stripped down car where you add tons of options (360) to a car that just comes with everything from the get go (PS3). The fact that Sony includes a hard drive and Blu-ray player in every system makes the lowest end system more expensive than the lowest end 360. What's easy to miss is that making these components optional on the 360 means:1. You can't play games on the 360 HD-DVD drive, you're limited to DVD9.2. Developers can't rely on the 360 having a hard drive which impacts performance.3. Buying a next-gen console without a hard drive is not a good idea. Many of the funnest games are downloadable and the other games often have bugs, issues or upgrades that can only be downloaded if you have a hard drive.So what are we looking at for a comparable 360? It's something in the neighborhood of $700. Figure:1. $350 for pro edition, $450 for the Elite (with the Pro you may get lucky and get one with an HDMI, not all of them have it but it's the same \"edition\", buyer beware.)2. $100 for wireless adapter.3. $179 for HD-DVD drive.4. $30 for quick charge kit5. Most likely a few bucks for rechargable batteries.Total: $659-$759 for the full 360, $499 for the 80GB PS3, and $399 for the 40GB PS3. All PS3s have Blu-ray, Hard Drives, and are equal systems. They differ in quantity of USB ports, memory card readers, hard drive size and the 40GB lacks PS2 compatibility. As you can see, $399 vs. $659 is really no comparison, the 360 is far more expensive with options included.Obviously there are some variations but that 20GB hard drive for the 360 gets used up fast and upgrading is _really_ expensive. The PS3 on the other hand accepts any laptop hard drive, has a backup/restore utility which makes keeping your downloads a sinch and is ultimately cheaper and more flexible.So what about the other issue, exclusive games? Sony has more skilled 1st party developers than any other console maker. Here's a few things for the PS3 that should get you excited:1. Ratchet & Clank - Steller reviews, could be game of the year.2. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune - Imagine Tomb Raider meets Gears of War. Incredible looking game.3. Haze - All the features of Halo with much more innovation and better graphics.4. Little Big Planet - Impossible to explain but the ultimate family experience. This could be the next \"Mario\". One thing to mention, it's open ended, physics based and supports user generated content. Next year's \"game of the year\".5. Resistance Fall of Man - Excellent FPS.6. Gran Turismo 5 - In cockpit views of all cars, incredible graphics, online with 16 racers, improved physics. Going to be big.7. Blu-ray - Winning the hi-def war by 2:1. If you don't what this is, start looking into it.8. Media capabilities - Wireless media sharing on your home nextwork. View all kinds of hi-def content, music service in the near future. Some folks even listen to sattelite radio on their PS3.9. Internet browser - May seem like no big deal but I use it all the time. It's a browser in your living room, very convient.10. Reliable - Even if your a 360 fan, what are you going to play while your 306 is in the shop. The XBox 360 has an incredible failure rate. The PS3 is the best on the market. Gamepro recently did a poll. 30% of readers didn't own a 360, 30% had no failures and 40% had it failed. Of the 40%, half had multiple failures.11. Rock Band with wireless - 360 version will ship with wired guitars.12. Unreal Tournament 3 - The 360 version will come out much later.13. Infamous - Super hero FPS game14. Heavenly Sword - Incredible graphics, sound and acting. A bit too short of a game but they may release downloadable content for it.15. Warhawk - Massively underated game. Imagine Gears of War quality graphics in an online 32 player, 3rd person shooter. Weapons, tanks, etc... but best of all are the flying Warhawks. Very addicting, lot's of fun.16. 1080P upscaling DVD player17. HDMI 1.3, first component to support the new standard.18. Better controllers including Dual Shock 3 which has both tilt sensitivity and rumble.19. Home - 3D Online community, awesome features with your own space and shared spaces.20. Super Star Dust/Everyday Shooter - The best classic dual stick shooters on consoles today. Move over geometry wars...21. Folklore - Great mystery/action game. Think of it as an adult pokimon because you fight by collecting monsters.22. Bungie's future PS3 title? Bungie (the makers of Halo 3) have split from Microsoft. Who knows what's in store.23. Most of the best 360 games are on the PC as well...24. Oh and Metal Gear Solid 4 of course, it's going to be huge.So to summarize, I've tried to make a compelling argument as to why the PS3 is a great console and a great buy. I think the 360 is also a great buy given you know exactly what you're doing. Overall however, I think the PS3 is the top console and will amaze anyone who gets one.Good luck!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2007"}

Seeing that I'm all about the Apple Iproducts I have no clue what Android even is.  From the articles I've seen on the internet it seems that this little box will download free, cheap and over all inexpensive games that you can play on your big screen HD tv set rather than on those iTablets that are inferior to the iPads.  So I guess that makes the Ouya an inherently inferior product to the current, next and previous gen games-even the Wii U.So I guess for 99 smackeroos it's quite the bargain.  Unless you download a couple games, find out they aren't worth it and then never touch the Ouya again.  And I kinda did the same thing when I bought the Wii and played some games off the internet browser on the Nintendo OS.  After that five minute diversion it was something i never did again.  So the whole idea of the Ouya being identical to that experience pretty much helped me make up my mind.Still I was rather fascinated by the 'crowd funding' nonsense that went into helping the company make this machine.  Cmon, though.  Did they really need that extra million or two they scrounged up.  They got more PR over that then the OUYA itself got at any other point.  And I guess there are people out there that have so much money to burn they'd rather donate it to some major corporation than a true artist that is on kickstarter.  to each their own.  I'm thinking of collecting all of my amazon reviews and putting them in a nice book for people to buy but seeing that i don't have the money on hand to get it going (seeing that i've blown it all on my PS4 & Games) I'ma gonna head over to Kickstarter and try my luck at the crowd funding phenomen.  I already regret never getting on twitter or Skype so before too much more of this technology passes me over&#8230;So back to my review.  What else is there to say.  The controller looks rather chincy.  But the games aren't all that demanding and it's not like many people are gonna play the OuyA all that much so does the controller even matter.  At least that's what I've read about the controller on the other reviews.  I know it may be a bit non-sensical or even a wee bit obnoxious that I write reviews on stuff I didn't buy.  But plenty of Americans don't read any news, can't begin to fathom the current state of affairs let alone Keynesian economics or basic principles of evolution and they insist on standing in line on election day to cast their ballots.  So being misinformed and over-opinionated is part and parcel in the grand experiment inherent to our democracy.  That and ever since myspace became a virtual ghost town I've lost my little niche in life.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Epic and deep in scope, but needs a bit of polish","reviewText":"It's really hard to sum up an all inclusive review on a game that is so deep and expansive with all the other reviews before it, but I'm going to give it the old college try anyway.Dragon Age: Origins can be considered a spiritual successor to some degree of the classic PC based Baldur's Gate.  Like most RPG's it is set in a medieval/fantasy realm where the land and it's kingdom have befallen to a demonic presence and it's up to you and your chosen party (you can change your group makeup throughout the game) like so many clich&eacute; games of this genre before it to bring justice to those that betrayed the fallen king, rid the realm of demons, and of course all the requisite side quests along the way.The main thing this game has going for it is of course it has been developed by BioWare.  BioWare is considered to be one of the best developers of said type of game and their track record of great games assures this to be another hit.What you can always expect in BioWare games is great writing and depth.  They really prevail in immersing the player in a well thought out world where the aspects of religion, politics, interpersonal relationships between characters and NPC's .  For those that are fans of deep RPG's, this should be right up your alley.  However, I also find that this can be a hindrance to some along with the casual player.  The story at times is almost too deep, and there are periods of time where the action is interrupted abruptly by numerous cut scenes, very expansive dialogue tree conversations, and encyclopedic like entries on discovered notes and quests.  It feels disjointed at time to be hacking and slashing one second, just to end up reading endless text passages the next that seem to drag on for lengthy periods of time.Depending on what school of gamer you are, again, the back story, quest lore, and cryptic notes that are discovered and placed in your Codex (think detailed personal journal) can get ridiculous at times.  While its great to have detail, I also believe developers need to walk a fine line in not supplying so much the player feels overwhelmed with tons of ingame texts.  There are times I feel like I am just reading and reading and reading, just to make sure I'm not missing one small clue.  One other complaint I have is that the text can seem small at times.  Even on a large 42\" TV, I feel I'm straining to read the `fine print'.Quests are the usual sort that is typical for this style of game and there are some unique twists and puzzles along the way that keep you engaged.  Boss battles do feel epic and skirmishes can be fast paced and rewarding.  On the flip side, some quests can also feel to drawn out, or multiple prerequisites and/or sub quests must be completed before the story progresses.  In one example (non-spoiler) in order to save a possessed boy as part of the main story arc, you are shunted over to a mage infested zone for a clue only to then be sent to liberate a tower for the mages.  Once at the tower, and questing through that, you must rescue your party in a whole new deep puzzle laden zone to acquire yet another item to liberate the tower.  In other words, in order to move forward in main quest `A', you must do `B', which requires you also complete `C, D, E' to get item `F'.  Before you know it, you can't even remember what `A' was to begin with.  Not all quests are like this.  There are plenty of isolated smaller quests and random encounters, but the epic ones are fairly involved and sometimes I began to wonder when does it end and I get to get back on track.Graphics are above average, but not perfect.  There are some occasional glitches where body parts disappear into others, body movement can be wooden, and lip synching is off.  There are some graphical inconsistencies as well.  You may equip a certain helm or item on your person, and depending on the cut scene or camera angle, you are wearing it one second, and not the next, only for it to reappear again later.Inventory management is `okay' but can be frustrating at times.  You have only so many slots to carry loot with the option to sell it to a merchant, augment it, or equip it.  The problem comes from the longer quests (see example above) where the ability to visit a merchant is not available for quite some time, so the player must decide what to take and what to leave behind or destroy.  I would have like the chance to sell it to a merchant, or carry more, but at times you are limited and thus you have to leave some loot behind in areas which you'll never come back to.  There is a `move to junk' option which is nice, in which you can sell everything labeled `junk' to a merchant, but in my case I had to destroy items to make room in my inventory slots to carry other stuff.  This equates to lost in game money.Character progression and leveling is well rounded and it's good to have a mix of party members, although I'd also argue that some of the `talents' one can specialize have very vague descriptions in some cases and too many options in others.  The actual manual that comes with the game is sparse on details, so you rely on in game descriptions, and sometimes you have no idea what a spell/talent does until you commit to them...and you can't undo once you've committed.  Again, because the manual can be vague (unlike the endless notes, clues, and lore) there is a fair amount of trial and error on learning how to craft, use items, and their effects within the game.  This also goes for NPC tactics you can assign and customize for each character.  Explanation and examples within the manual are virtually not existent, leaving you as the player to muddle through this on your own if you feel so inclined.  It adds a great layer of additional customization and minute controls over party actions, but figuring it out on your own can be daunting.  I suspect many will just leave the defaults as they are.EA and BioWare have done a great job in supporting and providing plenty of DLC.  As of this writing of this review, there has already been at least 1 hefty expansion available as well as other `episodic'-like content that can add additional hours, loot, spells, etc.  This is on top of a game that is already very long and deep out of its initial package.Finally combat:  I'm reviewing the game for the Xbox 360, so all your controls are handled by the controller and not a keyboard.  While the `command wheel', somewhat similar in nature to the one you use in Mass Effect, isn't always as intuitive in the heat of battle as one would like.  Using a combination of both triggers, shoulder buttons, and analog stick, you can temporarily pause the game and issue orders/behaviors for your party (or you can take control of any of them at any time).  But when battles get intense, this can be somewhat unwieldy to use.  Sometimes it's hard to determine who is doing what when there is a lot happening on the screen.  Visual effects can sometimes block your visual cues and get in the way of determining what actions are taking place....this is where I find a traditional PC keyboard and mouse more favorable.  You can still get the job done, but extra attention is needed when using a console controller.Overall, the game is very good and deep.  This is a true RPG that feels `huge' and that's without the expansions.  Spoken dialogue and stories sound very professional although feel at times not as original as they could have been.  The Xbox handles the action quite well, but close up cut scenes don't feel natural as the characters seem stiff and jerky with un-synched speech and graphical continuity gaffs.  Text is a bit small at times and the balance between fast paced action and drawn out explanations in text trees or spoken word can take some time getting used too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"FANTASY ALL-STARS","reviewText":"One of the things that makes Dragon Age: Origins (DAO) such a fun and realistic fantasy game is the fact that it actually draws a lot of its inspiration from some of the best fantasy writers.Both DAO and Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME series feature characters named Loghain, towers where magic-users go to study their craft, a Blight that threatens to destroy everything in its path, and dreamworlds where death in that world is the same as dying in the real world. Both also feature rings in the shape of a serpent eating its own tail.The Grey Wardens are reminiscent of The Night's Watch who guard The Wall in George RR Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series. The warrior and his mabari warhound storyline is also similar to Jon Stark and his dog Ghost.TOLKIEN references abound in the forms of orc-like creatures, elves, talking trees, sprawling underground cities inhabited by dwarves, and huge battles that often involve dragons.If you talk to Leliana in the camp she'll tell you a story and mention a character named Cormac. This name comes from a character by Robert E. Howard, who created CONAN.Indeed if it weren't for the inspiration of such masterful writers, the story may have been rather average. But fortunately that is not the case and it's nice to see that the developers put as much emphasis on the story as on the gameplay.The music by INON ZUR sufficiently captures the mood, making use of heavenly female chants and dire war drums.As for the gameplay, although I am no newcomer to RPGs, I have played neither Baldur's Gate nor any other Dungeons and Dragons games. There is a slight learning curve for the first few hours. Those that have played OBLIVION will find quite a few similarities in terms of inventory and quests and veterans of FINAL FANTASY 12 will find the AI Tactics to be rather straightforward. Even once you \"get\" the gameplay, you'll find that a second play-through is more than worthwhile since you can go back and pick up some things you missed the first time.The characters come across as something you would find in a typical Dungeons and Dragons novel, which is not so strange. The banter between them is great to listen to and really makes you feel like you're on a quest with friends and not a bunch of mutes.Perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the decision making. I've spent many a minute scratching my head trying to figure out what's the \"lesser of two evils\" in regards to the dilemma before me. Knowing that your actions have real, irreversible consequences really makes you stop and think about how you want your story to play out and encourages you to experiment.I really have nothing negative to say about this game, merely two-nitpickings that I hope they address in the sequel coming out in MARCH!--Although I appreciate their homage to the great fantasy writers, I would like to see a few more original beasts and locations. I've yet to see a fantasy novel or game take you to a tropical island . . . it seems that almost all fantasy primarily takes place in environments that can be found in Europe (dark forests, cold mountains, etc).--The Codex, although informative, gets cluttered way too easily.If you're looking for a worthwhile gaming investment this is about as good as it gets. I had just finished beating it once when the very next day I sat back down and gave it another spin--it's been a long time since a game has made me do that!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

If you are like me in this, or perhaps you are a gamer looking for something besides Call of Duty, I really have no idea why you won't love Battlefield 4.DISCLAIMER: Please be careful with the reviews that give this game a single star due to the server issues. EA has patched most of the problems away, and if you go on major forums like GameFAQs for this game you'll see most gamers are playing this just fine. Onto the meat...If you've never played Battlefield before and picked up this one, be prepared for a nerve-racking adrenaline rush. There are several game modes: 32 vs 32 Conquest (think King of the Hill on a massive scale; it's my favorite game mode), Rush, TDM, Domination (Smaller version of Conquest essentially), Obliteration, and more. The guns in this game play very realistically, so expect recoil, and a slew of vehicles like tanks, AA trucks, various boats, jets, and helicopters all with varying types within each category are on the battlefield depending on the game mode you desire. Whether you're an infantry-buff like me or love the feel of transporting your 'squad' (teams are divided into several squads of 5 for you to spawn in and interact with) across the game's sprawling, beautiful maps, there' something for everyone interested in this FPS-war game by DICE. Your heart will be pounding as tank shells whizz by while flying in a helicopter or you watch the skyscraper you were just at the top of crumble as you parachute down to an enemy-infested area.One of the most crucial keys to recognize is there are four classes to utilize: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Without going into too many details, each class carries a specific type of gun selection -- for instance Engineers use Carbines and smaller PDWs while a Support primarily uses LMGs -- as well as an ability like health packs and repairing tools. The overall idea is to use your abilities with your teammates in conjunction with a game mode's objective to blast your way to victory. That's right, folks: winning is just as important if not more than KDR. On top of this, the environment is destructible in almost every way, so think twice before camping lazily in that little warehouse in the corner of the map!With the basics out of the way, let me touch on the improvements many veterans may be interested in hearing about. First and foremost, the destruction... My goodness, the destruction! One thing I was immensely sad about in BF3 was the lack of destruction compared to Bad Company 2. While still not quite back to the ability of leveling everything and anything as in BC2, DICE has fortunately returned just how much you can destroy in this fourth installment. Massive structures won't be able to be damaged externally, but now you won't be disappointed with certain towers and buildings not being blown apart though they look like they should be. Engineers, you'll have a field day.Another major improvement is in the attachments for the guns (which, speaking of guns, are right on the money as they were IMO in BF3). As DICE has seen their game grow and have added in various perks and attachment options to compete with the options given in other FPS's, what would end up happening was regardless of the options gamers often ended up putting on the standard Suppressor/Silencer + Grip combo whenever possible. However, it seems DICE has really dived in deep here by having both a true pro and con with every attachment (This was done in BF3 though half-baked as mentioned before). Want to reduce your recoil on the first shot of your trigger an general muzzle climb? Well throw on an Angled Grip and a Muzzle Brake, but don't expect the MB to help out your gun's accuracy. Want to run in guns a-blazing without revealing yourself on the mini-map? A Tactical Laser light and a Suppressor will do the job, but you may end up having quite a bit of recoil. I think you get the idea; BF4 gives more meaning to attachments in a way that makes you analyze your guns more closely while appreciating your kit choices noticeably more.A definite change to the series is a feature called Battlepacks. Those who played Mass Effect 3's multiplayer will recall these from EA putting them in there, too. Essentially as you level up and rank up your weapons you will unlock these. These are 'treasure chests' that give you free camo colors, attachments, etc., once you open them. The items you get are randomized, and as you get higher in overall rank and complete advanced assignments you will unlock Silver and Gold Battlepacks which contain rarer items/attachments. To my knowledge you can't buy these with money in any way, so they are a nice incentive to keep on playing.One of the larger changes is the introduction of Commander slots in the massive Conquest mode. One player of each team fills this slot and has a bird's eye view of the map at all times. They have an array of abilities to use to assist the actual players on the ground, such as UAVs to reveal enemies, supply drops, cruise missiles, and more. A good Commander can change the tides of battle, constantly revealing enemies and alerting individual squads to a part of the map where a crucial engagement or objective is occurring. So important is this role that you have to be ranked level 10 or higher to play it, and if a Commander is doing a lackluster job their team can boot him out of the slot. What's neat is if you have a tablet, you can go on the BF4 Commander app and join a game for the sole purpose of playing Commander. You don't even have to have the game on at home; play this wherever you have a good connection. Multitaskers and RTS fans will really enjoy this.Other than these improvements, the game just overall feels more smooth and tight than before However, I'd guess that 1080p and 60fps would do that, as well as just the overall nuts and bolts of improved audio and different alerts/noises. This game looks so much better on PS4 than it did on my Xbox 360, and it's insane how the game keeps up its smoothness when in those 32 vs 32 matches. As usual, DICE has really killed it with the maps, and if you're a fan of Rush you'll really like the sequences that completely change some maps as Attackers destroy the consecutive A and B points. Paracel Storm is crazy!What I highly recommend you to NOT do is buy this game for Single Player. This is a Multiplayer game to the point that it surprises me DICE doesn't just do away with SP. It' snot that the campaign is horrible, just don't expect the level of plot and character development you could find in a shooter like Killzone instead (not to mention its lack of longevity). I'm serious, though; if you don't play Multiplayer you are wasting $60.TL;DR - this game is even more epic than its predecessors with better attachments, destruction, and added features not previous in past installments. The game looks amazing as expected. But PC players migrating to console may not be quite as excited.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0007D4MVS","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"A must-have for DS owners","reviewText":"This is the first must-have game for Nintendo's new handheld. With great implementation of the DS' unique features, fun-for-anyone gameplay, and quirky tone, this will please both the masses and the diehards.The hook here, obviously, is the touch screen. Let me tell you, using a stylus is just as intuitive as using a button interface. Everything is incredibly responsive; I can't think of a single time when I had to tap or rub repeatedly to get the game to react.There are a respectable number of characters in the game, each with his or her own control mechanic. To complete the game, you must finish a set of each character's \"microgames\" (think minigames, only they last around 5 seconds each). For example, there's a character for \"slicing\", one for \"scribbling\", and another for \"dragging\", among others. This variety keeps the game fresh, and always makes you excited to play as a new person.The microgames themselves are extremely well-designed. Although you are thrown straight into them, with no explanation or instructions, it's a cinch to figure out your objective and complete it within the time limit. You'll find yourself doing things as diverse as scribbling ketchup onto hot dogs, chopping carrots, or scratching backs. Lots of the games are funny, too. I should also mention that each game has three levels of difficulty, which adds more variety.Maybe what I like best about this game, beyond the great gameplay, is the extraordinary amount of content. Sure, the \"main\" game can be finished quickly, but there's a boatload of things to do after viewing the credits. By earning high scores, you can earn tons of extra prizes. These prizes are really great and unique; you can unlock everything from a playable piano to a two-player ping-pong game.This game has convinced me that the DS has real potential. It's a joy to play, it'll keep you entertained for hours, and it's full of little surprises that'll make you smile. If you have a DS, run out and play this now--I can guarantee that it'll make you leap up and exclaim, \"Touching IS good!!\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2005"}

More like complaining opponents.","reviewText":"After playing this game, and the single player campaign before even touching multiplayer, I realized something: The story is great!I don't understand why people say the story is horrible/badly done, it's good!It is short, but it's a continuation of Modern Warfare 1.Well the storyline itself is hard to follow, cliche, duh-hes-a-traitor, and even duh-hes-a-traitor-but-who-even-is-he?And you don't really care to try and follow it either, except for key points in the story.But the gameplay and action of the single player campaign are superb.\"\"\"Single player Campaign is 1 Player.\"\"\"SpecOps mode: This mode is good, it's just a lot of mini-missions that involve you doing specific things, like Kill 40 Enemies, Kill 15 Juggernaughts (Bosses, hard I might add,) and etc.\"\"\"This mode can be played with Offline(Spitscreen) Co-Op, and Online Co-Op.\"\"\"Multiplayer: Multiplayer is a blast! I had my doubts about weather or not controls would be hard seeing as I came from PC Modern Warfare, but the controls are terrific, I had not one problem.\"\"\"This mode can be played Offline (Splitscreen) or online\"\"\"Since other reviews mainly talk about Multiplayer, I'm deciding to just talk about the bad things of multiplayer.For instance: The Players. The people that play this game will whine like their mommas told them too.If you keep killing the same person over and over, it's almost as if they take it personal, and only come after you.And if they have a Microphone, it's even worse; they'll call you every name in the book, insulting you left and right.Luckily, you can mute whomever you wish too at any time, just press Select, which brings up all of the players' scores, and then go up or down and press X on who you want to mute, and viola, done.An Example of the rudeness that I've come across directed torwards me was this, although I can't remember what words he used, they were insulting: I killed this one guy over and over (Not in purpose, he just kept coming around) with a Riot Shield, and he then started calling me names, etc etc...I killed him again, and then he said something like you punk I'm going to get you back just wait.I saw him again, I hit him with the riot shield once (It takes 2 hits to kill in Multiplayer, unless its in Hardcore) and then I threw a Throwing Knife at him. The amount of happiness I felt when I did that, a thought inside me said \" That's what he gets, why is he taking this so personal? 'To me its fine, because I'm at a mental level to not care at all about these people.But in a way it isn't fine because deep down there is still anger boiling inside me,this is the reason I stopped playing the first Modern Warfare, because all of the people calling you noobs and thinking their better-than.Sadly, on here, people with Mics still call you noob...weather it's Noob-Tube(Using a grenade launcher thats attached to a weapon)or just an unfriendly insult that revolves around the word Noob.I hate this, although I can mute them, and I do, I still just don't like playing with these people.And with my so-so internet connection (2, 3 signal bars in-game) it makes searching for another game a pain.Which brings me to my next complaint: The sucky-suck-suck Server Search.For some odd reason, you can't search for a specific server...Do you feel like playing Search in Destroy in The Favela? Oh well.The only thing you can specifically search for is what mode, so it's going to be a random map everytime, you just have toleave the game, search again, if you don't get a map you want, do it all again.But back to my so-so signal and what problems this brings to server searching.I'm fine with leaving a game and searching again to find another map that I don't deeply despise, but one thing I'm not fine with isthe fact that it searches for a game that's near my Ping.Meaning that it starts with a 70 (Or something) ping server search, it searches, it searches.Now, since my connection isn't 70, it's going to search for a game that's 80 ping to see if I can connect to that.All the while, the game should know your Ping before it even starts up, instead of just skipping directly to a 150 ping server search, it starts all the way from the bottom, meaning I have to keep waiting and waiting until it finally gets a server at 150.And oh yea, you can create your own server, but guess what!The only server you can create is a Private Server, a private server is a server that people can only get in through invite.And apart from that, you don't get points, experience, or rewards!!!! Isn't that great?!And you can't create a public server either, they just have servers already there, and all you have to do is search for them, and other people will join the game as well.So apart from the ridiculous server searching, revenge-hungry players, and high insult probability, I'm fine with this game.I know that the players shouldn't deter me from giving this game 5 stars, but it does.Though the feature to mute them, and leave is there, I still don't feel like having to do this every time I kill someone that's overly, and emotionally attached to the game!I would even give this 3 stars if I had to think about the players again! But no, 4 stars is low enough.This game is worth it though, so maybe if you have a better ping, and can leave and join a game in seconds, your experience will be better. But if not, well you're in for server searches that last up to a minute or two, and insult-throwing, revenge hungry, overly attached players.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The games that are made by Nintendo are great. Such titles as Metroid Prime 2 and certainly the Zelda series are what give the Gamecube variety in it's games. The PS2 has games that have the same story, in a way. (For instance: Rachet&Clank;, Jak&Daxter.;) Also, most of the PS2 and Xbox games that are made only for that certain console are side games, not the ones that have an original storyline, and are engageing to play. The graphics are as good as or better than the Xbox or the PS2. In addition, the speed is much faster than that of the other two. It takes at average to load a game, about two seconds; at max, about ten seconds. You would think that with the $200 price tag on the Xbox and the PS2 would make it a fast console. (It takes, what, three minutes to load a game with the Xbox?)The PS2 has bad Playstation-only games. The only good and popular game only for Xbox is the Halo series. On the Nintendo Gamecube, you have Nintendo-only games that are engageing, fun, and worth buying. (For Example:Super Smash Bros. Melee) Most good games, like Grand Theft Auto, or Need for Speed, are on all of the consoles. Another plus, it is the least expensive of the three.)Look at AMAZONs average rating(as of 8-11-05 and has been like this for a while).The Xbox--------avg customer rating = 4 starsThe PS2---------avg customer rating = 4 starsThe Gamecube---avg customer rating = 4 and a half stars.KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Natacon \"Natacon\"","summary":"From someone who didn't care for RPGs","reviewText":"First off, I'll admit that I'm not a fan of RPGs.

I must say, after all the hype, I expected the game to be as flawless as, say, God of War 3, and for the most part it was.  I found the controls to be sometimes too sensitive in terms of angles (maybe because I was accustomed to God of War 3's third person gameplay where the character remained mostly in the middle while everything else moved).  Looking over Batman's right shoulder is a bit odd because I had to constantly adjust to make sure I could see what was ahead of him directly and whatnot.  Eventually, I got a headache my first time playing the game before I adjusted.  Maybe others don't have this issue and maybe I'm just really sensitive, but for me this affected how I played the game and for how long because I was getting such a headache.  The voices are amazing, being they're from those used in the Batman Animated Series, and overall the concept is extremely intuitive - Joker plays one on Batman and Batman gets trapped in the place where he puts his worst enemies.  Great idea!  Batman: Arkham Asylum is indeed the best Batman game on console, but with some minor improvements it could've been better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2010"}

I have played the online campaign missions for approx 10-12 hours I finished the resistance campaign and half the other campaign, I have played both co-op and competitive.This game has lag and before I get ahh you have a bad connection blah blah blah, I have 5-10 Mbps wired connection if thats not good enough to play a game than its broken. Also people who deny lag do you think a review site like Gamespot would have put it in their review if it wasn't there what is their connection bad as well. Now with all that said I do think they will patch the lag prob at some point. But even without lag game isn't that funIn terms of class based shooters I've played recently this game does even come close to touching KZ3 or BC2Parkour is clunky and not executed well Crysis 2 did it way better, better slide and jumping and grabbing ledges only diff is being able to slide over boxes and stuff which doesn't feel cool at all in brink.Shooting seems inaccurate and the guns even though many choices seem very similar.They had some good ideas with this game I really like the revive system it stops someone from revive you in the middle of a fire fight and getting killed again right away I hate that in KZ and BC2 . It puts the revive in your hands. I like the art style and menus all very nice looking.I liked plenty of games that got less than stellar review scores from mainstream review sites Socom 4, Army of Two, Alien Vs Predator. I had fun with all those games despite some problems. I like to make up my own mind about games and this one isnt very good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002NIP2SM","reviewerName":"HitRaj 47","summary":"It's Okay, but not that fun","reviewText":"There are a lot of people who bought this game simply because it had dedicated servers and quite frankly that doesn't make up for what a mediocre game this really is. For a start, like most games the singleplayer is short, but there is nothing new in it. It steals things from other games, especially Modern Warefare 2 and tries to poke fun at it. I'm not a CoD fanboy I swear, the CoD series have some of the most awful storylines in any games (except Cod 1 & 2, simply because they were based on real battles), but to copy things from a bad game, what does that say about Bad Company? The only thing that would make me enjoy the singleplayer would be a co op mode, but unfortunately no such mode exists.Furthermore, there won't be a MOD that allows it either because, in their infinite wisdom, DICE decided to not release an SDK, so there won't be any chance of community created content. That's a real shame, because that's what made the original Battlefield 1942 last so long. It was the spawn for games like Battlefield 2, thanks to the Desert Combat MOD. There were also some great maps and MODS that extended the game even further, but no such thing exists with Bad Company 2. This game will barely last a year for FPS fans and the only reason people keep playing it is because either, they can't afford a new game or they are just fans of the series.The game has nothing to keep any other gamer interested. The weapons feel like crap and sound awful. They don't have enough recoil and are incredible weak. I unlocked the last sniper rifle, added the perk that gives you extra damage and still, a shot to the chest in non-hardcore mode isn't enough to kill someone. It's pathetic.The multiplayer maps are quite big and vehicles are a pleasure to use. Unfortunately it lacks variety in the vehicle department. If they had worked on this more, it could have been a game changer. Even the Desert Combat MOD and Battlefield 2 had more vehicles to play with.As with every other DICE game, the spawn system is broken. Spawn camping is a huge problem on every map and gametype and it can get incredibly frustrating. Imagine not being able to do anything, because each time you spawn, there a tank in your base blowing you and your team mates up.For the most part, the graphics are good, except for the fog. The levels are too bright and the fog and dust are more annoying than anything. There are times where you are completely blinded because of it and it's quite annoying.The game has a leveling system like most FPS games these days. Unfortunately it's nowhere near as polished as Modern Warfare 2's system. I think there are about 50 levels to go through. I was about a level 20 something when I had unlocked ALL the items and weapons in the game. I honestly didn't see any point in playing the game after this point.Since weapons and shooting aren't the strong points of this first person \"shooter\", the game emphasizes a lot of team work. Running around like a fool, like a CoD player will get you killed. You need the help of your team mates to give you health, ammo and repair vehicles if you want to succeed in a multiplayer game. In fact, the friends that I play with game with, that actually like it, aren't normally good at shooters. It seems that driving the vehicles, dropping health and ammo packs seem to be their strongest ability and is the best way to earn points.Overall, unless you are a fan of the series you may as well skip over this one. Actually it's not even as good as any of the previous Battlefield games. I'd save your money for something else. 4/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

Stoffer","summary":"Battlefield: Best Company","reviewText":"My Advice & Opinion: If you already have the Call of Duty games and want another 1st person shooter with a modern war theme GET THIS!!!PROS:-First off, the storyline is better than most first-person shooters. There is character developement, plot twists, and actually a fair amount of good humor.-The gameplay is very identical to Modern Warfare 1 & 2. There is a mass amount of different weapons, although you can only carry two at a time, and plenty of explosives like grenade launchers, C4, rocket launchers, throughout the game.-A unique aspect about this game is that you can mow down trees and destroy the walls of most buildings. Most effectively by the use of a tank or grenades. This makes it so that you can destroy cover or camo for enemies, especially when you're playing online.-Most significant aspect abbout this game is its very underrated multiplayer, Capture The Flag & Gold Rush, compares to that Halo 3 & Call of Duty 4. In fact, I enjoyed playing online almost more than the actual single player.-There aren't even ten missions in the game, but each is very long, challenging, full of variety, and fun. So there is definitly compensation.-You can also give commands to your comrades which is a lot like GRAW.-You can drive all sorts of awesome vehicles like tanks, boats, helicopters, planes, and even golf carts. The controls are slightly, slightly clunky, but if you've played Frontlines: Fuels of War you won't even notice.CONS:-Unlike games nowadays where you heal by waiting in the corner for ten seconds, in this game you must inject yourself with a shot that you carry around throughout the game. After that, you have to either wait for the shot to restore or find a medipack which isn't absurdly common to find. It's not a horrible healing system, but I'm used to the wait in cover for ten seconds to heal tactic.-No free for all or team deathmatch online, not as big of a deal as I thought it would be, but it would've been nice to have.-Still takes a backseat to the Cod games, well, arguably better than World at War.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2009"}

It is a bit more heavy and bulky than a PS3 controller, just like an Xbox controller is. It is all personal preference in which controller type you like. It looks good as far as color scheme and is a good replica of an Xbox controller design in regards to size and shape. The usb cord for charging is short, so if you want to play while charging, you will need to buy a longer cord. There's no Bluetooth, so you have to use a dongle. There's also no six axis support, which is just as much of a bummer. Offset joysticks and buttons being a little crammed can be an annoyance, especially if you have large hands/fingers.

{"product_name":"B000099T2G","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Lacks Excitement","reviewText":"\"Jet Li: Rise to Honor\" is a third person brawling and shooting game. In the game, the player takes the role of Jet Li - or rather, a character virtually portrayed by him.The story is a fairly simple, revolving around Chinese gangs and criminal elements. Jet Li - or the player - is Kit Yun, a bodyguard responsible for protecting Boss Chiang, who is attempting to leave his life of crime behind. Most of the story involves beating up other gang members who are trying to kill Chiang or, later, his daughter, and the story serves mostly as an excuse for this violence.The gameplay is simple compared to many other brawler games: aside from guarding and area-specific actions, fighting occurs by pushing (\"slapping\", in the game's words) the right control stick in the direction that you want to attack. This allows for multidirectional attacking in the game's many multi-opponent fights. This simplifies combat almost to the point where it's not fun anymore; the only other action is \"adrenaline attacks\", which is basically slow motion or bullet time. Gun battles work roughly the same way, except the control stick is used to target and the R2 button is used to shoot. Apart from some neat interactive features, like kicking people into equipment or onto hot stoves, there isn't a lot of gameplay variety.The graphics are decent, but not good. Faces are reasonably good, but also tend to be blocky. The textures range from mediocre to poor, with too much blur and not enough detail. The action, despite some neat slow-motion moments, is generally lackluster as well. The sound is for the most part forgettable and consists mainly of yelling in Chinese.\"Mediocre\" describes this game fairly well. At most parts, it simply drags as you are forced to fight yet another wave of hooded thugs, and it lacks excitement and panache.4/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Black Cat de La Bear \"see that dark shape o'r...","summary":"3E is a must for every game","reviewText":"First of all, this game is not about clicking your mouse button rapidly and whacking guys with your lightsaber it is a bit smarter.  If you don't know the D&D; 3e then don't bother playing it, you won't fully appreciate how fun it is and you won't get in to your character's full potential.  Secondly the abilities to master in this game are Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom.  It is about being a Jedi and these skills are the most usefull for a jedi.  Strength(for effective Lightsaber use) Dex(for physical Jedi moves) and Wis(for force powers).  You cannot be a good jedi by developing your Charisma or intelligence because having something witty to say don't mean squat to gangs and other misfits.  Feats.  Feats are the most important aspect.  Become focused in both melee and small guns(a bit of dual wielding won't hurt either)no matter what class you pick.  Persuade is next to useless(in my experience) because you can usualy get other non-skilled dialogue choices and get the same results. It does help you buy stuff(except on Taris).  Being a scoundrel will not give you much jedi potential and it is mostly useless(even the dark-side).  I found that a Scout with all Scout talent + a bit of strenght - 1 lick of charm and intel, a few mechanical skills(gotta repair that droid/ship you know) and a few wheapon feats is the best class.Space travel is all too easy.  In fact if your looking for a space-sim/adventure hybrid you won't find it here(you won't find it anywhere in fact.)  You can't go back to the planet you just left. Ever.  It is NOT like Morrowind at all because of this.  Also you forfiet all of our equipment(you paid for with hard earned cash!) I guess spaceships of 4000 years before Impire(BI) didn't have storage decks. ;}The storyline is much better than most Forgotten Realms games and it is Sci-fi which is a new twist.  The graphics are great on an ATI(with a patch).  (...) I hate the whiny whaley generation Y-type \"woo as me I can't find a dance partner\" characters in this game.

The first lego game I ever played was the new Pirates one and I guess that set the standard and I enjoyed it so much that I bought Lego Indiana Jones and I thought it was equally well done.The Lego Star Wars Complete saga just isn't working as well for me. Sure it has all of the trademarks of Lego gameplay; the central hub, the collection, the hidden areas, the interesting characters and so on. But it's far too frustrating to be fun. Now to be fair I've just completed Revenge of the Sith and I'm going through A New Hope so maybe it gets better in the latter half. The first three SW movies were vile though and that awfulness has seemingly managed to seep into this game with far too many silly flying levels, where controlling your ship is laughable, to never-ending spawning storm troopers. There's no levels where you can relax and explore, take time to solve puzzles or build lego objects. In fact building items is so rare few in the first three movies that I'd forgotten you could do it. Plus each chapter seems to be a boss battle. Every time a new character appeared in the game you have to fight him. It just didn't gel with me and I wanted each level to end, especially the dodgy vehicle levels, and that's not good I'm afraid.I've read that this is basically a revamp of the original Xbox game and I guess that may explain it as perhaps Traveler's Tales were finding their feet with the forumla. It doesn't excuse it though and I doubt 100% completion will be on my radar for this one. Mediocre.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A joyous celebration of all things gaming, a masterpiece of unabashedly hilarious, whimsical FUN","reviewText":"I'll start this review with some full disclosure: This review is long and gushing, but please, allow me to indulge my heartfelt desire to give this game the praise it deserves. Rayman Origins is, hands down, one of the biggest surprises in high quality gaming excellence I have seen in my life (much of which I have spent playing games), and definitely the biggest surprise this year. This game is special, and for so many reasons too. I've been a huge fan of Rayman for 15 years now, sincehis first outing on the original Playstation, to hisstellar masterpiece Rayman 2and beyond. For the past few years, however, Rayman has been on life support, barely eking out an existence throughhideously lazy rereleases/ports of past glories, andas an afterthought inclusion with spotlight stealing Rabbids. Now though, the hero of light is back, this time with friends(!), by going way back to the beginning, and what a ride it is!The story in Rayman Origin is as silly, perhaps even more, as we've ever seen from the series! You see, Rayman and his friends tend to make a lot of noise when they nap and laze around, to the point of creating snooze symphonies. This proves to be really bothersome to the old grannie who is boss of the land of the livid dead, a dark and dreary realm near the glade of dreams. Finally she has enough of her noisy neighbors and launches a full scale \"darktoon\" invasion of Rayman's homeland, and Rayman & co. are more than happy to oblige her desire to duke it out! Hence starts Rayman Origins' platforming euphoria.First off, the art design in this game is outstanding. The environments are beautifully, fantastically dreamlike. Some places are majestic to the point of being downright breathtaking. Rayman has always been a series characterized by whimsy, goofiness, and imagination that is gorgeous and this game does not disappoint in the least. The character models and animation are equally charming. Watching it all reminded me so much of classical cartoon animation that feels fluid and spontaneously fun, playful, and adventurous. It also hearkens back to a time when animation followed a very important rule: the drawings must be funny. Yes, eyes pop out from the head, faces completely contort when characters are injured, enemies turn into big bubbles when defeated (and eventually pop like over-inflated whoopy cushions), the charm here is off the charts, and wholly appropriate for any age. This game is both beautiful and so very endearing, and the art design helps that immensely. I'll never get over seeing a tiny mosquito carrying the big, fat Globox who is the pellet shooter instead of the mosquito, or him flapping his arms like a chicken to stay afloat. Hilarious. Rayman and the teensies, as well as all of the supporting, non-playable characters (the nymph fairies especially, lol) are equally silly and joyous to behold.The sound design cannot go unmentioned either. The music is both whimsical and eclectic, while still adding in that laugh-inducing humor. Little \"Alvin and the chipmunk\" voices lend their singing talent to the background music, and it is so very funny. You'll find little touches like these all over the game, and it's awesome. When characters speak, they speak in that immediately recognizable pig latinish \"Rayman gibberish.\" As with the art design, humor is everywhere in the audio as well, be in it music or sound effects.I'd say the most surprising thing about this game is how incredibly solid the platforming is. Theoriginal 2-D Raymanhad a lot of charm, but the gameplay was definitely the aspect most lacking, but here? This is undoubtedly the best gameplay of any Rayman game. Rayman and his friends learn new abilities as you progress, at a perfect pace I might add, and each of these abilities adds so much dimension to the traditional run-n-jump 2-D platforming genre. The control mechanics are really tight, as good as any 2-D platformer starring achubby Italian plumberor afamous hairy ape with a necktie, and that is high praise indeed. You'll also be breaking cages to free the poor electoons and nymphs from captivity to progress through the various worlds you visit. The level layouts are outstanding, and playing this game just feels really good. It's also deliciously challenging in parts, but not to the point where it angers or frustrates you beyond the limit. Check points are frequent and there is an unlimited amount of lives to burn through (or \"bubbalize,\" to be more accurate), and that also alleviates a lot of frustration you feel from dying a lot. Plus, even when the game is very difficult, it's so smile-inducing you won't care about dying for the tenth time trying to get past a tough spot. It's one thing for a game to be entertaining, but at the end of the day, if the gameplay isn't good, the whimsy and imagination matters very little. Thankfully Rayman is worth its weight in gold, and then some.I also have to add that the co-op in this game is exceptional. Its silly craziness definitely compliments everything else in the game. My wife and I have had an absolute blast playing this together, and any game that my wife and I bond over gets extra points in my book. I can't even imagine how fun and crazy 4-player co-op would be! The ability to choose who you want to play as is a nice touch too, as there are tons of unlockable skins and characters in this game as you progress.One more thing I must touch on is the value. Most games like this get the condescending remark, \"should've been a downloadable title.\" Well, I can honestly tell you that this game is HUGE. I played quite a bit and figured I was nearing the end of the game, fairly satisfied with the length. Then, I found out that I was only HALFWAY through the game, with much, much more challenging levels awaiting me in the second half. When you consider there are major incentives to come back and see it all for completionists, this game is well worth the money it costs.As a series, the Rayman games have always been known for their whimsical imagination, beautiful art design, silly stories, lovely humor, and an overall saturation of pleasant FUN. Rayman Origins has all of these in spades and much, much more. I think I may have found my new favorite Rayman game here, and to take Rayman 2's place in that way is no small feat to me. I don't think there's anyone on earth with a working, functional heart that won't have it captivated in some capacity by this game. It is one of the best games of the year. In every way and at all times, this game always focuses on you having fun, and it succeeds in that endeavor. Rayman Origins isn't just the triumphant return of one of video gaming's most beloved characters, it is a celebration of the very spirit of gaming and as such, it is everything a video game should be. Buy this game, have fun, and get lost in the joyous experience Rayman Origins has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000MUW98O","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Change - Not Always for the Best","reviewText":"I really wanted to like Burnout: Paradise. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is fantastic with a few exceptions -- Avril Lavigne? -- and online play is integrated well. It's obvious that the developer was going for a seamless play experience - load times are pretty much non-existent. However, the cost in implementing this system is that simple commands like retrying a race or swapping cars is gone. Annoyingly after losing a race you'll find yourself having to either move on or trudge back to the start of that particular event. Another problem is that many of the events require a specific car or a specific class, here again you'll have to find a junk yard and swap out your car. I also noticed while playing that all of the events conclude at one of eight predetermined points and while you're free to choose a path of your liking there are realistically only so many optimal routes to race. Unfortunately with the `sandbox' environment you'll find yourself relying on maps a lot. The game has a great map - but you have to pause the action and go to a different screen to use it. The mini-map that you get while driving is essentially useless as you only see a small portion of the total map. I found that I'd usually start a race only to immediately pause the game and study the map for a route. Then along the way I'd pause a few more times to stay on track. Annoying. Winning cars in Paradise is actually pretty cool - many times you first have to find a rival and `take them out' in order to win their car. What's unexplainable is why the developer chose to give you a damaged car that has to be immediately repaired after selecting it. Get used to driving to the repair shop often. All in all Burnout: Paradise could've been the pinnacle of the series, as it stands poor choices by the developer in a few areas keeps the game from being great. Ultimately the game is enjoyable, especially for anyone new to Burnout, for veterans the shortcomings will be all to obvious.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2008"}

So, let's address a few of the obvious points that make a game worth the effort or not. When I say MoHA is a grind, I might be putting it lightly. Soldiers, as the game wears on, will take more damage than a tank. It really becomes a chore to have to slog through these super Nazis and a bit too unrealistic. It was tough to get through CoD on Veteran difficulty, but even on Casual, in MoHA, it doesn't seem challenging, just more like the game is cheating to make it harder. I never felt that way in CoD 2 or 4 (3 doesn't count) and never got so annoyed I just didn't care to play any more, which happened a lot as MoHA wore on. The gameplay is just not that compelling or immersive.The graphics are servicable for a current generation shooter and there are no superlative aspects that stick out in my mind. I noticed a lot of shiny objects that shouldn't have been. That's the only thing that sticks out in my mind if you're interested in a negative.The missions were ok in that the layout was open so you could approach most missions in any order seen fit. There was an awkward element to this though, in that most of the time, after dieing, the character would be jumping out of the plane again to parachute back down onto the playing field where all of the prior completed objectives would still be cleared. This only plays into the fact that the parachuting aspect of the game is a gimmick, the only value of which, are the Skill Jump achievements. It's not a really exciting mechanic, so the fact that the player might jump out of the plane 20 times (for each time you happen to die) makes it less realistic and more of a chore (load times and real time adding to the grind) than it is fun.The peak and lean mechanic, where the player can mover around in cover, is a really nice feature as is the weapon upgrade experience feature (weapons become more efficient and improved as they are used more). These would be nice additions to other games but, as a whole, don't really help make the act of playing Medal of Honor Airborne better enough to make it a good game. The overall gameplay keeps that from happening.In the end, Medal of Honor Airborne is a perfectly average game. It works. It doesn't look terrible. There are a few good things about it. It's really not that memorable. While I will remember CoD 2 & 4 as all time greats, MoHA will fade along with most other gaming experiences I'd just as soon forget. And the also ran parade marches on...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2008"}

The game to me looked like a strange and kiddy little title, so I did not pay it much thought. However, my brother picked it up a few months later, and I decided to give it a go one night. Since I knew this was a simulation I grabbed a drink, and got ready to be sucked in. I sat through the introduction which was a 10 minute discussion with a cat named \"Rover.\" After wading through the text, I got to town, and I was impressed. To begin, Animal Crossing is a simulation unlike any other, and while isn't for everyone, it still provides a unique experience.The graphics of this game are unfortunately the low point of the game. The sprites are cute, and the backgrounds blend well with this style of gameplay, but they just don't take advantage of the Gamecube's graphical processing. I still think the graphics of this game could still be done on the 64. Don't let this aspect get you down though, just like Harvest Moon graphics are not what matters, it is the gameplay. Going a little more into character models, I did find the expressionism, and emotions of the characters very light hearted and funny. If a character is sad, he/she will frown and there will be a rain cloud above their head. If you make them happy they will laugh and little \"Ha Ha Ha\" symbols will circle around their head. So, basically don't expect ground breaking graphics, but the funny character sprites, and light hearted graphics won't disappoint either. It is actually the low focus on graphics, that make the gameplay flow much better.The sound and musical portion of the game is one of my favorites by far. Now when a character speaks they will mumble really fast, as the text displays what they are really saying. I am supposing that what they are saying is a high speed dubbing. I believe this was done for a reason, just to make the characters sound cute. The translation of the voices and text are done well, and are top in their category. The sound effects of the game themselves are good. Such, as shoveling, chopping wood, clanking metal, and throwing things in the pond. Each sound is done well respective to the action it represents, and allows the game to flow even better. Now comes to the musical aspect. Now, besides some chimes and the town song that pop in here and there when you enter a certain area or talk to someone, there isn't much music to talk about. However, later in the game you will meet a character that will play songs for you on his guitar, and you can even get a stereo to play his songs. I won't spoil who he is though, you will have to find him yourself.Now, in Animal Crossing you control a little horn-helmeted boy, and your job is to settle into a new town, and more. When you enter the game you are basically broke, and cannot buy a house in this new town. However, a racoon named Tom Nook says he has a shop in town, and if you work for him, he can help you get started with your payment. So, you are wondering, I have a house...now what? Well, what I love about simulations is the fact they are so linear. While you do have some objectives like paying off your house, and your job, you can still do so much more. Go around and make friends with the town folk and do errands for them. Go fishing in the town and catch fish to earn money. Use your shovel to dig for money, kick a ball around, or furnish your home.The game is also very interactive. Unlike Harvest Moon and The Sims, this game does not have a constantly moving time frame. This game has a real time clock, that means that if its September 4th, 2003 at 10:00 PM in reality, that is the time in the game. While that may be cool at times, it is more of a problem than a good thing. Say you only have time to get on at night, you go to the village to do errands for people, only to find out they are all asleep. If you have to meet somewhere in the game at a certain time, you have to do it at that time in reality. Which basically means you have to have a lot of free time to play this game. With that out of the way, there are some positives about this time clock. Holidays and special events like Christmas and Halloween all occur on their respective dates. That way you will be able to do all the special events of the game without forgetting the day you can play them. The slow moving clock will also allow you to do everything you want and more, without running out of time.All in all, this game is truly a great game, and one of the top gems on the Gamecube system. Again, if you loved the Harvest Moon series, The Sims, Stick RPG, or any other special life simulation than be sure to put this game on your Christmas list. Those that get bored quickly, or never liked simulations, probably won't like this game, but I urge you to at least give it a try. With the connectivity of the Game Boy Advance and E-Reader, the addition of NES games, and the huge amount of things to do will offer easily a minimum of 50 hours of solid gameplay. Whether you like these kinds of games or not be sure to pick this one up, it is a unique experience everyone should give a go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2003"}

Successfully completing a certain number of rhythms in a row will result in frenzy mode which makes the little guys attacks much faster.  This game even comes with a great story line that is pretty easy to follow.While fighting you'll even be able to pickup upgrades which will apply to certain warriors to help you progress in the game like armor, weapons new drums, food and materials for crafting new warriors.

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"Like watching a childhood hero succumb to vice","reviewText":"****November 2011 Addendum****The game is fun overall.  Multiplayer is a fun experience, even despite the repetitive nature of it.  I had previously complained that the game was so unbalanced, they had to remove dozens of units from the multiplayer experience.  Even with them out, multiplayer is still GROSSLY unbalanced.  Units like the Thor and the Void Ray are ridiculously overpowered compared to virtually every other unit, and they have no real counter; the Zerg have no counter for them---Hydralisks are inexplicably weak against Void Rays, Mutalisks are killed far too easily, and Thors have a hidden splash attack with their Anti-Air missiles, which does double damage to light units (ie, mutalisks).  This attack is to Void Rays and Mutalisks what fire is to rice paper.There is no unit balance as Starcraft had; it's become an arms race; first person to spam Thors or Void Rays wins.*****And to think the biggest worry I had upon seeing screenshots early on was that the buildings and units looked so bloated, fat, and cartoony.  In fact they do seem rather bloated and cartoony compared to their Starcraft counterparts, but it's not nearly as horrendous as I'd initially thought it out to be.To get the easy stuff out of the way: If you care not for the story and only for the gameplay, then 3 stars out of 5 is a fair rating.I don't know why Starcraft was so innovative a game as it was.  It simply looked different, smooth and was extremely well-balanced.  It was a slick game with easily identifiable units on the field with easily identifiable sounds, weapons, and controls and interface.  It was an innovation and improvement over the engine used in Warcraft II.Here, there is none.  They claimed to have completely re-made the engine from scratch, but you could copy and paste the UI onto Command & Conquer 3 or Command & Conquer 4 and it would look pretty much the same.  It's not at all a bad thing, but it's not really a good thing either if you're looking to play this as a new game.  It essentially feels like C&C3; with cartoonier units.The game mechanics that went into making Starcraft so incredibly balanced will have to be re-discovered here, as new units are frequent in coming, old units have stats changed, and units like the Medic become essential for infantry squads, as they auto-heal when you move or attack-move them with a group, rather than wandering out up into an enemy because you'd need to micro-manage them directly.Initially I'd have considered the Protoss terribly, horribly, atrociously overpowered due to weapons like the Colossus and the Void Ray, but later missions showed that there was more to come for Zerg and Terran to even the odds.  This, however, says very very little for traditional defensive units like the Photon Cannon, Bunkers, and units like the Zealot.  You may as well not even make them anymore, unless you plan on massing them in gargantuan numbers, as they contribute next to nothing within huge armies, whereas in Starcraft, the melee abilities of a Zealot made it essential under a Defiler's swarm ability, or for fast attacks.But the absolute bane of this entry of the franchise is undoubtedly the writing.Virtually everything Jim Raynor or Tychus Findlay or Matt Horner says can be found in one line or another from any other movie, TV show, or video game.  There's almost nothing anyone says that isn't cliche', stupid, poorly delivered, or so bland and generic you can skip it and miss out on nothing.Remember Arcturus Mengsk.  Remember Mengsk of Korhal, and how the Confederacy nuked Korhal into an uninhabitable wasteland.  Remember how Mengsk fought and bled and suffered to fight them, with his rebel group the Sons of Korhal.  He was a character so morally ambiguous that he would suffer in order to help civilians, and then out of utter rage and vengeance, use psi emitters to obliterate entire Confederate planets, drawing billions of Zerg onto Antigua Prime and Tarsonis.He wanted to (and successfully did) end the war and end the Confederacy, and not end up spending decades fighting hard guerrilla war with the Confederate remnants.  He mad a bad decision, it was the wrong one, but he made it, and he was going to live with it.  He was like Joseph Stalin in his ceaseless aggression to power and to the safety and security of all Terrans.The Arcturus Mengsk in Starcraft 2 is better compared with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  He and his administration create laws so blatantly false and outrageous, even CHILDREN would not fall for it.  And this is presented CONSTANTLY in the form of UNN broadcasts featuring an obvious parody of news pundits.  One mission sees you, Raynor's rebels, liberate a civilian area from the Zerg and Dominion forces.  This is then reported on the news where a field reporter reports to the UNN pundit.  He then asks about civilian casualties, and the reporter says \"Actually, the only civilian casualties thus far have been crossfire from overzealous Dominion forces\" and as soon as she finishes, they panickedly go back to the pundit who panickedly remarks \"Uh, well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen; Jim Raynor, killing innocent women and children!\"The actions of Arcturus Mengsk, having civilians rounded up and slaughtered, or encouraging neighbors to spy on one another, or abandoning half his Dominion  at the first sign of Zerg threat so as to protect his core worlds, is so completely out of character for the Starcraft Mengsk that it's a farce.  It's buffoonery, and it's made less funny if you've played the Terran campaign in Starcraft 1.But the absolute worst has to be Zeratul and the Protoss.In Starcraft, the Protoss were the big tough fanatical race.  They were loyal, courageous, religious, and xenophobic.  They had highly advanced technology, but otherwise were very much like the Terrans in terms of being well-rounded, with good people and bad people making good decisions and bad decisions.In Starcraft 2, you could replace them with night elves in World of Warcraft or any random race of wizards or magicians from any medieval fantasy work involving people speaking with stunted syllables about ancient prophecies and fallen ones and doom.TVTropes has something called \"Flanderization\", named for Ned Flanders in \"The Simpsons\", who believe it or not, was once a NORMAL character who was religious, but also did \"naughty\" things and drank beer and such.  \"Flanderization\" refers to taking ONE character trait of an otherwise normal character, and making that trait THE defining characteristic of it, to the exclusion of all else.This has happened BIG TIME with the Protoss, where religious fanaticism and mysticism has now become the defining trait of the Protoss.  Nothing Zeratul (or Nibbler, as I call him, because he's voiced by the same actor) says is not painful to listen to, straight out of every Lord of the Rings knockoff, good or bad, and done worse.Mild Spoilers abound here:  For whatever reason, whereas Raynor and the Terrans are written at a third grade level of vocabulary and storytelling, Zeratul is written at a kindergarten level.  It becomes teeth-gnashingly irritating to have a cutscene show you where to go, and to have Zeratul SLOWLY exclaim \"I must go over there and link with that thing, but there are Zerg in the way!  They may be... problematic\", or a mission where Zerg attack your base every three minutes, and when there's thirty seconds left, Zeratul ALWAYS says \"The Zerg are massing for an attack!  To arms!\"Zeratul's fight with Kerrigan is not so much a fight as a World of Warcraft-looking cutscene featuring an exchange of magic pixie powers---I mean, \"psionic energy\"And then comes Zeratul's FIRST crowning moment of stupidity (because there's at least two) that comes as such a smack in the face to Starcraft fans, it becomes less the fault of the character, and more the fault of BAD WRITING.  Zeratul encounters a Protoss/Zerg Hybrid, and then states in that stilted, bland and monotonous delivery \"Who could have created such a thing?\"DID NO ONE ON THE WRITING STAFF EVEN READ THE SCRIPTS OF THE FIRST GAME, NOT EVEN NEEDING TO PLAY IT?So while you're saying \"Duran\" again and again and again, the next mission comes and here's Zeratul's stupidity that is again the fault of bad writing, not because of total ignorance of the first game, but out of just bad writing:Zeratul encounters the \"ghost\" of an old friend.  The FIRST THING this old friend says is \"I have come to you from beyond this world\", and the FIRST THING Zeratul says is \"But you died!\"The idiocy then continues as this old friend tells the story of the Overmind and its true purpose, and Zeratul chimes in POINTLESS commentary that only shows how utterly STUPID he is, not able to use age as an excuse to not understand the concept of \"lies\" and \"ulterior motives\" and \"not everything is as it seems\".  The old friend remarks something about the Overmind, and Zeratul says \"DUH DUH BUT, THE, OVERMIND, WAS, A, MONSTROSITY!\" and this old friend has to chide Zeratul like a child that it only SEEMED this way to him.I remark on World of Warcraft and magical fantasy a lot in this review.  Know that I am not trashing on the genre, or on World of Warcraft.  It is likely a fine game, but my point is that it is an entirely different genre game from this.  The same way you wouldn't want to see rubber-forehead aliens in \"Battlestar Galactica\" or slapstick comedy in \"Schindler's List\", I don't want to see magical fantasy-type superstition and talks of \"Prophecy\", \"Chosen One\", \"Fallen One\", \"the Damned\", \"Doom\", and such in a hard science fiction game.In fact Starcraft 2 does seem at times like that one disastrous step that Warcraft 3 did with the series; turning it from low-fantasy into high-fantasy, which actually went on to greater things in acquiring a whole new fanbase with World of Warcraft.It doesn't fit on Starcraft 2.  And seeing the Starcraft series go from something dark, ambiguous, and hard, to something literally at grade-school level in its simplicity, is like watching a childhood hero succumb to drugs or alcohol.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2010"}

There are several different racing modes you can play:1. Race - obviously, there has to be a mode where you just race, but it's pretty fun racing. You rack up points and earn boost for taking out, tailgating, and smashing into other opponents, drifting, and driving into oncoming traffic.2. Road Rage - your goal is to take out as many opponent cars as possible before your car is completely totalled. You can also play against a friend, where it's first to get ten takeouts, or last man standing. This is perfect for those days when you come home all stressed out from sitting in gridlock all day.3. Crash - My personal favorite, there are 100 crash junctions taken from sections of the different courses in the game. You have a specified period of time to cause as much damage as possible. This can also be played with a friend, either co-op or against each other.If you've played previous Burnout games and were not impressed, I would still recommend this game because I've done the same. Probably the coolest new feature of Burnout 3 is the aftertouch feature, which allows you to control your car in slow motion after you crash, making it easier to take out opponents. This also comes in handy in Crash mode.My only complaint, really, is that the massive amount of traffic in the game makes racing extremely difficult at times. It wouldn't be so bad if your car crashed every time you even bump a car that is not in the race. If you can get beyond that, though, this game is worth many hours of fun gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2005"}

Different story and some new locations and new enemies.Graphics: As good as the first game and decent for an Xbox title.Sound: Average for a star wars game.Story: The Sith Lords are back for revenge.  It takes place 5 years later from the first game, and it has some cameo appearances from some of the characters in the first game. The Sith have all but wiped out the Jedi. You start off without a light saber and force powers. You served in the Mandalorian wars under Revan and ordered the weapon called the mass shadow generator to be fired. The deaths from the weapon created a wound in the force and your connection was severed along with the Jedi council exiling you from the order. You have to find all the components to build a light saber and re-establish your connection to the force. You are trying to hunt down the Sith Lords and those who serve them. They are trying to wipe the Jedi from the Galaxy. You travel to areas such as Korriban, Telos, and Dantooine from the first game, and visit new areas such as Onderon and its Jungle moon Dxun, Nar Shaddaa, Malachor V, and space ships such as orbiting yacht, Peragus, and the starships Harbinger and Ravager.Gameplay: RPG type of gameplay as the first KOTR game. Kind of takes a while to get the components to build a light saber but there are shortcuts you can take. Once you do, you will level up in the force and they have a few new force powers from the first game. Your base is the same space ship from the first game, the Ebon Hawk. Lots of support characters in the game like the first one, some returning from the first game such as T3-M4, Mandalore (formerly Canderous Ordo), MK-47 (if you collect his parts) all with a back story. Some characters you have to choose who joins your party based on your alignment such as Hanhar the wookie if you are dark side or Mira if you are light side. These support characters fight alongside of you and you can take control of them to use their special abilities. The difference in the characters in this game, is you can gain or lose influence of them. It seems you can never keep them all happy. Some want you to be bad and some want you to be good. You can fight with melee weapons (vibro blades, light sabers) and ranged weapons (blasters, rifles, etc). Each character levels up in the game with experience points. You take on all sorts of bad guys including mercenaries, Sith troops, Jedi turned Dark Side, general Vaklu, and eventually the Sith Lords (Darth Nihilus \"Lord of Hunger\",Darth Sion \"Lord of Pain\", and Darth Traya \"Lord of Betrayal\"). There are some unique levels in this game and you even visit some of the previous levels from the first game.Replay: Worth playing through twice maybe, one for light side and one for dark side.Conclusion: The controls are good. The story is good but somewhat lacking. The only gripe I have on this one is there is no different ending in the game if you play light side or dark side, so kind of disappointing in that aspect. Still a great game and if you like the first one, you should like this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2011"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away.

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Simply a blast!","reviewText":"Greetings Amazonites!Just Cause 2 is a blast to play!  If you're looking for some downright fun action, then this is the game for you.  Step right up to my patented 3-tier review system.ENVIRONMENTS (5 stars): Wow... just wow.  This game looks amazing.  Everything in the world is eye candy--the buildings, trees, grass, rocks, buildings, characters, vehicles, etc, etc... You name it and the developers made sure it was pleasing to look at.  I really don't know how they managed to cram so much detail into a game and still make loading times transparent.  I'm not even sure there is any loading time!  I've journeyed across the world numerous times and never had the game stop to load anything.  Everything seems to just be there, ready to see.The game world, in my opinion, is vast.  There's something like 35 square miles of land in the game.  You can really feel the scale of the world by flying around in a helicopter.  It actually takes some time to get somewhere far away (there is a fast travel option, however).  I'm blown away at the combination of scale and detail.  There's variety in landscape, as well: beaches, ocean, mountains, snow, jungle, cliffs--it's all here.The sound and music is superb.  Every bullet shot, explosion, and rain drop sounds great.  The music is simple and creates a great atmosphere without beint distracting: some good, rhythmic tunes to keep the action upbeat.GAMEPLAY (3 stars): the controls are good and responsive; if you played any other 3rd-person action games, this won't be too much of a problem.  The camera is excellent as well; it frames the action well and doesn't get in the way.  There were a few moments where I would've liked to play in 1st-person, but it wasn't bad enough to ruin the game.  The 3rd person is all about preference.  Sometimes I find it disorienting when you're trying to change directions or look around--the camera and the character don't always look in the same direction.Managing items, vehicles, and inventory is easy.  Everything is mapped to the direction pad for quick access.  You can tap a direction or hold it down to change weapon configurations.  Using a parachute or grappling hook is a quick tap of a shoulder or face button.  There's no unwieldy inventory screen to scroll through--everything can be switched and configured in the game HUD.  This is a brilliant system that keeps you in the game.One of the strongest things in the game is the parachute and grappling hook combination.  You can jump off cliffs, pull the chute, and glide for miles at a time.  You can grapple hook the ground or a tree and keep your momentum, cruising the land in your chute.  It's quite a sight.  The hook also allows you to scale buildings, attach to helicopters (and take it over), grab vehicles (and hijack them), and attach people to objects (like a moving vehicle).  There are a slew of combinations these gadgets can be used for; you'll feel like a combination of Rambo and Batman!The weakest part of the game--and it can be frustrating sometimes--is the shooting.  The aiming system feels a little awkward at time.  You'll burn through a lot of bullets just spraying enemies.  You can zoom in and aim, but it's not practical when you're getting shot by multiple opponents.  It's simpler just to hold the trigger and let the lead fly.  Aiming seems very \"from the hip\" regardless of the weapon used.  The difference between the weapons doesn't feel as strong as it should be; head shots work for all weapons, but it seems like there's little difference between an assault rifle and a pistol when just shooting normally.  Fortunately, the frantic action often distracts from the unwieldly aiming.Vehicle operation is another sore spot.  It's fun to take control of cars, trucks, bikes, copters, boats, and everything in between--but it can be a chore to drive.  Aside from acceleration and top speed, most vehicles drive the same.  The steering is odd; it feels to easy to oversteer and too hard to turn sharp corners--even with a slower vehicle.  Helicopters and boats are the easiest to manage, but they can get cumbersome when you're being chased or moving at top speed.  Just like the aiming, the vehicles don't ruin the game--they're just not good.DESIGN (5 stars): The game is all about bringing down the corrupt government of Panau.  Something sinister is afoot--a conspiracy of international proportions.  The main character, Rico, is a specialist in causing chaos.  That becomes the focus of the game: blowing stuff up, assassinating key figures, and just making life difficult for the government.  It's a lot of fun, too.New weapons, upgrades, vehicles, and so on are accessed through an unusual method: you call a black market dealer, who flies to your position and drops the items to you.  It sounds a little corny, but it works quite well.  It makes a lot more sense than trying to find shops in a country where you're destroying stuff!The map is very well done and full of information.  Each location has an icon (like many other games) and highlighting an icon allows you to mark it as a compass direction and also calls up an information panel; the info panel tells you the basics of the site, what kind of rewards you can expect from it, and so on.  Each site has a combination of objects to destroy, people to kill, or treasures to find.  When you complete all the objectives for each site, you earn a bonus reward (normally points and/or cash).The story is actually pretty good.  You don't have to do any of the story-related missions at all!  This is one of the best things about Just Cause--you can, literally, do whatever you want.  There are all types of missions to choose from, and completing objectives opens up more choices.  Missions branch off of missions, depending on who you decide to work for.  Rico is a mercenary, and you can pick from any number of factions to aid; or you can just cruise around causing chaos, collecting rewards, and enjoying the scenery.The game has great appeal to guys, like me, who don't have a lot of game time.  It's fun to just fire up this game for an hour or two and revel in the chaos.  Take a quick half-hour dip into the world to raid a military base!  There's nothing like stealing a military assault helicopter and using it to demolish a secure military facility.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2011"}

You've got funny, quirkly dialogue between the different players in the storyline, a game cleanly structured into \"Chapters\" that take you to the end of the story, and then several different ways to tackle the gameplay.  Getting from beginning to end is half the fun:  you can \"reincarnate\" and go 'round again, making different choices on the next pass.Battle is turn-based, but again unlike anything else:  push your character up to another like pieces on a chessboard.  Is an ally next to them?  They get to double-up and both attack.  Instead of a Final Fantasy-style method of applying actions to the whole party...then everyone takes a turn, in Disgaea each character gets to make their move whenever you choose to...then the opponent gets a turn.  Special moves might have certain rules as to when you can use them, such as the character needing a clear path behind them to get a running start.Disgaea then takes the action up a notch by coloring the squares on the battlefield...and allowing you to apply bonuses / penalties to squares of that color...or a character can pick up the bonus / penalty token and move it to another color.  Can your player not get close enough to the enemy?  Move them close, then have another party member pick them up and throw them the rest of the way.  Unless they're penguins:  penguins explode when you throw them.  Handle pengiuns with care.Sound weird yet?  How about this:  you can go inside of items and \"play levels\" in things you find or buy.  For example, I found a gun, took the party into the gun, and started going through battle maps, finding loot and unlocking goodies.  I needed more people in my group, so I created some.  If I wanted to, I could petition a kind of legislative panel to make new people, but that's harder:  you should probably bribe them.  And if they don't vote your way, threaten them.  Just don't be too obvious about it, or they'll all jump out of their seats and come after you!Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is hilarious.  It's bizarre, but it's still something you can learn fairly easily.  And the gameplay is both fun and addictive.  Creativity will be rewarded.  The only real hindrance here is that sometimes the isometric 3D battle map is hard to see:  despite being able to rotate the board, there will be spots that you can never quite put your eye on.  That can makes it difficult to move characters to exactly the right spot without some effort.Higly recommended for the RPG gamer, novice or pro, who wants to do something different.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2008"}

We forgot to make a Mario 2 for North America!\"So they made one out of Japan-only game Doki Doki Panic. And everybody liked it...until they found out what was done to make it.Super Mario Bros 2 differed a lot from the first Mario game. Mainly because of its origin. You throw veggies at your enemies, there's a mini-boss at the end of every level, you get to choose from 4 characters, and Bowser isn't the main enemy. And you know what? All that was awesome. The music and sounds were kind of what you expected in a Mario game, but note: Doki Doki Panic had the same music and sounds. Just that this is in 32-Bit.This Game Boy Advance version is a great re-release of Mario 2. It featured lots of improvements over the original. First, notice the score system. Mario 2 never kept track of score, and neither did the Super Nintendo version (in Mario All-Stars). There are also new GIANT Pow Blocks and Shy Guys. Hearts now appear a lot more often. Of course, there are now voices.The biggest difference I know is the new Yoshi Challenge after you beat Wart for the first time. You have to go around all the levels of the game, looking for hidden Yoshi eggs (Don't worry, you can select the levels). Get all 40 and then you beat the whole game. The eggs, though, are hidden in the Subspace (Where you find the mushrooms), and they are not beside the mushrooms. The Yoshi Challenge made the game's replay value go up higher.There's also a version of Mario Bros (the arcade game) included with Super Mario Bros 2. This version is also pretty updated. You can do the Super Jump from SMB2 and you can also pick up and throw Pow Blocks. You can also run, which is a bit helpful. You can also link up to play with 3 friends in co-op.Think that's enough? NOPE! There's also a 4-Player VS mode that uses Mario Bros. This time, you need to either collect 5 coins or be the last one standing to win. There are some cool items you can use, but they are found in a trash can (gross). Stars, hearts, shells, you name it.Overall, it's an awesome cartridge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

NFS for playstaion has in my opinion offered solid graphics, energizing soundtracks, and the best cars that money could buy.  My intetest in the series began wane though with the addition of such extreme cars like the Murcielago, and the McClaren F-1.  i mean these are cars that i will most likely never afford let alone see one on the streets.  With Underground that all changed, and we now get customizable cars that we see everyday.  The opportunity for individual customization is high, but could have been done a little better.  The folks that know all have their favorite brands of aftermarket.  I myself am a Greddy man.  The options are easy to perform on the cars, and a degree in Auto Shop is not required as it feels like it can be in other games like Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero.I am happy with the graphics but would have liked to see a faster frame rate to cut down on the occasional flutter.  I love the soundtrack, and its ecclectic mixture of metal, and hip-hop.The lack of replay though is near inexcusable for such a game.  I like to replay the turns to check my lines compared to AI, and who doesn't like to sit back, and replay a spectacular crash at over 100 mph??I am still shocked that a replay wasn't offered for the game.  I'll let it slide if it was to make room for some of the car tweaking, but it still stings when i think about it.The tracks are challenging, and varied while still being familiar after only a few circuit races.  I really enjoy the game, and each little step i unlock feels like a big reward.  I am a little confused on the Reputation meter, and am still trying to figure out to increase it to more then just x2 which is all i have been able to manage on my little custom Civic.For the import racer at heart this game is a No-Brainer.  The Nay-Sayers will cry and moan about the lack of inclusion of American Muscle, and real life physics compared to the slight arcade feel that this one posesses.  To them I say Go Play Something Else!!  Yes, we all know that GT4 will dominate all upon its release, but this is not GT4, and doesn't try to be.  This is an upgraded version of the Tokyo Racer Zero game, and a much better version of what the Fast and the Furious game will try to capture but fail miserably.

The developers also give us tons of hidden goodies, very few of which have to be found to keep the game moving.  They give us play potential with costume-change sections, and in Lego Batman, even the ability to go back through some levels and play as the villain.Unfortunately, as prolific as the Lego series is, no one seems to have stopped along the way to fix some major interface problems.  It's often hard to mount ladders or climb rails.  It can be difficult to stay on them.  When you work as a team, it's easy to get stuck when one of you goes to far from another...even if it's the combat that's dragging you out of range.  I suspect that this game was designed for a single player, and giving someone else the ability to join in was an afterthought.  That's a shame, because I know I'm not the only one who likes to play this with my child, and I imagine a lot of brothers and sisters share their console time in this manner.Probably the least fun flaw in Lego Batman goes like this:  if a player is on a platform, and their partner dies, the camera will often reset, moving to focus on the respawn point as the dead player is revived.  When this happens, the other player gets dragged over the edge and to their death.  It can get very frustrating.  The worst example was when this happened and we were now on ledges opposite each other, trying to make our way back to the middle:  one player would die, the other would get dragged off the ledge to respawn the first, and then the first would get dragged off the ledge to respawn the second.  This could be a minor glitch if it didn't happen to us at least once on every level, often ending our game by killing out all of our lives.  Even Lego Star Wars, the oldest of this run, didn't do this to us.I applaud the look and feel and concept of this game, but Traveller's Tales needs to go back and fix the engine:  these major flaws make the game difficult to share.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2009"}

This time the game feels like more than a pretty graphics engine with a few action minigames inside it.  They really improved upon everything the first game did. However, there's a few notable things that drags the score down to 4 stars.1. Button-mashing in combat will get you very far and it really shouldnt be that way. Generally the combat is too easy. I would have liked more one-on-one combat since part of the reason the combat is so easy is that you are typically fighting groups and only one of them attacks at a time which the others just stand there until you hit them.  There's room for improvement in the enemy combat AI.2. I love climbing the buildings but its too easy.  It should be more like a puzzle to be solved, but instead all of the buildings are very similar to each other and you basically just scramble up them.3. There are treasure chests everywhere but they are totally pointless.  Very early in the game you will be generating income from your villa. As that point you will walk by the chests and there are _many_ of these dang chests.Great game in any case. The graphics engine is jaw-droppingly impressive. I cannot believe they got a console game to generate a giant world that looks that good and at a fairly stable 30fps framerate.

Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) not only grabs you, but also hooks you with its ingenous racetracks, colorful and funny karts and their favorite trademark characters.This game is one of the few to take advantage of the broadband adapter (sold separately).  The broadband setup allows up to 8 players to play simultaneously using 8 separate TVs and consoles (requires an 8-port hub with patch cables), or 8 players on 2 TVs(4 players per TV) using 2 consoles (requires only a cross over cable to connect the 2 consoles).  These kind of setups are fantastic for a LAN party or even a MKDD tournament.Racing in this game is now a cooperative effort, there's the driver and the thrower on the same kart.  Characters are classified as light(e.g. Baby Luigi), medium (e.g. Yoshi) or heavy(e.g. Bowser). There are also three (3) corresponding kart types.  Any combination of driver/thrower is possible but they can ride only on a kart as big as the heaviest character in the pair.  Light karts accelerate fast, but are weak when colliding against heavier karts, and they don't have great top speeds. Heavy karts accelerate slowly, but they are strong and have the highest top speeds.  This character/kart combination allows the player to experiment and find the best pair for him/her.The main event is the grand prix competition.  In this event you race against human and/or computer opponents trying to reach the goal first not only with speed but by using your wits.  Special items such as banana peels or green shells, among others, are scattered all over the tracks for you to pick up.  Each item gives you a strategic advantage that if used wisely can make a difference at the end of the race.Apart from the grand prix competition there are also other race modes such as time trials (to measure how fast you finish a track), versus (race against human players only) and battle, which also has its own variations.  These game modes combined with multiplayer capabilities makes this game entertaining for a long period.How many character are there to choose? Well, there are 16, but who knows if there is some kind of code to unlock others.How many karts? There are 8, but you unlock others as you start winning grand prix tournaments.If you want clean, fun entertainment for the whole family then this one is a winner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2003"}

With brilliant graphics and the fastest gameplay yet in a Sonic game it sure does make for a great video-game experience. But there's just not enough of it and not much is made of the Nintendo DS potential outside of some slight touch-screen interaction and a tall graphics.As always the levels range from tropical islands to mechanical metropolis with all the usual powers ups, springs and speed barriers. They are brilliantly designed and contain so many loop-the-loops and massive jumps that you'll go cock-eyed. The sheer speed that you can fire through the levels is amazing. The music top-notch too and there are loads of cool tunes.You can play as Sonic, with his usual abilities, or as Blaze the Cat, who has her own mission opposite Sonic. Obviously this involves defeating Doctor Eggman, but you now have a 'rush' ability which acts as a booster to make Sonic or Blaze go even faster.My major complaint is with the Special Stages. They are the same as the were in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, involving the 3D tunnels. And they are impossible. The one that I actually managed to enter requires 160 rings to catch the Chaos Emerald. Not only do I not think there were even 160 IN the whole stage but it's impossible to keep a hold of them as there are so many dangerous obstacles and traps. Plus, you control Sonic with the stylus pen in this stage and it's not got such a great response.And the last boss is impossible also. There is no way to defeat Doctor Eggman and the controls frequently contradict each other, it's all down to bad programming. The game sure has a few bugs (nothing major) that should have been sorted out.So apart from the special stage and the final boss, the game is just too damn easy and has nothing to bring you back for more. Yes, I had loads of fun playing it but it would be only worth the money if it were longer and had more to it.Graphics A+Sound A+Gameplay BLasting Appeal B-","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2005"}

Now, just because the graphics are my favourite part of this game doesn't mean that you should expect the most \"advanced\" visuals. What is great about what you will see is that you probably haven't seen anything quite like it.Sure, you've played sidescrollers and seen Japanese-style cartoon characters but screenshots just don't tell the whole story here. The characters have a motion that somehow allows a 2D cartoon character to come alive. Beyond that, there is just an enormous amount of detail poured into the environments that you just don't see in other 2D realms.That said, there are just a number of flaws that bring this would-be giant to its knees. I'll only focus on the most important: Gameplay. Be prepared to be frustrated. When you first start out, you will be puzzled by seemingly unresponsive button presses. As you play you will learn that presses just don't register while the character is carrying out the current action. What this amounts to is slowly and carefully timing your buttons with the animations, which is incredibly counter intuitive and clumsy- especially when you have five to ten bad guys bum-rushing you at high speed. Your natural tendency is to mash away, which will ultimately result in your demise.In the end, this game may be worth the bargain price, but only as a whimsical (and short) diversion for those dry spells between major new releases.Summary:Beautiful art meets clumsy controlsPros:-Absolutely wonderful art and animations-Unique concept of combining action and RPG elements (albeit not masterfully executed)Cons:-Frustratingly clumsy controls-Repetitive level design","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Terrific Fun, Needs Real Multi Next Time","reviewText":"There hasn't been a game this immature since Conker's Bad Fur Day on the Nintendo 64. Bulletstorm is a balls to the wall first-person shooter that's a mixture of Duke Nukem 3D and Gears of War. It doesn't shoot for a story that you're going to golf clap afterwards, and it doesn't try to revolutionize the genre. What it does bring to the shooter genre is something the genre long forgot this generation: how to just have fun. It encourages brutal violence through a \"kill with skill\" system that gives you objectives to slaughter foes in certain ways. Bulletstorm will take you to the simpler times of the first-person shooter in a sci-fi atmosphere that is not only fun to look at, but fun to kill in.General Sarrano, apart of the Confederation of Planets, is the antagonist here and apart of the secret army, Dead Echo. He leads groups of soldiers into missions that slaughter innocent victims. Years ago our hero, Grayson Hunt, discovers he's been lied to so he decides to take revenge on Sarrano. Years after the event, alcoholic Grayson decides to fight a battle with hired mercenaries to battle Sarrano, only to end up crash landing (with Sarrano) on the planet Stygia. So now Grayson isn't only looking for revenge, but he's also trying to get off of this planet, which is filled with savages. Luckily, he'll have help with a Strogg-looking cyborg colleague, Ishi.As far as the story, it's pretty simple for the most part and is probably only there to keep the \"story crowd\" entertained. The story and dialog never take itself too seriously. During the story, you'll hear profanity spew out of their mouth, and a lot of sexually charged profanity. Don't worry; if you dislike strong language, you can mute most mature language in the options (along with turning the gore off). The innuendo isn't only limited to dialog. During your killings, you'll probably notice a few of them pop up on the screen after getting a skill kill, such as the \"Shocker\" or \"Gang Bang\". Aside from all of the silliness, the game's serious side actually could have been done without. The more goofy the game's dialog was, the more it fit with the actual game. But the seriousness and emotion they tried to put into the game every once in a while turned part of the game into what it was trying hard to parody.Despite all of the story, for better or worst, the game brings to the table what it promises: over-the-top gratuitous violence. The linear campaign will last about 6 hours, which seems to be the new average for shooters. It's also a very easy playthough, even on Very Hard. It's ultimately a cake walk that never feels too punishing. Through each act, you'll unlock new weapons and skill objectives after you've discovered the energy leash. The energy leash is your alternative attack that lashes out at an enemy and pulls them towards you, or with a power-up, will slam energy down to the earth and knock them high into the air for slow-motion killing. The slow-motion is really amazing and fun to play with. When you pull someone towards you, or kick them in the air, they're temporarily slowed down so you can get an easy kill with a headshot or something of that sort. Everything else will move in normal motion. But while an enemy if flying to him doom, you really get to pick how you kill your victim. You can kick them off the map, into spiked cacti or electricity, or just shoot them with your arsenal.The skill shots system is one of the key elements to the game. As mentioned above, a lot of the names for these are filled with innuendo, but all of them will make sense while you discover them. For example, the \"Rear Entry\" skill is performed by shooting an enemy in the butt until he dies. The list is incredible for the amount of damage you can inflict on enemies. The more weapons and upgrades you purchase from strategically placed drop shops (stores), the more skills you'll unlock. These skills are viewable by pressing select on your controller, so it's always there to check what skill you need to try next. Each time you discover a skill kill, you'll enjoy it each time. Not only will it increase your score drastically, you'll find it funny how you've discovered them. As stated, you'll buy new weapons to play around with, outside of the basic assault rifle, kick, and slide. Weapons range from explosive cannon balls to your base shotgun. Each of them have their own alternative attack, or charge attack. Each of these charge attacks unlock even more skills to shoot for (no pun intended).During my play through, I did run into a few glitches that really put a damper on the game's pace. During Act 4, I was rushing through the level to get to the boss quickly. When I arrived at the area I was lead to, I noticed the boss never spawned. I restarted the checkpoint, still nothing. I had to restart the chapter to actually get the game to load the boss correctly. There was also a few other glitches I ran into. My friendly AI team crowding me in a doorway and causing me to stick for a few moments in the door. However, for the most part, the game runs fine and doesn't really have any issues.The game is something to look at. It's vivid and colorful. Usually in a game like this, you'd expect the tone to be rustic, but the game is full of plant life, colorful destroyed cities, and that crimson spray from enemies. The game isn't a 1080p title, but it still looks great still. It might just be all the chaos or the sheer environments that is the true eye candy. You'll never experience a frame rate dip that causes you to miss a shot or anything. Bulletstorm runs smooth, and for this type of title, that's better than the visuals alone. Accompanied with great visuals is a great sounding game. The music is adrenaline pumping and the voice acting is key on. It's a complete package with it's eye and ear candy, not to disappoint the reasonable.When you're done with the campaign, you'll get to enjoy two different modes. Echoes is a time-trial run of Bulletstorm. You'll be challenged to try and pull off as many skill kills as possible, while rushing through a level. Each level (and then some) from the campaign is available to run through and try your shot at the leaderboards. If you happened to have played the demo, you'll understand how this mode is. The other mode you'll play through is Anarchy. Anarchy is much like the Horde play of Gears of War. It's wave after wave of enemies, each wave increasing the difficulty and amount of mini-bosses on the playing field. This mode can be played with a few friends, and the game encourages so by introducing enemies to \"Double Team\". When you \"Double Team\" an enemy, it requires you and a friend to perform certain skills to get more points. You can play Anarchy solo, but the key to this mode is playing it online.Bulletstorm is going to satisfy those awaiting Duke Nukem Forever (another title which is bringing old school shooters back), or just those who want a break from the modern warfare titles that are being milked right now. It's a lot of fun if you're not expecting game of the year material. It's a throwback to the past, a kick to the future, and it takes a shot at taking your gaming too seriously. If you play games for the fun of it, you'll find much pleasure in this title.+ Over-the-top shooter that's very retro and new in a sense.+ Anarchy mode is a blast.- Short and very easy campaign.- A few glitches that need to be patched out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins.

Whether you're looking for a game to play online with a friend, or offline in split screen (as I did), you'll be hard pressed to find a comparable experience to what F.E.A.R 3 offers.In this game, one player will take control of Point Man, a solider with a haunted past who does the majority of the shooting in the game.  His special ability to slow down time for more accurate shots is awesome and very useful.  The other player takes control of Fettal, Point Man's sadistic cannibal brother who plays more of a support role using telekinetic powers.  He can create a shield around Point Man to reduce his damage taken, levitate enemies and suspend them in the air to make easy targets for Point Man, and most enjoyably, possess the bodies of enemies.These two roles combine to make what becomes a surprisingly tactical, yet incredibly action packed and enjoyable first person shooter campaign.  The campaign can get quite challenging at some points, and it is really fun to work with your partner and experiment to find out what the best tactics are to overcome and advance forward, especially given the very different abilities that each of you has.  Technically, the game is extremely well put together.  The shooting mechanics are as solid as any of this generation's best FPSs, and there is also a cover system that works extremely well, which is rare in a game that uses the first person perspective.  The level design is incredible.  The levels are huge and diverse and full of creepy moments.  Enemy AI is definitely a cut above.  They are very smart, using cover and flanking techniques and forcing you out of cover with grenades.  There are even mechs you can pilot!  It is clear that this new developer of the F.E.A.R series, Day One Studios, has put the focus on game mechanics and making this a top tier experience in terms of gameplay, perhaps at the expense of creating a more suspenseful, frightening game.  This may disappoint some long time fans of the series.However, for someone like me who is always on the hunt for a very good, smart, and action packed game that can be played with a friend in person, F.E.A.R 3 absolutely delivered the goods, and then some.

{"product_name":"B00004U1R1","description":"Made in Japan. For this game pak to operate, you must have an N64 expansion pak(sold separately installed in Your N64).","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Three Days, One Hope.","reviewText":"Majora's Mask seems to have risen from its ashes. When this game was released, it didn't have quite the same fanfare as Ocarina of Time. But these days, it's a consistent favorite amongst the Zelda faithful. You should probably check out the almost universally revered Ocarina of Time first if you're looking for one of those Zelda games for this console, but Majora's Mask is a good follow-up to that game.Story: The main plot is quite straightforward. After a mishap with Skull Kid, Link accidentally arrives in the parallel universe Termina. Then he discovers that Termina's moon will crash into the planet unless Link awakens the four guardian giants within three days.Gameplay: Link is dubbed 'The Hero of Time' in Ocarina, but one could say that he really distinguishes himself as such in Majora's Mask. You're constantly working against time in this game. It's basically impossible to awaken the giants within the given three days, so Link must use the Song of Time to travel back in time if he runs out. After completing a dungeon, your progress is essentially permanent even when you go back in time. But if you fail to complete it before going back, you have to more or less start over. There are sidequests galore in Majora's Mask, all of which are centered around the amount of time Termina has left to live. You could spend quite a bit of 'time' trying to complete all of those sidequests.Controls: They work the same as Ocarina of Time, but for whatever reason, MM's striking patterns, dodges, and such just feel a little different than Ocarina's. It's not necessarily worse, but I can never play one without getting rusty at the other. Anyway, MM employs lock on Z-targeting which makes centering in on your enemies easy. The controls of either Zelda game are some of the best on the system.Graphics: They're about the same as Ocarina of Time. If the expansion pak makes a difference in quality, I really don't see it. Ocarina of Time is one of the better looking N64 games, so that's a good thing. ;)Music: It's alright. The Ocarina melodies never did quite stack up to the game before, in my opinion. The Termina Field theme is one of the better renditions of the classic Zelda theme.The main problem with Majora's Mask is that it's not as accessible as its predecessor. You have to want to win at Majora's Mask. There are puzzles (particularly within the game's many sidequests) with no obvious answer on what you should do. Actual study is of Termina and its people is required. But because of this, Majora's Mask is one of the more immersive N64 games you can play. I don't think it's quite as replayable as OoT, but that shouldn't stop any fan of Zelda or the N64 from picking it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"Chance Briggs","summary":"The best DC based fighting game available","reviewText":"This review is from a person who has played pretty much every fighting game of note since the SNES era. Also, I am a big superhero fan, so I feel that I can offer some insight. After finishing the story and few of the S.T.A.R.S. missions, here are some of my opinions.Pros:The Stage Settings: From the Batcave to Ferris Aircraft to the Fortress of Solitude, I loved how they include different characters and objects from DC comic universe. I also liked the various characters in the background. For example, Martian Manhunter appears in the Watchtower stage; the Atom is seen in the Insurgency state; Gorilla Grodd, Deadshot, and Parasite all appear in the background of the stage based on Stryker's Island Penitentiary.Interactivity with Background: You can use various objects in the background to your advantage. If you are a super-powered character then you can slam them into your opponents, if you are a more human character then you can bounce off and get behind the opponent.The Character selections: Personally, I would liked to have seen less Batman villains, but the selection is pretty good. There are 24 characters in total, with 12 good and 12 bad. I'm a big fan of variety so I personally would liked to have seen characters like Animal Man, Adam Strange, Mr. Miracle, OMAC, Swamp Thing, etc. However, I understand that those are not quite the A-list heroes that would appeal to a large audience.The Character voices: If you are a fan of Batman: the Animated Series, the Teen Titans, or the Justice League then you will be happy to hear many familiar voices. For example, Kevin Conroy once again does Batman's voice, Khary Patyon does Cyborg's, and Tara Strong does Raven's and Harley Quinn's.Cons:The characters' costumes: I am not a fan of the new-52 designed costumes, so I disliked the fact that I couldn't use the more traditional costumes. I understand why they were used, but personally the new-52 costumes suck and I much prefer the traditional Superman or Captain Marvel costumes.The characters' faces: I thought the characters were readily recognizable; however, there was something off about Superman's face, Captain Marvel's face, and Lex Luthor's face.The plot: I would say that for a video game plot, especially a fighting game plot, it would be acceptable. However, if you are a fan of the D.C. universe, you've seen this awful plot a dozen times - Lois Lane dies, Superman goes crazy, turns evil, becomes a dictator and forms an &#34;evil&#34; justice league in a parallel universe leaving the &#34;real&#34; DC heroes to step up and stop their evil counterparts.DLC characters: This is a pet peeve of mine, and applies to pretty much every fighting game. Simply put, I refuse to pay extra to play as an additional character. I rarely buy games at full price, but assuming one does, the video game company is anticipating someone paying upwards of $60 for a game and then spending roughly another $30 to unlock the six unlockable characters? I found Injustice to be a fun fighting game, but who in there right mind is going to shell out $90?Overall:If you enjoy massive, destructible environments, ludicrous super-moves, and a completely ridiculous story on top of the requisite fighting game components then this game is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2014"}

I was really glad when this game came out because it touted itself as an updated Pirates!  And boy is it!  This game is so simple and that makes it so much fun.  You basically go around on a ship and find treasure, attack cities, trade, woo women, sword fight, get into ship battles, and rescue your family!  All the while you have to deal with the weather, repairs, food, and mutiny.  There are also plenty of missions to go on.  The game is really endearing too.  It's just plain fun.The only downside I can possibly think of is how every town pretty much looks the same.  They may have certain unique features like what they sell or something, but for the most part, they are all the same.  I didn't really mind this since the focus of the game aren't the ports.  It's about going out on the open sea and being a pirate.  In that respect, this game blows everyone else out of the water.  Buy this if you can!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A tour de force with some minor qualms","reviewText":"I went into Dragon Age: Origins with mixed feelings.  After my initial excitement over the announcement of the game a few years ago, my thrill was muted by the marketing and most of the emphasis from media sites and from Bioware/EA themselves.  Using Marilyn Manson's \"This is the New Sh-t\" in their marketing seemed curious, when you consider the song is talking about presenting something new, but underneath it's the exact same thing he/they have been releasing for years.  That sentiment didn't exactly ooze confidence that Dragon Age would be something special.  Ironically, the song does tell the truth in some ways; Origins is the new sh-t.  It just so happens that Bioware's sh-t is probably better than most other RPG developers could hope for.Origins begins with one of six stories.  When you create your character, you'll select a race, a class and are given one or two possibilities for an origin story.  These stories are fascinating in and of themselves, presenting you with the choice to begin as a Mage in the Mage's Tower, a Human Noble dealing with unrest in his/her house, a City Elf or a Dalish (forest) Elf, or a Dwarf Commoner or Noble.  Each story presents the world differently and can actually be pretty involved.  For instance, as a Mage you learn how the world mistrusts magic and has created The Chantry (the religious organization in Origins) to watch over them to make sure they only do approved things.  As a Human Noble, you'll live a life of privilege, until you watch your world come crashing down one night.  Likewise, the other origins present such themes as fratricide, racism and a look into social castes.  Taken together, these origins provide a more rounded view of this mythical world than most full movies or novels do.Whatever choice you select, ultimately you will be ushered into a select group called The Grey Wardens, who are tasked with saving the world from the Darkspawn.  The Darkspawn come every so often, in an attacked entitled The Blight and the only thing standing between destruction and these monstrous beasts are The Grey Wardens.  Truthfully, the story in Dragon Age will be immediately familiar to anyone who has played a Bioware game.  The structure is the exact same structure they've utilized since the beginning.  Give a great opening, then give some semblance of freedom to tackle three or four main missions before the game goes back to linearity and you are pushed along a route to the end.  Speaking of the end, my first play through clocked in at much over 30 hours.  And that was doing some but not all of the side quests.  I mostly stuck to the main story, which is amazing.  A lot of Bioware games presents a relatively short main storyline and peppers the game with lots of side quests that add to the length.  Dragon Age has a very meaty, long main storyline, much longer than their recent games.  Adding in the side quests (of which there are lots), and you have an incredibly satisfyingly long game.  The most surprising thing about Dragon Age is how unsurprising it is.  Most of the character tropes and themes--regardless of how well conceived and plotted they are--are the same we've been seeing throughout Baldur's Gate, Mass Effect, KOTOR, Jade Empire, etc.  In some ways, Bioware has become complicit in their game design and so it was almost too easy to see the direction the story took with each mission.That said, even when I knew how the story would progress before I even got to the plot points, Dragon Age had its teeth sunk deep into me and I found myself unable to stop playing.  Frankly, the combat system in Origins is the most inspired design Bioware has come up with yet.  Merging the RTS-lite feel of Baldur's Gate with the more immediate, third person perspective of some of their later games, Origins makes combat fun and strategic.  You choose four people to fill your party and with each combat scenario you are given a few options.  You can easily spend the entire time in third person in your main character, allowing the AI to manage the other characters based on tactics (for those who know, think the Gambit system in Final Fantasy XII...except more user-friendly) that will dictate how you want them to play.Want one character to be a healer?  Select the healer drop down and it will auto-populate the character's fields with skills and triggers (like \"ally &lt;50%\") that deal with healing.  Want more customization opportunities?  You can fine tune any of the drop downs.  It works pretty well, I've found.  On harder difficulties or the more difficult fights, you might want to have a bit more control.  With a flick of the scroll button on your mouse, you can move the camera up, giving you a better look at the combat field and presenting you with a game that looks and plays like a high def Baldur's Gate.  Pausing the action, you can assign individual skills and tactics to each character.  By combining these two functions, Dragon Age becomes the most accessible yet strategic game Bioware has created.  Each battle is terrific, even the smaller ones.While there's only three classes (Mage, Warrior and Rouge), you'll find that the skills each class has really helps differentiate characters.  For Mages, there's a ton of schools of magic, from healing to spirit to more elemental ones.  At levels 7 and 14, you are given the option to further specialize your characters by selecting a specialty.  Ranger, duelist, bard are some choices for the Rouge, Templar, Champion or Berserker are some for the Warrior while Blood Mage, Arcane Warrior and Shape Shifter are some for the Mage.  These provide an additional row of skills and provide some stat buffs to your characters.  On my first run through, I played a Mage that specialized in Blood Magic and as an Arcane Warrior.  This combination, I found, was truly exciting as it provided some very nice area of effect attacks but also allowed my character to get bonuses from heavier armor and use a magical sword when I wanted to get hands-on with my death-dealing.  Just working with my characters and their skills really provided a ton of content and allowed me to tweak my team to do what I wanted it to do.Visually, Dragon Age looks...good.  Not great.  But good.  The textures are sometimes lacking and some of the earlier environments, in particular, don't look as good as the final areas.  That said, the game was incredibly stable on my PC and only had one or two bugs that crashed the game.  It's built on a good engine but I was expecting a bit better in the texture department.  From an audio perspective, the music is great and the voice acting is usually very good.  My biggest problem is that I feel Bioware took two huge steps back with their dialogue system.  Coming from Mass Effect's mostly better dialogue system where you select a feeling or an action and then have the conversation play out, Dragon Age presents a voiceless protagonist and goes back to the earlier style of dialogue where you select a conversational choice and the characters go off on monologues.  In this reviewer's opinion, dialogue is one area Bioware sucks.  All we're given is talking heads, spouting soliloquies and monologues ad nauseam.While the characters and their voice actors are great, I wish Bioware would get away from the \"telling\" and do more \"showing.\"  It's not great character development to have your characters break into uninterruptible monologues about their backstory.  It'd be more fun to introduce some kind of showing aspect to it.  Not necessarily a cut scene, but tell the story in more visually interesting ways.  An example of the good way Bioware told some background exposition was in the premium paid content \"Warden's Keep.\"  You are asked to go to the keep to help someone uncover his heritage and once you enter the castle, you start to see snippets of the past because the connection to the fade is very strong in this area for reasons which are explained as you progress through the keep.  This is a better (not the best, though) way to show the past because it's creative.  There's still characters rambling on about their past, but the presentation makes it more immediate and visually stimulating.  I get enough talking heads when I go over to my parent's house on Sunday and they're watching Fox News.  I don't need it in my video games.That said, the gameplay and the entire structure is tops.  Not many games leave me begging for more, but I find myself saying \"just one more quest\" or \"let me just turn this in before I quit\" or \"well, I want to wrap this up so that tomorrow I can focus on...\" quite often.  From that aspect, I think Dragon Age is probably the most successful of Bioware's games.  It feels much more fleshed out than Mass Effect, less clunky than KOTOR and more interesting than Jade Empire.  Even when I curse Bioware for sticking to some completely outdated tropes and presentational aspects, I find myself unable to look away or stop playing.  And that's a sign of a great game.  Even with the flaws, very highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

When I heard a second was coming out I was ecstatic. Now that it is out and I've been playing it for a few months, I can say it definitely lived up to my standards.First, what I love about it. It's definitely a challenge. Even at the maxed out level 50 the baddies are higher than that, meaning it didn't lose it's difficulty at the beginning of play through 2. I also love that it's so extensive. If I'm paying $60 for a video game I don't want to be done with it in 2 weeks. Even playing through on co-op 5-10 hours a week (more when it first came out) we're still not done with this game and the two DLCs that have been released so far. Speaking of DLCs, that's another plus. We purchased the season pass and have been really pleased with the first two DLCs that have been released. They're fun, humorous, a challenge, and great time for our money. And last, I love the humor with this game. I still laugh every time I hear \"wall sphincters.\"And now for the downsides. The menu was difficult to get used to at first, because we are playing split screen co-op. I haven't played it full screen, so I can't speak to how it looks on there, but we can't see the whole menu on our split screen. We have to scroll up and down to see everything on it. It also leaves you in the action (as opposed to it pausing you and filling up the whole screen like it did in the first game). Both of those are things that took a little getting used to. The only other downside for me, and it's a big one, is that you basically have to grind hours on this game (which is impossible for people like us who have three kids and husband works a full-time job) or play four person co-op with other people who have done a bit of grinding on the game. It's been really difficult for us to get a group of four people together with the equipment necessary to beat the invincible characters. So far we've only managed to beat Terramorphous and Hyperious on the first play through with a group of four people. I know many people have soloed these characters, but that is with backpacks full of legendary items. I can only imagine how many hours were spent farming for those items. It's a little frustrating to get so far in the game and not be able to get those last couple of achievements (and I assume it will be the same with the next two DLCs).Either way, the invincibles give us something to work at and a reason to keep playing the game. I'm sure we'll get them someday (I hope)...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

The surrounding countryside is very beautiful but at the same side you see signs of war everywhere.

Along the dirt road there are checkpoints everywhere manned by different rebel groups.  At one checkpoint we got stopped by rebel soldiers and my driver had to promised to bring back beer for them if they would allow us to proceed past the checkpoint. I couldn't believe it.  You can actually use bribery in this game.  I noticed there was a small plane flying above me and I found out that rich people with money are paying pilots to fly them out of the country.  When I saw all this stuff I thought to myself that probably happens in real life in war torn zones around the world.I have never been to Africa but I'm sure this is as close as you can get to the real thing. There is a lot of detail put into this game.  For instance I noticed little things like leaves blowing off trees and plants swaying around.  There are birds flying overhead and constant sounds of wildlife.  I notice insects flying around all the time.  I came to a railroad siding next to a building and notice a lot of detail put into the rail cars and the railroad track.  There were crates and boxes inside some box cars and trash laying around the railroad track.  I was very impressed by the amount of detail.The AI in this game is very good.  Rebel soldiers react to how you react.  For example, I went into a large town and the town was already occupied by rebel soldiers.  Well in this large town there was a truce between the two rival rebel groups where there was no fighting allowed in this town.  So I was able to walk around throughout the town without being stopped by any rebel soldiers.  I could actually walk right up to the rebel soldiers without being shot at.  Everything was peaceful and quiet.  But the minute I pull out my weapon and start shooting at one of the rebel soldier's, all hell broke loose.  Rebel soldiers started shooting at me and some ran behind cover and some try to outflank me. I was fighting for dear life.  I decided to get out of town because there were too many rebel soldiers to fight.  Well I ran out of town and the rebel soldiers came right behind me.  I had to hurry and think of way to slow down the rebel soldiers before they caught up to me.  Well in this game you can slow down people that are chasing you by setting fires.  So what I did was I went to a large grassy area and set the grass on fire.  Pretty soon a large fire broke out and the rebel soldiers stopped chasing me because they couldn't get past the flames.  I was able to get away.  I was thinking to myself \"How cool is that\"?In this game you can choose the battles you want to fight and you can fight your battles anyway you want.  You can choose to fight during the day or you can choose to fight at night.  Or if want you can avoid fighting all together by just sneaking around.  In this game it's all up to you on how you want to approach your objectives.  I would highly recommend for you to go out and buy this game. There is a lot of replay value in this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}

{"product_name":"B007SRM5MO","reviewerName":"Zalmorion the Fantastic","summary":"Overrated Button Mashing","reviewText":"Much good has been said about this game already, but the game is so overrated.  Combat is not much more than button mashing.  The fighting animations are creative and fun to watch, but they get old quick.  The graphics are identical to the last game.  Basically, this game is a well-acted, well-presented mirror of the first game.  Boring combat.  Boring search quests.  A lame superhero fighter.  Fun to watch sometimes, but not fun to actually play for hours.  The settings are dark and gloomy.  Batman's clue finder vision (Detective Mode) is annoying and distracting.  The game makes it hard to see anything in regular vision, which is really poor planning.  Who the heck wants to play an entire game in altered vision?If you are a DC fan, at least rent it first.  If you are looking for a solid fighter/action adventure, I'd go elsewhere.  Sleeping Dogs does similar combat much better than this game.  It includes environmental actions, grappling, counters, etc.  It is a good example of what the Arkham Batman games should have been.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2013"}

Suddenly, a giant flash of lightning appears as it starts to rain heavily. You nervously look behind you. Nothing there. In a hurry to get away from the rain, you run under a near cave. After going through an old, broken door another lighting flashes and an intemidating roar of thunder follows. You slowly continue to walk through the abondoned, lifeless cave. A slight glisting of metal appears as you approach a peice of torn machinary. Traveling depper, you find the entrence to an old advanced shelter of somekind. After exploring somemore, you return to this enterence spot. A flash of lighting lights up the place again and you find a giant insect mantis like creature staring right at you. In a hurry you fire your beam at it and destroy it. An ear-wrentching cry echoes the halls as you see there are tons more of them, crawling on the walls jumping down from the ceilings, surrounding you. In a hurry, you attack them one by one and run to the cave enterence of the place. Suddenly, it lights up with life. Giant crab like insects start crawling down the walls, trilobites flee as the abondoned bunker becomes housed again, lights flicker on and off and motion is constantly seen throught this once desolate and quiet place. Only not one human or freindly creature is moving. Thats basically the opening sequence of Super Metroid. Constantly through this game will be intense and sometimes freighting moments of suspence. There is also always very satisfying action to follow. You play as Samus Aran, who has really cool sumersaulting jumping techniques. Also, she can shoot something right at a pin of a target while sumersaulting through the air ten yards away. Shes a really cool character with a really cool suit and a really cool arsenal of firepower to go with it all. Plus, a really cool game. Most of the game will be taken up exploring places, finding new abilitys/weapons in those places, and using those abilitys to gain acces to and explore other places. Most of these enviroments are dark, suspensefull, and gloomy like the one described above. The game also features some inovative enemys that can be destroyed challengly and satisfyingly no matter how you fight them. It has some really great graphics, too. But, the one con, and its a big one to, is that after watching the opening cutscenes, theres almost no story left. You'll alot of times be wondering if youre supposed to be in an area or not supposed to be there, with no real knowlege of where to go or what to do next. Just little hints like you've accomplished a big task in an area and feel that the next big task is in another big area. Other than that, this game is a really great classic and should be played by all at least once. It really almost plays identically to Metroid: Fusion, so a learning curve would be very small since alot of people have probably played fusion by now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2003"}

The object of the game is to rebuild your world by collecting Atla. It is a Sim City-RPG mix, the first of it's kind. The graphics are great (although there are a few glitches the programmers should have found). The controls are simple and easy to learn. The music fits the scenery, even if it does get repetitive (you listen to the same music for every floor of a 18 floor dungeon). While moving around in the same dungeon for an hour can be annoying, you really don't care due to the fact that you want to see what your next atla holds. The enemies are sort of cartoony but they fit in well. This game provides 30-40+ hours of gameplay, and when you beat the game a new dungeon is unlocked. Below are the various elements that make this a Sim City-RPG. I definately reccommend this game to RPG fans.Sim City elements- You must build what you have collected from atla any way you want, but if you want to recieve a good prize you will have to please the residents.RPG elements- This has classic RPG elements such as upgradable weapons. You can apply attachments to make your weapon stronger and when it is strong enough, you can \"Build it-up\" into a more powerful one. You can increase you characters' health, defence, and water containers individually with various items.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2001"}

The facial expressions are amazing.  This is one of the best looking games for the PS3.  The characters are wonderful, the storyline is great, the environment is very real.  But the gameplay was horrible.  Once I got past the looks of the game and actually started getting into solving the cases, it went downhill fast!Here's the core of the game in a nutshell:You go to a crime scene, walk around pressing X until you find all the clues, then you ask questions to someone.  And then it's on to the next scene where you do it all over again.It's terribly repetitive.  Sure, you get an occasional shootout or car chase (and those are pretty fun), but by and large your time is spent on look-alike crime scenes and impossible to solve interrogations.  I rushed through the end of this just because the Q & A's were so frustrating.  There is not a single person out there who can honestly say that they are getting the questions correct without a lot of guessing.  I can't even count the number of times I thought, \"How the hell was I supposed to know that was a doubt and not a lie?\"So, even though this game looks fantastic, I wish that I hadn't wasted my money or time.

My screen has frozen 2 or 3 times and I've had to restart.  There's still plenty of gory, head bashing madness but there is more of an actual story that you follow in your quests rather than just running all over the place looking for some insignificant item for a survivor.The graphics are better for the most part.  All your favorite zombie types have returned along with a couple that are almost impossible to defeat.  One particular section of the game involves going down into dark tunnels filled with broken chemical containers.  It's very dark with your only light being flares (which I ran out of twice).  It's definitely the creepiest part of the game and had me jumping more than once as I was blindsided by attacks.  Co-op play is available.  It even notifies you of other online gamers who are at the same approximate level that you are so that you can choose to do a co-op game.  Overall, I'd say this is a step up for this title.

Everything, from the packaging down to the game content itself is top notch, obviously intended to make the fan boys drool.  I personally don't care about the collector's aspect of the game.  It's nice, but I am more interested in the upgraded controls.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Much like the Pikmin remake, the upgraded controls rejuvenate the experience.Most of this review focuses on this product as a collector's pack or compilation since there is an abundance of good reviews on each of the individual games.  For anyone who hasn't played any of the Metroid Prime series of games, here's a really quick summary.  You play as Samus Aran, a bounty-hunter in a power suit that must save the galaxy from immense and epic danger.  THREE TIMES!  The game is played from a first-person perspective, and althought you kill a lot of Space Pirates with a variety of weapons, it is quite different from many FPS titles out there.  Exploration of the environment and discovery of clues, countless upgrades, intense platforming sections, and backtracking to find new paths are the name of the game.  In my opinion, the Metroid Prime series is possibly the only FPS title out there that really manages to get platforming right.  Almost never do the jumps feel cheap or impossible, even when they are challenging.  Combat controls are tight and responsive and I never found myself struggling with flaws in the controls.  Each of the three games play essentially the same, but the story is slightly different in each with some different weapons and item upgrades found throughout the title.WHAT'S NEW IN THIS?- Wii pointer controls for aiming and some limited motion controls.- Achievement/Medal system has been added to the first two titles- Widescreen support for the first two titles- Minor graphical upgrades- Metal collector's set box- Collector's artwork- One of the nicest and heftiest instruction manuals I've ever seen in a console game.  They don't make them like this anymore.THE GOOD:+++ Amazingly tight and precise controls, but more customization options would have been nice.+++ Split-screen multi-player in Metroid Prime 2.+++ Three of the best and most critically acclaimed Nintendo games ever made all on one disc.+++ Amazing graphics which... well, they're really old and show their age but the artwork is stunning.+++ At least 60+ hours of game play.THE BAD... SORT OF--- No online multi-player.  It really feels like the only thing missing from the game.--- Lots of back-tracking.  It's not really that bad, but some people can't stand it.  Be warned.--- You may have already paid for this and beat it at least once before.--- This set proves that most developers are lazy on the Wii because the graphics on some games produced last generation mop the floor.IS IT WORTH THE PURCHASE?That depends on who you are.* If you have never played any of the Metroid Prime titles and are looking for a good adventure game or a FPS title and you don't mind lots of exploration, pick this up.* If you tried either Metroid Prime or Metroid Prime 3 - Corruption and didn't like it, I doubt you'll like it this time either.* If you tried Metroid Prime 2 - Echoes and didn't like it or got frustrated, I recommend at least renting this one because Prime and Corruption are much more approachable than Echoes was.* If you beat all three Metroids before and you never play through a game a second time, you may want to stay away from this title. For those who rarely replay games after beating them, the new additions are nice, but nothing except the controls are earth-shatteringly new.* If you enjoy replaying some of your favorite games over again from time to time and you consider Metroid to be one of your favorites, the control upgrades alone are reason enough to justify the purchase.  Much like Resident Evil 4, the remake for the Wii makes this the definitive version to own.* If you enjoyed Metroid Prime - Corruption and never played Metroid Prime 1 & 2, this game is a must buy.* If you're a Metroid fan boy/girl, yes.  This game was made just for you.  I'd tell you to buy it, but you probably already had a copy pre-ordered months ago.  In fact, go buy two copies, keeping one sealed in the original shrink wrap inside a sealed vault.  I also recommend getting some therapy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Media Lover","summary":"Easily the Best GC Title!","reviewText":"Well, this is my THIRD review for Resident Evil 4.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"Final Fantasy meets Disney - high on charm, short on game","reviewText":"Anyone who has grown up watching Disney movies will not be able to resist Kingdom Hearts.  Square has brought these great characters to life before our eyes - they exist on the TV screen as if they stepped right out of a movie.  Each looks *exactly* as they do in the films, and most have the same voice actors as well.  Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and all of that gang, plus the players from most classic Disney movies - Little Mermaid, Alice in Wonderland, Tarzan, Lion King, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmations, on and on. You name it, its in there.Weaved into this is a classic Final Fantasy RPG, which is itself a huge reunion of Square characters.  Most major heroes from the Final Fantasy games making an appearance, including Cloud, Squall, and Titus.  Add to this the brillant archenemies as played by a union of Disney villians, and you've got another wonderful Square story.Playing the game underneath all this was actually frustrating at times.  Basically, Kingdom Hearts is a Zelda-like action-adventure done Square-style.  You fight monsters in real time, with traditional Final Fantasy touches like Ethers and Firaga and all that Final Fantasy goodness.  The combat is very fun, but I was frustrated with the camera, which usually fails to inform you that you are in fact surrounded by enemies and in great danger.  Also, the player seems to stumble onto critical plot events too chaotically, and I often found myself endlessly roaming a level hoping to find that obscure plot trigger.  Otherwise, a fine game, great for Disney and/or Square fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

I've always been a PC computer gamer myself for years because I always thought that PC computer games had much better graphics than any console game out there.Personally, I love World War II games and when Call of Duty 3 first came out I noticed it didn't come out for the PC. I just had to have Call of Duty 3 so I decided I had to go out and buy a Xbox 360 console so I could play Call of Duty 3.  I ended up playing Call of Duty 3 first before I played Gears of War.  I played the single player part of Call of Duty 3 all the way through and I really like the game.  I love playing first person shooters.Well I heard alot about Gears of War and I thought to myself even though this game is a third person shooter, I would still go out and buy Gears of War to see what all the fuss was all about.  To be honest with you, I wasn't too sure if I like the game since Gears of War is a third person shooter.  But I wanted to be fair and give this game a chance, because lets be honest, most games aren't cheap anymore.  So I wanted to out and try to buy the best game for my money out there.I really like Call of Duty 3 but when I played the single player part of Gears of War, I was blown away by how smart the AI is for the both the enemy and allied soldiers and the amazing graphics.  You don't have to tell fellow soldiers what to do, they're smart enough on their own just to go out and try to find some cover.  Same goes with the enemy.  They will try to use cover whenever they can and they will try to outflank you and try to overcome you with sheer numbers.  I thought the battles in this game were better than the battles in Call of Duty 3 and that's saying alot right there.Gears of War is by far one of the best games out there, period.  It doesn't matter which gaming platform it is.  No PC computer game, PlayStation 2 or 3 game, GameCube, Nintendo Wii, Xbox, or other Xbox 360 game comes close to this game.  I have a top of the line Dell PC computer and the graphics in this game are much better than the computer games on my Dell computer.  I honestly thought I would never find a console game which would have better graphics than a PC computer game.My hat is off to the developers of this game.  You definitely have a moneymaker here.  I can already picture endless expansion games to Gears of War in the future.  If you can't decide which game to go and buy, go get a Xbox 360 and give this game a shot.  You won't regret it.I noticed Gears of War is getting extremely high ratings on all the gaming websites on the internet.  It wouldn't surprise me if the developers of this game have already been approach by a movie director out of Hollywood to do a movie on this game.  It's that good. If someone does decide to do a movie on this game, believe me I'll be one of the first ones in line to go see it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

So it is not surprising to have a sequel to the extremely popular Final Fantasy Tactics Advance on GBA a few years ago. Same as the previous Tactics games, the world is set in Ivalice as part of the Ivalice Alliance series.A2 inherited quite a number of features from its predecessors in the Ivalice world - a whole array of ridiculously diverse job classes with different degree of customisation. What added to the system of A2 is the new job class that are related to FF XII, which introduced the green magick category for now the new class Green Mage. Also all the summons or espers in FF XII are now back in A2 but instead of assigning them on the license board you can summon them through equipping certain accessories that you get in various quests. Also the Seeq race is back for A2 and now controllable characters that you can recruit.Treating A2 just as an extension to previous Ivalice games will be unfair though for it does introduce new elements to the world. The most easily spotted being the new Grias race - the flying race that can reach high places on the field to grab those exotic treasure chests that contains items that you could not find in shops or bazaar. They proved to be quite useful on the field as compared to the slow Seeq race. A2 also reintroduced geomancer, one of the most useful jobs (in my opinion) and works in a complementary way with the Viera's Elementalist class. Due to the presence of two new races, there are quite a number of new job classes available for you to choose from and play around to create your favorite army. Not all of them are useful and some skills of different jobs are actually the same when executed on the battle field, so leaving you wondering why they have those skills and jobs anyway.Story wise, it is similar to Tactics Advance about a boy or teenage got teleported to the world of Ivalice after opening an ancient tome. The objective was to fill up the pages and go back to the original world. Nothing much of a very interesting story. But the great improvement story wise are all the side quests that weave themselves either into the main story or run their own storylines themselves. Clearly in those storylines, the theme are more mature and also provides a very different angle for you to look at some of the story characters.The battle system still plays on a grid structure, and you have to think about your direction of attack and elemental properties. The Judge system is back but less annoying than its predecessor as now you don't need to bail your allies out from the jail anymore but you lost the Judge protection and won't be able to revive your fallen allies inside the battle if you broke the law. Also a welcoming addition is the Clan Privileges you can maintain (and acquire through Clan Trials) throughout the battles if you comply with the laws. These Clan Privileges could prove to be tide turning if used appropriately in different battle context. Square-Enix has done away with most random battles in A2 but all battles are now mission and quest related - including the rare random battles that pops up according to what time of the year and what other clans are in control of the area. Most of the skills effect play out beautifully on the DS and the will tempt you just to apply them to look at how pretty they look on the small screens. However, in a very Tactics manner, from time to time you will run into very frustrating battles that really test your tactical skills and thinking even prior to the battles e.g. what to equip and what jobs to bring into the battles. Further certain job classes may not behave in the same way you remembered as in the past so you might need a bit of adjustments to get use to what they offer.A2 has a variety of gameplay to make it less monotonous. The injection of FF XII's bazaar system is one of them although the titling of items are as random as ever and you will need a walkthrough to get what you want without wasting certain hard to come by materials. There is also the Clan Trial for you to obtain bonus Clan Privileges to give you an edge to the battles. Also the Auction House allows you to get goodies and cheaper prices for items if you control certain turfs under your name. These are all welcoming additional gameplay that offer a better variety of experience although for most of the time you don't necessarily need to complete them to complete the game.In all, A2 is a welcoming and stable addition to the Tactics franchise but it certainly didn't revolutionise the franchise as the predecessors did. If there is another Tactics game for Square-Enix under the Final Fantasy banner, they will need to work harder to make sure that the franchise won't go stale.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2008"}

I loved Silent Hill and Even More love for Silent Hill 2. So The series was moving ahead full speed then this crap came out. The problem starts with the series changing to a female lead character. If you notice they only did it once and then when back to white males as the role. Female as a lead just didnt work, and an ugly as hell one at that. Now that is for me (which before the sex battle begins I loved resident evil 3 with Jill it just doesnt work for silent hill series), it didnt seem to bother some of the other reviewers. Next Problem is the religious crap they stuff down our mouth. It was present a little in the first but this was like 90 percent in this one.The storyline felt like left over ideas that werent good enough for the first 2. Either way they atleast got back on track with Silent Hill 4. Skip this one.Con-Storyline-Female Lead-Boring-Monsters-Everything that made the first two not in this onePlus-I think THe Goriest In THe Series-Vincent was a nice add character (felt like he was a silent hill character)All in all, I pawned this game.

Like many, I thought I was done with the Call of Duty franchise as each year it became more of the same. However, I rented Black Ops 2 and that changed very quickly.The campaign is probably my third favorite (behind Modern Warfare and Black Ops). I did not think it was nearly as great as most say it is. I really don't mind since I play through the campaign once before I delve into the real purpose of the CoD games..the multiplayer.The multiplayer is far and away the best since Modern Warfare revolutionized it about five years ago. Since 2007, it is been more of the same with more tweaks here and there, but this game allows for alot of customization.  Multiplayer has so many options to fit your play style especially with the Pick 10 style. I can go into a game with no grenades if I want and stock up on perks. Also, the emblem creator is better than ever with more slots and customization. It's a fun way to express yourself even if some user emblems are not exactly PG rated.While there are some technical issues and the game is not perfect, the game is the most fun I've had playing online to date.

Fight in tanks, jeeps, motorcycles, even a bomber.","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Next Best Single Player Mission to HL2","reviewText":"Hey, this can run on a 32mb graphics card meaning if you have a high-end 64mb module or a 128mb you are going to be in for a good time. I ran it on a 256mb and it was astonishing. Nearly anyone with a somewhat recent PC can play this 1st person shooter and I am sure it will leave most happy that they did. Was it better than Medal of Honour: Allied Assault, as we have heard? Yeah, it is, but not by much, a margin maybe, but still anything that can live up to MOHAA surely can't be missed and COD:UO lives up to the hype.The concept is the same as MOHAA except that there is more action, more high-octane moments, a different type of enemy AI and a lot more going on in terms of what you can pilot and drive in the story, although not freely but as part of the story. The game play certainly has the Cinematic intensity that it claims including various set pieces like a train bombing run, a lighthouse demolition, the Soviet offensive, all stunning to boot. It is not however HL2 graphics quality or anything close, but does offer a vast improvement over MOHAA, so in that respect is quite good, just nowhere near cutting edge. However COD:UO does have very convincing camera jitters and spectacular smoky explosions. The textures let it down a small bit but the environments and maps are genuinely war like all the way through and can not be faulted. The enemy AI and your own team AI can vary between very helpful and not so helpful but this depends on if you do your job or not. It is actually quite reliable. However, when your team take on an enemy the AI allows each to take multiple hits so that they eventually come into close combat and start hitting each other. This AI must be taken as is, even though slightly unrealistic, the game is not a war simulation but a 1st person war adventure and to be honest, does exactly what it says on the tin. So apart from the staged element, which actually ads to the game, it is more of an experience than a game you will turn to time and time again, however it is worth it for the experience of the single player mission alone.I can not fault it much except to say that not enough air strike missions, weapons realism is not fantastic and the game was a little shorter than MOHAA (this is a 3 day game span) but to be honest I am only cribbing. The pandemonium of war is all here in a spectacular fashion because the story is a winner as you play a mini version of BAND OF BROTHERS as part 1 and then a mini version of ENEMY AT GATES in part 2. So WOW!However when a new war simulation like OPERATION FLASHPOINT comes out for high end cards I know we will have the true war winner. Please bring on the real war simulator!Pros:- Play the two films mentioned above.- Best new war game and 2nd best 1st person shooter.- Awesome war atmosphere.- Smoky explosions.- Can run on a 32mb card!Cons:- 3 day lifespan.- Weapons are not so realistic.- Graphics are not 128mb worthy.- We really need a new Operation Flashpoint with map editor!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00IIHU44E","description":"","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"It depends on who you are","reviewText":"There are two major reasons that I got the X1 and neither of those reasons are for gaming. For gaming, I still use and will continue to primarily use Steam. Anyways I've broken down my thoughts about the X1 into sections.[Good]Kinect:1) Improved Tracking: A lot of the old Kinect limitations with distance and brightness are now mostly gone.2) Fitness: Not even the new Wii U can lay claim to this. Steam and PS4 can't do this well either, nor do they really even try. In fact nothing but Xbone can touch this area or further expand on it. Workouts like P90X and Insanity are now integrated with Kinect. Future Kinect features like being able to track your heartbeat just push it further ahead. Future upcoming fitness apps will probably make this feature even better. This is one of the major reasons that I bought the X1.3) (Future) Children's Apps: Yes there aren't any now, but the Sesame Street series was huge on the 360 Kinect. There are also apps from both Double Fine and Half Brick that were really nice for keeping kid's attention. These apps serve as either educational or great distractions for children which is priceless. (It keeps your kids and even other people's kids from running around your house and breaking things.) I am pretty confident that we'll be seeing more soon. This is the second major reason that I got the Xbone. Again in this area, I don't see either Wii U, PS4, or Steam even trying. Many people will retain their sanity around kids with Kinect.4) With the most recent software update, Kinect voice commands now work as advertised about 80% of the time, though at times I still have trouble getting \"Xbox On\" to work. (Yes I have properly configured Kinect.) Still in many cases, it's still easier to make selections with a controller. This is really useful only for parents who may not have any hands free to use a remote or controller, or for people who constantly lose the remote. I don't feel that this is useful for anyone else since the controller is still the most efficient way to get things done assuming that your hands are free, so it's not really an awesome feature for normal gamers.New Controller: I've heard the complaints, but I don't understand why. No it doesn't feel like it cost $100 million dollars to develop (lol this has to be the biggest marketing joke ever). However it is better than the old 360 controllers which were already pretty good. It's also still better than the Wii U's, PS4's controller (even though PS4's has more features), and probably than the Steam Controller (which will probably be worse than all of them).Silent: Unlike the 360, which sounded like a vacuum cleaner (or a leaf blower when you paired it with extra fans); the Xbox One is silent. It is awesome.Forza: This is an awesome launch title that really shows off the console. I don't care about Gran Turismo anymore.TitanFall: It's nice that this is free.[Bad]Xbox Live:1) (FIXED Summer 2014) Unnecessary Paywall: Outside of games, NOTHING WORKS without an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Facebook, Crackle, and a ton of services that Microsoft doesn't host are still locked behind the Xbox Live paywall i.e. you have to pay the $60 per year Xbox Live tax to get access to them. X1 is crippled unless you pay Microsoft's $60 yearly extortion fee. I can understand paying for multiplayer and maybe even for the Fitness Hub (eh not really for the fitness apps that you have to pay for), but there's no excuse to extort money for the other stuff. It's free on Apple TV, Roku, Google TV aka Android TV, and even on Wii U and PS4. This really needs to be fixed and is the most broken thing on Xbox One. It's the one biggest ripoff for consoles and it kills the notion of the X1 being the one box for everything. Who in their right mind would pay $60 a year and not just get the same access to Netflix and Amazon for free on the Roku or Apple TV.2) Previously purchased games do not migrate to X1: All the downloadable games, primarily the Live Arcade ones, that I bought for 360 are forever stuck on the 360, a dead box. Compare this to Steam, where a lot of the games I bought I can play on Mac, Linux, and so far on every new version of Windows. My paid Steam games will still work if I ever decide to buy a nice new fancy PC in the future.  It's the 21st century and it's now the norm to expect your software purchases to migrate to new hardware. It's not even just Steam, the 800 lb gorillas iOS and Android do it too. If I can help it, I will never purchase downloads from MS again, disc only. In Microsoft's defense PS4 and Wii U don't do this either. This is yet another reason for gamers to go Steam.3) No point in buying download versions of disc games: The price is about the same and there's no great feature to really differentiate it like Family Share. O yeah Family Share is already on Steam. It's in BETA but it's active right now.4) They are going to charge for the Health portion of X1 separate from Xbox Live. It's already bad enough that they're charging for things like Netflix and Amazon Prime, not they're going to try to nickel and dime people even more. This will make most of the health features useless.Kinect Issues:1) (FIXED Summer 2014 - no longer required) It adds $100 to the cost. If you heavily rely on Kinect like me, this isn't an issue. However I don't think most gamers will be relying on Kinect any time soon if ever if history is a good predictor of the future. This is the first major reason that people will buy a PS4.2) Use in Gaming: As I've already pointed out, speech recognition doesn't count since Kinect doesn't even process any of the speech. Historically I can't think of any major games that used the Kinect's motion recognition ability in a great way. Why? Because it costs too much for 3rd party developers to really customize for one console as opposed to just having the same game on all of them. Only MS and its subsidiary game developer houses will be able to do it. Sadly even MS itself can't really figure it out, since Kinect games were absent from its E3 presentation. At launch there's only the Wii Sports knockoff and Forza still uses a controller. I predict Kinect will only be used for Dancing games, Fitness apps, and Children's apps and games. Real games will probably not use Kinect's motion detection until MS gets its act together and at the very least announces a VR solution. Even Sony officially has one now.3) You still need a lot of room for Kinect, just not as much room like the older one needed.4) Most features like the kids games and even the workout apps aren't here yet. They're not even on the release schedule yet. If you're looking forward to any of that, you'll be waiting about two years minimum if not more.5) It's still not fast enough. There's still lag in recognizing what you're doing. This may be more of an issue with X1's horsepower than with the Kinect itself, or a combination of the two. (Maybe if they added more processing power to the Kinect, it'd be able to offload more of the work away from the console itself.)It doesn't feel Next-Gen in graphics and just in general: PS4 doesn't either. This is apparent with both X1's 720P upscaling limitation and PS4 stuttering at 1080P. My two year old $426 PC with $149 video card does way better in this department in both quality and performance. It also doesn't help that the same games have awesome user created mods for PC. I'd say the major tablets will all catch up in hardware horsepower within three years. What's real next-gen? Next-gen isn't TV integration. Next-gen is VR like Oculus Rift. What's sad is now even Sony has a VR solution coming in the future for PS4. Microsoft is just completely quiet on this one. MS really needs to step it up. Kinect is made for VR.Game Prices: So far nothing beats the prices and the frequency of sales for Steam or GOG on the PC. Getting a new or used game is just so expensive for the consoles and they're the same games as PC. This is the other reason that a lot of people like me will continue to use Steam as their primary gaming platform. Buying games on Steam and GOG (and even Green Man) is just way way cheaper, especially if you just wait one to two months after release.For all the emphasis MS marketing has put on TV, TV integration isn't great:1) X1 softens the image. Many people won't notice, but a lot of techies will.2) Even if you disable standard definition channels from One Guide, when you use voice commands, it will still take you to the SD version of the channel instead of the HD version of the same channel.3) Competing TV products that have already been working well only cost one hundred dollars.Lack of Good Exclusive Launch Titles: Ryse sucks. Dead Rising is so so. Titanfall and Forza are a start, but really it's just Forza.Horsepower: PS4 currently has a slight edge and it's a $100 cheaper. It's really a minor complaint since both machines are pretty weak. What makes it even worse for the X1 is that it does a lot of extra processing that the PS4 doesn't have to do like analyzing your voice with Kinect commands since the Kinect itself doesn't do it.Pretty Slow Load Times: Load times for the launch games are horrible, especially for Forza. It doesn't make any sense since it's reading everything from the hard drive unless it's still doing online DRM checks while the game is playing.Really Slow Install Times: It shouldn't take an hour to install a game from a disc. It's faster to download and install games on my PC using Steam which doesn't make any sense since my download speed with Steam over the Internet is 10 mbps (most of the a little slower) and the read speed from an X1 Blueray is 50 mbps. Why does it take an hour? DRM. For some reason it takes Microsoft an hour to verify that you actually bought the game through the internet which is really annoying. Pirates will eventually find a way around this. The only people this hurts are paying customers like me.No Harddrive Upgrade Option: (Fixed in future 2014 firmware) With PS4 you can replace the stock hard drive with anything you want like an SSD. With X1 it's currently not possible to upgrade the hard drive. Even if it were, you'd probably be forced to buy MS's overpriced hard drives. Consequently with games being about 40-60 GB, you're probably only going to be able to install about 10 games, give or take, before you need to delete and re-install other games which will take over an hour.[Misc]I am lucky: Unlike many PS4 and Xbone owners, my unit seems to be free of defects (at least for now). Then again we'll all know for sure since the defects will surface within two years if they exist.Do not buy this from Gamestop, especially if it's a ripoff bundle. I'd say it's only smart to buy at  Amazon and Costco.I got X1 for free after a bunch of trade-ins at Gamestop, specifically the ripoff bundle. I would not have gotten this system if I had to pay for it.[Verdict]If you just want something for games, I would at least give Steam a look. Upgrading a desktop PC that you already own with a decent graphics card (about $150 - $200) is also way cheaper than either PS4 or X1. Xbox controllers also work on PC. I know that if I was a poor middle school, high school or college kid, Steam would be the best thing since you can get so many games on the cheap (most of the console games except for a few exclusives are on Steam), it works with TVs now (a lot of video cards have HDMI out too), and games on PC look and play better than on X1 or even PS4. Steam also has major sales every quarter, so a problem I have is that I have too many games than I have time to play. Oh yeah unlike PS4 and Xbone, you don't have to pay for multiplayer and you can share games with up to 10 people in your friends list. Steam works on Mac, Windows, and now Linux.If you're one of the few old people like me who has money to blow, you care about hi-tech fitness, and something to keep little kids occupied and from driving you insane, then the Xbox One is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit.

Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games.

I'm 25 years old and I work long hours behind a computer, I come home and I want something to relax to that's not going to require large amounts of my time.The DreamCast fit the bill, with a great price and game library right out of the local arcade.Why buy a DreamCast so late in the game? Because although it's over a year old, if you judge a game console based on both  it's technology and it's game library, the DreamCast is the best console on the market.The price point is also outstanding, especially since you get a 56k modem and an Internet web browser with the system (there are many games that are on-line ready as well). You are not tied to a Sega ISP either, that makes this the most inexpensive sit-top Internet appliance on the market.When it comes to games, I like arcade games. If you like arcade style games, Sega makes some of the best and here you have perfect (I mean perfect) arcade games. You can also buy many of the first generation games for $20 or less.The PlayStation 2 is another machine to consider, IMHO the PS2's current crop of games do not justify it's heavy price tag, also if you have a DVD player on your TV, you are wasting money buying the PS2's DVD player (since the DVD has proven to be a failure for software delivery). The DreamCast has a very powerful graphics processor, it's inexpensive and it's quality control department works overtime to make sure only quality games are released. The PS2 will eventually beat it out, there are games like &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, but that's not relivant when you consider that PlayStation will always be at a disadvantage when it comes to great arcade style games. Sure they have Namco and Williams, but so does Sega (see dremacaast versions of Soul Calibur and Ready 2 Rumble), and Sega has their own brand that makes some really incredible games that are unbeatable in fun, but untill PS2 catches up DreamCast should be your #1 pick.Buy one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2001"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"The Most Polished & Impressive Halo to Date","reviewText":"*This is a single player reviewHalo 4 is by all accounts an exceptional game. 343 Industries first internally developed Halo game impresses on pretty much every front. From high quality production values, to a buttery smooth framerate 99.999% of the time, to the best graphics the series has ever seen, to a more interesting story between Chief and Cortana, etc. Halo 4 is Halo at its best.Firstly, Halo 4 plays like a dream. Similar to previous Halo's, gun combat is very satisfying, but now it's more visceral and impactful than ever before. If anyone says this is Call of Duty, that's hogwash. Other than the inclusion of sprinting, this very much feels like Halo, just improved and more polished than ever. The action is much more buttery smooth than Reach was, which makes playing a complete pleasure.Secondly, the graphics are a massive upgrade from previous Halo's. Previous Halo's lacked quite a bit when it came to character models and animations, but Halo 4 has some of the best looking character models and animations in all of gaming. It's shocking just how much of a leap these two things are from the Halo's that came before it. Going from Halo 3 to Halo 4 shows almost a full generational leap in things like lighting, character models, and animations. In addition, Halo 4 runs in native 720p resolution, which is a first for the Halo franchise, as Halo 3, ODST, and Reach all ran at upscaled 720p. To get that full native 720p resolution, Halo 4 is locked at 30 frames-per-second, and it's a wise choice. Unlike Reach, which had a framerate that varied wildly at times, Halo 4 is pretty much consistent and performs beautifully, even when under pressure from a lot of on-screen action. 343 Industries should be commended for such a technological feat as their first project. It's very impressive.Thirdly, the story's actually incredibly compelling. While some things aren't always crystal clear, it's mostly smooth and cohesive the majority of the time. The relationship between Master Chief and Cortana will hook you from the beginning of the game and until you reach the credits at the finale. Halo 4 is a tightly knit production that offers excellence in story, visual quality, and sound quality. It's truly a masterful game from a first time studio.As someone who has enjoyed the other Halo games this generation, I didn't fall in love with them, so it's shocking to me that Halo 4 has hit the nail on the head in pretty much everything it set out to do. Halo 4 is the best Halo since Halo: Combat Evolved. 343 Industries has made their mark on the industry, so I truly can't wait to see what they do next.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

Animation glitches: Great character models ruined by poor animation; horses get confused by riding around rocks, people movement is much less realistic than in other Rockstar games, such as GTAIV, people and animals constantly getting stuck in weird places - I once played a 30 min. game of poker where a guy was walking around on top of the poker table.

The graphics blew me away. It really looks like a high-quality cartoon rather than a game.

I also think it's pretty cool how Mario can literally run around small planets in true 3-D mode. I haven't seen another game quite like it.Unfortunately, the game is simply too long to really rank as fun. The game designers seem to have fallen into the classic trap of believing that gamers actually care about the story. We don't. We want action and to kill bad guys. However, in Mario Galaxy, it is impossible to skip the cutscenes (which are long and many). In terms of the dialogue and cutscenes, this almost feels like a Zelda-style RPG rather than a Mario game. I played for over an hour and only saw a few Goombas and one boss (a giant piranha plant). If I could at least have avoided the cutscenes, I probably could have gotten much further in the game for that time I played. I'm just too busy right now to beat a game that will probably take days, if not weeks, to beat.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"\"Embrace Eternity\"","reviewText":"Having survived the terrible experience of Mass Effect 3's horrible ending - which, BTW, has been improved from horrible to underwhelming with the Extended Cut DLC - I decided to play ME1 again just to immerse in the fantastic Mass Effect phenomenon at least once more. Moreover, I want to prove to myself that ME3's ending, as disappointing as it is, cannot mar the eternal beauty of ME1 (and to a lesser effect, also ME2) - And I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.To begin with, it is crucial to establish that ME1 is unique in the series because it is a RPG with shooter element, whereas ME2 and ME3 are shooters with RPG elements. The most important and simple distinction is this: In ME1, regardless of how well your aiming skill is, your weapons' accuracy is, by and large, dependent on the XP you invested in a particular weapon. On the other hand, in ME2 and 3, your aiming skill (along with reaction speed) determines your accuracy.Also, ME1 leans heavily toward exploration. Granted, this is the least developed aspects of the game, especially in regard to driving around the planets in the M35 Mako infantry assault vehicle or running around the Citadel doing side quests, which can be uneventful for the most part - if not downright boring. On the other hand, running or driving around afford you some spectacular views such as the Earth rise from the moon or awe-inspiring vista from the Citadel docking bay.In addition to the reasons above, the primary reason that ME1 is special to me is its story elements. As a former fan of the 80s science fiction mini-series like Battlestar Galactica (the one and the only original one, of course) or Buck Roger, I have to say that ME1 captured the atmosphere and the mood of these mini-series perfectly - and even better in many cases. As is, obviously having drawn many experiences from their excellent previous work in the Knight of the Old Republic, the EAbioware writing team, headed by Drew Kapyshyn, did a stellar job in creating their own science fiction universe and its own saga.The music in ME1, composed by Jack Wall and Sam Hulick, may not be perfect - but it is a perfect fit for the game. Surely, it is not as melodramatic as the music in ME3; nor is it as inspiring as ME2's. However, when framed within of the aforementioned science fiction genre, it is simply perfect. As is, I also have the soundtrack of ME1 and highly recommend it fellow ME fans.Another remarkable achievement for ME1 - at least for me - is that up until ME1, I never really give a damn about voice acting in games. In fact, I strongly dislike the idea of merging video games and movies together - and I still do. However, ME1 is an exception due the outstanding performances by virtually all the actors involved - especially Jennifer Hale, who voiced the female Commander Sheppard.In conclusion, and also in retrospection, in spite of all the little things that ME1 did not get right, the overall game is beautifully executed and its story is a substantial work of well-implemented science fiction. Therefore, whether you are newcomer to the ME series or a veteran, it's always a good time to embrace the eternity of Mass Effect 1 at least once... and again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}

It was so good that it refused to die with the failing Dreamcast and dove across to the Play Station 2 ( I hear the graphics aren't as good on PS2).  It is the ultimate survival horror game.What make Veronica so great?  The graphics are no small part.  Sure, I reveled like the rest of us in the exploding zombie heads of RE 2 and 3 but I loved the brain splatter of Veronica.  The Tyrant from RE 2, with his blank stare and overcoat never conveyed the sheer life of a bendersnatch as he trapezed across the room and crushed your head, all the while looking at you with those oh so human eyes.What else you ask, makes this game THE RE?  Well, the story is superbly done and Alexia is the most...AWESOME bad guy(errr...Girl) that has ever graced the screen.  And all your old favorites are back too so expect to see some old friends and new enemies as you crawl and run around.Oh and there is more!  Guns have always been great in the Resident Evil games but these guns are crisp.  By that I mean they may not be awe-imspiring like the electroshocker from 2 or as satisfying as the enhanced shotgun rounds from 3 but they will do the job exactly like you would expect.  The twin uzi's will stop a zombie in its tracks but the spiders will laugh as they pump poison into you.  But you can show them who is boss with a blast from the grenade launcher, now better built to kill groups.  Across the board the guns will satisfy.And there is just so much else that I cannot write it all.  But needless to say, if you own a DC or PS2 this is a good purchase at any price.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

How did I ever play these games without a lighted screen?The ritual with my standard GBA was, find a decent light source, and sit under it, back straight, craning my neck downward the whole time. As a result, I never played for very long. But with the SP's front light, you can play anywhere, in any position. That alone is worth the price of this machine. But the flip-screen design is also a major bonus. It'll keep the screen safe when the system's not in use. Also, the rechargeable battery is far more convenient than having to exchange AAs when you need fresh juice. Just keep the light turned off when you have good lighting to play under, and the battery will keep you going for a good 12 hours.One thing to be wary of if you buy the Platinum unit (not sure about the Cobalt): the silver paint comes off relatively easily if you subject the GBA SP to rough handling, so get a carrying case for it. Other than that, I can't find a single fault with this game system. If you already own a GBA without an Afterburner installed, buy the SP. If you've never owned a Gameboy before, this is the time to jump in. You get a sleek, sophisticated unit and a library of great games to play on the go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2003"}

Long overdue.","reviewText":"UPDATED 10/5OK.I'm figuring you, the reader, are in one of three categories:A: A \"newbie\" who never played this game, either because it came out before you were born or you skipped it because you were too busy playing Mortal Kombat and Virtua Cop.B: A non-RPG'er who got converted sometime in the past, and now is trying to make up for lost time.C: Someone who played the original, and want to know if this game fits the bill.I'll be as detailed as I can for all of you.First, Dragon Warrior is indeed the 4th in the series, however it is the first in a trilogy called the Zenithia Trilogy.  Part 4 we received stateside way back years ago on the NES.  We never got parts 5 and 6; in my opinion, neither really had the appeal of part 4.  This one attempts to tell a story the way I feel a story should be told: introduce each core character separately, as 'chapters', then bring them all together and finish on a strong note.  IF you've ever played Phantasy Star III, it's kind of the same thing, only these peeps aren't related to one another.  Note that when you beat Chapter 5, there is an additional Chapter which you must save after the credits and load to get access to.  The NES version had no such additional Chapter.Sometime in the late 90's-early 2k, Enix announced it was remaking Part 4 on the PlayStation.  Needless to say, fans were absolutely ecstatic.  It released in Japan, and it was like the world had ended...mobs of people picking up the game.  Shortly before its US release date...Enix announced that we were not getting it due to what they claimed was the lack of ability to work with the translation and code.  Needless to say, fans were absolutely irate.  It wasn't pretty, trust me.Now, here we are, almost a decade later.  The reason I told you the background, is that this is the exact same game as the PlayStation version.  That's important, because if you're expecting some touch screen controls to navigate, you'll be sorely disappointed.  \"Port\" is a perfect word for this.  If you're the kind of person who doesn't care, great.  Keep reading....Your first task is Ragnar.  He's a soldier in a kingdom where the children seem to have gone missing.  It's up to you to find them...and to help a creature in need.  Next is the tomboy princess Alena, who along with her companions wants to be free from the burdens of being royalty, and prove herself in the tournament.  Next up is \"Torneko\" (more on why I quoted that later), who is on a quest to be the world's greatest merchant.  Rounding out the crew is \"Maya\" and \"Meena\", twin sisters who are trying to solve their father's murder, and lastly, your hero, where you'll meet up with all of the previously named and embark on the final quest.If you've played the original, you've played this one; there are few differences in the core gameplay.  Of note is the now-common addition of the Tiny Medal sidequest to the game.  Find enough and you'll be rewarded with various specialty items.  There is one very unexpected change...in the NES version, during the final chapter, you only had control over the Hero, none of your party members.  In this version, you can control everyone individually.  The auto control wasn't really a big issue except at the last boss, because Brey (more on why you're just now hearing that name later) would always cast that ice spell on him which did almost no damage instead of using Bikill which would have resulted in an easy win.  There were ways around this, but still, it was annoying.The music is now orchestrated, and tracks that you may remember from the NES version make quite the triumphant return.  It's immediately evident that at the time, it would have stood out in a lot of people's eyes had we gotten it stateside.Graphically, the game looks way dated; almost a mirror image of Dragon Quest VII, if you ever bothered to play that game (I did, never beat it).  It uses a 3D environment, and 2D sprites stretched to 3D (but still 2D when you look directly at them).  Pixels abound, and small things are a little difficult to see, but not too much.You can see pictures for the weapons, armor and items!  This is a great thing for me.  I used to love looking at the pictures of the things as I equipped them, from the instruction book.  After a point you had no picture to reference, and you were left wondering what certain weapons looked like.  Now you can see them in the game, and it's pretty cool.  Also, the shop tells you in advance what sell price you can get for your stuff before you sell it, so you don't have to pick each one and guess.  Major improvement; that annoyed me before.Now, for the complaints.  And there are a few - mind you, I'm an old school gamer, and Dragon Quest IV was designed with me in mind; I've never played a more enthralling RPG in my life, not even the mighty Chrono Trigger.- Game is TOO EASY.  I don't know what happened, but in Ragnar's scenario in particular, I distinctly recall it being much more challenging; I even remember the minor strategy guide that was in the back of the book on the NES version.  You needed to be at least level 3 or higher to go to the second town, like level 6 or something to go through the first true \"dungeon\", and then some higher levels to even stand a chance at the tower.  I'm waxing through people like it's nothing, half trying.  Plus with the items now scattered all over the place it negates you having to really grind for money to buy those healing herbs you needed; just break some jars.- The dialogue was screwed up BIG time.  I know a lot of people hated the Old English way of speaking before, but I much preferred it over this.  I can barely understand anyone in some parts of the game.  You've got Scottish speakers, slang speakers, etc.  And what's worse is that the translators thought it'd be funny to purposely misspell certain words to \"emphasize the accent\".  I find it just way too hard to understand what they're saying.  Stuff like \"I dinnae kno any wee bit o path up the hill\".  Come on now.- Names were changed; detracts from the nostalgia.  Ragnar did not have a last name.  Everyone else's first name was changed besides Alena.  No \"Brey\", \"Cristo\", \"Taloon\" (I HATE the name Torneko), \"Mara\", or \"Nara\".  I'd say more, but I'd spoil stuff.  It felt like you have friends growing up, go into a cryogenic unit for 20 years, come back and your friends are all dead, but their children who look just like them but with different names are there now.  I didn't care for this at all, as minor as it may seem to some of you.- Creature names not true to the original.  It's not \"Bubble Slime\", it's Babble.  There are others, trust me.  It really bothers me, I don't know why.- They changed some of the Weapons/Armors.  Not just the items themselves, but their locations and names.  \"Sword of Malice\" is now \"Cautery Sword\".  I can't tell you how much I hate the new name.  \"Malice\" is automatically equated to pain.  \"Cautery\" makes me think of a chef in a kitchen.  Again, there are others.  In the NES version you could buy all of the Metal Babble Equipment with the right key and enough cash; now you can buy the armor, but the helmet takes the development of a town that's otherwise useless, and I only found one shield.  Just a couple of examples of butchering things that should have been left well enough alone.In short: do I recommend it?  Absolutely.  But just know...this is old school at its finest.  IF you can't handle a TRADITIONAL RPG, one that sticks to the basics as close as it can...skip this game, please.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2008"}

(Any game has to have a good story or else it isn't worth playing.) This game gives you the backstory of how the Autobots and Decepticons started warring with one another and what happened before they left Cybertron and crashed on earth.Cons:-I was hoping to story mode would have played more like the online mode with character leveling up and learning new abilities since I'm not a huge online gamer-Things tend to happen very fast during gameplay making it difficult to maneuver and see exactly where you're targeting since targets tend to blend into the background extremely well-I was hoping for more variety in the gameplay, but for a game that takes only around 8-9 hours to finish I can let it slideI bought this on sale at a store for $8 and it was well worth it. Based on how short it is and how that game would have greatly benefited from a leveling up system, I wouldn't recommend buying this for anything more than $15.

It was my first foray into post-Game Boy Nintendo handhelds, and it was really exciting to check out all the great content Nintendo had to offer on the handheld front, especially in the year or so leading up to the release of Wii U.  Needless to say, I was quite impressed.  I got to try several games such as Star Fox 64 3D and Kid Icarus: Uprising, and regular DS titles like Pok&eacute;mon: HeartGold and New Super Mario Bros.  Unfortunately, around November of 2012 I began running into money problems and reluctantly decided to sell the 3DS and all my games to make ends meet for a little while.Then mere months later, a Nintendo Direct broadcast revealed Pok&eacute;mon X and Y, the newest Pok&eacute;mon titles exclusively for 3DS which looked to completely turn the franchise upside-down as I knew it.  A while later, Nintendo fans were given their first peek at what would become The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, which further cemented the regret I had for ditching my 3DS.  I knew I would have to get another one soon.  Then later in 2013, Nintendo introduced the 2DS, an entry-level handheld that was not only intended for younger children, but sold at a much lower standpoint than the regular 3DS or the 3DS XL.  Despite my initial scoffing at the handheld, I eventually became intrigued by it.So without any further delay, I decided last week to take the plunge and pick up a Nintendo 2DS, along with Pok&eacute;mon Y and Mario Kart 7.  While the games are both fantastic and I'll be talking about them at a later time, I was surprisingly more impressed with the 2DS itself.  Despite its slate aesthetic, the smaller buttons and lack of 3D, I don't think I could've asked for it to be any better than it is.I have beefy hands, so at first I was quite skeptical about getting one.  However, the store I got it from happened to have one out of the box that I could try for a second, and I was pleased by the form factor.  When I want to focus on the game, I can focus on the game without the need for grabbing the stylus from the side.  Racing in Mario Kart doesn't feel like an inconvenient chore like some web commentators made the 2DS out to be.  When I play Pok&eacute;mon, whether I'm using the stylus or not the game never becomes hard to control.Otherwise, just about everything with the 2DS reminds me of the 3DS.  The interface is no different.  Sleep Mode is easily accessible with a bottom flip-switch.  Despite the placement of the Power button, it's pretty much impossible to hit it by accident.  Of course, none of this would matter if games didn't look smooth, which they do.  In fact, I could make the argument that the lack of a 3D slider helps bring out the depth in these games, and proves you really don't need the 3D to enjoy 3DS titles.I always heard that if you play Pok&eacute;mon X or Y with the 3D turned on, sometimes the frame rate can drop to a horrendous rate.  With the 2DS, I have yet to notice any serious frame rate issues aside from the occasional slow-down during some parts of battle sequences.  Mario Kart 7 looks just as gorgeous as its Wii counterpart, and sometimes even more so.  I've also played a few demos, such as the likes of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, which looks gorgeous on there.  Sonic Lost World ran just as fast as the Wii U version sometimes.  The only demo I could tell might benefit from playing on an actual 3DS was Bravely Default, which was still great to play anyway.My sole complaint about the 2DS so far is the lack of dual speakers.  With only one speaker, I noticed that Netflix sounded terrible.  I played about a minute of American Dad before shutting it off because even though the visuals were great, the sound was causing crackling, which can't be good.  Whether that was solely because of what I was watching or not, I don't pop on handheld gaming systems to watch something I could pull up on my Wii U anyway.  Even though Netflix output horrible sound quality, YouTube seemed to have no troubles sounding good.  Who knows, maybe having headphones makes up for the one speaker, but I have yet to try any out.If you're like me at all, you're a gamer on a budget and just want to play 3DS games without spending between $160-200 on a 3DS/XL.  If that's the case, it's worth trying out a 2DS for yourself.  Despite the changes from its older brethren, you really can't go wrong with a handheld that costs anywhere between $95-130, depending on whether you buy used or brand new (and where you're looking). It still does everything a 3DS does, it only looks different--and eliminates the focal point of the 3DS, granted.PROS:-Very inexpensive.-Surprisingly comfortable form factor-Plays all 3DS and regular DS games-Impressive visual quality-Easy and effortless set upCONS:-Only one speaker, making certain apps (read: Netflix) not enjoyable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

I have only been able to play PS2 games on the PS3 system. Because the PS3 games that are available in store & even on Amazon; there are not very many to choose from. There are only 58 PS3 games available which many would say is A lot, If your into sports or war games. I like to play video games with my kids and with the 4 wireless controls on the ps3 I was excited!! But have not been able to find Any PS3 games for 4 people. That is not a sport and not M rated, there are 4 player games but none that the kids can play ( E rated game!!) I ended up having to buy new PS2 games for me and the kids to play on the PS3 system. I could have save $600 and just played on our old PS2 system. My best advice if your into sport and war games (if you're a man) then you'll find the PS3 to be great with the graphic etc... But for kids I'd wait on purchasing the PS3 until they come out with more E rated games. And maybe by then they'll even come down on the price.Oh and if your thinking of buying it for the blue ray disc play, it is only great if you have a high definition tv but if you hook it up to a non-high definition tv it will look like any other movie no real difference. Also if you do have a high definition tv (like me) you will have to buy a HDMI cable (sold sperately which cost $70-$100) in order to see the high quality of a blue ray disc. without the HDMI cable again it will look like any other movie. So if your buying it for the blue ray be perpared to buy a new cable and Tv to see that High quality.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"D. Roberts","summary":"Incredible for most, not for all","reviewText":"I bought this on it's release day along with a DS3 controller. The very beginning of the game through me for a loop as there were several abstract videos played that I couldn't seem to skip. I didn't mind at all that the game had an up front installation. It was actually pretty quick. On to playing the game. I did mind that it has an install between every act and that if two people are playing it you'll constantly be re-installing the current act for that person.It's full of story. Most of which is a bit overblown japanese oddness but it kind of grows on you. The acting is well done for a game and Snake is a very interesting character to follow. I'm the type who likes a good amount of cut scene and story. I like to relax a bit between gaming. To me the perfect amount of this was done in Uncharted and Ratchet & Clank Future: TOD. MGS4 goes well beyond the amount of cut scenes in those games and they are a bit less compelling to watch. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy them.The game play is pretty incredible. It's easy to control snake, it's a ton of fun sneaking up on bad guys and the camo suit never gets old. There are a few short comings. Moving your gun 180 degrees in a fire fight takes awhile. It's understandable that Snake is old but it seems just a little too slow. Also it seems very easy to just shoot everyone with the tranq gun and sneak past.So the game is not perfect, why did I give it a 5? It's because the game does so many things so well and has such a great attention to detail in so many areas it definitly deserves it. The graphics are really great but beyond that the sound is AMAZING. The camera work is one of the best I've seen in a video game. Not once did I get dizzy and only when on my belly in the dark under something is it difficult to see what you're doing.Technically the game is one of the most impressive things I've seen in gaming. For those of you concerned, it is also a lot of fun. I personally like Uncharted better but that takes nothing away from this game given Uncharted is one of my favorite games of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2008"}

They honestly are the most addictive video games on the market. But, there honestly has been a huge lack of really strong puzzle games that have tied gamers over with the Nintendo DS. Most of those games though have recently been strong as great downloads for the Nintendo DSi though, with great titles like Dr. Mario Express and Warioware. There is honestly no question that these games are honestly the best to download if you own the Nintendo DSi. That was what I originally thought when I played the version of Bejeweled twist from the Nintendo DSi shop. It was absolutely so addictive in a compact version, that I thought the full Nintendo DS version itself would be just as good, and I was right.Bejewled Twist for the Nintendo DS is a very addictive game that really will tide over the hard core puzzler. The gameplay is very exciting as you master the game by trying to connect different jewels 3 in a row across, or up and down, by twisting the gems clockwise. The gameplay is very addictive to master, and easy to control from start to finish. There are hazards though that make it difficult for you to connect 3 in a row that can pop-up in the blink of an eye like locked gems that can lock up a gem so you can twist it and connect it to others, and timed gems that can counntdown to zero and set up a possible bomb that can stop you dead in your tracks and end the game. The graphics are nice, but it is the overall gameplay that makes it fun.Overall, I really recommend Bejewled Twist as a great addition for your Nintendo DS game collection, and if you want to try a sample version if you own a Nintendo DSi, try it through the Nintendo DSi shop. There haven't really been many games that have been recently worth buying for the Nintendo DS, but this is one that is worth the effort.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: A-Fun & Enjoyment: A-Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2010"}

And it fails on both.In terms of gameplay what you have here is an vapid linear blaster with very little in the way of truly challenging moments. It's a 'corridor' romp which provides little to no room to explore your surroundings and invisible walls and impenetrable foliage prevent any sort of chance to leave the devs' intended path. And each level is sprinkled with just enough leaps of faith and death drops to make the going tediously annoying but not actually hard. Frustrating yes, but not rewarding in any sort of sense of achievement. When you have 3D jumping platformer you must be able to see where your character is going to land and with Alice:MR most of the time you can't and it's often pure luck that she hits the silly mushrooms that you're attempting to leap onto. The enemies that you face are predictable and repetitive and can be offed with little more than a few dodges and your pepper grinder. If you see an open area then guess what... you're going to be locked in the room until you deal with exactly the same bad guys that you just killed in the previous locked-off area a mere two minutes ago. Yawn.But by far the biggest criminal here is the camera. Have we really got to 2011 and still have to fight with the camera? There are inexplicable moments in A:MR when the camera locks off or jumps around to show you the action from 180 degrees causing Alice to about-turn and run back the way she came without you actually moving the control stick! It's unforgivable.The story - well what story? The V/O acting was strange and unpleasant and the Cheshire pops up to mumble a few lines which for the most part was unintelligible. The memories you collect (an excuse to get off the rails that the game puts you on) offer nothing to the proceedings. Frankly I had no clue what was going on. There's no narrative, no arc and no point.Graphically things fare a little better thankfully and in many parts, especially the cut scenes, it reminded me of Tim Schaffer's Psychonauts and that's no bad thing. Of course it had to be spoiled with lazy blurry, pop-in textures and clipping errors a plenty. A month of code tweaking could have fixed it but the devs probably hoped we'd think it was all part of the styling of the game's look. I wasn't fooled.A mediocre attempt at regaining previous glory and one that will be at budget price-point within a few weeks. Hold off for a while if you truly must buy it but do look forward to disappointment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2011"}

Probably one of the most anticipated games of all time. It's breaking records everywhere. It has made over $1 billion already, it was the UK's best selling game of all time, the list goes on. Why is such a &#34;real&#34; game like GTA5 so popular? Usually sequels and series are dead at their fifth iteration, so what makes GTA5 so special? Love and care. Rockstar loves their franchise so much, they have put 5 years into GTA5 to make it what it is which is nearly perfect. There is so much freaking detail in this game I could go on forever describing it all. So let's start with the story.You play as three characters this time around which is a first for GTA5. Trevor, Michael, and Franklin are your average joes trying to get rich quick. The game starts out differently than any other GTA. You aren't starting out just outside of a car, this time Rockstar got a little cinematic on us. You're in the middle of a bank heist in a small town. You end up fighting your way out and the story fast forwards 10 years. Right from the start you get introduced to Michael, then Franklin, then Trevor later on. Each character is very well fleshed out and you end up getting attached to all of them in the game. Of course the other half of the great characters are people you get your missions from and this doesn't change here. While there aren't as many characters as past games they are more well designed and original. You end up going through the trials and tribulations of these three men as they get caught up in the mafia, street gangs, the government, and millionaires. Basically Michael is trying to make amends with his family on the side while Trevor is trying to find out what he really wants -- Franklin just wants to get out of the hood.The largest problem with GTA has finally been addressed: the terrible shooting mechanics. GTA IV tried to fix this, but it felt too sticky and too clunky. GTA 5 is finally more refined and feels like a third person shooter should. You can snap into cover, aim with precision, and all that great shooter stuff. You can even change the reticle if you want, honestly GTA 5 gives you more options on a console than any other game I can remember. While we're on combat you can finally customize your guns for the first time in a GTA. Add supressors, scopes, extended mags, flashlights, new paint, etc. It's not Call of Duty deep, but it's a huge step up for GTA. However, the combat is still tough as nails. You will die in a few hits if you aren't careful and I restarted many missions a lot because of how hard the game is.Secondly, the vehicles still control like you're driving on syrup. You will spin out a lot, and easily lose control. At least the cars look updated and are actually knock offs of real cars. The Banshee looks like the Dodge Viper and there's a car in here that's called the Coil. Figure out what that one's based off of. They look good and you can customize these as well! Yes! It's a lot deeper than you think. There are different levels of upgrades and they make a huge difference on how they perform. Some missions even require upgraded cars. Car wise, the game still shines and doesn't disappoint.While we're talking about cars and combat they all tie into missions just like previous games. Honestly, GTA 5 feels so polished and refined and is a perfect GTA game. The missions are a huge step up because you get to choose how they play out this time around. There are large heists that you need to perform and you can pick your accomplices and can choose two different routes to go. They are usually sneaking and going through the front guns blazing. It's a lot of fun and you really feel like you earned your cash in the game. During some missions you can switch between the three characters on the fly for an advantage. This adds a whole new layer to combat in GTA. The missions are much more varied than previous games and are just so much fun, honestly I haven't had this much fun in a sandbox game in a long time. You get rated after each mission and there are side objectives to complete for gold stars.Outside of those story missions are side missions called Strangers and Freaks. You meet weird people that you help out and these characters are both funny and strange. On top of that, you have random encounters where you help people on the fly as you pass them. It really helps bring the world to life. While we're on that subject, GTA 5 is one of the most surreal game worlds ever created. Los Santos is huge and I mean just huge. There are whole mountain ranges, huge areas of the ocean, and San Andreas as well as Los Santos itself to explore. Even the ocean looks so real thanks to the great water physics and under water effects. Scuba diving is a brand new option here, and yes there are under water missions. However, Rockstar took all this to a whole new level when it comes to detail. You can hunt in the mountains, the scenery gradually changes as you move around the world. It's just so awesome it's hard to believe that this is all out of someone's imagination.Your cell phone for example is an expansion to the one in GTA IV. You can buy stocks and bonds online, buy vehicles to get delivered to your garage, buy boats, planes, and various other things on the phone. You can now order a cab and most messages are done through text and email. It helps bring GTA to the present times and feels that way. The amount of detail in both the characters, world, graphics, and gameplay is just phenomenal. From the turbulence in aircraft to the way boats bounce off waves. GTA 5 has unparalleled detail that is rarely seen in any entertainment medium.At the end of your first day you won't want to put the controller down. With over 100 missions GTA 5 is full of things to do and places to explore. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin are great characters and everyone will have their favorites. Despite the ultra violence, cursing, and nudity in the game GTA 5 is gritty and raw and should be. Rockstar is one of the only came companies who have the guts to show everyone their vision without being afraid of political backlash. I'm sure GTA 5 will have plenty of that (thankfully Jack Thompson will be absent for this one). GTA 5 is one of the best games I have played in a long time and I can't find much wrong with it. Honestly, it's just typical stuff like frame rate slow down, some ugly textures, the online component was missing at launch, a few bugs and glitches here and there, but other than that the game is almost perfect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00009PS24","description":"The future of racing has arrived! High speed fun in the fastest, most visually stunning racing game ever.","reviewerName":"C. L. Hanson","summary":"WHOOOO HOO!","reviewText":"In 1991, F-Zero was released for the Super Nintendo. Heralded at the time as one of the greatest racing games ever created, pushing the SNES hardware and the Big N's &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; (at the time) FX chip to its limits, F-Zero for the SNES was, and still is, one of the classic games of the past decade.F-Zero for the N64 didn't seem to make anywhere near the splash as its successful predecessor. Even though the game expanded to over 20 different racers and was a larger overall game, for some strange reason, it just wasn't quite as enjoyable, in my opinion.However, when creating the next version of F-Zero, our buddies at Nintendo teamed up with their old nemesis, Sega, to create the futuristic, lightning-quick F-Zero GX. The result is nothing short of awesome!The Grand prix mode is solid, with absolutely breathtaking backgrounds, innovative track design, twists, turns, turbos, and don't-blink-your-eyes gamespeed. There are 25 different courses, and all of them are challenging and fun. As with the original SNES version, this game seems to really push the GameCube to its limits.The better you do, the more points you earn to buy parts to build your own ship, or other items in the &quot;garage&quot;. The garage is where you can buy chapters in the excellent Story Mode, which follows Captain Falcon in his adventures. When you solve the first mission, you earn points to buy the next mission, and so on and so forth. But, as time goes by, the missions begin to cost more and more, and unless you go through the Grand Prix mode first and save up your points, you run out of points pretty quick, which leaves you to race in &quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;Harder&quot; versions of the storylines to earn more points. This is where the game becomes very, very, difficult. If you don't want a video-game that you are going to solve in one night, this game is for you. There were some moments where I was ready to whip my Wavebird against a wall! But that is what makes the game fun!!A little kid probably will consider this game, much like Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, too difficult. However, older gamers such as myself enjoy the challenge and make return gaming a real pleasure. It's almost a reward to solve the &quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;Harder&quot; missions. I damn near started breakdancing when I solved the damn &quot;Hard&quot; version of the frickin' TRAINING mission!Another feature that has never been done before in the history of video gaming is once you create your own ship and save it on your memory card, you can bring the memory card to an arcade and play F-Zero AX, the arcade version of F-Zero GX, and play your ship! The information is shared between the console and arcade versions.I posted an earlier review for Mario Kart Double Dash!!, and I was kind of harsh about it. After owning and playing F-Zero GX prior to my purchase of Mario Kart, I had high hopes that Kart would include the same speed, detail and innovation. All in all, F-Zero GX is THE racing game to own for the GameCube.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2003"}

The wii wheel works ok with this game, but i prefer the remote and nunchuk.  Many people have problems with oversteering, but my problem was the button controls.  I didn't like having to stretch my tiny thumbs into the center of the wheel to press certain buttons.  It also doesn't make you feel like you are a playing a traditional mariokart game.  Graphic-wise this game is beautiful and has bright colors.  The gameplay here is truly outstanding, especially with the ability to do awesome tricks in the air.  It has easy pick-up-and-play controls (if you use the remote and nunchuk) and gameplay for casual players, but is challenging enough to keep hardcores coming back for more.Compared to the other Mariokarts, this game is better than them all except for mariokart Ds in my opinion.  If you didn't like Mariokart DD than don't let that prevent you from buying this game- I didn't get into Mariokart DD and I am addicted to this one!!  The only problem with this game would be the lack of uniquity compared to the other Mariokarts.  For example, those who have played Mariokart Ds and 64 will notice that the track Moo Moo Valley is just a remake of Moo Moo Farm with a few extras added in.  Also, Mariokart DD fans will realize that Dry Dry Canyon is too similar to Dry Dry Desert.  Of course there are a few new and creative courses like Coconut mall and Toad's Factory, but there is still almost too much of the same.Anyway, the unlockables in this game aren't that great.  The are not bad, but no one was begging for characters like Funky Kong to be in the line up.  However, I was excited to see King Boo and Rosalina in the game.  The unlockable bikes and karts are awesome!If you have never played a Mariokart game yet you should because they are all a ton of fun, and there isn't a better place to start than here.  Even people who aren't fans of the racing genre will probably like this game.  With flawless controls and fun gameplay, you can't got wrong with buying this one!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2008"}

If any game proves that visual beauty can't be quantified in numbers, and should instead be described with color, line, and form, it's Okami.The reason is simple.  Okami is the most beautiful game that's ever been made, an opinion shared with major magazines when it was heralded as Game of the Year in 2006 (it was competing with Zelda: Twilight Princess and Gears of War for the title, and won).  Now in 2008 and released for the Wii, still no game has surpassed the artwork in Okami.  After you rescue the first sapling, you'll understand why.The gameplay is more original than magazine reviews would lead you to believe.  They all agreed it's great, but said it's similar to Zelda, though I found it to be much more original, adult, and the gameplay to require more skill and depth.  Pulling off a 4-strike combo, for example, takes the timing of a Guitar Hero veteran.Okami was originally a PS2 title, but don't let that turn you off. It belongs on Wii.  This had to have been made for the Wii, there's no other explanation.  The brushstrokes, which are used for nearly every fight and obstacle, come so naturally to the wiimote, that it's impossible to remember how it was ever done with a gamepad.What's sad is that Okami bombed on PS2.  It had great reviews and a Game of the Year title, a strong fanbase, but for some strange reason nobody bought it, and the development studio went bankrupt.I hope Wii owners prove to be different.

{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"Sam Allen \"A zealous individual\"","summary":"One of my favorite RPGs ever!","reviewText":"Chrono Trigger, released in 1995 by Squaresoft for the long-obsolete (but never forgotten) SNES, is one of the greatest RPGs ever to be assembled. There are a series of pros, and only very few cons.The pros:-For 16 bits, the soundtrack is teriffic.-Same story with the graphics and sound effects.-The battle system is one of the best Square ever came up with.-The originality rate of this game is very high as well.Ultimately, the only con is that parts of the game are a wee bit too easy for some tastes. However, in spite of this fact, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who:A. Owns an SNES.B. Is into RPGs.C. Wants something that will truly mean something in the years to come (it's ten years old now.)Buy it if you are a fan of other Squaresoft role-players, such as the massive 'Final Fantasy' series, the somewhat more obscure 'Mana' series, and also, 'Chrono Cross,' which is somewhat of a followup to this, though none of the characters from this are present, it's still excellent. This may be rare and expensive, but it still comes highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00009ZVHU","reviewerName":"Adam B","summary":"Yea...it's THAT good!","reviewText":"LOVESIT!!! This is one of those adventure games that you just can't stop playing. The graphics are amazing, the sound is great, and the gameplay is incredible. It's amazing how fluid the prince moves in this game and how he controls. You can do amazing looking acrobatics, run across walls, and slow down ladders with ease and without complication. One thing I absolutely love about this game are the puzzles. They always make sense and although some are quite hard, they add a great depth to the game. They are all pretty similar in how they are completed, usually having to go from point A to point B. This is something I found great. I'm not too fond of games that have a great deal of backtracking involved; to me this ruins the excitement of the game. The combat system in the game is also a major plus. The prince can hold one of several swords, in which he can easily slash threw enemies with. Even though these are all great things, probably my favorite aspect of the game is the ability to go back in time. Let's say you accidently fall to your death in the middle of a pretty lengthy part of the game. What are you going to do?, restart and try all over again? No! You can easily just go back in time and try again from seconds before the death, that is if you have any Sand power left. All in all, this game is a great action/adventure title perfect for any gamer in the mood for a very fulfilling story and game.PresentationThe story is great. The menus are some of the best I've seen and easy to track through.GraphicsThe graphics are amazing. The enviroments are stunning. This is just a great work of art.SoundThe dialouge and voice acting is great. The music and sound effects fit the game well.GameplayThe gameplay is really what keeps me loving this game.

{"product_name":"B007CSF3GO","description":"","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"The First Chapter in a Tale of Love","reviewText":"When you hear the name Hironobu Sakaguchi, a few things come to mind: Final Fantasy, a subsequent brilliant legacy at Square, and usually traditional, strategic, turn-based combat. I was a bit skeptical about this game when it was revealed that it had a real-time battle-system. Fear not. This is a very fun, engaging, dynamic, and strategic battle-system that will make believers out of the most stubborn, control-freak traditionalists.This feels like one of the earlier Final Fantasies, with its medieval fantasy backdrop of swords-and-sorcery. It also feels like an MMORPG, with its living, breathing city with various things to do and see. And it also feels like a modern, third-person action game in the ilk of Gears of War or Mass Effect. This meshing of styles may cause you to fear that the resulting game would be a discombobulated mess, but it actually results in a vivacious synergy that captivates the player and invites him or her to keep playing.In the beginning, the game brought back memories of various games from my past - games like Vagrant Story, and Twilight Princess. However, as I played on, it developed an identity of its own. It became evident that the developers weren't following a premade formula for creating RPGs. They were simply creating a game that they themselves would want to play - one with a believable world, likable and relatable characters, fun battle-system, and an entrancing story.Sakaguchi and Mistwalker, along with Nobuo Uematsu, AQ Interactive, Nintendo, and XSEED have brought us a true gem. I would like to thank them, along with Operation Rainfall for making this game a reality for those of us in the US. I hope this is not the last story that Sakauguchi has to tell.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"J. JAGELLA","summary":"Half This Game, Too?","reviewText":"I don't know about other gamers, but I've been getting frustrated with games recently.  They look better than ever, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.  Game play, also, is in desperate need of betterment.  So without further ado, allow me to make Half-Life 2 the \"poster boy\" of recent PC games.  I like this game a lot, but I just feel that it reflects some of the contempt that the gaming industry is showing toward its customers.I won't say too much about Steam because other people have been very vocal about the troubles it's causing.  I needed to wait about an hour to install the five CDs and then sign up with Steam.  It was an unpleasant experience, but not that bad.As for the graphics, they're better than anything else I've seen including Doom 3, but they're not perfect either.  Outdoor levels have low resolution, and as a result the trees often look fuzzy.  Nevertheless, buildings look good with vivid colors and lots of detail.  This graphical sophistication comes at a price, and my system really strained under the weight.  I'd recommend a 3 Ghz CPU, 1 GB RAM, and a 256 MB graphics card if you want to run the game smoothly.Sound is very good although it often stuttered.  Evidently my hardware is a little slow for this game, and I believe the demanding graphics slows your system which can adversely affect the sound.Considering the game play, it's very similar to the first game.  The crowbar is back along with the head crabs.  You can really get engaged in the game play, but in some parts of the game it fell flat.  I found myself fending off tough enemies while having little idea of how to either escape or destroy them.  It could be as much fun as swatting at a cloud of pesky gnats!  Finally, after several tries, I would find the place to get away or the weapon to kill the thing attacking me.  Do yourself a favor and get a good strategy guide for this game.  It will save you a lot of frustration.In closing, I find myself wishing that game developers and publishers would take better care to see that the customer is getting a good product.  Half-Life 2 delivers some fantastic experiences, but these achievements are marred by frustrating and annoying game play on some of the levels, the demanding system requirements, and a bug or two that disallows continuation of the game.  And I must really protest the requirement to set up that annoying account with Steam.  Personally, I'm fed up with all this, and as a result, I have no plans to buy anymore computer games for the foreseeable future.  So developers and publishers, you just lost a customer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2004"}

I cannot disagree with any of the reviews regarding how buggy this game is. How buggy was it for me you ask? Well about 40 complete crashes(holding the power button to restart the console) 6 soft crashes(rare ones where you can at least quit the game and restart without manually resetting the console), tons of wierd little glitches like creatures caught in rocks, people stuck half in a half out of walls, companions disappearing, gun suddenly deciding not to fire, Pip Boy refusing to come up when I have one tick left of life... Well the list goes on and on. That being said, I have to disagree with the people blaming Obsidian for any of this....Obsidian did an absolutely awesome job crafting the world which is the Mojave wasteland. In practically every way, this game is better and WAY BIGGER than Fallout 3. You might wonder how I cannot blame the developers of this game for all the glitches. Seems weird I know. Obsidian is working with the archaic Fallout 3 Engine(which was a minor rework of the ancient Oblivion engine) This wouldn't be so bad if the engine was good to begin with but really it isn't. Of the three games to use this engine, Oblivion was the least glitchy and crashed the least but it DID CRASH. Probably about 8 or 10 times in the 110 hr playthrough(yes I did EVERYTHING) of that game. Fallout 3 crashed probably 10 to 15 times before the GOTY edition. And then we have the GOTY(game of the year for those who don't know) I have another review about this version of the game. Made 100% by Bethesda with no help from Obsidian, this game is easily the glitchiest game ever. Each add on pack(except for Operation Anchorage) crashed from 5(The alien add-on) to 30 (Point Lookout) times. Yes, those were even glitchier than FNV so please don't go around blaming Obsidian. They were just working with what they were given and did an absolutely marvelous job.This game is definitely worth the time. Just save often. It is truly an awesome way to toss away about 100 hrs of your life away!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

I greatly enjoyed this game, but the problem with the game is that it's too short (only about 7 hours top).  The control for Dante is great, but sometimes, the camera fights with you, especially in two instances: boss fights (which sometimes gets really bad for you!) and platform jumping (which is just plain annoying).  The ability to transform into two/three demon-types is great as well.  The graphics displaying the demon-transformation is exceptional, for one of the initial Playstation 2 games.  The environments became even better graphically at the end when all hell broke loose.  There were only a few faults that I can name.  First, the game was too short.  Second, the game was too focused on a single area, and Dante had to continously retrace his steps.  Third, the secret missions and such were just plain annoying.  Lastly, the storyline could have been more developed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2002"}

Now, everyone's allowed to have their opinion, even though I strongly disagree with it and find some scores to be way off. I'll just say that I can't find anything about this game that'd put it on par with some of the worst games out there. Granted, it's not a perfect gaming product and has its fair share of issues,  but none of these really harm the overwhelmingly great experience. This is a very good FPS for the Vita. Even if it were on console, I'd still enjoy it just as much.Firstly, the presentation is pretty much great. There are some drawbacks such as lousy gun sounds and some weak texture detail in spots, but these two things don't harm the game much at all. The graphics are overall very nice, with some nicely detailed gun models, solid character models for lead characters, an impressive soundtrack, etc. The story is also one of my favorites in the Resistance franchise.Secondly, the gameplay is superb. Dual analogs make this a buttery smooth FPS on the go. I didn't know how I'd feel about the touch controls, but I think most of them work well and make sense since you have two shoulder buttons on the Vita instead of four.Thirdly, it's just a fun game that has a good story and great gameplay. An odd little glitch or framerate drop is ultimately just a small drawback and not a game killer.Resistance: Burning Skies deserves your attention if you're a Vita owner looking for the next good game to spend your spare time on.4.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

I allways liked nintendo.  I remember when I was like 4,5 and 6 my mom and dad would play it.  This is a great system for many reasons.  First it is built very well.  The system feels very strong and you really feel like you get your moneys worth.  I bought mine and it took like 8 months for the battery to die.  I play it maybe like 4 hours in two weeks.  When the battery does die it is easy to just plug in and charge.  Also the games are great.  Nintendo may be deemed a kids system but I am 21 and I love it.  I of course own evey system but my favorites are nintendo and playstation.  Nintendo is great because you know they will have great games.  Every Nintendo system has amazing games that you can play for hours and hours.  Even for years and years.  Like the original Mario.  Also the wifi is SO easy to get set up and it is easy to get connected with other players.  I t is also easy to get a friends code and add him to your friends list.  Finally the DS is such a great price for everything you get.  This system will be great for a child, teen or adult who wants something to carry around with them that they can do for fun at any time.  Stay away from PSP.  All the games they ahve out for that system and the only one I like is Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2006"}

Are you hero enough?","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Freedom Force Has Me Fighting Back Tears, sniff.","reviewText":"My jaws sunk low, self-emitting air filed around me, and stupidly I gawked at my PC screen. Since when did a game rekindle my fancy for the first form of literature I warmly embraced? Anime, at times, is juiced up with vague or unnecessary talk with global weight on crushing action, but comic books have grown as a nippy alternative to time-consuming novels with marvelously penciled scenes. Where comics like the dormant Battle Chasers and, all-time favorite, Spawn attenuated my reading and visual proclivity, Freedom Force successfully lands on the video game populace in style. Full of tantalization, the game rips a new outfit on the grounds of gaming. I haven't experienced this kind of cunning direction, ever. Irrational Games assembles a flat-out ambiance which thrusts players into thrilling heroism. The RPG/Strategy affiliation shreds awesome gameplay components. Every description in the game is an indication that the company was rapt on fashioning a game based on the comic book medium. Freedom Force takes in all the legacy and stereotypes of the 60's Silver Age, and on the videogame scale, it rumbles.Sweaty-palm action awaits as soon as you decide who to take from a pool of heroes. After selecting four members, you then jump onto the fray and gain following missions. More often than not, your elite band of defenders must put an end to rampaging supervillains along with their loyal minions. Reasonably linear, the lion's share of Freedom Force is the mastered mechanics, and the ironic yet interesting cost of being violent superheroes. Remember anime (or even Power Puff Girls) where the forces of good take it on the open streets, disregarding the safety of structures, and bulldoze it down? As Uncle Ben once said from Spidey comics, \"with great power comes even greater responsibility.\" Ditto, here. Pedestrians mind their walks of life, cars burn rubber, and in the center, a heated clash between the forces of good and evil. Oh, dear! Oh, my! Being reckless may trigger unwanted wreckage of the city that is supposedly under your protection. Depending on your choice of attacks, Patriot City can be decimated to rubble. Strategic usage of the environment (i.e. lifting cars as projectiles) should be limited due to the sensitivity of the backgrounds. From caving buildings to impersonating Babe Ruth with traffic polls, needless destruction is booed.Devilish destruction reduces the bag of important Prestige Points. Awarded after victory, these points are applied to attain additional heroes. EXP points are also given to prime a hero's abilities or expand them. As an incentive to minimize running amok, if you fail to wisely handpick a fit squad, future supervillains will squash your band of heroes into [mush]. Ample with whirls of Real-Time frenzy, a tide of excellent RPG elements, and the aim to prevent harm on Patriot city, Freedom Force is smart as it is witty.Totally smitten with Freedom Force, it hurts to divulge the minimal frowns upon it. In fact, the game gets terribly hectic without any sign of slowing down. Selecting commands may provide golden opportunities for curt surprises from concealed enemies. Failing to detect them means your good guys go down and dead. Without radar or even a teeny map, studying your surroundings seems like a tactical joy, but the constant, overbearing work is strain for the eyes. Trust me, if you thought 4 heroes is depressing petty, it's enough with the brutal and lighting-quick square offs. Also, no automatic pausing is a pain. Frequent instances of tongue-lashing conforms with the in-game chaos. Even so, the robust personality of Freedom Force dwarfs the potholes floating around it. However, far from perfect, there is nothing quite like this and is the closest thing to match a child's interactive role in a comic book.The hero cast is intentionally cheesy as the Super Friends. Stereotypes of the 60's comics (corny dialogue) forges together and packs a full press of eccentricity. Merciless creatures alternatively keep the 90's evil-doer persona unbroken. Expect the trademark of what Marvel Comics originally gave rise to. Where DC presented the typical \"superhero stops supervillain,\" Marvel effectively introduced a new prospective and presented the personal life of its characters. Freedom Force excels on it too. Character growth was nice to witness, but the cast is so overpopulated that various characters are overshadowed by the stars. Cheesy hallmarks and naturally droll, the clowning occasions in Freedom Force deserves recognition.Voice-overs are gallant, funny, and when called for, somber. Excellent themes manage to merge an exclusive fusion of topnotch sound quality while comic-looking graphics that are so colorfully caustic it'll have your gums bleed. Once a \"FOOSH,\" slashed across the screen, I was tickled by my comic book sensibilities. Characters are fleshed out with exaggerated, superhero costumes and work well with the polygonal construction. The interactive 3D environment and superhero powers are very cool to watch when toyed with. The option to tailor the camera view is welcomed, especially when seconds of disorder surface. The thick quality behind every inch of comic book design has me fighting back tears.\"Sniff, it's beautiful man. Just beautiful.\"Vast in the digit of powers and tactics, the single-player is an experience of immersive frolic. Many people responded with a confounded, \"huh,\" when I asked if they knew the existence of Freedom Force. Can anyone say, \"sleeper hit.\" Hallmarks of the game siphons reality, and lets the boyish imaginings to roam free and putter with the infectious bounties of the game. Logging hours on the extensive single-player, the chance to shape your own characters, appearance, powers, and pick out an assortment of Marvel and DC skins, will have you brewing cup after cup of coffee. Now, to shut these blood-shot eyes. . .","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2002"}

If that's the case, the 2nd+ time you play it and go down a different path, you'll have to do certain things that you normally wouldn't. This is kind of what messes it up, because the first time you play it, you want your actions and responses to be right, or just how you want them to be. Then when you play again, you'll start feeling uncomfortable since you don't REALLY want to do the things you're doing, but just have to do it to see the other endings.After I played it the first time, then started on the 2nd/3rd play through, it started becoming more of a game, and was \"easily-put-downable\" when I started getting frustrated/bored. (Not really frustrated or bored, but the first time you play it you don't want to stop playing because you HAVE to see what happens next, but after you play it once, it loses the gripping factor.)People will say that the shocking twist near the end of the game ruins it; I say otherwise.Though I can agree that it \"may\" ruin it, I still like the way the characters react and deal with the situation.So for me, the game never goes into an \" aw, that ruined my whole experience! \" moment, ever.There are 57 trophies in the game, in which you are awarded by doing specific and particular things within each chapter.I updated this game the moment I got it, which was a tedious 1.1gb download, and with my slow internet I had to wait a whole day until it finished.I never played it before I patched it, but I figured if I'm going to play it, I might as well download the patch; seeing as it fixed camera issues, new main menu and supposedly bonus content (making-of videos).I got the version of Heavy Rain without the blue PS Move compatible logo, so I don't know if that version has the update pre-installed or not, seeing as it's the Move Compatible version.But the patch installed on the previous version installs the Move patch as well, so everyone can enjoy Move no matter what version they have.It's very hard to express why this game is great without telling spoilers; but if you're like me, I didn't want to see a single video of Heavy Rain before I got it, because I knew it would ruin everything - and I can say, if I had watched a video of Heavy Rain prior to gameplay, I would have been upset seeing as playing this game without knowledge of anything is the best way to go.I don't even know if I've started the review yet, but let me start explaining the aspects of the game.The game is single player, has trophies, and has 1 Downloadable Content episode (the game creator has basically said that after they finished working on PS Move version of Heavy Rain, and they started working on new DLC they figured it would waste time, and said that they would rather work on a new project, instead of spending more time on Heavy Rain.)Which I find stupid, how can you \"waste time\" on something that can still be played?But, I am fine with this, especially after playing the first and most-likely only DLC.(*1*) - GRAPHICS: 9.0The graphics in this game are spectacular, the skin textures and overall ambiance are better than any game I've ever seen.I watched video reviews, (after the fact), and I saw that they were all complaining about a few things, one in particular is how this game is supposed to be a cinematic presentation-styled game, yet some scenes of the game's textures are terrible.This is true, even though I don't feel that way about it.I admit, some scenes will have the character's face slimy-looking and textureless, and while these scenes and moments in the game come a little bit too often, it doesn't ruin gameplay aspects, but it will be noticeable and might have an awkward \" uhh \" effect on you and anyone watching you play it.Other than that, graphics are great, one of the few games (if not only) that actually makes rain in a game look good.----------------------------------------------------------(*2*) - STORYLINE: 10I might be a bit off with giving it a 10, but I'll explain.As I've said above, the first time you play it, you just know that the game is just what you're looking for (if you're looking for one of the few great Mystery/Crime games.)Some people will say the game is very slow and boring in the beginning, but quickly ramps up after an hour or so; but I say different. I'm actually pleased that the game developers gave the audience time to introduce the characters, instead of just starting the game in mid-battle or like you already know them and are well-acquainted;The story introduces each character and shows you what their issues are, or what they have to deal with daily, and gives you a starting point on how you want to play with your characters.What I didn't know in the beginning, though now I do, is why all your actions, in the beginning and middle of the game, don't actually change anything towards the story or the ending.But now I see that it's because the game is trying to shape your opinion of your character.It's basically testing you in the beginning/middle of the game, to see what you want your characters to do when it all starts coming down.I do agree, though, that the game gets a lot better after your choices REALLY start to mean something.You honestly start to feel sad and scared when your characters are in near-death experiences.This is the FIRST game EVER, that I was actually scared for my CHARACTERS life in any game.It wasn't like \"Oh no, I'm gonna die\", it was more like \"OH NO, NORMAN'S GONNA DIE!!!!!11!!!1!111!\"It tells you something if you're playing a game, and are actually scared for your characters, instead of only scared that you, yourself, are about to lose a battle.People also say that the characters are good and all, but aren't enough for you to connect with them and get a chance to feel for them. I could say that it's true and untrue. Reason is, you don't ever feel like you're INSIDE your character, but more like you're just looking at them from the outside. However, who can say that being inside them is so great?From what I've seen, looking at them from the outside is still an emotional ride. I felt for each character like it was someone I knew going through these things (all thanks to the introductory part of the game.)This would have to be my favorite storyline of any game, because it's one game that actually left it's mark in my memory; a solid mark.---------------------------------------------------------(*3*) GAMEPLAY - 9.0It's hard to say when it comes to this game's gameplay. I don't know how to explain it.I've read that people say that this game is just one big quick time event, and that they will hate Q.T.E.'s in any game they play from now on. My ending results didn't tally up to that one.There ARE a lot of Q.T.E.'s, but it isn't so much to the point of you wanting to destroy all Q.T.E.'s.I never had a problem with it, or even moments where I thought to myself: \"When will this be OVER!!?!?!?\"When it comes to movement in games, you'd think move the analog left or right to go left or right, but this game is a little bit different. Yeah, you move by holding R2, then moving the left Analog stick in which way you want to go, but it's a bit hard at times. Specifically moments where the camera automatically switches when you walk pass a certain point, then you try to turn left or something, then you'll start going backwards and the camera flicks back to the way it was before you CAME to that point. All in all, it's annoying, but only when you get to those moments in the game.But with that aside, movement in this game is realistic, and never at a time does it make you tired of walking.My game has only gotten stuck 2 times, even though I've had it just a week, but to my knowledge and what I've seen, the game doesn't get stuck every chapter, maybe like just once the whole game.-------------------------------------------(*4*) SOUND - 9.5Personally I love the soundtrack, it complements the weary ambiance and sad game tone, and adds to what you feel for your character. People say that the characters' voices in the game are at-times: terrible. I could agree, but then I think of the reason why people are saying they're terrible. Everyone's voice in the game is pretty much top-notch, except the character Norman Jayden.His voice can sound tremendously weird at times, and will make you a little bit scared for no reason at all.The voice actor would turn some words into the weirdest thing yet. Example; a sentence he said in the game was similar to this: \"All the victims were drowned in rain water.\"  Ok, sound right? Well this is how he pronounced it:\"All the victims wuh drowned in rain wahtuh.\"  It's kinda creepy; it does it on similar occasions in parts of the game.But then, I realized something. This game was made in Europe (Quantic Dream is a European based company) IE: SCEE (Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.) And I guess to people, the way he pronounces things would make them think \"Why is this an American game, and is supposed to be American characters, yet the voices sound like they aren't?\" And for some reason, they think of it as a negative, and that it's bad voice acting.But this game ISN'T American. And though the game's story is based on the east coast of USA, (most likely somewhere along the lines of New York), who says the characters in the game ARE American? Especially with Norman Jayden being an FBI agent, not normally stationed in this east coast city.So I just disagree with statements such as it's an American game, with non-American voice actors.But I will say that at times, at least every character has 1 moment in the game where they sound weird.---------------------------------------------(*5*) MISCELLANEOUSBefore I got this game, I was quite worried about the nudity in the game.Reading on websites, it kind of made it seem like a full-on, non-stop, \"IN YO FACE\" kind of thing.This is NOT the case. There are just 3 times in the game in which you encounter these scenes.Only 1 time will you be unable to bypass it. (2 times if you want a platinum trophy)The first scene you'll be forced to watch, it's Ethan in the shower.It doesn't show anything in the front, just his butt. It may seem like it's going to show more than that with the way the camera moves, but that's it. It gets a bit weird when he gets out and you have to shake the controller to dry him off with a towel..The 2nd scene is when you play with Madison, she'll have an OPTION to take a shower, in which she takes off her clothes, walks into the walk-in shower, and it shows her breasts and butt, that's all.Again, it may seem like they're going to show more than that, but they won'tIt all depends on your views.This scene isn't needed to get a trophy; you don't even have to go into her bathroom at ALL to beat that chapter.The 3rd scene, however, IS needed to get a trophy, seeing that there's something that happens after the fact, and depending on your actions, will earn a trophy.I won't say who, but you're given the choice to kiss a person, or not to kiss.If you kiss the person, then they'll start having some sex! xD But no, what they really do is start kissing, then lay on the floor. You'll have some INTERACTION with the scene, like to either unhook so and sos Bra, or to change position...The only nudity they show in this scene is so and sos Right breast, I'm not sure if they show any butt, but yeah...Depending on your views, this might be something to run home about. And I can say, it's kinda awkward if someone is watching you play, however, it does change the story/ending depending on which you choose. So, good luck with-a-THAT.There are a few bugs, such as during a movie scene where characters are talking to each other, and then some people that are walking around will just walk straight through the characters or any object, such as a desk or wall.I can say that it's really weird when it happens, but it's only a few times during the whole game, and ruins nothing at all.There are also some weird times where the characters facial expression doesn't quite match the situation...You'd know when you see it.It may sound like there are just bugs and problems at every which way, but it's only a few, and is spread out through the whole game, and by the time you encounter one, you'd have forgotten about the previous ones.(*5*) OVERALL - 10At the end of the day, I give this game a 10; because of how the story is told, and what the game makes you feel for the characters is just too realistic. And for a GAME to make me actually fear the outcome and possible regret of a situation is just wonderful. And even though I said the game gets a bit boring after the 3rd or so play through, this is still a game that should not be passed by. If like me, you'll connect to the characters. At first, I didn't like Norman Jayden, and had liked Ethan the most, but after I played it again, I started liking Norman more and more.This is an Action/Adventure, Drama, Mystery/Crime, and Romance.I really hope that this game has created a new genre of games, as I also loved Indigo Prophecy.There just aren't enough, if any, games like this, and have added Quantic Dreams to my list of favorite companies.I hope this review helped.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2010"}

It failed miserably on all fronts.  the graphics are terrible.  The gameplay is totally linear practically a rail shooter.  The zombies pop up out of nowhere and completely overwhelm at every turn which makes it very frustrating but I guess that is the only thing that keeps you from completing the game in about 15 minutes.  It's short no matter how you play it.  You have a few options that don't really end up making that much of a difference in the long run because the game just doesn't go anywhere.  Like an idiot I kept at it, kept trying to find some redeeming feature and just as the survivors are getting airlifted and you think that maybe this is where the good stuff starts, the games ends.  The gamer is playing as Daryl Dixon.  He goes through a few towns, meets up with his brother Merle and finds a few survivors. There is no strategy, few chances offered to outsmart the zombies.  Your options are mainly just blowing heads off or running.  Activision obviously made this game to cash in on the popularity of the television series right now but it's not worth your time or money.  TellTale games has a great Walking Dead game series going on.  I'm waiting for the next installment.  It's a DLC series.  It lives up to the name Walking Dead.  There are so many good zombie games out there, Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, Dead Rising.  I don't understand why Activision couldn't have taken some cues from some of the existing games and done better with this one.  It truly just sucks.

At first when I played through it I didn't really appreciate how smartly designed this game was.  I also didn't realize what Valve had created as far as an infinitely replayable FPS.Shooting zombies is almost guaranteed fun, just look at World at War's 'zombie' variant and its popularity.  But unlike Dead Rising, Resident Evil or World at War, this game's premise is truly fast gameplay against a clever \"director\" that can alter enemy placement, musical cues, item placement and your bot allies actions.  A formidable accomplishment on its own.This game, unlike most FPS, truly rewards teamwork.  You cannot beat this game without your teammates.  And you'll be hard pressed to succeed unless you actually talk to your teammates about your status or what you see/know.  And the great thing is that this incentive for cooperative play is a natural byproduct of the tense \"survival\" style of the game.I would recommend anyone who plays this game (and likes it) to try the developer commentary option (click on \"extras\" on the main menu).  You get to walk through the No Mercy level and hear the developers explain how and why they made Left 4 Dead like they did.  A great bonus that I hope other developers include in their games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2009"}

This game has the best graphics of any Xbox One game I have seen yet. As a launch title, Ryse: Son of Rome has done an excellent job at portraying an amazing historical fiction with the action/adventure genre. I rented this game out of fear it would not be worthy of purchase from some of the professional reviews. Had I purchased this game I would NOT be disappointed in amount of content or the overall experience. That said, I am a casual gamer finding time on the weekends to play. The single player lasted me 7-8 hours on Hard difficulty.Gameplay is slightly repetitive as others have noted, but it did not distract me from the overall experience as hacking and slashing was an extremely guilty pleasure. The gameplay is fluid and just looks stunning on my 60' LED TV. Multiplayer is fun as well and adds replayability to the game.

They can be a bit tricky and difficult or completely easy. I must admit I'm a little rusty with a sniper and any mission with those in takes me several tries. One thing my partner is disgusted at is the amount of cheats I use. I particularly find the all weapons cheat most useful, a tank is fairly good for taking out a lot of cars at one go, or a submachine gun rather than a sniper usually does the trick! And the 'lower wanted level' is a must to get through 'my' game sucessfully. And turning all the pedestrians into zombies was quite amusing as well!The graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is really easy, my friend, however says that he's never teaching my to drive as my driving skills are appaulling! And if you are as bad as me there's hours of gameplay to be had.Just keep it away from the kids.............","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Great engine but lacking a story","reviewText":"The makers of Doom 3 faced the same quandary as Valve did with Half Life 2, how to make a sequel to a game that was extremely popular in it's time, but after a break of several years the gaming environment had changed completely.  Half Life 2 managed to pull this off by essentially giving us a new game that referred only to some main elements of the original, and the gaming engine was playable on average hardware back in the day.Doom 3 went the route of trying to make a new game using a lot of the game play style of the original, and largely floundered.  The main good point is the graphics engine, which still looks good today.  Having sharp and clear animated displays on the walls, an almost fully rendered environment, and little details everywhere such as legible magazine covers all added to the realism.  It required high powered hardware back then, which is now pedestrian.  Part of my reason for replaying it recently is to see how things looked now that 512MB and 1GB video cards are common place, which were unavailable in 2004.  The engine simply looks great, however things pretty much stopped there.  The flaws are as below:The game is almost entirely dark corridors and hallways.  Part of this may have been due to the limitations of the video cards at the time, as rendering an outdoor environment would have been difficult.  However, the non-stop theme of darkness and monsters coming out of corners is good for only a few levels, and then becomes numbingly boring.  It's nothing compared to the level of scares by some games such as F.E.A.R.There is a back story told mainly by notes on PDA's and data files, this also get repetitious as most of it is filler to add to the atmosphere and mood.  Underneath the guise of fleshed out world it's still finding keys (or in this case data on PDA's) to get through doors and fighting through levels up to a Boss monster.Details are sharp and clear mainly because there's no atmospheric haze to speak of, and everything including the people has a subdued metallic look to them.  The characters are what has probably aged the worst, as they simply don't look very good today.You have to manually edit a cfg file to get a wide screen resolution.I really can't recommend Doom 3 as a fun game, it was an astonishing technical exercise for the day but otherwise is at best an average gaming experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2010"}

He made the mold that many have copied even now forty years later. The idea of using Connery in a Bond game was a great one. There are unfortunately some problems that hinder the experience.The graphics are decent no where near Everything or Nothings, but a decent effort from EA. The voice acting is where this game falls apart. Sean Connery now sounds nothing like James Bond. Now he is of coarse older and has a thicker accent. That accent annoys me in every cut scene throughout the entire game. They should have just kept with the dialogue from the movie and pulled it from the archives. Some look past it, but it annoyed the hell out of me.The game plays like EON, but the cover system doesn't work as well. There are many times in the game where you simply duck behind cover because you can't latch to it. Now that would be alright, but you still get hit when kneeling.The levels are also a little bland using a lot of browns and blacks, but the game feels enough like a Bond game that you can forgive that aspect. The driving levels are rather forced and feel like an afterthought in this title.The story itself basically follows the movie with some additions here and there like an extended ending. I liked the new ending and prefer it to the original actually. Throughout the game the story really puts you in the shoes of Bond and you feel like Sean Connery right down to his body mannerism and melee style.Another great addition to game play from EON is the multiplayer. It is the traditional death match, but with added traps and even jet packs to fly around in along with vehicles.In conclusion if you are a fan of the classic Bond titles then you will find ways to love it. Now if you are a modern Bond fan then I think you can still enjoy it for its core shooting mechanics though not perfect along with its well written story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2010"}

It came early on in the systems life, in an intense drought and offered huge upgrades over the original when rail shooters still had some demand remaining. It even introduced the rumble pack and was one of the early successes in local 4p multiplayer on a console.This remake sort of arrives under the same scenario, there's very little available for the 3DS, and it'll be a few more months before even the standard franchise updates begin to hit let alone all of the oddball RPGs and adventure games the DS was known for to a lot of us geeks.Sadly, Star Fox has been left behind in the last decade, with so-so experiments and farm outs to third party developers being the only successors. The tradition sort of keeps on. While Star Fox 3DS is a solid port of a classic it is starting to show it's age a little, no new content or mechanics have been introduced, the additional visual coat of paint is only about a half generation above the original so ultimately you're just looking at filler.If you've never played it before, I recommend it but if you're just looking to relive some memories I'd wait for a price drop or move on.

In the other games it was about exploration and adventure but in this game its all about survival, this game has no exploration or sense of adventure and the best way for me to describe the gameplay is being pushed into an alley way and forced through the level, if you've played the last game Tomb Raider Underworld this is not a sequel it is a complete refreshing of the whole series. This isn't the first time a game series has been ruined since Square Enix took over Eidos, Hitman Absolution was also a complete let down taking away the openness and freedom that made the games unique in the Hitman series. Sleeping Dogs was originally the 3rd game to the True Crime series but it was scrapped by Activision and picked up by Square Enix, the game was interesting but it felt very short and small compared to most open world games. The point is ever since Square Enix has taken over they have ruined some game series especially Tomb Raider and Hitman so I would be cautious of playing any game developed by them, if you can try to rent this game before buying it or pick it up used if you can find it under $15 because it is VERY DIFFERENT than any other Tomb Raider, I personally did not like the switch from adventure to survival.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"Trent Steele","summary":"The best Splinter Cell yet","reviewText":"Ubisoft did a pretty spectacular job with this game.  Despite the lack of Michael Ironside as the voice for Sam Fisher, Blacklist is easily the best Splinter Cell to date.  Featuring a strong, probably 12-hour campaign with a wealth of unlockable upgrades and plenty of co-op and competitive multiplayer action, there is plenty of fun to be had here.  There is a tremendous amount of production value, and the gameplay incorporates the best features of the entire series for an overall solid experience.The gameplay centers around 3 different play styles.  \"Panther\" is the stealthy player who leaves a trail of bodies in his wake.  \"Ghost\" is the stealthy, non-lethal player that leaves no trace.  And \"Assault\" is the player that runs in guns blazing leaving a smoking husk behind.  There are a ton of gadgets to unlock that are well suited to different play styles.  You get grenades: flashbang, tear gas, smoke, frag and incendiary.  You get mines: shock mine and proximity mine.  You get distractions: sticky camera, sticky noise maker.  And you get the tri-rotor UAV.  Some of these gadgets, like the tri-rotor, can be upgraded to be more effective.There are ton of guns to unlock and upgrade.  Each gun has a certain number of attachment slots that you fill by purchasing upgrades from a pool for each gun.  They allow you to upgrade the attributes of the gun and sometimes make them silent.  After unlocking the best guns in the game by upgrading the home base (a mobile operations aircraft called the Paladin), I found most of the other guns didn't even compare.Upgrading your suit changes your appearance and gives you better stealth or armor attributes.  They also include additional slots for more gadgets and ammo clips.  Each piece of your suit can be customized by choosing to purchase different colors with the game currency.The gameplay is polished and quite slick.  Returning from the previous entry in the series, Conviction, are the cues to move from cover to cover.  Sam can incapacitate enemies from any position and nearly any vantage, though some enemies are more heavily armored and can defeat your advance if attacked from the front.  There's also a more inherent use of shadow than the previous game.  Previously, if you were in shadow, you were automatically hidden.  Now, unless you're in complete shadow, enemies might see you.  There's no silly light meter like in previous games.  You also typically have a second to incapacitate an enemy if he sees you -- just before he yells for help.Missions are fun.  Most don't require you to be undetected, but give a cash bonus if you remain so.  Typically heavy reinforcements and dogs come when you get detected so there is a strong incentive to remain hidden.  Other missions favor an assault approach, but I found that the missions that pigeon-holed you into a certain class were rare.  There are a wealth of co-op missions to play through, and some can even be played solo.  I found these to be quite enjoyable and well-done side missions to the main story.The story is mostly vanilla Tom Clancy stuff.  It was fairly predictable, but the voice acting is great.  Anna Grimsdottir still has the same familiar voice, but Sam Fisher is no longer voiced by Michael Ironside, regrettably (apparently he wasn't up for the mo-cap).  Briggs is a new character that acts as the second in co-op missions.  I appreciate the inclusion of Briggs because it shows that co-op was designed into this game from the beginning.The game can be pretty difficult.  I played mostly on Normal because I have limited game time these days and I didn't want to spend a lot of time restarting (load times are looong on the 360).  The challenge offered by Normal was adequate.  For some missions I had to enlist the help of my brother to complete via co-op.  It's a good time.Outside of the mission based co-op, there's also a competitive multiplayer called Spies vs Mercs.  Spies have a hacking target and Mercs have to defend the target.  Spies are 3rd person.  Mercs are 1st person.  Each side has 3 canned class types and 3 custom slots that you have to unlock.  Each class has a certain special ability such as cloaking on the spy side or enhanced vision on the merc side.  The classes seem fairly well balanced and the mode is a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, I don't think it has legs to carry it well into the future and I worry that it will be a ghost town a few months from now.I highly recommend this game for fans of stealth action.  It aims to please all play styles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"Ground breaking, but...","reviewText":"This is one of the hardest to write reviews I have ever done. I know Bioshock is art, its story and interaction are just amazing. The way the story plays out combined with the voice acting and setting are just ground breaking. I should love everything about this game, that being said this isn't one of my favorite games, and that is just my personnel preference. The actual FPS portion of the game is tried and true, where it excels is the way the story plays out. This is much more than just a game, it is easy to see the political and social ideas that come into play. But it is not necessary to read into it and it can be enjoyed for what it is, a good solid FPS with a great story line. The game play is rather familiar though, there are a good number of 'go and fetch an item' and 'go and kill this guy' quests. To me it felt as if  it slowed the flow of the game a bit. The shooting and weapons are nothing terribly new but do have their own feel to them. The plasmas on the other hard are pretty neat, though if you have played a good FPS/RPG that contains a magic system you will be pretty familiar with it.  But all up, love it or hate it, Bioshock is a game you really need to play if you consider yourself a gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2008"}

Somehow I fall for it every year thinking that they will improve the game but all they do is tweak stuff around. First off I tried creating a Franchise team and the game froze on me right where it announces the two teams that are playing. Then I finally got past that part and played through the game and it froze at the very end. I was so pissed off. I ended up playing Ultimate Team Mode which is a fun idea but the mode itself seemed a bit left out in the dust. I do like some things in this game like the motion of the players feels a lot better compared to previous years. The new Gameflow feature I thought was a good idea but needs a lot of work. I think EA's license with the NFL is up after this year so hopefully 2k can take a crack at it and make a solid football game for once. Until then I will just rent these crappy Madden games to get my football fix.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2010"}

You can read the stories to kids and mess with the voice playback to sound a little more cartoony. You can save your readings and play them a later date. I think technically, this product fails on a couple of levels. I feel like the voice playback usually sounds kinda blah and it has an overall feeling of rinky-dink cheapness to it. Even the mic doesn't feel particularly sturdy. Still, there's a good mix of stories to read (though you may want to avoid \"The Little Candle Girl\", which I had never read until this game introduced me to it.

'Assassin's Creed 2' is one of my favorite all-time video games and buying this trilogy collection, which includes it's DLC and two sequels ('Brotherhood' and 'Revelations') was a no-brainer. Unfortunately the way the games are packaged onto the disc is a bit strange and the HD space required to run all three games may turn off some gamers.The first thing that booted up when I popped in the 'Ezio Trilogy' disc.....was 'Assassin's Creed: Revelations' (the third game in the trilogy). There's no in-game menu, no automatic way to switch to playing the other two games. I had to quit 'Revelations' (after it's mandatory 4+GB install) and after selecting AC2 and Brotherhood from the dashboard menu the games install....I mean COMPLETELY install to your HD. By the time I had  AC2, Brotherhood and Revelations ready to play I had taken up 17 GB on my hard drive. Even stranger you're still required to have the disc in your system to be able to play each game (unless you want to play Revelations you'd probably want your auto-run turned off). To be fair it DOES say what's required on the back of the box and you can always just install AC2 OR Brotherhood by themselves (each takes up about 6-7 GB's) but those hoping to have all three games play off one disc will find these features a nuisance.I will say 'AC2' and 'AC:Brotherhood' play beautifully on the PS3 without any of the bugs I remembered from their initial launches (UBISOFT did a great job cleaning things up). Graphics are smooth as ever and being able to climb buildings around renaissance-era Italy and Ottoman-ruled Turkey is still incredibly fun. Story-wise I'll never warm to Desmond's present-day narrative but getting involved in Ezio's quest for revenge and discovery is just as compelling as I remembered.I'm not against having the option to install games to your HD I just don't like it being a requirement. 'The Ezio Trilogy' comes with three great games and if you can deal with this package's quirks the $40 price is a steal (individually they're $20 each if you download them off the network w/o AC2's DLC).

The sequences where everything is falling apart around you and you have to keep moving are incredible. Never have I been so a part of a game. Button pressing sequences are brought back in this game, and I think they are done correctly. Combat is great in this game, but it wouldn't be Tomb Raider without tombs, right? Everything to do with tombs was done perfectly. The look of the tomb, Lara's dialogue regarding it, and the puzzles you have to solve in order to get to special chests. The island is littered with tombs, relics, documents, and so much more; get out there and explore!The storyline was riveting and engaging. I didn't want to put my controller down. The characters are well written and definitely interesting (villains included.) I think they did a fantastic job on Lara.

{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"Gary S","summary":"With improved graphics, more online modes and superior character customization, Vegas 2 is one of the best sequels ever.","reviewText":"The Good:- Graphics were my biggest complaint with the original Rainbow 6 Vegas. It looked like a PS2.5 game. Well, rest assured Vegas 2 corrects this glaring problem with significantly better graphics. From textures to lighting, scenery to players, graphics have been improved across the board. It's still not up to COD4 standards, but pretty damn close.- Gameplay is top notch, as expected from the original. Cover is easy to use and a key aspect of this game. Unlike COD4, Rainbow forces the player to use strategy to succeed.- Character customization is excellent. You can select every detail - clothes, armor, guns, even camo patterns. As you progress through the game, and move up in rank, more items are unlocked. What's nice is you earn XP regardless of what game mode you play - single player, online or split screen. That's a nice touch.- Location design is fresh, highlighting the darker side of Vegas this time around. You'll still get to tear up some casinos, but you'll also play in junk yards, train stations and refineries. Online mode level design is also well done, covering a wide range of locations.- Speaking of online mode, this aspect of the game has been enhanced. There are more modes to choose from, a more robust XP/rank system. I also found it easy to join games, better than COD4. My favorite mode is terrorist hunt.- Sound - good use of surround with excellent explosion and gun fire sounds.The Bad:- Sound glitches - I found a few instances were the rear surround speakers crackle or pop. Also, sometimes after killing an enemy their gun fire continues to sound off. I'm surprised these obvious bugs were overlooked.- Story modes lacks a good story... but it's not a big deal.- As mentioned above graphics could still use some improvement.The Verdict:Overall, this is an excellent sequel. It fixes the problems of the original and builds on all the things that were great. If you enjoyed the original Vegas, or just like 1st person shooters, this game is a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Chip L \"chip1978\"","summary":"A graphical upgrade to a great game","reviewText":"Halo really was exciting when it first came out over ten years ago. The graphics, for the time, were amazing and it broke the mold in terms of the first person shooter gameplay. What I liked best was that the story in Halo was rich and deep without being convoluted or overly simplistic. Ten years later, the Halo universe has expanded exponentially with games, books, comics, and a short animated series; yet I still think the original Halo had the best story in the series.This game is a graphical upgrade to the first Halo - and almost nothing more. The graphics switching (between old and new) is a nice feature that I use way more than I thought I would. It's interesting to see how the game looked 10 years ago and then press a button and see the upgraded graphics. The gameplay hasn't changed a bit - literally. Because the old game engine runs with a new graphics engine overlaying it; the game literally plays exactly the same as it did 10 years ago. If you were looking for a remastered Halo with all new level design and new AI (and let's face it, after 10 years the AI feels kind of dated), then you're going to be disappointed.Of course, besides graphics there are other upgrades. You can now play cooperatively through the campaign online. You can also find \"skulls\" throughout the campaign which, when turned on, can change gameplay (e.g. infinite ammo, or double enemy toughness). Perhaps most interesting, 343 studios has inserted video \"terminals\" into the game. These insert backstory and plot points that were not in the original game - although they do not change much of the original game. While interesting, the truth is all these terminals can already be found on youtube; so I certainly can't point to the terminals as a huge \"plus\" for the game. I suppose I should also mention the audio is also upgraded; but I can't tell much of a difference between the old and new audio. (Fans of the original should know the voice-acting remains untouched; don't worry about Cortana or Captain Keyes sounding \"funny\").I know a lot of players are upset that the game's multiplayer uses the Halo Reach engine rather than old school Halo. Ultimately, I think this allows more people to play - both Reach fans and people who bought Halo CE. I remember those LAN parties with the original Halo and I have to say I don't miss having to set up 2 xboxes and 2 TV's and enough guys to make things interesting. I can understand, though, why some people might feel like Anniversary really left something out.If you didn't like the original Halo; you won't like the updated version. But if you're a fan; or if you've never played Halo, I think you'll like Halo Anniversary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053BSNZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Best UFC Game So Far","reviewText":"Warning: This is NOT a Button Masher!  You need to practice!!!  But after putting in the hours, the game becomes fun and feels rewarding because you earn every win.  I'd recommend the UFC games for fans of the sport and fans of fighting games.  There's a good deal of strategy here and the game is so realistic that you'll actually be able to get more enjoyment out of watching the UFC if you learn how to play this game.  You'll have a better understanding of the strategies and how the techniques work together.Concept: 9/10Sports games fall on a continuum of Difficult Simulation and Fun Arcade Game.  This UFC Game is right in the Middle.  It's got all of the current weight classes, fighters, personalities, graphics, introductions, from the sport, so it feels really authentic.  The gameplay is complicated and takes about a week to learn.  But, MMA is complicated because it combines punches, kicks, wrestling body control, and jujitsu submissions.  All of these disciplines play pretty well and after you learn how to play, the game is fun.Game Modes:Exhibition - 1 fight - pick a weight class, 2 fighters, and go at it.Title - take a famous UFC fighter and fight your way through the contenders to become the champ.Title Defense - Once you are the champ, fight the best of the best to keep your title.Career Mode - Create and Manage your fighter, train to become better in certain aspects of MMA, and fight your way to the top.VS Mode - fight a buddy - (Offline ONLY)Gameplay: 8/10It feels like there are so many ways to lose in an MMA fight.  You can get beaten down for 3 rounds and lose a decision.  You can get beaten down severely and get KO'ed.  You can get hit with a flurry of powerful strikes in rapid succession and get a flash KO.  You can get thrown onto the ground, dominated, and KO'ed.  You can get thrown to the ground and submitted.  But all of these techniques can be used on your opponent, too.  Knowing when to use the techniques is as important as knowing how to use them.Striking:  9/10Standing and trading punches and kicks.  You can target your opponent's head for a KO, the body to drain your opponent's stamina, or the legs to slow them down and nullify their takedowns.  You get BONUS damage for excellent timing.  If you catch an opponent coming in and beat them to the punch, you do more damage.  If you dodge their attack and counter, you also deal Bonus damage.  This takes a while to get used to, but once you do, it's pretty fun.  You can also catch kicks by grabbing your opponent's leg and counter punch them in the face.  Not only is this rewarding, but it also deals bonus damage.  On the easier difficulties, the game is almost 100% striking.  It's a good way to learn.  As you play harder difficulties, the AI starts incorporating other aspects of MMA like grappling, transitions, clinches, ground and pound, and submissions.Grappling:  8/10You can grab your opponent in a clinch, deliver knees, elbows, and punches, or throw them onto the ground.  Once you're on the ground, you can move the R Stick in semi-circles to change your position.  You can pull the right stick to \"block\" or cancel an opponent's transitions and keep them where they are.  You can grapple from the top and bottom while delivering punches and kicks to ground and pound your enemies.  Certain positions on the ground yield better results.  For example, if you are in your opponent's guard, you can't punch very hard because you can only swing your arms.  If you get on top of them in a full mount, you can deliver haymakers to their body and head and go for a KO.  Grappling is pretty easy once you learn the positions and how to block your opponent's transitions.  But it takes a while to \"get it.\"Submissions:  8/10When you are grappling, you can click the R stick to go for an arm bar, choke, etc...  This brings up an Octagon with a Player 1 BAR and a Player 2 Bar.  The length and speed of the bar is determined by your grappling skill and current stamina.  Each Player can move their bar around the octagon shaped track.  (like 2 trains)  In order to submit your opponent, you just have to overlap part of their bar with part of yours.  This is easy when you both have large bars.  To make an opponent TAP OUT, you have to keep your bar over theirs and a gauge starts to fill.  But you have a limited amount of time to fill it, otherwise your opponent escapes from the submission attempt.  The bars can pass through each other, so you can try to move away, or move through the other Player's bar to escape.  It's kinda fun, and very suspenseful.Training:  7/10In career mode, there are training exercises to boost your stats.  These are 2 minute mini-games where you practice your moves.  Depending on how well you did, you get stat boosts for your next fight!  But training in opposite disciplines may actually lower your stats in the opposite discipline.  So if you are a striker who wants to learn grappling or submissions, your punch and kick stats may drop a little bit.  When training, it's important to be well rounded, but not abandon your most effective techniques.  Most of the games are easy, but you don't get to practice them.  They just throw you into them and you have to do your best in 2 minutes.  It's frustrating at first, but gets easier later on.Graphics: 8/10The graphics look pretty good and authentic to the UFC.  The venues, octagons, and crowds look great.  The fighters all look like their real life counterparts, but they could look a bit better.  When the fighters take damage, their face swells, they bleed, sweat, and their body and legs turn reddish-purple from the repeated hits.Sound:  7/10The music is great and the commentary is from Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg.  Most of the time, the commentary is on the mark, but sometimes, they'll say something strange.Multiplayer: NONEThe THQ servers are down because THQ went bankrupt.  There was online support, but not anymore.Maturity: TeenIf you like the sport, you've seen blood and fighting.  There's no profanity or anything that you wouldn't expect while watching a UFC.Replay Value: 8/10Since the game takes a while to learn and even longer to master, you'll be playing it for a long time.  However, the lack of an online multiplayer mode really hurts.  I'd recommend going through the tutorial, then a bunch of exhibition fights first.  Then take a pre-made fighter and fight your way to the title.  Once you are familiar with ALL aspects of MMA, try the Career Mode.Overall:  8.5/10If you are willing to put in the hours, the game is fun!  Because it's so difficult, every win feels great!  You can enjoy the UFC game for at least a month, even without online mode.  I'd recommend it if you are a fan or casual observer of the UFC.Unfortunately, THQ is no more and EA bought the UFC license.  Hopefully the EA Curse won't affect the UFC and hopefully, they'll make great games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2013"}

Players take on the role of a wiser, more industrious heroine who sets out in this third-person 3-D action game to free Wonderland from the tyranny of the Queen of Hearts. Alice will confront a host of weird creatures in surreal settings and solve numerous puzzles through more than 15 levels of gameplay.","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"Wow","reviewText":"I had a little trouble installing this game, but once it started working, I knew it was worth it. I get annoyed by most disney movies, but this definitely saved Alice for me and put it into a new light. The main character has attitude, but also loves her friends. She's trying to straighten things out in her head after a terrible incident, by fixing Wonderland. Many familiar Alice characters are there, and they're all much more interesting now. The combat is fairly simple, the gameplay can be challenging, the music is nice in the background, and the story is engaging. This game disturbs you at times but in a good way. Get this game if you're into darker plots.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Radaar\"","summary":"See The Light of Zelda","reviewText":"Once again, Nintendo is able to give a stellar addition to the popular Legend of Zelda series.  Despite the fact that the games usually contain the same three core characters (Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf), the games continue to be original.  More importantly, though, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is engaging, challenging, and fun.A few centuries after the events of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the descendents of Link and Zelda, who themselves are also named Link and Zelda (the various games in the series take place across various time periods, with the main characters being represented by ancestors and descendents, all of whom strangely share the same names).  Link is a farmer in a southern province of Hyrule while Zelda is, as always, the princess of Hyrule.  In an interesting move, the people that link lives with may not exactly be Hylians; Hylians, including Link and Zelda, have always been characterized by their pointed elf-like ears, but Link's fellow villagers have rounded ears that we have.The first few tasks of the game have Link dealing with mundane tasks in order to learn the various controls for the game, which, for the Wii version, is extremely important.  However, after being asked to bring a gift to the royal family, mysterious and shadowy beasts show up and enshroud the land in a mysterious twilight.  Link is turned into a wolf while trying to fight the monsters, and is subsequently knocked out and jailed.  While in jail, he meets Midna, who helps free Wolf-Link in exchange for help with a yet-to-be-revealed task.From there, Link and Midna work as a team to rid the land of Hyrule of the strange twilight.  The quest takes Link and Midna to previously seen locales of Hyrule such as Death Mountain (where Gorons live), Lake Hylia, Zora's River (home of the Zoras), and Gerudo Desert.  New places include Snowpeak (home to one of the strangest dungeons I've encountered in a Zelda game) and Link's home of Ordon.As the game goes on, Link's quest takes new turns and has events that are some of the most epic actions I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  While Ocarina of Time was an epic tale overall of how Link, Ganondorf, and Zelda first crossed paths, there are moments in Twilight Princess that seem to be taken directly from The Lord of the Rings.  The final battle of the game is also very well constructed and fun to engage in.The Wii gameplay is amazing.  Swinging the Wii Remote to swing Link's sword, pointing the Remote at the screen to aim the bow, and using it as a fishing rod truly bring the player into the game in ways the traditional control system could never attempt.  It also allows for a much smoother form of horseback combat than that present in the N64 versions (though it was still difficult).  If you have a Wii, I definitely reccomend this version over the Gamecube one (the only downside is a loss of continuity; since Link is usually left-handed, the programmers were afraid that right-handed people, who are the majority, would have trouble using the sword, so they flipped the game around; what this means is that Gerudo Desert is now in the East and Kakariko Village and Death Mountain are now in the West, though in the Hyrule in Ocarina of time, the desert was in the West and Kakariko and Death Mountain were in the East).I have to say that the only thing that I would change about this game is the inclusion (or lack thereof) of magic.  For some reason, even though magic exists, Link does not have a magic meter.  Therefore, there are no spells or magic arrows (or green potions), and the Magic Armor, which makes Link invulnerable while wearing it) is powered by rupees, which can be very annoying.  Still, aside from the complaint, this is an amazing game.  The story is fantastic, the gameplay is top-notch, and the graphics are amazing.  This game may not be as good as Ocarina of Time, but it is very, very close.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"Strange concept.  Addicting game","reviewText":"I know what you're thinking: \"PAPER Mario?!  What on Earth were the executives at Nintendo thinking when they released this?\"  Well, let me say that as dumb as the title sounds in concept this is one of the most ADDICTING RPGs on any console.  I'll have to divide a few categories to fully describe the entertainment value of this game.Gameplay:  It is pretty straight forward with a turn-based combat system, but certain button combinations will allow you to perform special movies and inflict increased damage on your opponents.  Also, as Mario you are joined by a multitude of various sidekicks that essentially cover the major species from the various Mario games.Graphics:  They are pretty good, in all honesty, considering they set out to make an environment that resembled paper.  Everything looks as good as \"Paper Mario\" for the Nintendo 64 could, and sometimes the effects are able to impress the gamer.Child gamers:  This is a great game for kids that they will just eat up because of the familiar characters and the humorous dialogue.  As someone who grew up on games like this I can confirm without a doubt that Paper Mario will have kids laughing and enjoying themselves for hours on end unless they just don't like the gameplay.Adult gamers:  After several years I dusted off my Nintendo 64 because being older I wanted to go back to games I didn't play as a kid, such as GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, but before I did that I decided to dust off my old gaming cartridges for nostalgia's sake.  Soon I had popped in Paper Mario and there I found myself sitting there intently playing it again.  Sure, the humor won't entertain anyone over the age of thirteen, but the gameplay will have you interested.Paper Mario is just a fun game, plain and simple.  It is still my favorite game in the long running Mario series of games alongside Super Mario World and I give it a very high recommendation for anyone with kids, or who just wants to have a clean and fun gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2009"}
