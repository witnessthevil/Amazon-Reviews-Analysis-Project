{"product_name":"B00006599O","description":"Turok: Evolutionis a prequel that takes us back to the origins of the Turok lineage. In the beginning of the game, we see our hero, Tal'Set, fighting nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms. All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore--each with unique traits and damage. Flight sequences now enable players to soar through the skies on a winged pteranodon, and scripted event sequences bring the world to life with stunning detail.Turok: Evolutionfeatures 32 types of prehistoric and indigenous life rendered with frightening realism. The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences. Great care was also taken with the multiplayer modes, which were developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers, and artists.","reviewerName":"TorridlyBoredShopper \"T(to the)B(to the)S\"","summary":"Roll Over, Fetch, Die: Things to Teach Your Pet Dinosaurs!","reviewText":"I personally like hunting dinosaurs. There's something about running around with a quad-barreled shotgun and tearing into raptors that makes me feel giddy, and there's something even more fun about taking a compound bow, zooming in, and taking something's head off. Seeing little monkeys sitting in trees or prehistoric crocs swimming around and thinking, \"I should kill that\" just makes the day pass so much better. Perhaps its that \"melon hitting the sidewalk\" sound that makes it enjoyable when I fire, or perhaps it's the fact that the limbs coming off and oceans of blood flowing at a distance just look interesting.Yeah, I like the fact that the game is interactive and that I can want up to a brontosaurus sitting in as background, it looming like a titan above the terrain, and I can introduce it to missiles that bore into its skin simply because I can. I like that grinding sound that says, &quot;that's gotta hurt&quot; to me, and it doesn't get old no matter how many of them I kill. Its so - exhilarating.Added to that is the fact that these dinosaurs running amok aren't all beasts you've seen on the Discovery channel. Somewhere along the evolutionary pathway, some dinosaurs became bipedal, started practicing the fine art of carrying weapons and enslaving humans, and they're truly what make hunters happy. While its true that running into a stegosaurus with missiles flashing off its back is interesting (and a shock, depending on the situation), the people hiding and taking shots at you are what make it interesting. I personally like finding them, taking a weapon that lets me pick them off from afar, and watching them spout blood over the side of a cliff as they cry to their mommy gods for a better form of band-aid. And, since I'm doing it to save the human race, it alright and makes me a hero to boot.Turok does have a few graphic problems, mind you, and it isn't a game that everyone would enjoy. Sometimes the things you have to do are a little tedious, and there are some stages I didn't like. I personally thought having to fly around on something and pick enemies off was a waste, and I could have done without some of the stealth mode boards. Still, the range of what you can accomplish, the amount of weapons and the way some things sneak up on you, makes up for that. Once you grow accustomed to having to jump in first-person (not always easy when judging distance) and control with one analog while aiming with the other, it actually improves your skills. You become a dinosaur death machine, leaving corpses with missing appendages temporarily (yes, they don't stay around too long) in your wake. And that, most of all, is what I enjoy.I wouldn't go as far as to call this a hard concept to get, either, no would I call the missions all that difficult. I breezed through the boards pretty steadily, sometimes killing myself with weapons that didn't work the way I thought they would and sometimes setting myself on fire when I got crazy with the napalm attachment to my flame-thrower, but that was just me and not something the game did. Most of the time you simply have to get from point \"A\" to point \"B\" without getting torn up too badly by snipers, bigger guys with bigger guns, and the ever-roaming dinosaurs. And that's not that hard. In fact, you can make a game out of it now and again, baiting one on the other and introducing a gun shooter to the teeth of a beast chasing you as you mad dash to get away from it. That was a fun feat for me because I liked moving through the terrain and killing, and I like killing with style. The only thing missing was a wall to hang the heads of things I killed on.Added to that are the interesting little games you can play on two-player mode, making it something you can break out and humiliate your friends with. Some weapons only work in two-player settings, giving you new objectives to tack on to competition, and there are a few setting that let you exclusively do certain things when wanting to burn a little time. You can fight with only clubs and bows, for instance, opt to have all the weapons, get stronger every time you pick off a player, and a multitude of other things. And everyone knows that the ultimate humiliation is getting a chance to hold down a friend on a game, beat on them, and then laugh a lot at them in front of a host of their peers.I personally feel that anyone that likes hunting games, enjoying tracking their enemies down or tearing into wildlife that sometimes reacts to it, might want to give it a try. I like games that let me simulate hunting bear and mountain lions, but what's a bear when compared to the chance to plug an armed Thunder Lizard with my compound bow? You simply have to overlook a few of the graphic problems, understand that the enemies' sounds are redundant and that they aren't that smart, that it is a quick play, and you'll be fine. So, happy hunting, and please, for the sake of the dino children, quit trying to eat those lizards you kill! Their families would like to have an open casket funeral at least one out of three times (the odds of them getting out of a good headshot), you know!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2004"}

Zelda's 3-D games aren't the only ones that have been praised, however: fans still rave about SNES classic A Link to the Past and 2005's Minish Cap on the GBA was also well-liked. Now, the series takes a natural move onto the DS. Phantom Hourglass is a real winner in the series and on the system, making use of every DS function imaginable and delivering that same old Zelda experience we've all come to love.Phantom Hourglass is a follow up to The Wind Waker, and the story takes place pretty soon after its predecessor. Link, Tetra/Zelda, and the pirate crew are on an adventure to find new lands when they encounter the ghost ship, and Tetra is taken aboard. Link tries to jump onto the ship to save her, but falls into the water and wakes up on Mercay Island, where he meets a fairy, Ciela. Link soon finds out what he must do to save his friend and later becomes involved in an even more important adventure to stop the evil monster Bellum. The story is pretty good, and many memorable characters such as Linebeck make the dialogue interesting.Phantom Hourglass is played in the style of the 2-D Zelda games with a bird's eye view, but everything is in 3-D. Essentially, it's a new definition of 2.5-D. You move Link by directing him with the stylus, which works very well and is almost as reliable as a regular control stick or D-pad. You attack by touching an enemy or swiping the touch screen, and you roll by drawing circles on the edge of the screen. All the action is there on the bottom screen, but the map on the top screen is incredibly handy and useful, and you can even write notes on it! There are also a handful of nifty button shortcuts that make equipping items and bringing down the map all the quicker, and they're nice to use when you figure them out.The regular Zelda gameplay is evident in the game as you go through a dungeon and find your way to the next, but the game's huge world is traversed on a boat, and that's where Linebeck comes in. Although your reluctant helper can prove annoying on the journey for the hero, he provides transportation, which is essential to getting anything done. When you set sail, you draw your route on the touch screen and the boat proceeds to move along your set path. As you go along, you can shoot bombs with your cannon or salvage for treasure.Of course, the bulk of Phantom Hourglass is, like in all other Zelda games, the dungeons. This time around, the dungeons are really fun but almost disappointing at the same time. Of course, going through a dungeon has always been great fun, but in Phantom Hourglass, most of the dungeons present little to no challenge. They're generally really easy. I hardly broke a sweat getting through the first five dungeons or the game and I normally am in need of a guide right off the bat in a Zelda game. While the lack of challenge is a bit disappointing, the puzzles are still great and extremely clever. Of course, you also have your arsenal of items to help you, and the touch screen is put to good use when you're using these items, like drawing a path for your boomberang or bombchu and aiming your bow or grappling hook.The biggest challenge the game presents is in one dungeon you constantly revisit throughout your adventure: The Temple of the Ocean King. After almost every sub dungeon, you go through a little more of this one big dungeon to get a sea chart leading you to the next area of the sea or getting some information that'll help you get to the next place you need to go to. The main concept of this dungeon is the Phantom Hourglass, the game's namesake. While in the Temple, your hearts will be constantly drained when outside of safe zones, but only if your hourglass is out of time. As long as the hourglass has some sand of hours left in it, your life won't be sucked out of you. The sand can be charged up by going outside the Temple.The dungeon is also home to Link's most formidable enemies: the phantoms. They roam the corridors of the Temple and chase Link when they see him. If they hit you, you'll lost a minute's worth of sand and start back at the beginning of the floor. Unfortunately, you will have to go through the same floors several time before the game is over, and you'll get pretty tired of doing them over and over. This is the game's biggest issue, and there isn't anything else that really hurts the game aside from the mild difficulty.Phantom Hourglass displays some very nice DS graphics. They're viewed from above, but they're 100% 3-D. While you play they look very nice, but when you go up close in the main story parts, they don't look quite as good. Still, the cel-shaded graphical style is a winner yet again. The sound is also great with nice effects and good music.Thre is also a nice multiplayer feature available. You can use local wireless or Wi-Fi. One player plays as Link, and the other commands three phantoms. The Link player moves around the dungeon floor bringing force gems back to his area while the phantom player draws paths for the phantoms with a map and tries to catch Link. It's pretty fun to do, and it involves quite a lot of strategy to succeed. There is also a ranking system for this as well as achievements.Aside from the main adventure, there's quite a lot to do. There are the gems to collect that power you up, there are heart pieces, bomb bags, arrow quivers, treasures, sea charts, and... well, more. If you want to get all the stuff, you'll take quite a long time to do it, but have fun as you go just because of how enjoyable the game already is.To sum it all up, Phantom Hourglass is an excellent game. It provides a great Zelda experience, albeit an easy one, and shows us even more of what the DS is capable of. It's easily one of the top games for the system and is worth a spot in any Zelda fan's collection.Gameplay: 9.0Graphics: 9.0Sound: 9.0Value: 9.0FINAL SCORE: 9.2/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

This is a game for when you want to bust some baddies for an hour or so and then do something else.This is the draw: You have a spinning boomerang blade thing on your arm you can throw at enemies.Later on you get the ability to slow time down and actually drive the \"death boomerang\" through the air manually.If you are not sold on that idea, get the demo off PlayStation network and give it a go. That's what got me to buy the game.Cons:Story is thin soup, another \"amnesia\" hero. But the setting and atmosphere (creepy rainy euro doomsday) is nice.There are some \"puzzle\" moments that are really out place and slow the game down, but just check for online guides and move on.Boss fights are both interesting and slightly annoying; there is always sort of a puzzle element to them. But that what makes a boss fight a boss fight.Not very good close combat system, just one \"bonk\" attack.Cool Stuff:The hero basically slowly turns into a walking death machine through the game.Lots of great \"Predator\" like upgrades. You even get a few \"auto kill\" animations for stunned enemies (these can get old after a while, so mix it up with close and far combat).Your other non-blade hand can carry a pistol that you can fire away with while your boomerang is still out there flying around.Or you can grab an enemy's gun and use it before the gun self-destructs. The fun part is that conventional weapons don't really work that good on monsters, so you just grab a gun, empty the clip, drop it and move on. It's an oddly rewarding experience in comparison to the usual \"save your ammo\" play style on 3rd person shooters.Shoot and slice your way through \"Zombies\" in the dark.

The fighting system is convoluted, over complicated, and not ever explained very well. Dimensions breaks this barrier with a great Chronicle story mode that introduces these complicated techniques little by little so you can absorb it and it works great. The story mode is entertaining but nothing to write home about. You play as various characters trying to stop Alpha-152 which is Kasumi's evil clone. DOATEC is trying to use this to destroy the ninja clan Mugen Tenshin.The fighting system actually is complicated but after the story mode you can actually use it. There are the usual combos of kick and punches, but you can juggle opponents and stun them in a critical state. You can throw and hold opponents while holding is kind of a counter attack you can actually counter a counter in this game. If someone counters your attack with a hold you can counter back or get out of the hold. Understanding how to do this take some getting used to but it adds some strategy to online fights. You can also do a super stun which is called OHing an opponent and this means they can't counter. There are also special stances that the characters go into which can be used to strategically add extra combos without the opponent knowing. You can also delay attacks in combos to kind of trick the other player in thinking your done so they stop blocking.The fight system is fluid and smooth with great animations and controls, but my favorite part is that the combos are listed on the bottom screen so you can tap them or just use them as a quick combo list. This is really handy and actually makes playing the game more enjoyable so you aren't constantly pausing the game to remember a combo. On top of this you can now tag team which is fun and adds some great combos into the fray. I liked the extra modes such as tag team, and infinite mode, and of course the showcase mode where you unlock figurines to take pictures in 3D.There are a lot of costumes to unlock to make the females look more sexy or the males look more cool and StreetPass and SpotPass are wonderfully integrated into the system. I'll have my 3DS in my pocket all day when going out then come home and have a few challenger ready to fight online that I passed when going out. I might even drive by a few SpotPass areas and come back with some downloaded costumes. Dimensions really utilizes these features and I have a blast using them.With all that said the 3D effects are amazing and really show off the systems features in this way, but overall the graphics are smooth and crisp and look very detailed. I highly recommend Dimensions because it's the best fighting game on the system right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B008277M0Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"This Year's FIFA scores BIG!","reviewText":"The BasicsSo, what's in the game?From the start you get a ton of game options in the menu which really hasn't changed that much and still easy to navigate.  A new mode is EA SPORTS Football Club Match Day, which is a really cool feature that will let you play with the `same experience' as the real world news and gossip. You will hear commentators talk about players who have been transfer listed, who are on the bench, injuries, and any other bits and pieces that can be reflected in-game. Also you will see players who are hot/cold and its effects on their gameplay. You do however have the choice to turn this feature off, but I would really encourage anyone playing to try this feature.  You still also have the ever popular Football Ultimate Team which is similar to a Card Collecting Game where you buy virtual packs of cards with players and incorporate them onto a team.  You also have extra skill games yo can play to kill time (more on this in a moment) as well as many different online modes.Graphically speaking, the player faces looks a little sharper this year and a little less plastic. But where the game shines is on the field. The Player Impact Engine looks to be more improved with better collision detection and little nuances such as players jumping over sliding opponents or more realistic falls when crashing into each other, and even players grabbing on to shoulders when jumping up for headers. So far, with the new animations, the game looks to be a lot more put together than last year's version. My only minor gripe still has to do with the lighting effects on the field -- something that Konami seems to have a better handle on.Control-wise, it's still familiar but the biggest difference I have seen is with the First Touch Control. There really is a difference in feel as a player first gets a ball from a pass as they bring it in, attempts to change direction and keep control of the ball. It's definitely not like it's been in years past where you just get a pass and go and it's not a gimmicky trick added to the game. There is a change when you see a player in FIFA 13 get a ball from chest to foot and gains control to start running versus what you've seen before in past versions where a player gets a pass and off he goes.  Also, I've noticed that one has to be really careful when passing into space as you just can't pass and hope for the best. If you aren't careful, you can overpass your teammate, into a completely wrong direction.  Also the AI will make many spirited attempts at passing and many times balls that aren't outright intercepted can bounce in a totally different direction.There are many mini-games you can try prior to starting your match, which will go a long way into improving your game. Some include teaching you how to lob a shot into the goal with the objective of having you lob the ball over a few boxes and hit a target while getting the ball into the net. You get points towards doing these activities and I think when the game goes live, you can use these to your created player but I will revisit this when the game is released.The game's AI seems to be a bit better this year and one of the things I have noticed this year is how well the AI plays on the ball as well as playing near the ball. One of my biggest gripes with the last two iterations was how a player with the ball could run past opponents and, on some occasions, either that was too easily stripped or no attempt was made to take the ball. So far in the game, I have noticed more times when the AI and my controlled player got into tussles trying to get possession of the ball as sometimes occurs in games as well as realistic challenges with slide tackles. I have seen players more aggressively step in front of other players to cut off passing lanes, block crosses and stop shots. But the biggest difference is when shots are taken and balls that bounce off either the goalkeeper or the goal and go back into play. In previous versions my frustration was that when that happened, no other teammate ran forward to make another attempt to finish the goal. Everyone stayed rooted to the spot or started running back down field. This time (and I actually scored many different times because of this), I saw players rushing up to try and finish the missed shot and put the ball into the net.So what's the deal with the updates to the Player and Manager Career Modes?I jumped right in to the 2 modes I was most eagerly waiting to try: Player Career and Manager Career and to be honest, you can see where EA ripped the pages from Konami's PES and actually improved the formula.Player Career - How I Spent my Weekend in Northampton TownOne thing that has always been daunting about playing FIFA games especially as a new player is that the player career mode was unforgiving.  You create your player and your stats were always low and you either jumped in and swim with the big fish or you get booted from the team especially if you were trying to make it with a big club like Inter, MUFC, Barca or PSG.  This year's iteration takes a very different approach, one that even PES doesn't take.  You have the option of creating a player and signing him to any club that you choose but the rub here is one way or another, you manager may send you out on loan to improve your skills. As it happened with me, I of course created my player and signed him onto MUFC, and after 2 games, SAF sends my player to Northampton Town FC. I was bummed, I mean I really felt like I was sent out of sight, out of mind but...the beauty of this mode is this.  You are given goals to work to.Unlike PES' career mode which 1.) sends you to a team  and forces you to work your way completely up and 2.) your only clear objective is to do enough for the team to stay in the Starting XI, the club that you play for regardless if you are starting  or loaned out, you are given a set of objectives(primary and secondary) to play for.  Some can be making a certain a amount of goals in a season, keep a certain rating average, getting assists and a few others.  As you play of course, any special skills you pull off gets added to your player.  That much has not changed, so your player does `develop' as your season progresses. My player build started off at 67 and after 5 games, my player's overall skill is 70 and I am getting a few unlockables along the way. This is a much different take than other past FIFAs as you are responsible for your player's growth and yes, the manager still controls the game including tactics and line up. As the season has progressed, I saw the call for internationals and of course, my player is nowhere near ready to go, but seeing the announcement, made me want to play more so that eventually my player does get called up.  This is a mode that PES has been touting for years but in one fell swoop, EA may have this right after doing the right amount of tinkering with.Manager Career - Sitting in the Manager's ChairI think it's safe to say that FIFA 11 and 12's manager mode was the same thing with no changes and I was hoping and praying that this really would have been fixed in this year's mode. While some fixing has been done, there is still a lot to do but suffice to say this more has a FIFA Manager Lite feel to it. So, everything you know and love is still there. You still need to pick your Starting Xi, wrangle transfer negotiations, set up your scouting networks and the like but this mode is a little more interactive now but not by much.  For instance, you can still have times you can talk to the press before games but still there is no reason to do it as it doesn't have an outcome one way or another with management , supporters or your opponent.  Another item I saw that may need addressing is that when negotiating transfers, you have to have almost perfect finesse in moving players whether buying or selling. In many cases, once talks break down, that's it.  Teams will not come back to the table for no reason and because of this you have to plan accordingly. You can have a transfer deal already sealed up and ready to make your next move when negotiations between the player and their team fall because they can't agree with wages. Be prepared for this to happen...a lot.  However, there is a lot of interaction going on with your manager and the club execs during the season so you won't be bored. And no, you won't get called up to internationals right away similar in Player mode but you will see announcements about it, this game awards those with patience and perseverance.  Another plus too, is that if your team has qualified, you can start your season off drawn for Champions League and Europa League (although the names have been changed due to licensing) and competing at the proper times. Another great touch is how players now will interact when they aren't getting enough play time, want to sit out a match or even beg to start at the expense of another team mate and even more priceless is the reaction you get from them AFTER a game.The Bells and Whistles - The Small Stuff That CountI think for any sports game made, many can pull out minute details that may have made the game for them. Be it the way a transfer has gone to a way a player does a celebration, FIFA was a love it or hate it game sometimes based on the small potatoes.  There are a lot of little things that this game does that I even wish the American juggernaut Madden NFL would do.  For instance, when playing a season, before you start a game, you have the choice of getting other scores and news announced from around the league. It's a nice touch to hear midway through your game that a player on a rival team has gotten a red card or was scored on via a PK. And it happens frequently enough that you stay informed and infrequently enough that it doesn't take away from the game.  Even when a player gets hurt during the game you hear whether or not that player will come back or is out.  You even get to hear a full recap of scores post game as well as an announcement of upcoming fixtures.Another nice and small touch is how much the commentary is improved.  Yes eventually you will start hearing the same things over and over, but a nice touch is to hear how well or how bad a team's form is coming into a game or if a player is on the bench or up for transfer but most surprisingly, how a new transfer may be playing against his former team.  For instance, in my Manager mode I picked up Holger Badstuber from Bayern Munich and when I went to play them a few weeks later, I was shocked to hear something to the tune of `we will see how this new acquisition will fare today against his old club' and was pleased that someone thought long enough to put that in there. What I am waiting to hear is manager sackings.And as mentioned slightly earlier, there is more interaction in the menus.  Big stories pop out which may prompt some action from you, audio alerts will pop up from time to time and so on.  You can really see that a clear effort has been made from EA this time around to make this year's game a more polished game rather than a roster upgrade from previous years.Graphically speaking, the game has been improved; the Player Impact engine has changed the game giving an air of unpredictability to matches and the improvements in the Career and Manager modes has given more meat to modes that were suffering.The downsides are few but what I saw was:- Weird day and night cycles especially when players are subbed.- Every once in a while scoreboard results and audible results didn't match- Inconsistent commentary as the game opens, some games you get a mouthful from martin andAlan, some games they are deathly silent- Game saves can get corrupted so save often!- More audible chants!!! I may make a real effort to get some this year and put them in game-There is still a great deal of improvement to be made and should EA gets complete rights from PES in terms of tournaments then it may eliminate PES completely ( I hope this never happens as competition keeps game makers on their toes!) which reminds me,  it is theoretically possible to recreate specific tournaments.  You have enough tools to replay the Euros and the World Cup but you don't have all the bells and whistles to do so until those `add ons' appear.After having a full weekend of play and eagerness for Tuesday's disk release, I may not have a need to play PES this year.  I can only hope that these improvements carry over into the Vita version although it's a downer that there is no cross play.As an EA FIFA fan this is a must play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2012"}

As a result, most people reacted badly to it and were rather critical of it (probably overly so). Fact is, I actually like this game quite a bit. Sure, the graphics aren't very good, and jittery to boot, the voice acting sounds like it's straight from a SciFi channel original production (it seems to relish its cheese factor) and there's a lot of aimless wandering at times, but for some reason it's just plain fun.The game is very much a mess, but it's a wonderfully entertaining mess once you clear out some of the rubble. If you think of it as a Z-movie rip off of Oblivion (easy to do after playing the XBOX version for a while) you'll enjoy it more. Heck if I know why, but I Keep coming back to it...probably because a lot of the aimless wandering ends up feeling more memorable in this game than a lot of the overly guided plots of other games. This is about as open as games get. You can do what you want, when you want to do it. From an old-school role-playing viewpoint, that's really what it's all about. I also love the powering-up of your character as you progress, turning your once-weakling adventurer into a veritable powerhouse, largely by picking through the remains of your vanquished foes. That aspect reminds me very much of Diablo.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2010"}

Like i said this was my favorite game because not only cuz of the graphics but the storyline was soo great in this, and the music scared the heck out of u. When i heard capcom remaking the RE games i was soo excited (except for the fact they were remaking them on the gamecube), anyways i got over that at least cuz i now have a Gamecube (got it for less then 80bucks) well they had the resident Evil remake and so i was waiting for the RE 2 &amp; 3 remakes and when i saw the screen footage for it, i was like what is this a joke or are they really just throwing the same game from playstation to the GC. I was really dissapointed.. what is the point in buying the same game with the same stuff in it as what i have. U know i even bought a new  RE2 on psOne for $14.99 cuz it was in a thinner case. Thats how much i like this game. But when i heard they smoothed the graphics a bit im thinking ok sounds good enough to buy right?? Not really.. i saw the price to be too high, $39.99.. i was thinking, why in the world would u spend that much money on something that wasnt really fixed up.. u spent that amount on the remake of RE1 and got alot out of it, the same for RE 0. but even though its dropped now its still kinda expensive. really $29.99 should have been its original price when it first came out then drop down to like $20 or something.. but nope.. so my suggestion is if u havent played this RE game yet.. buy it.. if u have played it then i would probablly wait til they drop it down again b4 buying it.. or just keep looking on here for a good price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Old School Gamer \"What the hell's a gigawatt!?!\"","summary":"I've been with this series since age 12 and love this game.","reviewText":"I first got Diablo when I was 12 years old. I spent most of an entire summer just trying to get the online feature to work through a 56k modem with a buddy of mine. It worked three times and failed. Diablo II came along when I was about 18 and I spent another whole summer playing with 3 of my friends hotseat in a comp room we had set up. The online for that game was laggier than all get out, so we had to.Now comes Diablo III, a game I will honestly say didn't have me very excited if just for the fact it's been so long I've lost my thirst for a new incarnation. But I found a copy of the CE and got it because Blizzard CE really are worth something eventually. I am running an Intel Q-6600 chip, ATI 4870(pretty old card now), and 4 gigs of ram and I was surprised to see I can run it on the highest settings with 1920X1080 resolution and never have a hiccup. It installed in 8 minutes flat. Things were looking up.So I got to the main menu. It looked *exactly* like WoW, a game I've played a combined 2 years off and on but left because I hate online games(because of the childish communities, not the gameplay). I loved it, honestly. It made gave me that feeling of excitement of exploring a huge online world just seeing it. I started a Barbarian because I always play melee first.Contrary to a lot of haters here, I love the choice of the first area being Tristram. It sets up a connection between this and past games. It evokes nostalgia, something I dig. At first the game felt linear like Warcraft III's level design compared to Warcraft II, but it quickly opens up into the classic map strcture but with a little more exploration. The thing that strikes me about the levels so far is that they at least added sidequests or what they call \"events\" you have to search for, so there are actually other things to find other than your objective on any given map.The action gameplay is part and parcel the same as the previous two, but what game that is a Diablo-clone has ever gone anything different? Titan's Quest? No. Torchlight? No. You can't fault them for something that is unchangable. They actually did make it somewhat deeper by now giving us a multitude of attack skills to place on either your left or right mouse button, as well as the 1-4 keys. I personally love the stripped down design because it's more about participating in the action actively than defining the \"perfect build\". This is a symptom of what the MMO genre has done to the mentality of the gamer. It's not so important to pick where your stats go because the important thing that fans are forgetting is that classes have 1-2 main attributes anyways. No one is going to spend all their points on Intelligence for a Barb, nor would you put everything in Strength for a Mage. All Blizzard did was do FOR YOU what you were going to do already. Is it really that hard to see this people? The attribute assignment thing is *not* important.Crafting now takes a large role as a result. You spend money to train a blacksmith who makes your better gear. The Auction House serves as a good place, but prices are typically high for good gear. The real goal is to find recipes to make your own. This is brilliant to me. The main draw of a Diablo game is better gear. It always has been and always will be. Blizzard, apparently, gets this better than their supposed die-hard fans. There is *always* a chance you'll find new recipes and make better gear as the game has content added. The game doesn't end simply becuase you beat it. Want to beat it on Hell...alone??? Well, you're going to need some pretty damn good gear. Gear defines the character, but this is the same as half the classes in WoW, yet no one complains about it there.The story, the world, the music is brilliant. It's of a rate higher than either of the first two and yet it trounced by, once again, hardcore fans. The voice-acting does the job. The story itself is more prominent than either of the last two(so how can it be WORSE? and it does the basic job of getting you to the next zone. Neither of the last two were Heavy Rain-esque stories people. Get over it. The music is the best in the series. I actually listen to the soundtrack in the car and I don't do that for just any game.I must make it abundantly clear as well that I have had no problem with the fact I have to be online to play this game. I understand the entire issue, trust me, and I likewise want all my stuff on disc. I'm not *for* purely digital content. That said, I'm playing this game in single player, non-public games and I've yet to experience a hiccup with a computer that, while still pretty good, isn't top class anymore. This game doesn't require that much power and the online thing is an issue only if you have A) a shoddy router/network card or B) you live in an area with bad connections. I'm fortunate I don't have either, but I can understand if some of you do have the latter and that this game being online-required makes it nearly unplayable.I don't want to blither on for 70 paragraphs trying to detail details you've all heard about. If you're reading my review it's because you're hoping to see an honest opinion about enjoyment of this game. Diablo I and II are two of my top 20 games of all time merely because they had me so enamored of a world in which a videogame resided. Only Blizzard could turn a 40+ hour gear-hunt into a game with more draw to it than Fallout(ok, maybe the same amount, but hey =). They have done that for *me* yet again. Nothing much has changed, but who was asking for it to? I sure as heck wasn't. I wanted the same exact wave of demons breathing down my neck. The same bleak world full of holes for me to explore and things for me to kill. I wanted the same act structure, gear hunt, choice of classes, etc etc etc. Blizzard didn't reinvent the wheel and this long-time fan is so very glad for that.FYI I take one star off only because it isn't a perfect game, but few are. It could have done with a bit more customization in classes, but I think they're all so vastly different it doesn't matter much in the end. It's also a patchable aspect of the game. They did it with WoW, they could do it here. It's also slightly shorter and more easy(on normal anyways) than Diablo I or II. But again, few games are *that* tough. There is also the fact I know Blizzard will eventually gouge me again for an on-disc version. I very highly doubt they'll patch it in, but maybe early adopters or CE purchasers will get lucky or something =/","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Salvatore Paradise","summary":"funnest zelda game i've played in years!","reviewText":"this is the second time i've played this game. i bought it soon after it first came out in 2005, however playing it again nearly a decade later, i didn't remember much of the game at all. the last zelda game i played before this was the newest zelda, 'a link between worlds' and i must say that this game (and other zelda games from this era) was far more fun. i played 'link's awakening' and 'oracle of ages' last year and i now strongly feel that zelda really hit its stride in the GBC/GBA era.this game in particular has its own unique and imaginative gameplay. a large portion of the game centers around the ability to shrink down to 'minish'-cule size, in order to achieve things in the field that regular-sized link can't do. this aspect of the gameplay is intergrated into puzzle-solving and even sometimes a boss fight. the sword you use in this game, the sacred sword (not the master sword) has the ability to charge up and produce multiple clones of link, depending on its levels of strength as the game progresses. this is also another aspect of the game that is deeply integrated into puzzle-solving and boss fights. it can be a lot of fun but also very challenging because the link clones all disappear if one of them are hurt.lastly, a fairly large aspect of the game is collecting kinstone pieces and fusing them together with random people, puzzles, etc. a kinstone piece looks like a half of a coin with a tri-force on it. the coins are cut in a number of unique patterns and colors. fusing kinstone pieces can reveal secrets in the game or can sometimes be necessary to advance.other than that. it's a pretty standard zelda game. fairly short, even with the sidequests, so if you think most zelda games are long, this one may be more up your alley. as far as items go, you have the standard zelda inventory: shield, bombs, arrows, boomerang, lantern. some perennial favorites from past zelda's like roc's cape and the pegasus boots, along with some new items that i will leave to you to discover on your own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"No Title","reviewText":"When LucasArts made KOTOR(Knights Of The Old Republic), they got put on the map.

Although it's survival horror, you'll only be scared by the intensity of the battles and wits of the enemies.The traditional zombies are gone and have been replaced with psycho villagers and weird chanting cult members.

{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Learning Curve but Kind of Fun","reviewText":"A long-awaited sequel to \"Nights into Dreams\" for the Sega Dreamcast, \"NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams\" has a similar theme to its predecessor. The main character, NiGHTS, is an acrobatic being who flies around a dreamscape battling creatures of nightmares.The main character is NiGHTS, a mischievous jester who works against a being that seeks to take the spirits of people who dream. The two other protagonists are a young boy and a young girl, who for their own reasons have been having nightmares recently and come to the dream world to escape their problems. However, only through defeating the evil being can they save the paradise of their dream-world.The game looks 3d, but is actually 2d. The levels are in most cases racetrack-shaped, looping around so that it's more than just a straight line. NiGHTS flies around, leaving a trail of pixie dust as it goes. If the pixie dust is formed into a loop, a small portal is generated that destroys enemies. NiGHTS' main other technique is a drilling boost that smashes into enemies in addition to making NiGHTS go faster. The goal of missions differs from area to area; some involve chasing enemies to find keys, while others simply involve flying through a set number of rings. After completing some missions, boss fights with special conditions will take place - though they're more of \"puzzles\" or \"challenges\" than traditional boss fights.There are also platforming sections where you play as the \"dreamers\" - whichever child is currently \"dreaming\" at that point in the game. When playing as a dreamer, there is a time limit before you are pursued by creatures that try to \"wake you up\" (a \"Night Over\" is basically a \"Game Over\", so waking up essentially equals losing). There are some things you can do to avoid waking up  - finding treasure chests prolongs your time, and you can distract your pursuers by throwing blue chips, which are small collectible items found on the stages.The game is more complicated than it really ought to be, but that's really only in theory - in the game itself the concepts are reasonably accessible. The only problem with gameplay is that, due to the 3d field hiding what's really a 2d track it can be hard to keep track of what's in the foreground and what's in the background. This remained my most constant issue throughout the game - since most of the objects consists of brightly colored, but relatively featureless, shapes, it was difficult to tell things apart, and as such it was easy to become disoriented.The graphics are good - about standard for a Wii game, which means a little bit behind what's considered \"Next Gen\" but still pretty good. The camera (as referenced above) is the biggest problem, often undoing the simple fun of flying around by pointing at an angle that makes it hard to see where exactly you're supposed to be going. Sometimes it switches from a straight-on camera to a third-person following camera, which complicates things even further.As a whole, NiGHTS can be kind of fun, once you figure out how everything works. Besides the main game, there's also multiplayer (local or online) and \"My Dream\", a small garden where the enemies defeated and good creatures saved by NiGHTS are sent and can be interacted with. Both of these add at least some extra play value to the game. It's difficult to say what's wrong with NiGHTS, because there's not much particularly wrong; it's just not fun to play for the most part. It doesn't handle that well, and the camera makes it worse. As a total package, it can be pretty good, but it's kind of difficult - annoyingly so - to pick up.7/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

It's hard not to compare games and rank them based on genre and replay value. Since this falls into the FPS genre with an online multiplayer mode, the standards are pretty high. This game is boring. The character trots from one part of town to another, shooting down enemies, occasionally running into a tougher enemy, and going through a series of unexciting events and bland dialog. The game is linear, talking to other characters does not reveal anything, there really is not much to do besides comb every corner for hidden cash and 'intelligence' clipboards.The supernatural powers and weapon upgrades are fun for a short time but since there aren't many variations of enemies in the beginning, it's a sleeper.

In many ways MIRROR'S EDGE is a great game, but in a few, significant others, it sucks big time. Firstly, it's yet another buggy, console port, which is becoming par for the course, sadly, for us PC gamers. Despite this, however, the visuals are good apart from the character models, which are below normal PC game standards. But the most important aspect of the game is the gameplay. When you're free-running through the city it's a true joy to play. The recreation of parkour techniques is remarkable and DICE have created a truly immersive experience. But then you're forced to fight, and that's where the game fails miserably. The combat in this game is the worst I've ever encountered. It's so bad at times that there isn't room in a short review to detail the failings, suffice it to say it's maddening, especially when you're forced to replay a particularly tricky section because you have insufficient control of Faith when in combat, or because she transforms from a nimble athlete into a trudging hippo as soon as she picks up a gun. And yet, even though I wanted to throw my PC out the window many times while playing ME, I'm so glad I stuck with it because, at it's best MIRROR'S EDGE is an inspired example of what computer gaming can offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Frantic, Engaging and Amazing","reviewText":"Uncharted 2 ended up being a smash hit.  Perhaps one of the best video games sequels ever produced.  It was better than the first game in almost every conceivable way.  It's hard to imagine any follow up to Uncharted 2 being half as good but rest assured, Uncharted 3 is just as good as it's predecessor.  If you played the first two games and enjoyed them then you simply have to play Uncharted 3.The story in Uncharted 3 is a bit more rich and defined than the first two games.  Nathan Drake is back and this time he's searching for the Atlantis of the Sands.  It has something to do with the ring he inherited from Frances Drake.  But a woman by the name of Katherine Marlowe believes that ring is hers and it ultimately holds the key to finding this lost city.  On paper Uncharted 3 sounds pretty basic, but watching the story in action showcases a strong character driven narrative.  In particular players will learn more about the dynamic between Nathan Drake and Sully.  The cast is remarkable and charming.  And we learn about them not just through the cutscenes but how they interact with one another during some of the moments in between the actual cutscenes.  The dialog and banter between them is charming, humorous and sometimes even heartfelt.  There are also moments that can, and often do, feel as though they've been ripped from a summer blockbuster.  Though some of it is definitely over the top, the character driven nature of the story is what ultimately makes it so good.  Like the first two there is a distinct human element at play that makes the simple situation an interesting one.The cutscenes are aided by extremely good direction and motion capture as well.  The characters feel human.  But more than that, Uncharted 3 is simply a beautiful game.  The environments the game takes place in are detailed and the animations are smooth.  The Uncharted games in general are some of the prettiest you'll ever see.  But it isn't just that they're visually astounding, it's that their detailed and encompassing.  The environments come alive.  Other details also stand out a lot.  Water or sand is amazing and the way the physics work is also amazing.  If there's one thing we can clearly say about Naughty Dog, it's that they'll never skimp on the presentation of a game.  The voice acting is equally as good and charming.  Some of the best you'll hear in the industry.  As you play and watch the characters interact and hear their voices it's hard not to love them.  You'll be drawn into their personal hell and anguish, but also their joy.  It's all great on the eyes and ears.Gameplay wise, Uncharted 3 hasn't changed too terribly from the first two.  There is a good amount of gunplay, platforming and puzzle solving throughout the adventure and the game does a very good job of balancing them all and pacing things along.  The gunplay in and of itself hasn't changed much.  You'll find yourself charging from one firefight to the next, taking down the bad guys and picking up their weapons or replenishing your own supply of ammo.  You'll also take cover to avoid fire and pop up to shoot when the time is right.  You can also enter melee combat which is fun as well given how much it has improved over time.The platforming sections are generally among the easiest to acquaint yourself with.  You'll find yourself scaling walls or jumping from ledges or hanging off objects all in an attempt to keep yourself from falling too far.  Despite all the detail, the path is usually laid out for you.  This is also true throughout the entire game.  You'll rarely get lost or not know where to go next.  You'll also rarely find yourself backtracking as a result.  Aside from a few of the hidden treasures off the beaten path, there's no reason to really deviate from your destination.  And if something should happen where you find yourself stuck, the game will point you in the right direction.  The puzzles are pretty creative and simple.  You won't find yourself stuck for too long, given that the game will provide hints thanks to a journal that Nate carries around with him.The game handles all of this well, rarely keeping you in any given situation for long.  What is more amusing is how much adventure is truly packed into this game.  The second game, in particular, had amazing moments: A helicopter chase across rooftops, an amazing train sequence, a game of cat and mouse with a large tank and a jeep chase were just some of the second game's highlights.  Uncharted 3 does a little more.  Without spoiling anything, you'll find some of these moments leaving you quite breathless at the spectacle.  It's not the situations themselves that are amazing as it is how the game presents them.  You'll even find yourself scaling and shooting at enemies firing from above and watching as they tumble forward and fall past you.  It's amazing stuff.Without a doubt the biggest overhaul is multiplayer.  Before the versus primarily had you on teams but here you can do a free for all or three teams against each other at the same time.  You still have other modes such as the co-op survival mode or a variation of capture the flag.  You also still have tons of different boosters to equip.  But you can also enter matches with temporary boosters (called kickbacks) which you can get by earning a certain number of medals.  They're not permanent but they help for those who may need that small boost.  Likewise, for those who want a truly hardcore experience you can always go onto the hardcore battle arena.  The maps are also ingeniously designed.  Not only are your opponents people you have to look out for, but so are some of the environmental effects.  In one level a sand storm rolls in, for instance.The most rewarding is the co-op experience.  Sure you can still go into an arena and do a survival mode and whatnot, but there's actually a co-op campaign here as well.  And it's a full blown story campaign, complete with cutscenes and everything.  You can team up with two friends and go at it.  It's remarkably satisfying and pretty addictive.Uncharted 3 isn't perfect by any means.  Like the first two before it, there's a lot of precision in playing.  For example how the game times some of its jumps when say... platforms are falling from beneath you.  Or cutscenes that run seamlessly into gameplay.  If you're not on the ball you may find yourself retrying certain segments constantly.  Some moments can feel like a trial and error practice simply because you don't know WHERE to go immediately and thus you fail until you figure it out.  Since Uncharted 3, like the previous two, is very straightforward and linear you generally only have one option out of a situation.  If you don't find it fast enough in some of the more time sensitive moments you're done for. In other situations your timing may be off by just a second.  Uncharted has always been somewhat of a challenge but most of it comes from the first hand experience.  When you play through a second time things tend to flow more seamlessly when you know exactly where you're going and what you're doing.  The good news is that checkpoints are everywhere.  If you end up failing a platforming section or a gun fight you usually tend to start right next to it.  So the game won't punish you too badly.Uncharted 3 is a great follow up to Uncharted 2.  Whether or not the game is better is up for debate.  The multiplayer suite certainly is, but for some fans who were truly blown away by Uncharted 2, they have to face the fact that the third game isn't exactly the same leap forward that the second one was.  You've got new weapons, a revamped melee system and you can now toss grenades back to your enemies... but for the most part Uncharted 2 didn't have much that needed fixing to begin with.  It was a near perfect game, addressing each and every issue the first game had.  With not much to address there isn't much for Uncharted 3 to really improve upon.  Or add, for that matter.  In seems the only part that Naughty Dog strived for more with was the story.  And they succeeded.  You certainly get a much more emotionally involved story but the gameplay is primarily the same thing here.  If you've enjoyed the gameplay of the series thus far, there's no reason not to jump into this one.  The story and characters alone make this a must play for Uncharted fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T.

Super Mario Bros. Deluxe features not only the 1985 NES original levels, but also the Japanese version levels that North American players couldn't have before.  At that particular time, the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play Super Mario All Stars for the Super NES/Nintendo Wii.  However, the NES Japanese levels were finally included on this 1999 Game Boy Color port/remake.  (For those of you history buffs, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. was actually named Super Mario Bros. 2.  The North American version of SMB2 was completely different and released in 1988 with Wart as the main archvillain, not Bowser.)I actually find the Japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging.  Some unusual effects will happen, such as Mario/Luigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds, entering a \"negative\" warp pipe that brings you back several worlds (i.e., instead of going FORWARD), or seeing Goombas walking in the water levels.Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is one of those games that I could NEVER ever quit playing, even if I wanted to.  So stop reading this already and get this game!! Sadly, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe isn't currently available for download on the Nintendo 2DS/3DS, but it would be very nice if it was.  :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX1JO","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris Kennison","summary":"PLAY STATION MOVE TRIUMPH","reviewText":"I'm gonna update this review at some point or another because at this point, I've only tried Boxing and Tennis.This is a great game with great mechanics and atmosphere. I played Sports Champions 1 as well, but found myself mostly playing ping pong. So when I saw that SC2 had tennis & boxing, I was thrilled to the hilt to see how the game was. I quickly got into the tennis and I like how it starts you off with ultra easy opponents and slowly walks you toward more difficult opponents, then equal opponents and then pushes you to be better with more difficult opponents. The Tennis is easy to learn and I found the nature of playing just like in real as far as where your hands are. If you get your hands tied up or out of place, you're in trouble. If you don't return your hands to center after every shot, you're gonna get burned. Loved it.Then I tried the boxing and it is fantastic. Not only is it fun, but it is a workout and unlike most boxing video games, when the round was over, I didn't skip the cut scene, I took the break, because I needed to take a breath. Sit down. Get a drink. Awesome!!Again, it starts you out with easy opponents and they get harder as you drop them. I found the easier opponents in boxing though, more challenging. I found that in the early fights, you really need to learn how to block punches and practice strategy and efficiency. Unlike most boxing games, you have to have a strategy. You can't just throw 100 punches and not expect to get tired or be vulnerable to a right cross because your guard is hanging. It is the closest thing to real boxing I've ever experienced.I also like that in this game, as opposed to \"The Fight: Lights Out\", your boxer is as good as you. You don't have to work up your guy to be equal to you. It is you. Your boxer is as quick as you and as smart as you.Love it. Can't wait to try the other games on this version.  Bowling. Archery. Skiing. Golf!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"Niedducciano","summary":"Ah-mazing","reviewText":"**UPDATE: The original product review follows this update**Since I wrote my original review, I have played all the way through the single-player game once (and am starting a second play-through).  I had read and heard a lot of complaints about how the game ends, but I honestly do not mirror those feelings at all.  I feel like the game gives you at least two or three different options for your desired closure to the story.  The options you get at the end are directly tied to your \"Galactic Readiness.\"  If you want to have a \"happy\" ending, then make sure you take the time to develop relationships (not necessarily just the romantic ones) and make sure you spend the time on the side missions.  They are cruicial.**ORIGINAL review follows**Mass Effect 3 (ME3) has not disappointed.  The graphics are even better than they were in ME2, the sound has been adjusted to be even better as well.  I definitely suggest playing this game with surround sound and some decent bass.  But, don't let my love for this franchise sway you one way or the other.  Let me attempt to give you a rundown of the newest and final iteration of the series:* Single playero FANTASTIC storyline - just 3 hours into the game and I already have an idea of some upcoming plot twists that I am extremely eager to seeo Cinematics even more seamlessly integrated into gameplay and therefore the game itself plays even more like an interactive choose-your-own-adventure movie than beforeo Mostly the same game mechanics as ME2 but there are some changeso Improved cover system - largely resembles the Gears of War (GoW) cover system.  In my opinion, this is definitely an improvement' You can easily maneuver from cover to cover, as well as \"quick kill\" enemies that are just on the other side of your cover.  The environment becomes even more integrated into gameplay and tacticso Improved character customization: this has become a hybrid of the ME1 system (too many options) and the ME2 system (too few options)o The same powers/skills we all loved from the original games with some improvements (keep in mind that outside of the demo, I haven't had a chance, yet to completely explore all of these improvements) - an example is that the Engineer can now deploy not only attach drones, but a turret sentry as well; but each of the character classes had similar class-specific updates to the skill treeso Some new squad members to accompany your familiar team members - this gives the your team afresh feeling as well as familiar feeling* Multiplayer (So far the vast majority of my multiplayer experience is with the demo.  I played the multiplayer demo for probably 20-30 hours)o There is nothing here to compare to previous games because in ME1/2 there was no multiplayer (MP) featureo All cooperative gameplay - no competitive multiplayer optiono Teams of 4 go up against various enemies that are encountered in the actual game - you go through 11 increasingly difficult waves of enemieso You gain critical War Assets for completing MP games - if you survive all 11 waves, you get more War Assets and a higher readiness bonus' Even though MP is absolutely OPTIONAL to the single player storyline, it does benefit your single player playthrough by more quickly increasing your galactic readinesso You level up your individual characters and character classes in MP just like you level up Shepherd in the storyline - but you have slightly fewer powers to level upo All that I have left to say about MP play is that it is a TON of fun and the fact that there is a bonus integrated into the single player story just makes it all the more rewarding* Collector's Edition - I have heard some people say that the Collector's Edition (CE) isn't worth the $20 extra, but I disagree and here's why:o Tin case - probably worth $4 or soo Downloadable content: character appearance packs, Shepherd appearance and accessory pack, N7 weapons packs, etc. - worth probably about $4-ish, each = at least $12-isho Digital downloadable soundtrack - probably worth at least $5 on iTunes or even more(?)o Lithograph (it's small) - about $5o N7 velcro patch - $2.50o Early access to a surprise DLC mission - $3-$8 (depending on how intensive the DLC turns out to be)o DC Comics miniature-sized comic book bridging the gap between ME2 and ME3 and following Aria from ME2 - $2.50(?)o Art of Mass Effect 3 book: ~$10o That adds up to: $44 on the low end, $49 towards the higher endSo, you're paying $20 extra for about $40-$50 worth of stuff.  Not only that, but all of it is very nicely polished and extremely well presented.All in all, I would say at the least the basic game is well worth the $60 price tag, as I expect to play through it multiple times, not to mention the practically endless fun to be had with the multiplayer function.  And, I would also say that if you're into collecting video game stuff, or getting more for your money, then the CE is worth it as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

Here's why:-The Wii remote has been able to make even the most medicore game a hit. examples include dragon ball z and excite truck. However that's only because the controls were able to work right. The controls on this game are frustrating. The nunchuck controler is used as your look finder and more often then not the cursor goes way off screen. So you end up spinning everywhere. What fun is a game if it doesn't control right?-The graphics are game cube quality at best. Realistically, it's more like N64. You can see the polygons all over the screen and you don't get the feel of crispness that the 360 and PS3 offer.-There's no online support like the other systems. I've said enough.-On the upside, The game does have intense firefights. Sadly the poor controls and lame graphics cause this one upside to be quite underwhelming. Plus the lack of Online multiplayer causes the firefights to lose their replay value.IF you must play the next installment of the series.

Unlike the previous 3 systems, this system doesn't replace its predecessor.  I think I played old games on a new system the previous 3 times, but not his one.  This is the first system I didn't buy a single game for at launch.  I don't like shooter nor the same sport and racing games 3rd party throw at you.  I think for the ps3 launch all I had was the movie Talladega Nights and ridge racer 7.Games:Humm i don't game as much, and only bought 3 boxed games (not digital download) for the PS3 last year (2 I didn't even get past 1/4 of the game).  The only game I am interested in is Dragon Age3 and the Witcher3.  I bought every Resident Evil, but might skip the next one since it isn't a survival horror anymore, more of a shooter.  Since I got PSN plus I got 2 free games to download, they are ok (always hungry and resogun).  The bad things is I have a few digital download small games for PS3 and they don't show up or are compatible with the ps4 yet.  This is the most ungamely crossover I ever had.Interface:Is fine I don't get too carry, thought the xmb was fine.  Don't see as much customizable settings as in the PS3.  It is more web feed ordinate.  You see what your friends played and watch, useless new feed and people uploading video of themselves.  The web browser is much improved over the PS3.  It is on the same level of andriod or better.  Just can't see adobe flash video.Tech hardware:I want the camera, and it isn't even in stock anywhere, except for the few people who upload video of themselves on the video section.  Controller is a little different and better to hold.  It doesn't feel as cheap plastic as it used too, got some grip, the handles are a little slimmer.  The touch pad is good for watching app like netflix.  The controller has a cool light, but no where to disable it in the setting.  Didn't see where the eject and power button was, so I just press any recessed buttons and found that  out.  I like the glowing blue light on the console, very modern.  My old ps3 bluetooth might and remote will not work, haven't found a way to sync them.  But the controller comes with an earpiece and mic.Apps/ features:DLNA is gone, this is applauding, you don't take features away that was there in the old system.  DLNA is good that I can see photos, video, music on my home server or other computer on the PS3.  Sony is one of the biggest backer of DLNA a few years ago.  They are just trying to push their paid video and music service.  Well I complained and I and many other complained and they said they will bring it back in a later firmware update, and they better.Netflic and Amazon prime is still there, but no youtube, they got some music video channel which i sgood, but doesn't have all the video that youtube has.  Since the web browser can't support flash, can't watch youtube there either.All in allI know the games will come and I am not much of a gamer anymore.  I think the tech is very nice and priced reasonably.  I really hope they update the psn games for th eps3 for the ps4 and add dlna so I can retired my PS3 which at this point I can't.

Although many previous installments of the FF series feature great storytelling, FFXII is the first and only game in the FF series to feature good writing of the specific lines of dialogue spoken by the characters. Each FFXII character's dialect, class, education, etc, is artfully expressed through their speech, without obscuring the meaning of what they have to say, and the fact that in spite of this great strength, FFXII still somehow manages to feature a weak story, is evidence of the dispensibility of good dialogue scripting in RPGs, compared to in playwriting, where good dialogue scripting is absolutely indispensible. FFXII's cutscenes, like FFX's, seem to be triggered primarily by arriving at new plot-related locations, rather than seeming to evolve naturally from exploration of the world, which is a weakness in both games, because it gives the player the impression of being dragged along from A to B to C. Good RPGs, even when they do exactly this, do a better job of disguising it than FFX and FFXII, by allowing a greater variety of play situations to trigger cutscenes.FFXII's gambit system is great, and adds a lot of fun to the gameplay, but it is incredibly hard to find battles in FFXII which are challenging, but not impossible. Defeating the werewolves roaming Giza plains, for example, is a task which goes from impossible to easy within the space of a few experience levels, and the employment of the licenses and equipment obtained while gaining those few levels. One minute, the player's party is so weak that no possible strategy is effective enough to defeat them, and the next minute, the player's party is strong enough that any reasonable strategy will do. So for a game with as deep of a battle system as FFXII, FFXII provides very limited opportunities for its players to engage in battles where their own strategy will mean the difference between victory and defeat.Battling in FFXII is actually very fun, and the aforementioned flaw should be less adversarial to most players' enjoyment of the game than it might seem to be. Another strength of FFXII is the extreme open-endedness of its play possibilities. Large sections of the game open up not very far into it, and the player is left with the option to advance the plot, or to explore uncharted areas of the map, hunt monsters, run fetch quests, or buy better equipment and magic. It is not possible to buy all of the strongest equipment with the money obtained simply by running through the plot of the game, and this is a great strength of FFXII, because choosing what to buy is more interesting in this game than in games where the player may easily purchase everything.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}

It's hard to believe that the PS2 is capable of such jaw-dropping visuals (and only on one disc, yet!), but you have to see FF XII in motion to appreciate how truly incredible the graphics are. The main protagonists are fantastically designed, and there's a far deeper sense of unification and realism between the character designs, and the in-game personas developed for them both by the storyline and the (excellent) voice actors. Cityscapes and dungeons are jaw-dropping in their detail and size, and the frame rate is very impressive indeed, with next-to-no slowdown. FINALLY, there's a competent camera system to play with, and presentation screens and in-game menus are very straightforward and very usable. Some repetition occurs with the various townspeople you run across, but the monster design more than compensates for this. All-in-all, visually, FF XII is top-drawer.SOUND: 4/5As I mentioned previously, the voice-acting in FF XII is of an unusually high standard, and the variety of convincing character accents (Eurasian, Nordic, American, Indian, British and so forth) lends huge amounts of plausibility and atmosphere to the story. The battle music is a little repetitive, but is really nice to listen to, so that's not necessarily a bad thing. Effects are functional and utilitarian, as they should be, and overall, FF XII's sound designers are to be congratulated for a stimulating aural atmosphere that's almost the equal of the visuals.PLAYABILITY: 5/5FF XII is different, VERY different, than those FF titles before it, and I don't just mean the in-game mechanics. Whereas previous games begin with simple storylines that build and build to eventually become metaphors for ethical and moral questions bigger than the characters contained in the game, FF XII starts off with some very adult themes (and I don't mean adult in an inappropriate-for-children sort of way, have no worries on that score!) and situations, and is almost confusing in its scope and scale. Civil unrest, war, political corruption and domination all mark the beginnings of FF XII, and so from the get-go, we're a far cry from the displaced where-am-I-now scenarios of Tidus and co. in FF X, or the simplistic kidnapping-goes-wrong antics of Zidane in FF IX. This game runs on a decidedly more sophisticated theme, and yet manages to retain all of the individual character development and plot depth that we've come to expect from a FF title. Story-wise, FF XII is an absolute winner - it's like losing yourself in a good book, or listening to a fascinating history lesson.And what would these major structural changes be without some major mechanical changes to go with them? The battles in FF XII are all real-time, you can essentially choose to fight or flee from the almost all of the many enemy encounters waiting for you. It's such a refreshing change for a FF game to be able to roam about without dreading the brief pause before the battle screens have to load, and EXP and LP (License Points - a bit like AP from previous games) are earned in real-time too, so you spend a lot less time navigating confusing menu screens and such. Characters are also no longer restricted by class or race - you can have your male protagonist wielding an Oak Staff while your magic-heavy characters brandish swords and shields, it's all highly customisable. Gambits mean that your party characters take their own initiative within a user-specified list of actions, and, while this takes some getting used to, after a couple of hours, you wonder how you managed without them.From a gameplayer's point of view, then, FF XII is a dream, and a highly polished, professional dream at that.OVERALL: 5/5This is a refreshing, redefining game in the FF canon, and one that even the mildest fans of the RPG can get to grips with. Those stat-fiends amongst us too will find great depth and rewards in its many secrets and sidequests, and everyone will appreciate the beauty of both the visuals and - rather more importantly - the storyline. I can't recommend it highly enough, you just need to play it to understand.Go buy it right this minute!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2007"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"Played, beaten... STILL HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO!","reviewText":"One play through of FF12 will leave most gamers understanding what five years of development can cause for a game. In Final Fantasy 12's case, the result is a mammoth product that which requires more play hours than possibly even some MMORPG's for \"casual\" gamers.But aside from the numerous tasks for the player's enjoyment, FF12 has an underlying feel of perfection and caliber that which almost all of the last games on the PS2 will not come close to. Take for example the detail put into the graphics on screen and the animations of the very townsfolk in all of the towns. It is rare to see a game feature towns full of people doing so many different things besides just walking around and waiting for you to talk to them. Now it feels as if almost all of the NPCs in a select location have their own personalities and daily going-ons besides waiting for some strange person to approach them and start a conversation. And going back to the graphics - the graphics in FF12 are superb. The art form is not the same as it was on say FF10, but the solid rendering and work that has gone into making the very real time gaming action is just unaccustomed for most games. Just by looking at this, you can tell it is a Final Fantasy game and not some run of the mill RPG put out by another company.The action itself is probably what most gamers will have something to say about. The \"Active Dimension Battle System\" causes the player to break away from the standard turn based action of yesterday RPGs and adapt a more real time approach, similar to that of the systems employed by most MMORPGs these days. The only difference in FF12 is that the player still has to select commands from menus and wait for attacks to finish charging. It is an evolution for the standard Final Fantasy game, and it is a welcome one as well. While some conventions are not as well addressed as they were in FF10 (summons, HP and damage limits), the game manages to do enough to make one feel that this is easily the future for Final Fantasy and RPGs in general.Other parts of the game play feel a little worn out and annoying however. The treasure chest system for the most part will leave many players feeling annoyed and tired after having to come to understand the sheer randomness of the treasures. And that is just what it is, the chests are placed randomly on the map and their contents are based on random probabilities. Some of them do not even reappear once opened, so players may have to reset the game and keep opening the chest until they get what they want.Another \"time waster\" like the treasure chest system is the \"Bazaar\" system, which requires the player to kill numerous monsters to get particular items that the monsters drop upon death. The chance of the monster dropping it is again based on random probability. Once the item is obtained, the player has to sell it to vendors and hope to figure out the right combination of items to make the vendors sell a superior item in the \"Bazaar\". And sadly, some of the more powerful weapons in the game are only obtainable through the bazaar. And the game's \"random drop probability\" does not just end with the sell-able items. Some of the better weapons and armor can only be obtained from random monster drops. And to complicate this even more, some of those random drops come from hard to find randomly appearing monsters! While it is too late now to make a change of this, it is easy to see that in future Final Fantasy games, Square-Enix could do more to change the way powerful items are obtained rather than using tired old MMORPG \"time eater\" tricks.The last thing to touch upon is probably the sound. While some of the songs could use to be longer and the casting for the voice actors is questionable on some parts, for the most part, the game puts on a very satisfying performance.Final Fantasy 12 is a unique experience, but it is also a long one. In order to completely \"complete\" this game, one will have to brace for at least 150 hours of play time; and that is just a light estimate. 200 hours is more likely for those who do not use game guides, so be prepared for a unique experience that is unlike any RPG you have played before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2007"}

The first is trivial, but since the game is new to the player, it's not awful.  Stage two is either a lame \"simon says\" program, or a trivially simple mini combat game.  After that, the game becomes a fairly average RTS.  In Spore, you get to choose parts for your creature, then dress them up, then choose the look of buildings and vehicles.  None of it is terrible, none of it is the great new thing many people expected.  Gameplay is safe, some fun, but nothing exciting.Which makes Spore an overpriced, fairly average, Real-Time-Strategy game with pretty pictures and an offensive Digital Rights Management tool which you might see mentioned elsewhere in the reviews.

Rhodes","summary":"Soul Calibur still has that soul!","reviewText":"The Soul series has been a staple in fighting games since SoulBlade was originally released on the Playstation several years ago.  The original SoulCalibur redefined a genre.  SoulCalibur II was more of a refinement of that.  This makes stepping into SoulCalibur III something of a conundrum.  The game has a lot to compare to.  SoulCalibur III is more along the lines of being the same old same old.  On the other hand what keeps it down is its kitchen sink approach.  It's a fun and grand game, but they added in just a little too much this time around.  The game is robust and huge, providing a fantastic single player experience, but much of it you're likely to bypass in favor of just getting your friends together and fighting.Story hasn't always been SoulCalibur's strong suit.  On the other hand the characters often times have been.  The relationships and their motivations for seeking Soul Edge to either obtain it or destroy it have always been amusing.  Likewise so have their relationships to other characters.  It has been the bread and butter of SoulCalibur.  It has been what has made the characters fun.  Reading their biographies, and about the levels and environments has always been what has made SoulCalibur stand out in terms of a narrative.  Listening to them talk in battle or watching the story itself play out hasn't always been.SoulCalibur II had a very simple approach to how things went within the story and whatnot.  You played through Arcade mode with various characters in an effort to see different stories and endings.  SoulCalibur III tries for an actual story mode that, for the most part, does a valiant effort, but gets rather annoying at times.  You select a character and begin.  There are branching paths in the story but the end result usually doesn't change much.  Especially because every character's story essentially follows the same arc.  You might go to different locations and fight different characters, but some moments will play out exactly the same.  That's not to say there is no unique nature to it.  The final boss is always different... as are the various endings.  Every character has different endings that are dependent on a button input.  You're more likely to play the story for the sake of completion, but once you go through with the fifth or sixth character, it starts to feel repetitive and boring.  It's not as quick as a typical Arcade mode and some of the exposition and dialog is just silly and not needed.  Likewise, there are some cutscenes that throw in quick time events.  That's right, quick time events... in a fighting game.  But not for the actual fight.  In cutscenes that predate fights.  And at first they can be confusing as they'll say things like \"G\" (as in, press the Guard button... not \"Press the X Button\").  You'll quickly get used to it, but it's a wonder why you'd have to bother with them to begin with.For the most part, fighting is the same.  There have been some new moves added and a few moves are easier to pull off, but it's more or less a refined version of the combat you saw in SoulCalibur II.  Battling is very familiar.  If you played SoulCalibur II or the original SoulCalibur you'll know what to expect.  What might throw some, however, is that the difficulty has been ramped up a lot for this outing.  Each story starts off relatively simple enough, but there are times it's unbalanced.  With AI controlled opponents sometimes being able to predict your moves perfectly, or pulling off moves that can feel almost gamebreaking at times.  It's a real test of skill... but sometimes you're apt to lose out on a battle mostly due to bad luck rather than because you're actually not that good.  It certainly proves that SoulCalibur is not the button masher people think it is, however.  It'll get you nowhere when going through SoulCalibur III's various story modes.As I said, there seems to be a Kitchen Sink approach to SoulCalibur III.  Aside from the story mode there is also a Chronicles of the Sword, which has you create a character and traverse a map in a similar style to a strategy RPG.  The problem here is that it's relatively boring.  There doesn't feel like much to do and there aren't that many SoulCalibur style battles to get into.  There is also a missions mode, but it's hardly as expansive as SoulCalibur II's weapons master mode.  Then there is the Quick Battle mode which is effectively the game's Arcade Mode.  And like the previous two games there are lots of galleries and such to unlock.  You can also purchase several weapons from the shop etc.There isn't a whole lot that keeps SoulCalibur III down.  The unbalanced AI can certainly cause problem, but it's not impossible.  SoulCalibur III is at its strongest, however, when you're actually playing with friends.  You can't setup battles against the computer on your own, but get a friend together and SoulCalibur III showcases a lot of fighting chops.  Here, you might find some can win with button mashing, but if anyone takes the time to learn the ins and outs of SoulCalibur's fighting system it's a surprisingly complex and fun game.  There aren't that many fighting games that offer up the same kind of multiplayer fun.  SoulCalibur III is at its best when played in this manner.  That's not to say the single player experience is no fun.  SoulCalibur in general excels in this regard.  SoulCalibur III most certainly has the best single player experience to date... but it also has some of the most frustrating AI to fight against sometimes.  It also throws in far too many characters that are mainly clones or tweaks of pre-existing characters.  A great single player experience, but it doesn't separate from the fact that unlike SoulCalibur II... SoulCalibur III isn't nearly as much to play by yourself with the AI being unbalanced the way it is from time to time.  Even experts at SoulCalibur may have to take some time to really study their opponents before finally getting things going.  Skill is still a requirement... but luck isn't exactly a skill.  It is definitely a game that was designed with the Arcade in mind (as in, it's designed to crush you).  On the one hand, that also makes SoulCalibur III a good challenge.  Master it and you're likely to learn a lot and compete in tournaments (not to mention future installments).  It's a double-edged sword.Visually Namco will never skimp on a SoulCalibur game.  And SoulCalibur III looks absolutely amazing.  Giving off some of the best level design and character models you'll find on the Playstation 2.  Music wise there's a lot of good stuff here as well.  The music is great.  Some tracks are pulled from SoulCalibur II, but that's fine in and of itself.  The sound effects are also really good.  There are few fighting games that look this good.Overall, SoulCalibur III is a fantastic game for fighters.  It isn't quite up to the good graces of SoulCalibur II.  And there are certain things that feel either out of place (Chronicles of the Sword) or like they have no place in SoulCalibur at all (Quick Time Events) but the game is still an extremely good one that any fan of the franchise will enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2005"}

I am a huge LEGO fan and have played all of the available titles on my PS3. So when I found out that Lego City was a Wii U exclusive, I was bummed.I grew up playing Nintendo since the late 80s. So I am a Nintendo gal. That said, when I purchased the Wii, I never got used to the Wii mote and the nunchuk. I like the traditional controller. So when they announced the release of this console, I initially decided against buying it, since I thought that the Wii U gamepad was too gimmicky. It turns out I was wrong. Massively wrong.LEGO City Undercover showcases the gamepad's features. So far, I'm only in chapter 5, but its features are the following (if I discover any more features, I'll edit this review): a. can scan for hidden collectibles and suspects (which is addicting - I found myself scanning the environment instead of embarking on my mission).b. shows you the City's gargantuan mapc. Listen to audio conversationsd. Engage in video chats with your colleagues, etc.The gamepad is very interactive, and I'm loving it so far! (On that note: the battery drains fast, so keep the charger next to you while playing.)Lego City Undercover is probably the BEST outta all the titles. It was worth every cent. Its environment is amazingly colossal! It's much, much, much bigger than the Lord of the Rings and Batman 2. I knew prior to purchasing it that the City is huge, but I honestly didn't expect it to be this vast! I found myself exploring the areas. The view was simply spectacular as I was standing atop a bridge. It's so obvious that the producers put a lot of thought and detail into this game. Kudos to them.I wish that Lego City Undercover is a two-player game. My six-year-old nephew and I always play the LEGO games together, so I'm disappointed that it isn't available for this title.There is a lot of driving in this game (and since I am not a big fan of driving vehicles in any video game, I mentally groaned). My six-year-old nephew tried driving and then handed the controller to me (as if his aunt could do a better job lol).  I ended up running over pedestrians and smashing into everything. The game thankfully doesn't penalize you for your accidents. The driving is MUCH better than Indiana Jones 2, but it is still a bit of a chore. (That said, I am getting the hang of it.) Luckily, I learned that you could hail a cab and you could be driven to your destination. So I can't complain much.Another teeny tiny gripe: I occasionally found out that I can't rotate the camera (using the right analog stick) 360 degrees.Also, the loading time is very long. Too long by any standard. Personally, I don't mind waiting, since the game makes up for it.Despite my minor gripes, I gave it a five star. I love this game so much and I'm still early in the game. The graphics are simply stunning. The dialogue is funny and witty! It's the ideal game for the whole family. I can tell right off the bat that its replayability factor is high.  You can unlock many disguises throughout your playthrough. For example: A miner's outfit, a robber's outfit, etc. I love the \"special effects\" when Chase McCain gets suspended in mid-air while driving, a la Hollywood. I also love the martial arts. Instead of mashing your button while in attack mode, you can do certain techniques. It's fun.If you're a Lego fan, then I recommend that you buy it. If you haven't played any Lego title before, then this game comes highly recommended from me. If you want to play with another person, then I suggest you pick up The Lord of the Rings (since it has an offline co-op mode). I can't tell you how many times my six year-old nephew made me play it with him. There came a time when I actually hid it from him.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}

Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"A New Step in the Series.","reviewText":"Any fan of the Need For Speed series will be able to tell one thing from Need for Speed Underground, and that is that this new game is pretty much unlike any of the other previous titles in the series. This time through, Electronic Arts is breaking new ground for the series, and is going to the streets for racing flava this time through. Underground is all about street racing, which is seeming to be the next big thing in racing titles as the Midnight Club series has proven. But I am hopeful for something in this new game, and that is I hope that it's able to bring a new style to the street racing genre. I am a fan of Midnight Club, but let's face the truth. Midnight Club lacks many key components that prevent it from being the ultimate in street racing titles. Street Racing Syndicate and a game based on The Fast and the Furious are two other street titles currently in development, but from videos and playing demos of these two games at E3, they are shaping up to be quite lackluster. So far, Underground has terrific graphics, sound, and most important of all, gameplay and speed physics. The San-Francisco based city that the game takes place in looks sharp as well as nearly everything else that I have seen so far. EA has even brought in an Academy-Award winning special effects designer to help them in the game's building process. As far as Midnight Club goes, it lacks in sound, graphics, and above all, the game lacks in gameplay and style. Midnight Club and Midnight Club II both bored me just a week or so after playing them. Another poor feature of the MC series is average multiplayer racing. Underground is working very hard to be a great multiplayer experience on the PS2, and the multiplayer looks awesome so far. Another thing that I am excited about is customization. No other NFS titles have included customization to a heavy degree, but Underground does. You will start out driving, let's say, a normal Ford Focus, but depending on how you handle things, it could become the most awesome car on the streets. Yes, the series does look like that maybe it slowed down its gameplay a little bit, and another reason for this is because at least in the earlier stages of development for this game, it was possible to completely destroy your car, and it took a load of cash to repair. The slower pace may dissapoint some gamers, but I really don't have a problem with it. EA has never let me down, and let's all hope that they put enough time into Need For Speed Underground to make it a street racing masterpiece!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2003"}

LCS feels like a port of the GTA3 engine, but feels nice on the PSP. Everything you love about GTA is intact here and is a great first outing for the little handheld that could. Like all other GTAs you play as a man who is trying to climb to the top of the city.The missions are varied and well put together, but extremely frustrating. I had to use cheats a lot since the game is highly unforgiving. They will put way to many guys in one spot for you, and this is due to targeting and shooting issues. When you lock on with R Toni will target the closest target, but camera issues hinder this. If you have someone shooting behind you you have to turn around, tap L to reset the camera, lock on, then shoot. In this amount of time you will be dead. This is probably the biggest issue in the whole game. Most of the same issues are carried over from GTA3 and this also includes graphical issues like pop-up, weird collision detection, and some audio glitches.The game is surprisingly busy for a handheld game with cars and pedestrians everywhere, you can do everything you could in GTA3 like steal cars, do taxi, police, and fire truck missions. Unlike GTA3, however, you can ride motor cycles. There are a ton of weapons to use in the game, tons of cars, and lots of missions to do. Missions vary from escorting, on rail shooting, protecting, delivering, stocking, and assassinating. The characters in the game are lively and the dialog is awesome. The radio stations talk shows are my favorite part in the game. They are hilarious and completely outrageous like GTA should be. There aren't enough of them though (about 5) and after you get into 5+ hours into the game they get repetitive, and the same goes for the commercials. The songs however aren't very good, and I don't even think any of them are licensed. This can be changed by playing custom songs off your memory stick, but it requires a weird converter on your PC and isn't very user friendly, but its there and I love it. In fact LCS was the first PSP game to use custom soundtracks so kudos to Rockstar for doing this.The game looks very good for a 2005 PSP game. It looks like an upgraded version of GTA3 which isn't bad, but if love GTA4 and have the pre-GTA4 games you will not like this at all. Some times the game can look really good when you riding into the sunrise and light is reflecting off the water and everything around you. Everything is actually 3D and doesn't look flat and retarded like you might think. So, bottom line, if you want a great GTA game pick up LCS, and its even a good entry into the series if you have never played it before.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Seriously, this should have just been a first person shooter and advertised as such. When I heard of the game, I was only going to get Uncharted 3, but the person buying me the game was convinced to get all three in a set. I figured I might as well play them all starting with this one. The game isn't the worst, it's actually pretty good. The locale is beautiful, the missions are fun when you have to scale, jump, solve puzzles et al. Sometimes you have a partner and other times you are alone. You'll really get into searching for Drake's treasure.However, the wave after wave after wave of bad guys coming after you suck. You scale a wall and there is a gun fight waiting, you open a door and there is a gun fight waiting, you jump down and there is a gun fight waiting. Seriously, How many men do the villains have that are willing to die for them? I guess not many sense they all looked alike. You have the fat gunners, the crazy skinny run around gunners, then the crazy skinny run around gunners in hats. Get bored with them? Now you have camo wearing snipers, and gunners who will kill you in one shot. Bored with them? They will give you something else to shoot. There were villains in places that made no sense for them to be. For example, Nate has the map that the bad guys want, he solves a puzzle which opens a vault or door that hasn't been opened in centuries. but guess who is already inside? You guessed it, the bad guys with guns ready to give you yet ANOTHER gun fight. Since they seem to know the entire route to the treasure, even into sealed off passages it makes you wonder why they want the map so much or why they kept certain people alive to find it. They were already waiting, set up and everything in every place Nate entered. Honestly, I had to roll my eyes at the ridiculous amount of gun fights waiting for me and times I had to shoot someone before they died. I even got a few head shots that weren't even accounted for and had to shoot them several more times before they fell. I can get shooting the camo wearing guys multiple times (They were probably wearing vests), but not the guys wearing dirty t-shirts and nothing else.Anyway, I did like this game, and there were parts that scared me but the lack of adventure outside of gun fights made the game tedious. I will play Uncharted 2 and I do hope the creators give us LESS gun fights and more adventure.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2011"}

Aiming is done with the stylus, while your other hand is used to move Samus as well as fire.A HUGE thank you to the game designers for including an option for us lefties. It takes a little while to get used to using the A,B,X, and Y keys to move, but being able to actually aim without feeling gimpy sure is nice.The true glory of this game comes with the multiplayer matches. Being able to hookup with people worldwide for an impromptu death match is really what this game is all about.There's an option where, if you are playing against someone on your friend list, you can use the DS built in speaker to actually voice chat with them. I haven't gotten to use it, but it's great to know the designers really went all out when putting this game together.I own the DS Lite, so utilizing the Stylus Control Mode isn't too bad. I'm not sure how people with the original, more bulky, system will feel. I could see how it could get a little taxing and lead to hand cramps if played for too long.The overall theme when talking to people about this game is \"it's a great game if you can get past the control scheme.\" It really is worth the time and effort it takes to master the controls.

Seriously, if they could spin the clock back and delay the Wii U until this title was ready, I don't think the Wii U would be suffering the sales numbers it is (and yes, the low sales figures are documented).This game really shows off a lot of features of the Wii U, but without being intrusive. The Wii Pad is not just a different controller, but its use is integrated into the game in a natural manner. You can use practically every controller that exists so far: WiiMote with a Nunchuck, Wii U Pro Controller, or just the Wii Pad itself. This gives you a lot of flexibility. I've tried the various controllers, and so far, I seem to be most comfortable with the Pro controller.It also requires a bit of brain usage, in that you're not just blasting anything that moves, but you have to solve puzzles and figure out what you need to do, and how best to do it. Perhaps not the kind of game for everyone, but if you're interested in a challenge, it's a bit unique. At least, unique to me; I've never played a Pikmin title before.And most importantly, so far, it's FUN! I've only been playing Story Mode, so I haven't really fully explored the game, but if what I have seen so far continues throughout the game, it looks like it'll be one of those games that I will re-visit even after finishing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2013"}

It's not like other games. For better or worse, they are not attempting to make it like other games or fundamentally change their formula. Many of Gran Turismo's fans over the past 15 years liked the game because there wasn't anything closer to their tastes, but today, there is more competition.Do you want a Gran Turismo style game? If so, this is excellent. Do you instead want something that doesn't take many hours of work to open up? It's up to you.Gran Turismo 5 is excellent, but there may be other games that are closer to what you actually want. Dirt's series is much easier to dive into and has plenty of graphics punch. Blur and other more arcadey games present cars you see on Top Gear or other TV shows, but with Mario Kart style action.Gran Turismo presents a tremendous amount of content. Many cars, many tracks. With that content, you can painstakingly perfect your driving technique and develop tuning concepts while enjoying a very wide array of driving situations. The graphics, particularly the lighting, is superior to other games. Period. Forza presents the stiffest challenge, but is somewhat less realistic and has inferior graphics (at least 1-3... I have yet to play the new one) and levels of content. That said, Forza is a great game. Some will find it more fun.

Here's the main problem, i don't care about the characters.  It may just be me, but i'm also having a time following the story.  In ME3, your decision (supposedly) dictate the outcome of the game.  Here you make decisions, and can never be too sure what you did, or how it will affect you.Now for the non-linear part.  Imagine if you were put into a box, and now that box is your whole world.  Just for fun, someone puts dividers in the box to make the box appear bigger with additional rooms.  That is the feeling i get when i play.  It is as if you are dropped off in a level, you can walk around and do the quests for that level, then you are taken away to another level.

The game tries to hard to do 1:1 tracking which can come off a little awkward looking on screen, i think it should have been like 70% tracking your movement and 30% in game auto animation when you complete a certain motion, just to smooth out some rough edges to make the game look a little cooler while fighting. I know some will say that this makes it more real because you actually have to know how to throw a punch, and that is correct; however if you are going to make it based on your skills then your fighter shouldn't have to earn speed and technique stats it should be based on my own speed and technique. That is where the game is a bit awkward, when you first pop it in to play it is kinda horrible since your guy will not be built up much at all. You might be in great shape and throwing perfect punches but your character wont be. I think this was one of the major turn offs to the pro reviewers who didn't stick with the game long enough to build up there character and start having fun with the game. If you stick with it the game becomes a lot more fun once your character is built up.Once again this is a fun game, maybe not initially, but if you stick with it it is a great and fun workout. I am a bit confused why they have one to one tracking and then dumb down your character so it really doesn't feel one to one until you build your guy up. It is frustrating in the beginning because of that. It would have been better to have it just been solely based on your own fighting skills, maybe just be able to build your characters strength and heart but speed and technique should have been based on how the user was actually performing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

Johnson","summary":"Solid title.","reviewText":"The second addition to the Gears of Wars series continues with what was great debut.  Other than a few new weapons and some changes to game play GOW2 does not really bring anything entirely new to the table.  This is not a bad thing, because the first GOW was an excellent title to begin with.  However as with all games, if they continue putting out the same game with no drastic changes, then people will get tired of the same ole thing.  A perfect example of this is Call of Duty, I had about 3 or 4 call of duty games all being set in WWII.  After COD3 I had played enough WWII games to last me for the rest of my life.  When COD4 came out I was relieved that it was no longer WWII and I am STILL enjoying it to this day.  However for whatever reason the newest Call of Duty is ANOTHER WWII game.  The mere thought of playing another WWII game makes me want to take a nap.  Needless to say I'm not buying COD:  World at War.  That said, the Gears of War series is still relatively new, so even though it follows the same basic story line, it doesn't yet suffer from the drawbacks of using the same recycled, overly done story line year after year that that the COD series seems to love to do.Gears of War II continues a few months after the end of Gears of War I.  Basically the light mass bomb did not do much to eradicate the Locust.  So the COG army is back at it again hoping they will finally be able to eliminate the threat this time around.  The story is pretty much the same as before with a few new twists.Even though this game is using a newer Unreal engine, I don't notice much change in the graphics other than no longer having a brownish reddish tint to them.  There also seems to be more enemies to fight at one time however other than that, there are no big improvements in the graphics department.  The same goes for sound as well; no big improvements other than of course new dialog from the various characters and a handful of new locust enemies.  For sequels, not having big improvements in graphics and sound is only bad if the original needed improvement.  However with GOW no improvements where really needed so why fix what wasn't broken?  I'm glad Epic took this approach rather than trying to get too cute messing up what was just fine to begin with.The biggest additions to the game are the actual game play and the variety of new weapons.  The first change I noticed to Single player mode is that when your character, Marcus is shot down in battle, instead of the game ending right away you have an opportunity crawl and seek revival from your computer controlled teammates Cole, Baird and Dom (sometimes).  If you don't get help in time, only then will you die and the game ends.  Of course sometimes if you are blown to pieces or crushed, then there is no amount of reviving that can save you so in this case the game will be over right away.  There are also a wide variety of new weapons, in addition to the old favorites like the torque bow and long shot sniper rifle.  A couple of new weapons include a new type of grenade that will emit poisonous gas when exploding, that will cause your enemies (or you) to rapidly lose health if you don't escape the cloud.  Another is a fairly powerful weapon that fires a few bursts at a time, but its power is offset by the slow reloading time meaning in order to use it effectively you have to master active reload.  One thing that carries over from the original is that Dom is STILL dumb as rocks.  He more than occasionally gets in your way when trying to execute head shots and the worse is that when you are down crawling around looking to get revived; Dom will just stand there while you bleed to death.  To add insult to injury, on the few occasions when Dom does seem to be coming to your aid, he will turn around at the last second running away from you allowing you to die.  Luckily Cole and Baird are more helpful.GOW 2 is a bit more violent this time around with more options for execution moves coupled with more gore in cut scenes and actual game play.  I am pretty much desensitized to violence but parents who are concerned with their young children playing violent games should know that GOW2 is probably as violent as they come.  Ninja Gaiden 2 is a game that also tops the charts in terms of violence, but I think GOW2 even has it beat in some aspects.  Unlike some games that \"unfairly\" get an M rating, GOW2 definitely earns the M rating.  In addition to the violence, the language is also the worse I've heard in any game thus far.  Pretty much every dirty, naughty, cuss, curse, swear or whatever you personally refer to these words as, is uttered at some point in this game.  While is certainly not as graphic as having say, Richard Pryor, Bernie Mack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Chris Rock in the same room, there is still a generous amount of S and F bombs flying around.  However, after a while you'll get used to it.  In reality though, the language is a mere afterthought when considering the amount of blood and gore; so you have been warned.  On the other hand, if you love ramming chainsaws through the torsos of your enemies having blood spatter on the screen, literally blowing heads off, snapping necks, or stomping the head a dying enemy into the hard stone floor with your boot, then you will be right at home with this game.I am pretty far in the game, and depending on how the remaining of the game is I will probably play it again when I'm done.  The subtle additions to game play and the new weapons make it worth a a look.  Overall, I am not blown away by the game as I was with the original GOW, but if you liked the predecessor, you should not be disappointed with the sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"MyPenName","summary":"Wow","reviewText":"I have to start by saying that I have never used any other headset than the one that comes with Xbox 360, so I don't exactly have much to compare Turtle Beach XP400 to. I have used smaller bluetooth devices with PS3 as well, but again, no other headset. That being said, I thought this headset was amazing.Firstly, it is really easy to set up and get into playing. The dual frequency for wi-fi is a huge plus and I had no interference at all and no buzzing ir hissing noises. There were no disturbances in reception. I used these in 2 different rooms on separate ends of the house. (PS3 is in one room & Xbox360 is in another). The reception was great in both ends of the house and the headset worked flawlessly on both systems.The headset itself seems very well made and durable. The ear cuffs are comfortable to wear, even for lonng periods. You can adjust the band to a perfect fit and have the mic in optimal position. As the Xbox360 is the only headset I have to compare this to, I will say that the Xbox set got really uncomfortable even after just a short time of use - 20 mins or so - and actually became painful. It also seemed like the mic was never quite positioned right and I was just constantly re-adjusting the whole headset. With the Turtle Beach, I just put them on, adjust them once and am good to go...I don't have to re-adjust them at all. They are comfortable.The headset seems all quality and is worth the price. There is no aspect that seemed cheap or cheesey. They didn't skimp on build quality anywhere.The receiver is small and won't take up much space at all.The sound quality is of course amazing. You don't realize all of the little sounds and impacts that you are missing, until you try these out. I really was amazed. The surround sound is just amazing. There is no cutting in and out either and sounds/noise from around you will not cut out the sound in the headphones. These are excellent if you want to ignore everything and everyone around you lol, as you will only hear what is going on in your game or your phone call, whichever you are doing at the moment. They provide true noise isolation. It is like you are actually in the game.Answering calls during gaming is simple and efficient. I had no problems whatsoever with that aspect either. I was using these with my Nokia and they paired easily. The call/sound quality is better than any bluetooth or earbuds I have ever used. There was never any interference with calls. It almost sounds like you are sitting right next to the person, talking to them.I really jumped from one extreme to the other with these - going from the (cheap) Xbox360 headset straight to the Turtle Beach. I had no middle grounds to compare, but I will say I definitely recommend these. I wasn't sure what to expect in any aspect - build quality, sound quality, ease of use - but I was more than pleasantly surprised. They more than surpassed any slight idea I had of how they would sound and operate and are definitely worth the investment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"A slightly below average shooter with really good graphics","reviewText":"I know my opinion is going to be unpopular, but so be it.Crysis 2 is, to get right to the meat of it, a slightly below average shooter with really good graphics.  Yes, the engine looks nice, yes the effects and draw distance are great, but that is about all the game has going for it.  As a shooter it is pretty mediocre.You have a suit upgrade system, but I found most of the abilities to be less than stellar or visible.  You have a limited stealth feature which is overly used.  Maps basically vary between two designs:  a hallway style shooter and an open \"sand box\" style shooter.  The hallway style is self-explanatory.  The sand box style basically goes like this:  You drop into an area full of patrolling bad guys and you have to make it to the other side.  You can either run and gun, stealth, or do a mix of both.  Most of the time you have to stealth because as soon as you are detected the enemies will converge.The story itself is far from engaging.  It is so mundane and non-descript that when I reflect upon it no real aspect of it stands out.  Just kind of standard super-soldier alien invasion mush.I haven't bothered with multi-player as I didn't get the game for that.  I figured with all the rave reviews that the single player would be beefy enough.  It was not.  It is so uninteresting that I can't even be bothered to finish it.  I'm pretty sure I'm far into it, but there is nothing \"grabbing\" about the game.The game is a stark contrast between a great looking engine and a basically empty world.  Lots of open space, not much to fill it.  Lots of unused potential.  The game is basically a full price demo of the graphics engine and nothing more.  They should turn that graphics engine over to a company who can write an engaging and interesting game.  That is probably the point of putting Crysis 2 on the market.Play the demo, that's all you need to see before you buy the game.

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"A must have game","reviewText":"Crysis 2 is an amazing game.  When I first saw the trailers for this game, I didn't think the graphics on console could look this good, but even running on the 5 year old Xbox 360, it looks unbelievable!  Graphics aren't everything, though, and fortunately the gameplay is solid.  Controls are very similar to CoD, but you can scan areas ahead for enemies and then create a plan of attack.  Wether you prefer to attack head on or sneak around, the Nanosuit (that your character wears) has powers like invisibility and armor mode to accommodate your style of play.  There is no time limit for completing levels, so you can take all the time you need to execute your plan, and if something goes wrong, you can go invisible and retreat so you can reevaluate the situation.  This is a very welcome change of pace from most other shooters, and gives you a real sense of control on the battlefield.The levels are huge, similar to Halo Reach's size, but this is not an open world game, and levels are linear.  The developers left enough wiggle room so that you can choose how you want to proceed in each level, adding a lot of replay value.  It's fun to play levels over again with different tactics and see how things play out.  The AI is pretty smart, however there are some moments when enemies will walk into obstacles and get stuck instead of just walking around the obstacle.  There also isn't a lot of variety of enemies.  Mainly you'll fight \"bad\" humans who are all exactly the same, plus 3 types of aliens who are all almost exactly the same.  A few battles against and/or in vehicles change things up from time to time, but mainly you fight on foot.  By the game's end, it all starts to feel a little repetitive, but the game ends before it wears out it's welcome.The sound design is well done, and weapons, vehicles, and aliens all sound appropriately lethal, with your Nanosuit's AI voice being a highlight of the game.  The music is good, although it doesn't change based on your situation, but rather triggered by checkpoints in the levels.  This leads to some moments where dramatic music plays while you're doing almost nothing.  Voice acting is done well, and none of the characters come off as corny, although a lot of the curse words feel forced, both in the situation and by the actor.As good as the graphic, gameplay, and sound are, the story is not.  It's unfortunate that a game with this level of polish falls so flat in the story department.  The setup for the plot is told in the first 10 minutes of the game, but the rest of the game is just other characters telling you to go here and there, and the story never goes anywhere.  Questions like \"Why are the bad guys trying to kill you\" and \"Why are these aliens invading\" are answered with a lazy \"because\".  For all your efforts over the course of a 15 hour campaign, hardly anything is accomplished aside from a pile of corpses in your wake.The multiplayer is solid, featuring a level up system similar to CoD.  The Nanosuit abilities change the pace of the matches, however, and that is where Crysis 2 sets itself apart.  As for performance, the game runs smoothly without lag, and the graphics are just as amazing in multiplayer as offline single player.  It should be noted, there is no spit screen mode of any kind, and the online multiplayer is competitive only, so no co-op missions or anything like that.  On the plus side, this game does support 3D for those with 3D HDTVs.Overall, the gameplay is solid enough to keep this game entertaining despite the writer's lack of imagination.  The suit abilities put an interesting twist on a tried and true genre that's starting to homogenize, and if you're a sucker for graphics, you're not going to find a better looking game on consoles.  Most importantly, this is a very fun game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6N266","description":"","reviewerName":"Robin Solsj Hglund","summary":"Adrenaline-filled but nothing else","reviewText":"The Run is a hectic, adrenaline-filled action movie of a game; a rip-roaring Michael Bay-esque trip for the speed junkie. If you find car simulators and regular racers too boring, this will be right up your alley. If you were more fond of Burnout than Forza Motorsport, give it a go. However, I have to present a fair warning first. The good part is that it's a beautifully designed game; the new Frostbite 2 engine provides a world full of beautiful lighting, gleaming cars, sparks and glistening pavement. That, combined with the great surround sound (odd rock and roll and awesome \"movie chase music\") and the sheer delight in speed is enough to hold you at attention; I've played many of the hectic levels only to find afterward that my feet have shuffled up the carpet. The story is done and over with in minutes; Jack joins a race across America to win a whole wad of cash. You pick a starting car, and off you go!For the most part, the game's quite alright, but it does have a lot of drawbacks, and most of them seem to stem out of lazy design choices. There are a few \"quicktime event\" sequences where you only have to mash the right buttons, providing you with the illusion of participation. Except for a few given story moments, you can only select cars by driving into gas stations at a few certain points - not only does this leave you bereft of choice for a vehicle for the larger part of the game (annoying), it can also seriously affect the outcome. I was unfortunate enough to pick a muscle car for a dirty on/off-road checkpoint-race, and it didn't just prove difficult, it was impossible (pedal to the medal and I'd still be at least ten seconds away from my next checkpoint). That forced me to restart the entire game at the 70% mark, there was literally no other choice. There's a replay level-function, but it doesn't override your current game. This \"win big or you can't win at all\"-feeling permeates the game, and it's a true shame.To sum things up, The Run is a short and exciting game, the main campaign will only take about three hours of effective gameplay time, but the challenge maps and multiplayer may provide a bit more incentive to keep playing. Unfortunately these are also quite backwards; as you rank up, you unlock little multiplayer trinkets, and if you want really good cars, they're limited to a few challenges, mostly you'll find yourself using and unlocking the lesser cars. The game could've used several more levels, some more variety, but most of all, a lot more choice for the player. It's as dense and packed as an urban city street, not as wide and open as a beautiful highway.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Reggie","summary":"103 hours of fun and fustration.","reviewText":"When I go to the theater to watch a movie, I pay $9 bucks and get 2 hours of entertainment. When I bought FF13, I paid $29 bucks for it and got 103 hours of entertainment. For me, the game was both fun and fustrating. I thought the battle system could have used a little more work, and felt that FF12's battle system was better.  And I also didn't like the way the camera moved around during some battles so much. As I experienced this while playing the game, I said to myself that no video game ever created is perfect. Whether perfect or not though, I figured that for $29 bucks brand new,(half the price they originally were selling it for) I got a good deal. And if FF13 had sucked, (and fortunately it didn't) it would have been better if it had sucked at $29 bucks than at $60 bucks... the price that many people did paid, didn't like the game, and considered it not worth it.  The game can definately be finished in half the time I finished it in. It only took me longer because I did the side quests and chilled out adimiring the beautiful scenery and the artwork that they put into the game. I read somewhere that it took 5 years to make FF13. So I figured that since I didn't spend the last 5 years of my life thinking, plotting, planning, discussing, developing, writing, producing, directing, drawing, coloring, animating, programming, editing, testing, managing, music composing, music arranging, music recording, song singing, praticing, localizing, voice over work, translating, designing, creating visual effects, special effects, sound effects, financing, marketing, promoting, shipping, distrubuting, selling, stressing, wondering, wishing, dreaming, and hoping that FF13 will be a success...  i'm not gonna talk crap about it at all. I'm just gonna do what my sister tells me to do if I get into her car and start complaing about her driving. (she tells me to just shut up, kick back, and enjoy the ride).  So i'm just gonna shut up, kick back, enjoy, and appreciate every bit of the 5 years of hard work that many people from the other side of the world spent working on this game in order to get it into my hands, and just consider myself lucky that I got a chance to play it. After 103 hours of playing FF13 and thinking back on it all, it was a really nice ride. Not bad at all.  And when SquareEnix come out with FF15 someday, hopefully i'll have a chance to take another ride and play that game too. Since I don't have any technical skills to create a video game, and don't have a company to produce and sell a video game either, good job to the team that put this game together, and everyone involved in getting it into my hands so that I could play it.  Well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2010"}

One that gamers that have been hard to adapt to is the PS Vita. Players have been underwhelmed by the system exclusives and the lack of games that are dynamic and fun to play. Media Molecule is trying to revamp that experience with their latest hit Tearaway. But is this the game that PS Vita fans have been waiting for or will this be one that you need to pass on?The feature of this game is that you are in control of a messenger that is on a quest to deliver a message to you. You can take control of either the male messenger Iota or the female messenger Atoi. The world that you will explore is created entirely out of paper so you will be able to manipulate this world with your god like powers. The difference between this game and other games is that the world that you are exploring is entirely made out of paper. You will have to help guide your messenger by touching on the front and rear screen and by blowing into the microphone. A gentle blow on the mic is translated into a mighty gale , your fingers can poke holes in paper walls and you can touch the rear touch pad to touch up through the landscape to help defeat enemies.What I love about the game is the whole premise and the game world that you are put into. An entire world where trees, rocks and even animals are made out of paper. You can also customize your messengers appearance whether you want to be either friendly or scary. This is an interesting premise and it should be as it was done by the same creators who gave us Little big planet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

It has great graphics and sound, the 3D effect is really cool, it is well worth the price, and it has great games. So why did I trade it in? Well, although it has great games, there just wasn't enough of my type of great games. First, there are only a couple of shooters and so far, both are Resident Evil, they are good games, but 2 shooters are not going to satisfy for very long. There is still quite a few games that would interest any person though. My second gripe about the games is that they are just not coming out fast enough. After the DS had been out for a year, by looking at the game selection, you would have thought that the DS was the only portable on the market, the 3DS' game selection however, doesn't look much different now then it did when it launched.Don't get me wrong though, don't let me detour you from getting one, there are still plenty of games for the 3DS, and they are fun games. The system itself is really nice, and I'm sure that there are more and better games coming out soon enough.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization.

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"Don't Believe The Haters","reviewText":"I purchased this game even though there were a lot of negative reviews from professional critics and consumers as I have played all of the games in the series. I found Resident Evil 5 to be more action oriented but that did not bother me. I don't expect all Resident Evil games to be the same. Games evolve for better or worse. I actually enjoyed RE5. It was nothing great and reminded me of Far Cry 2 in some ways. But it was a Resident Evil game, no doubt.I was playing Call of Duty Black Ops II online and was ready to play something different on a cold and rainy night. Something more in tune with the mood of the environment. So I put the disc in my Playstation 3 for a game of Resident Evil 6 not knowing what to expect. I was already prepared from all the negative reviews. But as I played I did not find all those negative things that all those reviewers mentioned. The game played smoothly without any glitches and the game play mechanics was very good. Being a first-person shooter aficionado I was expecting the usual problems of the usual third person shooter. I was pleasantly surprised that I could go into the first-person mode to aim at targets. And the shooting mechanics actually worked pretty well. Reviewers complained that it is laser only but you do have cross-hairs with the red dot to indicate that you have the target in your cross-hairs. I love the fact that the L1 is used to aim and the R1 to shoot. I hate it when game makers try to be \"creative\" and design the shooting mode totally different from other shooters. You want to be able to use the standard shooting mode as doing otherwise leads to problems with pressing the wrong buttons to aim or shoot.During the game you will have a partner which works pretty well. Your partner will actually be of help unlike in some other games where the AI is so bad that the partner is just there to decorate the screen. You can play as any of the four characters and I am starting out with Leon. After you finish one campaign you can play as one of the other three characters from their perspective and their storyline. As such, you get four games in one. That makes for a huge replay value. Their stories will intersect and you can see how each character plays out.The biggest surprise for me was the fact that while I played the campaign, another player dropped in from out of nowhere. I did not know that others can just jump in and play with you without invitation. Although I did not know this person I am glad that this person came along for the ride. This player was obviously a veteran of this game as he or she knew where to go and guided me along. This player actually saved me several times when I was down. He or she gave me a shot of medicine when I was about to die. Sometimes I did die but I came back to find that the player had waited for my return. When you die you go into the screen that gives you the option to continue or not. At times I felt bad that I wasn't as proficient as he or she but I was new to this particular game and felt like he or she was rooting for me to come back. I sent this player a friend request to play with me at a later time but I don't know if he or she will accept. All I know is that I will continue to play and hope that this player will join me again in the future. On a side note, online players can also join in as zombies which I hated as they tended to be tougher to defeat.The jump-in-and-play feature of co-op play reminds me of that popular Zombie mode in Call of Duty Black Ops. The zombies keep coming in swarms but they were manageable. I had played it on normal mode so I can only imagine what the harder mode must be like. I can will probably play the game on a harder mode once I complete all the campaigns on normal. As a side note, you can hit your partner with your melee moves so keep a distance from him or her when fighting the zombies. I learned that the hard way and felt bad because I had hit the player's character by accident as I was trying to help him or her. And I could not apologize for my errant hit which leads me to my next comment.There is no audio communication between you and your partner in this game unlike in other games such as Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies so you cannot warn you partner when a zombie is approaching him or her from behind. All you an do is run to the rescue if you are able to. There is a mode at that comes up at times that allows you to thank the other player for rescuing you. I was able to do that a few times but sometimes it does not work like it should. But I can understand why this feature was not used as there is story audio going on during the game and in-game audio by players may ruin the atmosphere and stand in the way of good storytellingOne complaint that I have seen a lot in reviews by consumers is that there are too many QTE or Quick Time Events. These involve either moving the analog button in a certain quadrant or in a circular motion or pressing one of the action buttons at a precise time. Those QTE's did not bother me. They reminded me of the ones in God of War but they were used in more situations such as shaking off zombies. Other than that, it did not bother me at all. The only people that these QTE's might bother are those who are not too familiar with the button placements or do not have quick enough reflexes. But for those players they can set the game on easy and all the QTE's will be done for them. I think that they should have simply had a setting to turn off the QTE's as some may not like to have the game set to easy as now the whole game becomes too easy for them.What I also like is that you can choose unlimited ammo in the setting. This allows for more ammo to be available to you as you traverse the maps. The only thing is that sometimes you can still run out of ammo and have to rely on melee which I had to do a lot and as a result get injured a lot. I chose unlimited ammo as I don't need it to be as realistic as possible. But who plays video games to experience realistic play when it comes to Resident Evil? I'm just playing it to have fun. Same with racing games. I don't want to deal with having to repair the car before I can play the game. I just want to have fun.The only thing about playing the game with another player is that most will probably just play with you at a whim and then you will never encounter that player ever again. But if you have a friend who has a copy of the game, you can play the game in co-op from across the country. If you have a friend with you in the living room, you can play together at any time as a second player can just drop in and play at any time. What I love is that you don't have to worry that the other player will take all the ammo and other items as each player receives items equally from each pick up. You don't have to rush to get your share as there is plenty for everyone to take.I plan to play this game frequently after having a taste which left me wanting more. I could not stop playing as the action is non-stop. Gone are the days of quiet eerie moody environments. This game is about action and thrills. The zombies keep coming and there are a variety of them. What I also like is that on top of being able to shoot while moving, you can also kick and stomp on zombies. I actually saw my partner do an elbow drop right out of a pro wresting move. This game kept surprising me.If you are a fan of Resident Evil, shooters, melee or action games, you must play this game. This is a must-have as far as I am concerned. This is one of the best games I have played in a while. Yes, it is linear, but the story and action will suck you in. This game has great graphics and voice acting. I found it to be on par with Prince of Persia in that regard. The controls were excellent. It did not remind me at all of the controls of the old Resident Evil games. The camera was okay and did not hinder the game play as many reviewers stated. Get this game. It is worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2014"}

Yes, it's a screwball, over-the-top rip-off of Grindhouse -- but who doesn't want to play a screwball, over-the-top rip-off of Grindhouse? If you answered, \"I don't!\" this game isn't for you. For everyone else? This game is pure perfection.So why the 4 stars? Because the developers had 2 years to work on this after the Wii version and they only added 2 fun -- but short (shorter than usual) -- levels. It's ridiculous that at least 3 or 4 new levels couldn't be added. Or, at the very least, 2 very LONG levels exclusive to the PS3.The other thing I don't like is that you have the option to play it with a traditional controller. This is a \"light-gun\" game -- play with a traditional controller and you pretty much miss everything. This is for the Move and for the Move only. And if you play with the Move? You'll have a BLAST (literally).I can't explain why this game is so much fun (seriously, I can't -- if I did, my review would be censored). I can just say that I played through it on the Wii at least 3 times and, so far, I've played through the PS3 version by myself twice and with my girlfriend once, with my mom (yes -- my mom) once and with a couple of friends! I have went through this game 9 times (6 times on the PS3, alone)!What does the Move bring to the game? Far more accuracy, for a start. The Move wand (or whatever that sno-cone lookin' thing is officially called) is far more accurate than the Wiimote. The aforementioned 2 new levels (both fun, but, as I said, both short) and 3D.If you have a 3DTV, put them glasses on and be transported back to the earliest days of 3D horror!

A couple more exclusive new levels would have brought up the value. But this game, as it is, can be played again and again with friend after friend (not to mention your girlfriend and your mother, if they're not prudes).My only other complaint is it's already a few bucks less than when I bought it. But that's all the better for you! If you like horror. If you like cheese. If you like grindhouse. If you have a steady hand and good aim? Well, what are you waiting for?

The main thing that made the series so popular were the well developed storys. Now, the series seem more like an anime with a very bad script and story. The pros. 1. Very beautiful graphics. 2. The music is ok, at times it seems like the music doesn't fit certain situations in the game. (For example), a very upbeat song/ music is played during a sad and dramatic moment. 3. The battle system has been improved very well compared to ffxIII, i have no complaints. Now the cons.1.seriously, how many times do we have to hear \" we have to change the future\" ?. We get the point, no need to keep saying that. 2. Time travel, it's ok, but its obvious that square enix got this idea from a t.v show that was called stargate, And for a final fantasy game, this is very strange.3. The story is lacking and the way the game had ended made it clear that the game isnt complete. Overall, this is a nice looking game, but thats all thats great about it.

I say rare, because most trash games are lucky to get a few hours out of me before they get flushed down the toilet. I'll admit, reluctantly, that I tolerated the first part of the game. So when did the honeymoon end? Wow, where do I begin?-Story. To put it simply: it's dull. Aside from the initial medieval planet you start on, the rest of game failed to provide any form of intriguing plot. Once the giant SPACESHIP OF DOOM appeared and starting blasting things with laser beams, I yawned and lost interest. Most of the story is cliched, and that which is not tailors mostly to the Star Trek crowd (of which I am not a fan).-Characters. The characters you control are lame and annoying, with Fayt being the worst offender by far. \"Gee Cliff, I don't see why we can't just give that big dragon a big sloppy kiss and huggity hug so that we can all just live in glorious peace and harmony. Do we have to kill it?\" Never mind the fact that you just polished off 5,000 of his brothers and sisters in that cave you just trekked through, Fayt you moron. The other characters aren't as bad personality-wise, but they're just as verbose. Yada yada yada. Be quiet.-Dialogue. Mind-numbing. Like someone else said in their review, most of this game is dialogue and cut-scenes. You know, if a company is going to make this much of a game dialogue, then why not make it any good? God, I just wanted the characters to shut up already and go eat an blueberry or something. You're not philosophers, you're monster hitmen. Go do your job. Suffice it to say, this part of the game probably accounted for 15 of the 25 hrs I put into the game before ending the trauma altogether. Too much talking about a boring story and not enough action.-Battles. By far, the most irritating part of this game. Granted, it was unique for a few hours, but it quickly got old and stale. Why? For several reasons. 1) Enemy difficult is woefully inconsistent. You'll be blazing through one dungeon, killing enemies in 3-4 hits, and then in the very next dungeon, enemies take 50 hits before they die. I remember spending 2 hours in one area, raising mad levels with my Triple EXP bonus gauge activated, only to walk into the next dungeon and have the first group of enemies use me for toilet paper! WTF?! Bosses are the same way: ridiculously easy in one battle, and near impossible in the next (without at least 10 attempts). 2)Enemies use a paralysis counteract if you hit them when their fury is full. This wouldn't be a problem if enemy Fury actually DROPPED when they attacked like your players' do. I'll be lucky to get in one hit before CLANG NOW YOU'RE PARALYZED. The enemy would usually follow up with a hit that took 100 hp off my my 2500 hp total, and my bonus gauge would break, citing a Critical Hit. Yeah, that's a critical percentage. Fun. 3)Gone are the days when just losing all your HP would kill you, now you have to friggin' worry about your MP too! If it hits 0, you die! Hooray! My favorite part was in one cave where this one enemy used some vortex blade attack and killed off two of my high-level characters immediately (each had 3000+ hp full up), mainly because the attack removed MP rather than HP. Screw you. 4) Enemy AI is cheap and stupid. They simply use the same powerful attacks over and over again. Same goes for the lame bosses. Your characters are wailing away on some boss, lost in some 30 hit combo, when all of a sudden \"FIRE BREATH\" happens and all your characters and blown across the screen, with half their health gone, nearly dead from MP loss, and no fury. Probably confused or poisoned too. Rinse and repeat, and you have the general battle experience provided by this game.-Exploring/treasure. I remember in the good ol' days when exploring was productive and finding treasure chests was actually *GASP* enjoyable! Why? Because actual TREASURE was found. I think out of the 1,000 chests I managed to open before quitting, 950 of them contained some form of freakin' berry (used for healing purposes). Completely sucked the fun out of exploring. Why can't you give me more weapons!?!-Items. Yay, I can only carry 20 of each. Umm why, considering I use 5 of them after every battle. Nice.-Inventing. So dumb. Just how complicated must you make this process? It would be nice to have potential inventors clue you in as to which item they are looking for and where they are, rathing than spewing some more SO3 plot-garbage that means nothing anyway. Hooray, Cynthia is available to recruit! So where is she, and what do I need to do to get her? WHO KNOWS, NO ONE IS GOING TO TELL YOU! Why not even a little hint?? Oh I get it, \"difficulty\". Right.-Hidden things. This reminds me of the more recent final fantasy games. You have to complete 10 off the wall, ridiculously hard tasks just to get one weapon, or one inventor. Sure, I'll win a bunny race 100 times in a row to get this one inventor. Why on EARTH would you want to do that? How on EARTH would you even know to DO that in the first place? It's like they want you to purchase a strat guide with the game. Thieves.-Battle trophies. Stupid and not worth collecting, seeing how most of them are earned from completing mindless and outrageous tasks such as \"Win 5,000,000,000 battles\" or \"Win 3,000,000 battles without getting hit\", and when you do collect enough of them, the rewards are poor. Costumes for a battle mini-game. Yawn. New difficulty level. Oh wait, do I get to play the game on a NEW, HARDER difficulty level? Oh boy another 40 hrs of absolute frustration and poor design awaits.-Puzzles. I just love trial and error puzzles. It's a good thing too, since this game is full of them. Sigh. This category also needs to include the \"where do i go next\" puzzle, where during a cutscene, a character will mention off-hand where you need to go next, and I'll miss it because I sneezed or something, and then I'll have absolutely no idea where to go. And townspeople won't even help me! WTF? How about a world map that indicates your next location or goal. Novel!I remember 10 years ago when games used to be fun, and not a chore. You know, you can still have difficulty in a video game without making the player suffer through some overly complicated battle system, fighting enemies for hours on end because the stupid things won't die. If only the developers would take a little time to adjust the flow of the game-- start off easy and progressively get more difficult, but never too difficult as long as you're leveling at a reasonable rate. I want my games to move at a brisk pace, only slowing down when I choose to level or complete a sidequest. Don't make me spend 5 hours fighting enemies to gain enough experience to raise another TWO levels so that maybe ONE of my characters can survive a boss battle. Is that too much to ask?Lastly, let me end on a positive note. Thanks to the glorious idea that is \"Playstation greatest hits\", this POS was only 19.99. At least I didn't pay twice that for this dog.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2005"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

Well you have never been able to run and shoot on an RE game and that adds to the challenge. It was a longer game than 4, and did have some enjoyable moments.

I questioned earlier this year the lackluster teaser trailer shown to us, complaining that it showed nothing new, and that I would have little justification to go out and buy what would amount to more of the same.I'm not at all ashamed in saying I was proven wrong.  I wanted to be proven wrong.  And I was.Call of Duty 4 was like a good game that was given a powerful shot of energy to make a great and compelling campaign that had one special moment that came to a viewer like a hard smack in the face, the one thing that turns a great game into a classic game--- the mission \"Shock and Awe\", from start to end.  This needs no explanation here.The sequel aims heavily for upping its predecessor as much as possible, with a story far more complex and action-adventure laden, going bigger and faster as well as darker and edgier.Where Call of Duty 4 was a gritty smack to the face, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is like a kick to the back of the head.  And a curb stomp.Call of Duty 4 stuck out to me for its \"stinger\" moment---which not only succeeded beautifully in being shockingly realistic, but in playing off my very real and the very real fears of billions of people---nuclear destruction.  \"Shock and Awe\" gave us all of that, and turned an average campaign into a monstrous creature that blew us away (much the way Paul Jackson was?)Modern Warfare 2 doesn't use these moments very sparingly, and in fact indulges in them at a brisk, satisfying pace.  The opening mission is a very realistic journey into a war in Afghanistan, where your force has to hunt and kill many OpFor terrorists, and has an early sequence in which the Marines are riding in their big armored vehicles down completely barren and deserted streets.  An occasional civilian comes out and runs away in fear.  At one point, you see three men glaring nastily at you from a balcony, all but screaming \"bad guy\" about them, and yet you can do nothing.  Some time later, you're attacked.The rest of the story leaps immediately after this \"cold open\", and where it took half the campaign to kill off the American character in COD4, the American character is dead by the third mission here, in a mission called \"No Russian\", which itself is the most terrifying, gutwrenching, brutally offensive missions ever.  Just ever.Without spoiling it, there is a very good, and very mindblowing reason the terrorist Makarov tells his fellow terrorists \"No Russian\" in the mission's start.  The first half of the mission then involves you---an American spy, forced to go to any means to maintain your masquerade with Makarov---and the rest, murdering HUNDREDS of innocent civilians in a Russian airport.That was something I simply couldn't take in and register, and had to restart the level some time later to get over it.  I then realized then that they were very, very serious about the pre-game warning about the game's very extremely graphic content, and giving me a one-time only offer to turn off the graphic portions of the game.From there, the game keeps delivering \"HOLY SH!!\" moments again and again, but without spoiling you into expecting them every level.  However, a very similar ending to \"Shock and Awe\" appears this time around, spread across three whole missions and a cutscene (IN SPACE!)And yes, the game DOES give us more of the same---more stuff and junk.  More multiplayer options, more single player options, more weapons, etcetera.  It keeps the multiplayer system intact with great new options and fun.Another big improvement: the graphics.  These are by far some of the most realistic graphics I've seen in any game ever.  People's faces actually look human (though obviously 3D), and their mouths move correctly to their speech.  Details everywhere are given great attention, as random computer systems have every crease, button, hole, and screw in clear detail.  A box of mints shows in clear detail on the dashboard of a military vehicle.  Wads of gore stick to where they land, and boxes of paper for printing are in perfect detail and fully labeled all around.Then, the drawbacks.  None of these are enough to bring down the game even half a star:- The blood-on-the-screen look is probably more realistic than just shades of red, but it's incredibly distracting, and fills up far too much of the screen that it becomes almost impossible to see anything.- The story indulges a lot more in a fantastical action-packed nature of real, open war not just on terrorist organizations, but on an equal footing.  Part of what made Call of Duty 4 so great and shocking was that it essentially was based on reality and stuck to that---Americans were waging a \"war on terror\", surgically striking OpFor locations while hunting down the OpFor leader Al-Asad, the Bin Laden of this world, while SAS agents sneak around working against Russian (and perhaps Chechnyian) terrorists, in which both storylines overlap and become one towards the end.This time around, it stays to that storyline universe, while taking greater and greater departures from reality.  For me, there seems to be a genuine concern that the game that was so appealing for its realism may end up going just a bit too far into the fantastical, and while still be a great experience, not be as impactful as COD4 because it went beyond the realm of speculative realistic fiction, and into the realm of fantasy war stories, like \"Turning Point\", \"Command & Conquer/Red Alert\", \"Rainbow Six\", \"24\", and all the other modern-ish war stories that become fantasy on their own terms.Perhaps that's a good thing for this game, though it has more than enough features to make it an epic experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

Taking all the seriousness out of a sandbox adventure game and making it about explosions, superpowers, and hialrious violence. Elected president after saving the world, everything is quickly turned around when the Zin, a race of near giants arrive and conquer the Earth in a few short short, with the leader Zinyak imprisioning the Boss in a Matrix like duplication of Stillwater as a prison and punishment.All the same gameplay is here, from glaringly named and appearing phallic weapons to a gun that shoots music, you know what you're getting. All the favorite side missions reappear with an alien or Matrix twist, from mass destruction in a UFO to Insurance fraud to superspeed foot races.Audio and grpahics continue to be top notch, though I do wish they'd put a little more effort into the main world, which is literally copied from the previous game with UFO's and other alien tech injected along with some modifications to certain buildings. Voices are wonderful, and the comedy is in full force as you wander around the city.The story is the same as all the others, although you're left with only one faction to contend with rather than the standard 3 opposing gangs.The game is well polished, and there's really only a handful of nits. Taunts are near impossible, as you have to taunt a Zin, which are all automatically hostile once you're in range. Sidequests are all side missions almost, so you have to hold off on your favorite activities or miss a portion of dialogue, which can be near hysterical or just a token &#34;Go here and kill Zin.&#34; One major fustration are the Data Clusters, which are the pickup quest for the game, and come in at a whopping 1255 pickups for a single trophy. Also is 4th and 40, which requires 40 hours of gameplay to get. If you manage to take 40 hours to beat this, you're doing it wrong. Certain challenges are vague to the point that I've needed a walkthrough on about 10 or 12 of them, as I can't figure out what its actually asking for.Overall, this is great. Entertaining, explosive, with superpowered death matches and fun ragdoll physics as far as the eye can see. But it is missing something. When you're literally the One from the beginning, a portion of the challenge is missing. I've died maybe a handful of times, and only because I was fixated on getting a challenge that I didn't really care I was being shot at. And certain elements are cut and copy over and over, and don't have the oomph they used to, or have been punched up on difficulty to the point you have to cheese it out to get a gold (Fraud has this problem in spades). The third still is reigning champ in my mind, but not for any real reason I can put my finger on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2014"}

SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best.

An overturned military transport truck, riddled with corpses. Rookie member Rebecca Chambers is beginning to wonder what she got herself into. Bravo Team is about to discover the evil nightmare that is growing all around them.","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"The root of all evil is still fun","reviewText":"After several years of encountering zombies, there's no doubt, the Resident Evil series has definitely aged. When Capcom signed an exclusive deal with Nintendo to bring the series to the GameCube, it still brought little hope to the already tired RE formula. After the impressive Resident Evil remake, Resident Evil Zero was finally released. Gamers had to wait nearly four years for the game to come out, due to the jump from the N64. However, the results are still exceptional. While its been argued that RE0 is still flawed and failed to offer anything drastically new to the Resident Evil saga, it is still very much fun nonetheless.The game follows the events one day prior to those that took place during the mansion incident, when the Bravo Team was ultimately wiped out. One of its survivors, Rebecca Chambers, meets up with Billy Coen, an escaped convict. The story attempts to explain who established Umbrella and the origins of the T-Virus. While gamers were disappointed to know that it produced more questions than answers, RE0's story is more interesting than the RE remake. Also, the relationship between Rebecca and Billy is the most realistic in the entire series. Graphics-wise, its a masterpiece. Wine bottles move flawlessly, curtains flap in the wind, and dust trails behind you. The rain and water effects are also stunning. The sound is also welcome to one's ears. Silence is often utilized to instill impending fear, while the voice-acting has improved. The music is adrenaline-inducing when suddenly attacked, and calm during moments of relief. The graphics and sound create the perfect atmosphere, with some of the best audio-visual presentations of any game thus far.The Resident Evil series has always reinvented itself control-wise with each consecutive release, and Resident Evil Zero contains its share of unique gameplay. This time around, the magical item boxes are gone, which allows the player to drop items anywhere they please. Zero's zapping system gives you the ability to switch between characters on the fly. This inventory system will be clunky and frustrating to first-timers and even to RE veterans. It takes time getting used to. The game forces you to manage your items carefully between the two characters and make sure both remain alive. Its up to the player how to figure out puzzles using one or both characters. With Rebecca and Billy at your disposal, you can either go solo or team up on enemies, strategically saving ammo and each other. It isn't all perfect, however. At times, your computer-controlled partner may not respond to attacks accurately. Although the inventory and battle systems aren't perfectly polished, RE0 is the most innovative Resident Evil game since Nemesis.Resident Evil 0 is the least scariest of all the RE titles and it touches on all-too familiar territory. These reasons explain why it is also one of the least appreciated games. Managing the inventory will certainly turn people off, but another run through will definitely help you become better, it will make you like the game a lot more. The game's combat system is also cumbersome, but its fresh idea offers something new to the fold. By now, the RE series has grown old and overdone. It has come to a point to where the usual RE traditions have become too predictable, and the tried-and-true gameplay is just routine now. Even though Resident Evil 0 was not exactly the breakthrough title gamers and RE enthusiasts hoped it would be, it is not a bad game by any means. Avoid comparing it to other RE titles and simply enjoy what the game has to offer. Even after several years of the same zombie killing and puzzle solving, this Evil outing may still offer a night of fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2004"}

I mean this is a PS2 system, unless you've been living in a cave you know the basics already.This model:-Yes it has a fan, just a small one.-AC adapter is inside the machine, there is no power brick.-DVD drive is top loading not front loading.  DVDs click in place like Game Cube.-Network adapter (for all the use it is) is integrated.-There is no \"off\" switch.  It's either on, in standby, or unplugged from the wall.It does heat up due to the tiny size and tightly packed electronics.  I'd suggest setting it on theAllsop 27021 Metal Art Jr Monitor Stand.  First, you can store your controller(s) under the PS2 that way and second the stand is slit for ventilation and the metal construction acts as a massive heat sink.  It's also probably cheaper than a lot of things designed specifically with cooling in mind and unlike fans, it won't wear out and it can't draw too much power through the USB and fry your PS2 over time.I can't say for sure how long this particular model of PS2 functions before it will break down, but mine is over 6 months and running now.

And I must say I absolutely loved it! I do plan on trying out Fallout 3 as well.The storyline is very engaging once you get past the starting phase. It may take a little while to get used to for a non-Fallout player, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun. Most, cities in the game are copies of their real-life counterparts. The city of Nipton which is in California is nearly the same as it is in New Vegas. This applies to the Hoover Dam, GoodSprings, and of course parts of Vegas (which is known as New Vegas).The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland (Nevada, California, Utah, and Arizona) There is so much to explore in this giant map and the interactions between you and NPCs are pretty cool. Yes, companions do come back and they will join you depending on your decisions and the path you chose. You can choose between 3 main paths, but I'll leave you to find that out for yourself.As mentioned above, I have played this game twice and still haven't gotten through all the good stuff. The replay value is VERY high due to the content each path provides or simply due to the lack of exploring. The DLCs for this game are also very good but we are here to talk about the stock game. If you are interested in getting the DLC straight off the bat, then I highly recommend the Ultimate Edition of this game.Fallout New Vegas is an awesome experience, if you like Sin City and the 50s era theme, then this game is perfect for you!(Please note that you should play the game without DLC first to fully understand it without jumping into the DLC portion of the story)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2013"}

In \"New Vegas\", the player takes the role of a courier whose package was stolen and who was left near-death. Recovering thanks to the aid of a friendly local doctor, it's up to the courier to decide what they want to do about it - to seek revenge, to try to recover the package, and which faction to aid in the war-torn Mojave desert.Unlike Fallout 3, which was fairly limited in terms of story choices, New Vegas is much more about the player choosing on their own what to do. There are several major factions in the game that the player can opt to support. These include Mr. House, the enigmatic ruler of New Vegas, the New California Republic, a democratic assembly from out west, and Caesar's Legion, a brutal but efficient army of tribes intent on subjugating the wasteland. Like past games, there's also a variety of sidequests that can have different outcomes for local communities. While the sides are a bit black-and-white (there's no doubt that Caesar's Legion is the evil choice, even though they try to dress it up with \"it's the most efficient choice and they keep raiders away\"), it's still better than FO3's story, which was unquestionably linear.The gameplay itself is more solid than Fallout 3's, as well. The gunplay, in particular, is much improved, and offers the addition of iron sights for most weapons. This allows for more accurate shooting, and in general combat feels more responsive. The VATS system from FO3 is still present, allowing for pinpoint targeting of enemy limbs, but it's been intentionally made less accurate so that players will have more incentive to use normal shooting (which was basically worthless in FO3). The melee weapons still have the same problems they had in FO3 though, namely questionable hit detection and poor VATS responsiveness.In addition to its normal gameplay, New Vegas also offers a \"hardcore mode\" designed to appeal to people who want to play it more like a survival game. In hardcore mode, healing items restore less health (and restore it over time, instead of instantly). However, the most important change in hardcore mode is the need for food, water, and sleep - something that's present in normal gameplay, but only for healing purposes. In hardcore mode, finding food and water is as important a part of the game as defeating enemies and scavenging gear, which makes the game feel a lot more \"post-apocalyptic\". In both FO3 and New Vegas, there's sources of food and water around the desert (broken pipes and old plumbing serves as an unpleasant, but viable, water option). However, only hardcore mode makes it actually worth looking for them, which makes it kind of a neat touch.FO:NV shares a lot of FO3's problems, since it's closer to a mod of FO3 than a new game. However, it's drastically improved upon FO3 in terms of things like story, writing, and atmosphere. While the game is far from perfect, the things that are bad about it can be traced back to the FO3 gameplay and engine, while the things that are good about it are mostly connected to its own material. That's not to say the game is perfect, either - the wider variety of choices means that a lot of the quests are buggy and can easily be broken, and the wasteland of New Vegas is a lot less open to exploration (stray from the road and you're likely to find high-level monsters almost immediately that outclass you even when you're high level). Still, compared to FO3 it's a much more immersive experience.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I already played as 3 classes and will continue until I play all the classes and on different levels. I never had so much fun before. What disappoints me is how fast the story ends. I wish it had more. A LOT more adventures, story lines, action. The game is PERFECT in my opinion. It just looks too short. What I want is some more new characters in Mass Effect 3, BESIDE of the old ones, and longer, longer gameplay. Game rocks. Absolutely fantastic in my opinion. Oh and to see what characters, we, gamers love IN ME2, please just go to forums, google em.Some characters I love so much that if they will be not available in ME3, I will kill someone. And that is about Liara. I really like Liara in ME1, but in ME2 she can't be on my team. I just wish she could be. She is one of my favorite characters. I really want her in ME 3.As for ME3: add more content( more romance, longer,sexier and with more ways to date with a character). Hopefully the game will be 18+ :D Not for some kids. When the game is bug free, with a great stories, plot and u are sure on all 1000% that we won't be disappointed, then release it and don't forget DLC for later. I cant wait for ME3 collectors edition! And sad that ME1 has only standard edition for PC. Thats a shame.Do not repeat other games and break our dreams and desires to play it.Last words:I love ya dudes, girls, for making such an amazing, super awesome game. Wish it had no bug like when u walk up into the air and couldn't move. But hell with it. I wish there was a way to turn a game into reality. I just love it that much.I give the game infinite amount of stars. I hope developers do read comments and reviews on their game.

{"product_name":"B00C1ZBFTW","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Continuing the excellence.","reviewText":"Update (8/6/2013):Nearing end of game!  The game gets insanely tough later on, especially boss battles.  There is some DLC available, and more in the works, but I haven't added anything other than the Amazon.com coat (which is not really all that useful past level 8 or 9).  I wanted to present a review of the core game.  I have heard that a couple of DLC quests are repeatable for massive exp, so I didn't want to add those and change the balance.  On a subsequent play through I will load most of the DLC.One thing to remember is to NOT GIVE UP.  Some battles are tough and require balancing or adjusting your party.  I HIGHLY recommend adding extra slots for demons.  This is probably one of the best ways to keep reserves for both battles and for fusion.Update (7/21/2013):If you got the pre-order with the bonus book, do not read the book at all if you want to contain the surprise of the story.  There is a ton of spoilers, even within the location concept art.  Just be aware of this.  I would say about an hour after beating Minotaur is a good time to look at the book and not spoil some of the surprise.  Also, the story does have a lot of interesting twists and turns.  The English voice cast is excellent, the sound editing is spot on, much better then Soul Hackers.My only problem is the difficulty which sometimes is easy (even on the harder setting), but if you aren't careful, even weaker groups of foes might get lucky and wipe out your party.  All it takes is a few key hits on your party's weak points and the enemies gain extra turns.  Also, enemy groups might be hiding reinforcements.  Always dangerous.  The game does offer you two options for if you are getting creamed: you can revive your party with macca after you get game over.  You can actually do this for free if you keep negotiating with Charon.  The other option is that after you get game over a couple of times, the game prompts you with a lower difficulty setting.  I did not choose to lower the difficulty, and if you have played games in the series, I recommend also keeping the tougher setting.  It's worth it.  Since you can save (nearly) anywhere, it's not a big deal if you die.  Just keep saving!-----------------------------Original Review:The 3DS is an interesting system.  Love or hate the 3D (I am not a fan), it's tough to argue with the quality of games being published.  Shin Megami Tensei is one of those games that bears solid roots in classic RPG styles, yet has fresh and up to date touches that keep each new release interesting.  The previous SMT 3DS release was Soul Hackers, a re-release of a PS1 (and Saturn) game.  This is the first original SMT game on the 3DS, and I hope it won't be the last.I haven't spent too much time with the game, but I wanted to put down a few initial impressions based on my time playing this and virtually every other SMT title (all the way back to the Famicom original).  There are a few interesting changes from previous games, but I feel this game bears a little more similarity in style to Persona 4 than previous SMT titles.  Mainly this is interface and gameplay, not story and theme of course.Speaking of the story, the game starts off interesting in a fictitious future based on a feudal style Japan yet modern in time.  Suffice to say, like other SMT titles the heroes become caught up in the battle between good and evil using demons as their scions.  It's like a grown up Pokemon.  Demons are either light or dark and this makes for interesting strategy and team building.  And the demons are mostly familiar for fans of other SMT titles.  Although the attitude level has been ratcheted up on a few!  Looking at you Wendigo!  And the spell names are the same (mostly) as previous SMT games as well.  So fans of the series will be familiar with the names, but those who aren't might not know what Bufu, Dia, Agi, and other spell names refer to.  But there are descriptions of each in game.The pre-order bonus was a great plus.  The design book was mainly a strategy guide with just about 10 or 15 pages of design works.  The soundtrack is also a nice bonus.  But for those newer to the series, the strategy guide will help players through the initial portion of the game.The main storyline is very interesting, but a welcome addition is the side quests.  There are many to undertake and rewards very from a little macca (money) to rare weapons and items.So far the game has not let me down.  I will update the review further as I play more deeply into the game, but my main response is this: if you've played a Shin Megami Tensei game, then expect more of the same great style and story.  If you're new to the series, this might be a good starting point, but perhaps playing a Persona title first might be less shocking unless you are familiar with this style of RPG.Highly recommended.  And the $30 Nintendo e-shop bonus was a nice plus for purchasing this and Fire Emblem.  I used it to get Animal Crossing for $5!  Win win!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}

The gameplay is varied and involves exploration, strategy, and stealth, among other elements. With an engaging story line filled with conflict, magic, and discovery, the game follows Rau, a heroic warrior unmatched in skill and strength, as he battles through richly detailed environments to discover the truth about his family's dark secret. Featuring a completely new and innovative combat system, detailed character design, and clever gameplay,The Mark of Kriaims to breathe new life into the action-adventure genre.","reviewerName":"Seppo Helava","summary":"Disney + Conan + Gore = ?","reviewText":"The Mark of Kri is not a game for kids. Its lush animation, and soft, almost painterly graphics may at first appear to be geared towards a younger audience, but the first time the main character, a barbarian named Rau, cuts an enemy's arm off, then turns around and cleaves a foe in two, it becomes obvious that the style is no indication of the target age.That said, The Mark of Kri is a beautiful game, whose presentation is second to none. The innovative combat system allows for both interesting one-on-one battles, and more chaotic multi-person battles. Essentially, using the right analog stick to target an enemy will cause an icon corresponding to one of the PS2 controller's buttons to appear over an enemy's head. Until you either \"stop focus\", or kill the enemy, hitting that button will target that enemy. If fewer than three enemies are targetted (the triangle button serves a different purpose, as do the shoulder buttons), the unused buttons become attack modifiers, allowing you to do different combo attacks, providing some much-needed variety.The game isn't strictly about combat, however. Rau is able to sneak about, and kill his enemies stealthily, and he is able to snipe enemies using a bow he is given. The variety in combat techniques gives the player a number of ways to approach problems in the game, giving it a bit of nonlinearity that's not standard in an action game of this sort.Rau's \"sprit guide\", a bird named Kuzo, provides yet another gameplay element. Rau can see through Kuzo's eyes, and as such, can send the bird ahead of him, so he can plan how to best attack the enemies that lie in wait.The Mark of Kri is an interesting, varied action game. It's not tremendously long, but doesn't lose your interest, with lots of options to unlock, and a good amount of replay value. The graphics and animation are reminiscent of a Disney film, the feel of the movie, and the narrator, are very Conan-esque, and the abundance of gore, as a result of the excellent and innovative combat engine provide a game that, at first blush, may look like an overly violent kid's game, but in execution, is a wonderfully differently stylized game, made for adults.Great stuff.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2002"}

Who knew that back in 1992, Nintendo was about to release something so epic onto the gaming community. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was a Zelda classic that graced the SNES years ago. It was and still is revered as one of the best SNES games and one of the strongest entries in the Zelda series.Many reviewers have already broke down the gist of the game so I will simply add my two cents to my review of it. This game brought back the gameplay mechanics of the first NES title and expands on it in every way imaginable. Top it off with the graphics and sounds capable of what the SNES can put out and an even bigger quest than the previous two games before it and you got a classic that you won't be able to put down. Everything about the game is perfect: the overall presentation, the top down perspective that showed every graphical detail of the overworld and dungeons, spot on controls that had you control Link on his quest to save Princess Zelda, memorable music tracks, incredible sound effects all wrapped up in a quest that will take days to complete (and even longer if you find all of the game's secrets.)In case you missed out on this great game (shame on you), then you can either pick up a used copy of your SNES still works, pick up a copy released for the Game Boy Advance or download this title for the Wii via their Virtual Console Service for 800 points ($8 U.S.) It's well worth playing and well worth seeing why this game continues to receive high praise so don't miss out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"An Honorable Addition to The New Square Enix Library","reviewText":"When news of a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics spread, it seemed the world became merrier, peaceful, and precious.  So it is real, I may have thought, dreams can come true.  Yet, as hype can sometimes turn as a spiteful enemy, journalists professed that the next installment to FF Tactics was not proper to its heir.  Totally unsurprised and a wee bit infuriated, I still clung on to my gaming faith to see how Square Enix's first U.S. game fared.  Its been quite a wait, and a Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is finally available.  Those journalists were right though, the game doesn't truly feel as an authentic sequel.  Gone are the Lion Wars, the distraught St. Aujora, the heroics of Ramza, and a considerable number of things that charted the original.It's puzzling to assume why Square does what it does.  I mean wouldn't have you gained much, much more acclaim if you were to craft a direct sequel on the next generation console?  Instead they design an unrelated story and throw it on the Game Boy Advance.  It was hard to climb out of my mountain of expectations, but once I accepted what the game was, I was aware that Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is an honorable addition to the Square Enix collection.  Ignoring my lofty hopes of a greater predecessor, in terms of the Game Boy Advance, the latest strategy whirl on the Game Boy Advance pulls off exceedingly.Starring Marche, a rather reticent kid, he befriends two of his classmates, and because of opening a magical tome, they all awake in the world of \"Final Fantasy.\"  Stranded there, all of them go their separate ways, living an alter life of knights, princes, fighters, wizards, and all that which delineates the realm of fantasy.  Marche, intent on going back home, finds himself destroying the mythological crystals that closely connect the world of Final Fantasy.  Protected by mighty guardians, he fights them without the knowledge that the crystals are the very foundation of how the world exists.  To an extent, I did in fact wonder how the outcome would shape, but plenty of the story went drably by and the mere incentive to play was simply based on the enjoyment of the gameplay.If you're reading this I assume that you already know the basic mechanics.  Mirroring Tactics Ogre for the Game Boy Advance, FFTA is a traditional, Turn-Based Strategy/RPG.  New races such as the moogle, man-sized reptiles who welcome a good clash make up the bangaa, and the chubby, unphysical spell-masters are the nu mou.  In a nut-shell, humans usually take up most classes, moogle units are both magic oriented and brave enough to take ranks as knights, the Bangaa love to wield the sword but not that of a staff, and the nu mou are the entirely opposite of the bangaa.  Its best to mix up the squadron of units because each class has their own strength and particular class to take advantage of.  Races aside, the player is allowed to have the usual limit of six characters on the battlefield, plus the regular commands.  Akin to the original, most of the commands are determined by the which class is chosen, as well as the secondary class.The plot advances as the player chooses to sign up for Missions located in the pub of every town.  Players must pay for the information and agree to take up a Mission to take on villains.  After the battle, players are given profits and AP points.  Unlike the traditional benefits of gaining levels, where abilities are mastered, FFTA works in ways of FFVII.  Equipped weapons, like materia, present abilities to a character.  It takes a certain amount of AP points before the character permanently attains the ability desired.  Fortunately, gaining the abilities is quick, since most battles rewards players with plenty of points and EXP.  Also, Pub's offer solo missions for individual characters.  They can either fail or succeed, if so, they are rewarded individual AP points, gil, and items. Sharing a little from Secret of Mana on PS1, the player has the decision where to place locations on the map.  An observant player would also note that specific locations can trigger a treasure to pop up for the taking.Battle is also regulated by laws.  At every battle, the player can read what action is illegal.  Should a player break a law, the fully armored judge, who rides a chocobo, casts the defiant character with either a minor yellow card or a serious red card.  As a rule, the cards lead up to a jail sentence for an amount of time, depending on the character's history and actions.  At times a player can forget to check on the laws.  What's more, there are occurrences when I had to change weapons, classes, and try different approaches to saturate the enemy in defeat.  And when the essential things like items or cure spells are forbidden frustration can build up fast.As any other Tactical RPG, FFTA is a joy to see your cast grow up as their stats increase.  Buying and receiving an formidable arsenal and possessing the option to choose a myriad of classes is part of the fun.  I really immersed myself into the game.  Taking the role of clan to battle others was refreshing, and the clan itself, the default name of \"Nutsy,\" having the ability to level up as well just augmented that.  As the player accomplishes more and more missions, and send individual units to partake in others, the clan stats increase depending on the kind of mission.  Superior to Tactics Ogre, yet another gem, FFTA maintains the Square Enix name we can usually trust.  With over 300 missions to conquer and other optional quests, FFTA can strip the player's hours without him even knowing.  Although, some say FFTA takes an extra step to get into, I would rebuke by saying this game is rather easy to master.  I knew FFTA would be different, and it is.  Despite its overall lackluster appearance, it still controls to grab the player's attention and be engrossed to the reminiscence of Final Fantasy Tactics.FFTA is your average schmoe in the plot area.  Marche is given the chance to live his wildest dreams of a hero slaying the baddies, yet he feels going home is for the best.  After all he has a sick, wheel-chair ridden brother to take care of.  While, the story isn't as boorish as many claim, I had quite some fun engaging the story and penned up a fanfic.  So if a game can inspire a gamer to write a story behind it, then it can't be that bad can it?  But then again, I usually write one after each RPG I've bought.  Be the judge yourself.  Just don't send me to prison.  And don't throw me a red card, not the red card!  Where is Ezel, the nu mou inventor of the antilaw which supercedes the unlawful actions?  Where is he?Closely parallel to Tactics Ogre's performance, FFTA on the GBA screen is full of color.  The sprites are big, but do not reflect how the characters look in the actual gaming manual.  Such as the moogles, they are petite, but are far too overgrown on the screen.  No biggie though, its just the Game Boy Advance.  Graphically, you can't demand too much, for there is no mad need for eye-candy, is there?  As far as the audio goes, you can forget it to even reach as far as the original's unforgettable score.  FFTA's music is just decent and repetitive.  I suggest to conserve battery life, turn the music down, and just listen to your fancy of a musical genre.  The only important quibble I have on the graphics are the instances when slow down bog the game down and no rotating camera.  Slow down occurs when a character is moving and jumps on a higher or lower platform.  Despite it, its not too much of a threat.  With well over average tunes, a good look to it and distinguishable characters, the presentation is done right.Yeah, the title is very deceptive, but I have to forgive Square Enix, because there has been a real drought of RPGs.  In the wait for the more engrossing titles, you can sit back, take a load off (not literally), and get into this commendable game.  Handling easily enough, playing even better, FFTA was well worth the wait, but I don't agree to the common price of $40, nor the unconnected storyline.  Somehow I think I'm being cheated by the heavy price and misleading titles of late.  Oh well, I guess I have to bear it all, and suck it up like a man.  Gotta be thankful for all these incredible games, man.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2003"}

You are a muscular, well trained soldier wearing pounds of gear, armor and weapons - and it'll barely be enough to keep you alive.This game is compared frequently to Halo, but if Halo is the lighthearted ease of Star Wars, Gears of War is the non-stop assault and clinging to life of Alien. You're not jumping around like a kangaroo here, blasting at foes. You are heavily laden, crouching behind anything you can find to shield you, trying your best to stay alive for five more minutes. You have to work strategically with your fellow soldiers to climb forward every inch.The graphics in Gears of War are very impressive. The game is done in a palatte of browns, greys and reds. The dismal skies above, the swarms of black birds, the dented and dingy equipment - this is a world on the verge of despair. Enemies don't stand out with brightly colored costumes. You have to really pay attention to know where they are and to take them out.The sounds really help drive home the urgency of your mission. Voices cry out on all sides for help. The hammering of the machine guns and rapid fire weapons ring in your ears. The soundtrack is pounding and epic. If anything this is all TOO pounding - after playing this for weeks, I really can get a headache :) I'd turn it down, but then I wouldn't be able to tell where the enemies were sniping me from sometimes.The storyline really helps involve you in what is going on. It's like being at the center of a high power action movie. There are decisions you can make along the way to help guide the story. I really enjoy the \"fight for every inch of soil\" way it has you feel like you are involved in a real challenge. It might seem TOO challenging for some new gamers. Stick with it - it's well worth it.I do wish, with all of their emphasis on taking cover and being cautious - that you could CROUCH. I understand not being able to jump - you're wearing hundreds of pounds of gear! However, you can crouch behind cover. Why can't you crouch when you're not near cover, to lower your profile a bit? I think that would help out in some situations.Still, that's a minor complaint for a fantastic game. If you're a mature gamer (there's a fair amount of blood here) that enjoys shooters, definitely pick this one up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Shaimun","summary":"Best Exclusive for Xbox","reviewText":"The first game I bought for my Xbox 360 was Gears of War 2. I later wanted to play the first game in the series and here it is. My review for it.It is a heavy 3rd person shooter. I mean the protagonists are guys that look like they've eaten too much protein and worked out in the gym 24/7. That is besides the point. The characters are likeable and they can be funny sometimes, especially Cole Train.The game-play feels pretty heavy. You take cover and shoot. The problem is, the controls don't transition smoothly sometimes and it may feel frustrating on a higher difficulty setting. On some parts of the game, you will be split up from your squad. The problem with this is if you get knocked down, it is game-over because if you were playing co-op, The 2nd player is the only one able to revive you. Unless you get through the split section, you cannot afford to die. The game can be difficult this way since latter versions of the game like Gears of War 2 and 3, the Coop AI are able to revive you.The story is about an underground species called Locusts that causing a miss on the planet. The story is pretty good. I have played this game a couple of times. There is great replay value in the Gears of War series. There is just an everlasting feeling of using a Lancer(Gears of War weapon) to slice locusts in half.If you are thinking about getting into Gears of War, play this one first before 2 and 3 obviously.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2012"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Bring on the Souls","reviewText":"Soul Calibur continues it's reign over the fighting with weapons game genre. With the latest installment, some things that you enjoyed about previous titles remain while new features have been added.In addition, Soul Calibur III's misplaced create-a-character strategy game is gone. For some reason a lot of people thought that SC III wasn't quite the same, or up to par. But it did introduce some new characters, and they -- among some other new/special characters-- return for the 4th Soul Calibur.When first heard that Star Wars was going to make an appearance, it was met with considerable skepticism. But, in the PS3 version Darth Vader and his apprentice are welcome characters. They are integrated by an added \"Force Bar\" which allows them to use the force until it runs out or is replenished.__Gameplay__The characters feel solid in this one. You can perform some amazing moves with each of the characters, in addition to the new feature of performing a \"critical\" on your opponent. Criticals are performed by first knocking off a piece of armor, and then attacking the vulnerable spot. When the opponent's Soul Gauge is depleted you can perform the Critical, no matter what their health status is.Instead of just gaining \"levels\" to show what kind of fighter you are, the levels actually correspond to abilities of that character. All characters in the game and even those that you create have the ability to become better / stronger. Take Taki for instance. After using her for a bit she gains a couple of levels and in the Create-A-Character customization, you can give her a different weapon and change her skills to give her bonuses or abilities during battle. Some are passive, but some can be activated using power from the Soul Gauge. One of Taki's abilities is to become invisible for a period of time (Repeatedly press default [R2]). Some other abilities that could be added were the ability to drain the opponents Gauge with impacts, or to steal some of their HP. The \"Appeal\" ability works on gaining an advantage over opponents of the opposite sex, but hurts the character when fighting against the same sex.Another feature is the Tower of Souls. The idea is that as you work you way up the Tower, the enemies become harder. After you work you way to the top, you've given the option of descending below the Tower, into its depths, for more challenges.Of course, Gold is the currency of the game, and it's how you unlock weapons, some of the initial characters, clothing/items for customization, and the extra features such as special animations, illustrations, etc._Online_Another new feature, this one is going to take some getting used to. As it stands now, the feature does need some work. Nice idea, but poor execution. Hopefully a patch will update the problems with the online. (For example: when losing in a match you can quit to avoid being beaten without a penalty for quitting, and the would-be winner gains nothing)_Overall_All in all this is a great title, and a lot of fun to play. The Story and Arcade modes may be short, but have interesting stories and are easily played over and over to gain experience and gold. I'm also intrigued as to what DLC (downloadable content) will be released.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2008"}

Many of the fighting mechanics from NG2 are back (which is a good thing).  The Steel on Bone is still in the gameplay and takes quite some time to master but learning it is essential for harder difficulties (invincibility frames are very useful).  And speaking of difficult, they sure didn't go easy on that aspect.  Master Ninja wasn't too insane but then that unlocks Ultimate Ninja (which is a new category for the series), and I'll tell you what, it will test every ounce of your patience (the White Spider bosses of Day 7 are absolutely bonkers difficult).  But you do feel a higher sense of accomplishment.  So,if you liked NG2, NG3:RE will not let you down.There is also added online content, which is fun to play as well, particularly the co-op battles.  And, once again, the Master and Ultimate levels are hard as a mutha.  Good luck.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}

The fourth (main) title in the Ratchet & Clank franchise is another must play game.I won't repeat all the things already said about this game ad naseum, except these:Graphics: They are truly stunning.  I will admit though after hearing all the Pixar comparisons that we aren't there just yet, barely.  R&C; is at the top tier of this generation for games but honestly nothing I have seen has yet to compare to Ratatouille on Blu-ray, IMHO.Gameplay:  Solid, solid, solid.  Some have said the gameplay is too easy and if I had anything to complain about, it might be this.  I am not a glutton for a punishment in my games nor am I a hardcore gamer, but even I could've appreciated the difficulty tweaked to be a \"bit\" harder.  Case in point, it seemed weird to constantly be passing by health regenerating orbs after just being fully healed by an equipment vendor.That said, the variety and sheer quality of gameplay alleviate any complaint I might have had about difficulty.  From run-and-gun, to platforming, to vehicle combat, the game is NEVER left with a feeling of monotony.  Like previous reviewer have said, this makes putting this game down very hard.  It is just that fun.Story, Sound, etc:  The voice acting is top notch and par for the series.  The story, while a little convoluted is well presented and adds to the gameplay.  The series is also noted for its sense of humor and that tradition contiues well here.  It avoids cheesy jokes and never wears out its welcome.  Replay is also here due to the ability to go back through the game and collect tokens previously missed to unlock extras as well as maximize all your weapons.In conclusion:  While the game isn't perfect, it is just so much fun and engaging that it really is a must buy for anyone interested in this genre at all.  As for people who generally avoid action platformers, a rental is definitely worth it to check out what everyone is raving about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2008"}

His younger brothers always wanted to use it.  I decided to buy a second as a birthday gift for one of the younger boys.I went with the XL because my son is going to be 7 and I felt that the bigger screen would better suit him.  The clerk at a local game store suggested the 3D instead but I passed. I wanted the freedom of the kids being able to share games for the systems. My son is also only going to be 7 and I felt that 3D was \"too much\" for him. Plus, I worried about headaches it may cause or eye strain.I considered the Lite but one of the tools on the DSi the my kids love is the camera feature.  The Lite doesn't have it so I was back to the DSi.  Anyway, I went with what I knew would work best for my son.He was thrilled.  The system is bigger than the standard DSi.  There is more for him to grip onto.  He loves it.  He was able to immediately utilize many of the features that he learned about on his brother's DSi. The burgandy color is an excellent gender neutral color.My oldest son said the games look much better on this DSi than on his smaller one.There is a parental control on the device.  I suspect it is for internet.  We never connected my oldest son's DSi to the internet and we're not going to connect this one as well.  Really, he just wanted to play Lego video games and take pictures and that's enough for us.Overall he is very happy.

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"An intense single player campaign and a fun, although uninspired, multiplayer makes Crysis 2 worth picking up","reviewText":"Crysis 2, the latest graphical powerhouse from developer Crytek, marks a number of firsts for the developer. For the first time they have left the lush tropical setting and moved to the urban jungle of New York city, providing a number of gameplay changes from previous games in the city. Crysis 2 also marks the first time the developer has targeted the console platforms as well as the PC. This decision was met with some disappointment from some of the PC gamer elitists. All of Crytek&#8217;s previous games focused on pushing PC graphics technology as far as it could go, resulting in games that looked absolutely stunning but required thousands of dollars of PC hardware to run adequately. PC gamers often used these games as showpieces for their gaming rigs, using them as an example of why PC gaming was superior to the consoles. The disappointment was based on the assumption that by developing the game for the consoles, the PC version would suffer due to the rather old console hardware.It would seem that in the process of optimizing the game to run on the older console hardware has resulted in much more reasonable system requirements on the PC then the previous Crysis games. I was able to run Crysis 2 on my somewhat modest gaming PC at the maximum graphics setting with very smooth frame rates. This same computer still has the occasional slowdowns running Crysis 1 at maximum graphics settings, and that game is a few years old at this point. That is not to say that the game doesn&#8217;t push graphics hardware like the first Crysis did. This game looks absolutely phenomenal, easily winning the category of best looking game this year. In fact, every aspect of the presentation is impressive. New York city is almost photo-realistic at times, and the scope of all of the environments is truly impressive. Character faces look lifelike, and the animation is fluid and natural. The visual presentation here is second to none, and the fact that the game runs on consoles is an equally impressive feat. The PC version of the game is the best looking of them all, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions look great as well. Whatever platform you play Crysis 2 on, know that it is the most impressive looking game around. The only disappointment with the presentation was some issues with 5.1 surround sound mixing. Dialog coming out of the rear channels was often too quiet, even when the character speaking was only a few feet back.Moving the game from the jungle to the city has resulted in a few gameplay changes over the previous two entries in the series. The environments in the previous games were pretty wide open, allowing for numerous ways to approach each enemy encounter,  places to hide, and tactics to take. The open-ended level design of Crysis 2 has been scaled back a bit, as you have fewer opportunities fighting in city streets then in dense vegetation filled jungles. The tradeoff here is that the city provides a bit of verticality that the other games never had. There are lots of things to climb in the city, providing lots of opportunities to take the high ground and work your way around patrols. The setting also provides a lot more cover to take advantage of, with abandoned cars, signs, benches, and other things placed all over.You still have the same weapon customization options available as you would expect. You can attach an assortment of scopes, silencers, laser sights, and launchers to many of the weapons, increasing their usefulness in multiple combat scenarios. The suit abilities are back, but this time you can customize those as well. Taking down the alien enemies in the game provides you with &#8220;nano catalysts&#8221;  to spend on suit upgrades. These upgrades have affects such as reducing the energy drain while cloaked, adding tracers to bullets fired at you, increasing the damage you can absorb, and providing you with more air control when falling. You can only have a few of these upgrades activated at a time, and the proper selection of upgrades in the right situation can make your life a lot easier.The suit has also been streamlined a bit, and the game is better for it. Instead of having to manually switch between speed and strength, they automatically kick in when you want them. Holding down the sprint button activates speed, draining energy as you run really fast. Holding down the jump button will automatically activate strength, allowing you to jump many feet into the air. The suit controls much more naturally now, allowing you to stay in the combat at all times instead of fumbling with a radial menu when you need to switch abilities.The open environments and the customizable weapons and nano-suit abilities gives the combat in the game a sandbox feel. There are a lot of ways to approach any combat space, and thanks to pretty solid enemy AI no two encounters will ever play out the same way. The brute force and stealth approach are always viable options, however the stealth route is often pretty easy and ultimately less satisfying. It is just way too easy to sneak past enemies using the cloak if you have upgraded it, often allowing you to skip somewhat large portions of the game. For example, at one point in the game you are tasked with fighting your way into an armored compound to kill the enemy leader. Dozens of heavily armored guards stand between you and him. The resulting firefight is intense and extremely fun. However you could also choose to cloak and bypass everyone, walking straight up to the commander and taking him out without a shot fired.  Since a lot of the combat can be skipped if you choose, your playing time will vary.  I only used the stealth suit to sneak past a few encounters and finished the game in roughly eight hours.Some of the people I have talked to consider being able to skip large portions of the game broken, making the game less fun. I tend to disagree. If you treat every game as a challenge to overcome with the least resistance possible, I could see how you might be disappointed. However I strongly believe that in games like Crysis 2, you are fully responsible for your own experience and enjoyment of the game. I play games to have fun, not to find the most optimum way to beat it. I wouldn&#8217;t find sneaking past everything fun, so I simply didn&#8217;t do that and I had a great time. I got into some of the most intense gunfights I have ever experienced in a game, often times barely escaping death. However, if you are one of those people who play games simply to win, and do so by whatever means you can (such as exploiting the AI), I will warn you now that your fun might vary.The story in the game is probably the weakest part of the package. It seems that a considerable amount of time has passed between the events of Crysis 1, and the game does a poor job of filling you in on what has happened.  You start out as part of a squad of marines sent in to rescue a scientist named Gould who has important research about the aliens. In the opening moments of the game your squad is wiped out, but not before Prophet,  one of the nano-suit soldiers from the first game, saves you. You are given his armor, and it is up to you alone to carry out your mission. Your interaction with other characters in the game is pretty limited. You get a few moments of face time with Gould during the campaign, but it seems most of the characters in the story simply exist to yell orders at you over the radio or provide you with someone to take out. The story is big on technical details about your suit doing something with the alien tissue samples you are collecting, but it is not always clear what exactly is going on are why you are doing some of the things you are tasked with. However in the most basic sense the story does get the job done. It provides you with enough motivation, and provides a number of pretty epic set piece battles.Crytrek has gone with the Call of Duty approach to the multiplayer aspect of the game, so if you have played any of those games you know what you are getting into. You have a persistent character profile that ranks up as you play, allowing you to spend XP to unlock new abilities and weapons. Just like in the single player campaign, you can customize your weapons with attachments, providing players with a lot of options when creating their own classes. Other features taken out of the Call of Duty playbook include challenges you can complete to unlock bonuses and map specific killstreak rewards. Some of these rewards, like the orbital laser strike, can be very devastating. Finding a game to get into is easy thanks to a quick match option, where you specify the game mode you want to play and you will automatically be placed into a game. I found search times to be extremely quick, and most games to be lag free thanks to dedicated servers on the PC. The suit abilities and their energy draining mechanics add a neat aspect to the multiplayer gameplay. For example, sprinting around uses your suit energy, resulting in less energy to absorb damage should you run into an enemy player. Knowing when and how your abilities and how to manage your energy is required to do well. The stealth ability provides a lot of opportunities to play sneaky and outmaneuver your enemies, and becomes a very valuable tool in objective based game modes.Overall Crysis 2 is a compelling game. The single player campaign offers a lot of intense gunfights and breathtaking visuals, while the online multiplayer offers solid, if not uninspired, social fragging. Only time will tell how much staying power the online aspect of the game has, but as of right now the game has a sizable online community. With a standard length campaign, enjoyable multiplayer, and the best graphics of any game to date, Crysis 2 is worth picking up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"Honor and glory. . .","reviewText":"\"Time is an ocean in a storm.\"In 2003, Ubisoft, developers of the Rayman series and the recent smash hit Splinter Cell franchise, reinvented what had been one of the seminal platformers of the late 80's and early 90's. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a reinvention of the classic series, full of hallmarks of the series; combat, beautiful animation, cunning traps, and daring acrobatics, but with a new set of characters, new story, and brilliant new gameplay mechanics that changed the way platforming could be approached in games.With the help of Jordan Mechner, the original creator of the Prince of Persia series, Ubisoft spins a tale of a young prince and his first conquest. Eager for honor glory, he accompanies his father to India, where, seeking treasure, they use a traitorous Vizier to infiltrate and decimate a Maharajah's palace. During the raid, the entire palace is ransacked, and the prince and his father sieze the Sands of Time, contained in a bejeweled hourglass, and the Dagger of Time, a weapon of unknown power.However, the treacherous Vizier, seeking immortality, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to open the hourglass, setting the Sands of Time loose as a plague upon the palace of Hazad, a once-welcoming place now turned into a death trap full of twisted Sand Creatures, spike pits, whirling blades, and bottomless chasms. With only the Dagger (giving him control over time) and Farah, the daughter of the conquered Maharajah, the Prince must make his way through the sultan's palace and undo what he has done.The meat and potatoes of Sands of Time is its brilliantly cinematic and acrobatic platforming and puzzle solving, featuring the use of ropes, poles, beams, narrow ledges, and walls that the prince must run along to avoid danger and traverse his environment. Both the level design and the ease of control (even for pulling off the most incredible looking stunts) is leages ahead of other platforming games, and the addition of the sand powers (allowing you to rewind time, slow time, and speed it up) adds a whole new layer to the puzzles. This is enhanced by the game's visuals, which set a bechmark for animation and artistic design, drawing gorgeous vistas and gruesome enemies while never stuttering.The sand powers are also crucial during the combat portions of the game. During the game, more and stronger enemies will stand between the Prince and redemtion, and he must use the dagger to destroy these monsters, which, in turn, grants him superhuman powers; he can freeze his enemies and slice them to ribbons, slow them to a crawl as he dances around them, and stop time completely to cut a swath through them with ease and grace. The game gives the player a larger number of options in dispatching enemies, though you'll find yourself sticking with a couple strategies for most of the game.During combat, as well as during the exploration of the sultan's palace, there is a steady stream of banter from the characters. Whether it's simply the prince talking to himself (or to the player, as he tells his story) or the snarky comments he and Farah fire back at each other, it gives the game a great sense of personality. Both of these characters end up having to work together for survival, with Farah slipping through cracks to open doors the prince can't reach, or fire at enemies from a distance as he battles them with sword, and it's great fun to watch their attitudes toward each other gradually change.The story that unfolds for the player, which uses both of these characters to great effect, is also a treat; it goes a step further than most video game stories, with some great twists along the way, and just the right sense of closure while still leaving room for more. And with the brilliant music and fantastic voice work, it geniunely draws the player into this world of ancient Persia, and makes sure they'll want to hear the story again and again.With gorgeous visuals, a capturing tale, and plenty of charm, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, is a brilliant action platformer that allows players to do things previously impossible in games, and draws them into a digital world like few other titles can. So come and hear a tale like none you have heard before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2005"}

It's a great formula for a game and while many have tried and failed, few have gotten it right. Even the industry standard setter, Mario hasn't taken any leaps or tried anything drastically new over the four generational incarnations of the title. It never ceases to amaze me how well they get rated when clearly a game like ModNation does way more for Kart racing than Mario Kart on the Wii could possibly dream of doing.First, let me say this is not your little brother's Kart racing game. This game is sometimes easy and sometimes almost unfair in how difficult it is-over all it's difficulty is just-right: challenging, forcing you to race your best. It really makes you work to win and sometimes the AI is just nasty difficult. There will be moments when you want to throw your controller through your TV. But that's ok, that means the game is challenging, anything easier and you would be bored, anything harder and you would give up. But ModNation Racer is an addictive game and is almost certainly going to keep you coming back for more.I should stop for a moment to say that yes, the load times are long. But not overly-so, yes we've come to expect more. But the game plays like a dream. It's colorful and simply amazing to look at. The driving controls are tight, kart-like and simple. Once you're racing you immediately forget about the 45 seconds you spent waiting for the race to load. Once you're zooming down the track drifting, spinning, getting power ups, getting closer to the edge of your couch, everything else slips your mind.The Career mode is deep and engaging. Each race has three different objectives. The first is often simple as completing the race finishing third or better which allows you to progress to the next race. But the other objectives include finishing first and getting 10,000 drift points. Completing the more complicated objectives allows you to unlock more things for the more creative side which has been endlessly compared to Little Big Planet.I'm going to admit when I first saw this game, I thought it was just another Kart knock off game. They had it playing on a demo PS3 hooked up to a 60\" TV at Best Buy and I still hadn't decided whether or not to get a PS3 or an xbox 360. This is one of a few games that caused me to lean towards getting a PS3. I wasted hours in that Best Buy playing this game and experimenting with the creative options, which are what really got me hooked on this game.Let's face it, making cool characters is nice (and with 10x more options than creating your Mii on your Wii, the sky is almost the limit to your creativity), making Karts is fun, it's the Track builder that really shines. Ever imagined what it would be like to play Mario Kart with your friends on a track that you had built? No more imagination needed, the reality is here, my friends, and it's called ModNation Racers. The Track editor/creator is AMAZING. It is intuitive and yet has a depth to it that is incredible. I can get lost for hours trying to make a good race track and I've only scratched the surface, I am by no means good at making race courses in this game.The last thing I want to tell you about this game, and it's the power up system. Let's face it, Mario Kart allows for some pretty limited skills when it comes to playing, giving the person in last place amazing power-ups while the person in first place putts around the track holding a green shell behind them or a banana, hoping to use it shield themselves from the impending doom of a blue shell or whatever thing-a-ma-jig the racers who are eating their dust are getting with their power-ups. The power-up system here gives you various kinds of really cool power ups, but the more time you hit the power-up things, the more your power up becomes more powerful. It's worth it to get to level three, almost always. Protecting yourself from this mayhem rest in your drifting, airtime which fills your boost meter which can either be spent on boost power or shields adding a whole new level of amazing, challenging greatness onto this kart racer. Like I said before, this is not your little brother's Kart racer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

The President has been assasinated, You are found on the beach by a life gaurd with a bullet wound and the number XIII tattooed on you. You have lost your memory. Powered by the Unreal 2 engine the graphics and sound are fantastic. It has comic book style graphics complete with &quot;BAM&quot;, &quot;AAAGH&quot; ect.

The level design is excellent and i liked the selection of weapons, you can use objects like bottles, chairs, mops ect to knock out people. The biggest problem is the horrible save game system. It does allow you to quicksave anywhere but when it loads it will be at the start of the level or at checkpoints. This may not be a big problem if the developers knew where to have points but they do not. There should have been checkpoints after boss levels but there is not always one. They are a big problem in stealth levels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2003"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Timothy Branik \"PKTACES\"","summary":"NOT BAD, DIDN'T SUCK","reviewText":"Ok, this is a steam game as you're well aware by now, what does that mean - you can't buy used or it won't work - The game is OK takes place almost entirely in an office bldg like the previous ones - there are some scary parts where you have to melee your way away from alma - other zombie/ghost thingies - some cool flashbacks - the ending is kinda weak.  Overall the game felt kinda short (7 intervals - 14 \"missions\") Nothing really new here, so was kinda boring. Therefore the best I can give it is a 3 star.

{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy","summary":"Halo Fusion...","reviewText":"Would have made a great deal of sense for the title of this game. Upon release, the multiplayer was just plain unsatisfactory, although the changes they've made as of now really have turned that aspect around. They tried a little too hard to be flashy and really had a lot of gimmicks. The forerunners are just dumb to fight. They have strong weapons, and teleport, but otherwise they just stand still and shoot. Whatever the deal is with their shield system is just annoying and they need to have heads where heads should go, on top of the shoulders, not somewhere near the top of a big hump. The elites roll was basically pointless. The didact was not at all imposing, and the final 'battle?' was just plain disappointing. I didn't get why they would've ended it that way.So they lose a star for not having a clue with multiplayer when they released it with too few playlists, poorly balanced weapons, lowering the skill gap enormously, etc... And another for what they did with the campaign. I do consider the way spartans play to be an improvement, but the forerunners are lame, and the elites were feeble in comparison with previous titles. You can make an awesome main character all you want, if the opposition is lame, the game is going to suffer.

This is dedicated for those who play \"The Road To The Show exclusively. I will add online play at a later date. This is a great game that still has room for more added features and improvements. Here is a list of bugs I've encountered while playing as well as some improvements that would be nice to add. I've also included what is good. All and all, I love the game and the series. Unfortunately, the bugs in this one are sooooo easy to spot.Bugs/Improvements needed*When you see players/umpires talk, their lips don't move (not realistic)*The home plate umpire only has 2 animations for \"strike\" call (would like to see some \"replay value.\" Look at all the different \"types\" of umpires in the real MLB. For example, the ones who scream strike one, the ones who lightly call it, the one who takes a while to call it, and the very animated ones)*The umpires clap during the game (seems biased lol)*The field practice sometimes deducts points when you've actually reacted how you should (it's one of those minor issues where you just scratch your head in amazement)*The fielding has gotten better but still can become a major headache (the ball slowly goes by the second baseman and the player just stands there) The out fielder goes back back back and stops; the ball flies right by them and no error called (another \"what was that all about\")*The amount of balls hit on the line drives me insane, how about you?*See above, and in most real MLB games, 90% are actually doubles yet in RTTS, it's a single, even for a speedy batter.*The AI can be brutal and drive you insane to the point of destroying your controller out of disgust (I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm on my 4th controller and it's got some \"battle wounds\" lol*Sometimes when your RTTS player is dominating, the AI kicks it up a notch to \"make you know your place\" lol It can get very brutal...a little lightening up would be nice*The animations are very noticeable. Show (slow) motion, which is a nice addition shows the catcher catching a ball, with his glove closed!!!!*See above: A strike in Show motion, revealed that the strike called, was a ball that pretty much was called where your ankle meets your foot, WOW that was a low strike!* On 2 occasions, while loading to the actual game, it stayed in perpetual loading making it feel like it crashed. Luckily I just completed a practice session, so it saved at that point; loosing nothing.* Simulating the offseason is sooooooooooo sllloooooooooooow! I get scared when the season ends lol!*Loading is slower than last years* Wish list: more negotiating contracts, talking to manager/gm for that added realism*it was weird to see in the minor league stadiums how easy the ball flies behind home plate and into the spectators. In real life, someone definitely would of gotten hurt*The minor league stadium facing the Manhattan skyline shows no headlights on during the night on the suspension bridge. Yikes, it's amazing you don't see an accident when playing!*Why can't the cheering/booing be more pronounced and lifelike. Especially if your stats are amazing and you are not the home team. Or if your clutch is high, your team is loosing, yet the bases are loaded, with 1 out; you're at the plate. If we can create it, why can't some be already included.*The broadcasters are sometimes out of touch with what is going on and are so repetitive.*How about that if you had a bad injury or were out a long time, be sent to the minors for rehab games. There are times you want to shut them up.*Walking (BB's) is a little off this year. My scouting report shows (D for control) that he needs to throw more strikes, yet the way I'm pitching, I'm throwing 80%-90% strikes with 1-2 walks. I had a pitcher who threw for 150 innings but only walked 3 batters total even though his rating for control was \"D\"* This one kills me! A ball is hit into the outfield and the CPU fielder lines up but misplays the ball (by misplay, I mean he stands there, and if it were real, he would of gotten hit on the head). It rolls to the warning track while the fielder just stands there. Inside the park homerun!* You can get hit by the ball on the knee, shoulder, or leg by a comebacker (if you're a pitcher) but the manager doesn't even check to see how you are. You don't get to throw some pitches to make sure nothing is hurting. It seems also that the hardest of comebackers seem to bounce off you. Not very realistic.* Baserunning bug in RTTS- I hit a double, \"the outfielder didn't even reach it yet, but the man on 2nd ran to 3rd and stopped while the man on 1st stopped at third. Yes, they both were on 3rd base, and one was out. I was credited with a single, no RBI. Could of meant a good amount of points if it was the playoffs or if you were about to get a career milestone.*RTTS \"hair\" is not realistic.*No weather (would be realistic to see rain, and if it pours or thunderstorms, there is a delay or the game is called. Doubleheader???Good points:*Added field/pitching practice is a very nice touch*The fielding got a little better (but see above in quirks)*The AI didn't get tougher (in '09, it was tough) but lets you know it can \"take it up a notch\" For those who like a challenge, it's not overbearing*Takes a longer to develop your RTTS player which is more realistic.*The controls stayed the same, which is good: don't fix what was not broken!*The faces look so real*It's funny to see the spectators try to get the ball hit out of play*The added practice toss/hitting is a nice touch*A lot was left untouched, which is great because '09 was a great game*If you walk a batter, the 90% chance of them scoring, is gone. Walking is more realistic yet the stat for its possibility is way off*Show motion is fantastic (one problem though, it exposes some quirks...see above)*Good amount of types of pitches for a pitcher* Love the spectator animations, especially when they reach for a ball or fall out of their seats when a line drive goes past them. You see them try to scoop up the ball. Some fall onto the field....gives you a nice little chuckle!Wish list:*Wish your drafted player played in the much lower minor leagues; perhaps the rookie leagues. Most of the times, it's too fast to be called up when in Double AA. If you're really good, you can advance quickly. My pitcher went through AA and AAA within one season and was called up at the end of 2010 in September (while he was 18 yrs old).*If you leave for free agency or get traded, the home team stadium remembers it and boos you.*Add whether or not you can be a clubhouse presence or are quiet. The \"talk to your manager about team chemistry seems to never work.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2010"}

As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

Orr","summary":"Red Dead Redemption","reviewText":"It would be easy to dimiss \"Red Dead Redemption\" as \"Grand Theft Auto\" with horses and ten gallon hats.  But Rockstar San Diego has in fact created a more heartfelt world than the rather parodic and cold world of Liberty and Vice cities.  In other words, RDR's world is as much focused on the wild-eyed temperance preacher standing outside the saloon as much as the crazed and whoopin' drinkers inside.  It's handling of characters -with some notable and unfortunate exceptions- is sympathetic.  Most of all, it gives the impression of a lived-in world that is both old and new, tired and vibrant, and with room for both the myth of the charismatic gunslinger and the lonely and crazy people that the brutal society of the West created.RDR improves on the template of GTA not only in terms of its superior and softer characterisation.  Although the story is the same old tale of a wronged charismatic central character taking on a bette noir from his past, mission structures tend to be a little more varied, with the slo-mo Dead Eye mechanic a cool nod towards the films of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone.  Side-quests can vary from collecting flowers, to going after wanted criminals, to hunting the various exquisitely detailed wildlife -varying from birds to coyotes and skunk- dotted about.  These side-quests give a sense of the richness of RDR's envirnoments.  The whole honour system adds a motivation to really behaving like a good guy, as well.  Furthermore, Rockstar's decision to set the game as late as 1911 means that we are always being given a concrete setting for the birth of our own world.Although I'm not a big fan of online multiplayer, there are enough game modes to keep anyone entertained for many hours; the online free roam mode is excellent for just messing about and shooting innocent characters without worrying about the consequences to stats, too.But the biggest improvement in my opinion over the rather needlessly detailed and cynical world of GTA is RDR's absolutely stunning score.  Sparse musical accompaniment often refers in fragments to Ennio Morricone's famed scores for Leone's films and the more sweeping arrangements for Anthony Mann and John Ford's famous Westerns.  It gees up effortlessly for fight and chase sequences, before ebbing away to occasional splashes of impressionistic and moody pizzazz.  Most of all, the music perfectly illustrates how RDR so often favours feel, shadow, landscape and melancholic observation over the pyrotechnics of violence, flamboyance and simplistic story development.  The music is so much about what represents RDR's lasting achievement.This does not mean RDR is perfect.  Although characterisation is generally very good, is there any need for a sneaky, alcoholic Irishman?  The cover system can be a little unwieldy in tight situations, but RDR is not the first game in history to have this problem, and it certainly won't be the last.  But the game works so beautifully, with so few snags, that you really have to nitpick to find serious faults.  Plus it must be emphasised that RDR looks phenomenally good, at least on the XBOX360 version I've played: amazing detail to the various character models and environments, with very little pop-up.  It gives a sense of scale, dynamism and -most of all- possibility to the game world.\"Red Dead Redemption\" is an exhilarating and smooth ride of a game.  It has the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen in a game.  It is a Peckinpah film made by Leone, a Howard Hawks western with the conscience and heart of Jimmy Stewart.  And I'll settle for that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000BWZY7Q","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"One of the biggest worlds just got bigger","reviewText":"Ever since I got my new laptop, I've now surrounded myself with PC games and their expansions and whether or not something's worth the purchase since I've gone years dealing entirely with the console market. Naturally one of the first I got was World of Warcraft, one of the world's top MMO's available and seeing as how level caps and new races get added for the expansions, getting Burning Crusade offers some content to warrant a purchase for those looking to get the most of the game. And unlike Wrath of the Lich King's, the content here can be accessed right from the get-go and seeing as how there's been a couple of improvements, Burning Crusade is worth a purchase for these reasons though the main game by itself has enough content for everyone too.Added to the World of Warcraft character choices are 2 new races: the draenei, who start off on Azuremyst Isle with the previously inaccessible ability to be a shaman while the other race, the blood elves, start on Sunstrider Isle near Silvermoon City with the ability to become a paladin. Both starting areas are quite beautiful in their art direction as the blood elves area can best be described as \"autumnal\" with lots of orange and forest areas giving a great Fall season feel whereas the draenei as a more sci-fi element with glowing crystals and bizarre places such as rivers that are entirely in red. Thanks to a higher polygon count, the characters models as well look a bit more attractive (especially the ladies) and some trade cities such as the Exodar are quite stunning visually.The other addition is adding jewelcrafting as a profession which allows you craft trinkets such as rings and jewellery that can be added to weaponry for bonuses. It's a cool addition though with many other professions it's really up to you which one you want to put your time on. Skinning has become a huge moneymaker for my travels while my Mage has been benefitting from Tailoring so even though there's jewelcrafting, it's another choice for your character though with enough time and cash into levelling up jewelcrafting, you can create some pretty nifty stuff. The level bump for the professions as well as been bumped up so let's you become way more proficient than was previously allowed.But arguably the biggest addition to the land itself outside of the 2 races starting areas is the continent of Outland with new zones for you to explore and level up in which is helpful considering the level cap has been moved to 70 instead of just the 60 level cap the original cap had. With some new PvP additions, it would seem that the Burning Crusade would be truly exceptional however a couple of minor things drag it down. Having played through both quest zones for draenei and blood elves, it's kind of hard not to see some parallels from a mission where you fly back and forth from a hippogryph but that's kind of the nature of the races anyway and you can't do anything from either the \"kill 10 of these/collect 8 of these/talk to him or her\" quests but I quite liked the storylines for both though.Strange thing actually is thanks to the massive patch download I had to do to play the original game, I guess Burning Crusade went with it since mine came on a DVD-ROM and it barely installed anything, I just upgraded my account to Burning Crusade on the launcher, inputted the product key and kaboom, I'm ready to play which was quite cool though it partially made me feel like I spent 40$ for the product key rather than the game content on the disc but oh well.While one can say Burning Crusade is more for the hardcore since you don't necessarily need this game unless you want the new races and level cap but for those wanting to invest more time in World of Warcraft, Burning Crusade makes an excellent addition...and considering how great the main game is anyway, you'll probably feel like buying it on principle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"Super fun campaign!","reviewText":"Since FC1 was famous/infamous for the hardware-busting graphics, I never played it. FC2 on PS3 didn't fair too well, so I passed. FC3 looked way too good to pass up, so I pre-ordered it.Here are a few thoughts.Positives+ Amazing visuals across varied terrain. Load time was suprisingly acceptable considering the large map.+ Open-world concept provides immense choices. You can choose to do a side quest or story mission at any time.+ \"Random\" events seem to unfold as you drive around the island, which brings realism and adds to the overall fun factor. At times enemies will keep going but other times they will chase you, so you never really know what to expect. I think this is a very nice touch.+ RPG-like skill upgrade system that allow you to customize your abilities using skill points (as you earn XP) really adds to the depth of this game. This system reminds me of Borderlands 2 in that new skills open up as you progress and \"learn\" new skills.+ While the plot was not strong, it was good enough to keep things interesting, keep you guessing about what's going to happen next.Negatives- Saving during a story mission is not allowed and there are no checkpoints. If you die in the middle you lose all progress, which sucks if you are in the long mission with multiple objectives.- Dying while exploring seems to puts you back in random locations; at times it put me at the closest fast-travel point or radio tower, and other times I respawn just outside the enemy camp/outpost that I was trying to attack. Either way you lose progress up to that point if you didn't save. I found that this  less-than-stellar design choice indirectly affects gameplay as it forces me to save frequently, taking away from the continuity and flow of the game.- Enemies tend to be the same; there are 4 or 5 different enemy types each with specific skills. No bosses.- When driving around exploring, enemies appear out of nowhere and attack you. While some of this is fine, after awhile it becomes tedious especially when you just want to get from point A to B as quickly as possible.Closing commentsThis game is very good but very difficult. At normal difficulty I was dying regularly, but fortunately you can adjust the difficulty setting at any time. I played on easy setting and it took me abaout 20 hours to complete the story missions and some side quests. If you enjoy open-world games with a lot to do and the freedom to choose what to do when, you will definitely like this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"M. DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"Massive Effect on Gaming","reviewText":"A little late in the review... but better late than never--or something like that.Mass Effect is a fantastic game.  It hits so many of the major themes of classic RPG, action, and traditional sci-fi storytelling.  If you've played other Bioware games, like Knights of the Old Republic, then you'll dive right into this game without any problems.  It combines elements of Star Wars, Star Trek, Starship Troopers, and many other classics--but it remains unique.  I'll touch on some of the key points below.+++ GAMEPLAY: Outstanding in all aspects.  The game is 3rd person and captures the scene and action nicely.  The camera angles and movement is spot on; I didn't have any moments where I felt disoriented or otherwise distracted by the camera.  The controls for switching weapons and managing your character(s) inventory is easy and fast.  The action is top-notch: aiming, shooting, moving, taking cover, and so forth are all done well and are easy to use in the game.  There might be a short learning curve, but it won't take long for you to pick it up.  The controls for navigating the galaxy are eye-popping--seriously!  You get this insane holographic map on the ship and you can navigate the 3D galaxy, picking systems and planets to explore.  I really wracked my brain on this one, but I can't find a single thing to complain about with the gameplay elements.+++ STORY: Now your mileage may vary on this one, but I found the story to be enthralling.  After creating a character, choosing your background and such, you can journey through the game in your own way.  Be a no-holds barred mercenary, a merciful white knight, or whatever type of person you want to be.  Your actions and attitude are reflected well in the game: the other characters react to you according to your deeds and behavior, your comrades hold in you different regards, and there are different options in dialogue and missions depending on your path.  The main story of the game is awesome.  I personally don't think it's cliche at all; it's an original, quite serious, yarn in the best spirit of space opera and hardcore science fiction.  It kept me glued to the screen and excited to know the outcome.  There are a few missions that are repetitive, but the main thrust of the story is fantastic.  There are plenty of things to do and planets to explore.  If you like to take your time and explore a game, you'll easy get 50+ hours out of this game.  Well worth every penny!+++ ENVIRONMENT: The graphics, sound, and music are all fantastic.  I know, it sounds crazy that so much is so good about this game... but it is!  I'm sure some gamers will find fault with something in the environment of the game, but it's a work of art.  For how much detail is shown on characters, ships, planets, equipment, etc this game performs well and rarely, if ever, experiences any glitches.  I only saw a graphical hitch once or twice in my 60ish hours playing.  The game never froze or stuttered for me.  The atmosphere is perfect.  The ships and planets and people all look authentic... they look \"lived in\" as the Star Wars universe did.+++ MISC: The game has a few DLC add-ons that extend the life of the game by adding missions and locations.  The DLC is good, not great, and the core of the game is much more exciting than the add-ons.  Unless you're a hardcore completionist, don't bother with the DLC and stick to the main game.  There's plenty to do and see in the galaxy.  There are a few missions and enemy encounters that can get a little repetitive, but it's not often enough to drag the game down.  I took off one star from the Fun Factor because of this repetition.  There's also some repetitive elements to interacting with your comrades and crew; you'll often have to talk to them between missions to get anything new out of them, or to advance relationships with them.  It's not really a problem, game-wise, but I can't really say it's fun.  Dialogue and cut-scenes, even if good, can be a yawner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

First of all I love Mass Effect. I love the universe, the characters, all the subplots and the overall presentation of the game. I was pretty blown away by the cutscenes at the time. They were so realistic and engaging. The citadel is still one of my favorite parts in any game ever. After your Shepard leaves the citadel things really go downhill. The planets aren't as interesting and the poor combat starts to reveal itself. The mako is a sin. It never worked right and wasn't fun and it's hard to imagine how they could've kept it in the game.The inventory is TERRIBLE. I never really cared about my weapons, didn't care about spending large amounts of credits on equipment from a guy on my own ship. That was horrible and I never invested in it. Also don't be fooled into thinking there's a lot of choices in the game, there's only a few really. So while the story, the characters and lore are AWESOME, the gameplay mechanics are pretty bad. Mass Effect 2 fixed a lot of these issues or just got rid of them, but the story and RPG elements took a hit. Still a very engrossing game if you're looking for a good story and characters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2014"}

The gameplay itself is fairly simple, consisting mostly of punching and using special attacks but the character development system is incredibly deep. You have the ability to level your characters moves and outfits, equip different items, level your own specific team, acquire special team bonuses, and of course level your characters stats. This keeps the game entertaining because as your skills and attack level they become more useful and look slightly different. Depending on your skill your characters can end up being really strong compared to the enemies or really weak by the end of the game. After you have completed the game on normal you can start a new game on the hard difficulty using your already leveled characters. With so many characters to use, even some additional ones available soon through download, you are bound to find a team that you like and build them up to be incredibly powerful.My personal favorite part of this game is the multiplayer cooperative play. You can play locally with you friends on one system or online. Playing online and offline is almost identical except that while online all players can upgrade/change their characters at the same time while you have to take turns while playing locally. Also if you start a local game with your friend and decide you want to continue playing online later you can do this by loading your save file on xbox live or vise-versa. Its that easy.Overall there really isn't anyone I can think of who wouldn't like this game. Unless you don't have any friends, don't want any friends,  and absolutely hate all things marvel. Otherwise I would say this game is worth playing. If one of your buddies is tired of you targeting him all the time in online play maybe you could get him to work through this game with you. He'll probably like you better afterward.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2007"}

This allows for cross world puzzle solving and some amazingly unique locales. The control setup is identical to its predecessor, and the HUD (Helmet display) is pretty much the same. No need to remaster new controls, just hop in and go.Graphically the engine was rewritten from scratch. It looks lightly different but not a large gulf of difference. It does push the Cube to its limits in many ways with ginormous bosses and no slowdown. The game features a lot more cut-scenes and lore to explore with log files from dead soldiers and computers found throughout the games large areas. Space pirates are low key in this one but still they are in here trying to kill you any chance they get.There is a lot more wild life and curved terrain thanks to the fantastic engine. The plot also moves a long a lot faster than the orginal which makes for a more pleasant trek. You get to battle a dark version of Samus throughout and also traverse giant mechanical fortresses. There is a lot of variety and the music is \"to die for\" good.All in all the MP2E is a solid First Person Adventure with shooting components, puzzles, ginormous bosses, a variety of lifeforms, lots of weapons/suit upgrades, tones of secrets to explore, fantastic music and real atmosphere.

While Blur utilizes a power-up system with similar elements such as forward and rear firing weapons, shields and speed boosts, this is a different game.Blur is a game that uses models of actual cars from Ford, Chevrolet, Audi and others in an environment that attempts to appear quasi-realistic. While the visuals may be based on real world environments, the gameplay is closer to an arcade-style racer with social elements included. While there are differences in controlling the various vehicles it is not a realistic driving simulator. Some vehicles may have better turning or acceleration but the differences aren't as great as the cars in Grand Theft Auto games.I find the gameplay mechanics to be adequate. There is nothing inherently wrong with them as far as arcade racers go but they aren't revolutionary. Even the vehicular combat feels like we have done this before but the game is well done. I do have to admit that when racers wreck they do so spectacularly.Blur's biggest draw is the social aspect. There is an online multiplayer mode with up to 20 players which makes for some frantic races. You can accept challenges from your friends or even make your own challenges and send them out. This is very cool but this is not hyped very much. For example, I might score an excellent time on a particular course and send a challenge to my friends and they will receive a message in their system messages inbox. You can also create and receive individual challenges and this adds a new element of fun that is not present in other racers.You can also post your accomplishments on FaceBook or Twitter from within the game. I find this feature to be a bit useless but those who enjoy bragging about their trophies or achievements may enjoy this.All in all, I find Blur to be an enjoyable racing game that most people won't know about because it lies under the shadow of Gran Turismo 5. If you can find Blur for $20 or less, it is a solid pick-up.Final note: I have the PS3 port of Blur and I actually had to change my network settings to connect to the game servers. None of my other games require me to do this. After some research I see that this is a common problem. It isn't that hard to get your game connected but if you are buying this for your children you might want to adjust your network before letting them play. I have no idea if this problem occurs on the 360 port of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2011"}

And perhaps you want to check the store, because said friend reminds you of some DLC or a game, you just enter the store with either a simple voice command (WHILE ON SKYPE STILL, AND PLAYING A GAME), or using your controller and download the DLC while playing your game, and on Skype, and installing the DLC or game. The XB1 can do it all, and with no issues. I love this system. Congrats Microsoft, on a revolutionary system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

Many new features have been added from previous games in the series. Its going to be a much larger game. You're not just stuck in some small cities, you've got a much bigger area to explore. The graphics look improved from what I've seen in screen shots, and I doubt they're will be any pop in, because for a next generation game, pop in would be pathetic this far into PS2's lifespan. You can steal new vehicles, including trackters, and my friend told me he saw a screen shot of a guy mowing a lawn. You have to eat in this game to keep up, but, like in real life, if you eat too many fatty foods like donuts and you dont exercise it off, then you're charecter, Carl, will become a fat guy. This game will be set in a ghetto type area in California. Early rumors said that the next Grand Theft Auto would be set in Las Vegas, but those were false... its set in California (that would have been cool, though). In the past four Grand Theft Auto titles, it was annoying how you couldent swim. You could rob a store, you can steal a car, but you couldent swim. Well, this time, like in the recently released (and dumbly titled) \"Driv3r\", you can now swim. Woo hoo! If Rockstar North (previously DMA (Doesent Mean Anything) Design Games) can add exciting missions and enough new gameplay to keep this fresh and fans happy, then it'll have yet another hit on its hands.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"James P.","summary":"Linear","reviewText":"This game took about 25 hours to finish.Guns, environment, and E99 powers are nicely done.

You get to shimmy up the back of cyclopses (which Chrome argues is not a word, but I prefer it to cyclopsi or cyclopseses {although the latter is more fun to say}) and stab them to death, shimmy up the back of griffons and stab them to death, and shimmy up the back of golems (okay, Chrome, why is GOLEMS not a word?  WTF?) and -- you guessed it! -- stab them to death.There's not much to say; quest-givers mostly ask you to kill or collect a finite number of things, to escort them to ridiculously dangerous locations halfway across the world (seriously, somebody named a place Bloodwater Beach and PEOPLE ASK TO GO THERE), and complete the odd story quest.But this all belies the actual charm of \"Dragon's Dogma,\" which is the fact that while ostensibly an online game, where you create a slave and share it with the rest of the world while hiring others' slaves to assist your quest to save the world...  You never deal with other people.That's right.  All the hiring of others' slaves is done without talking to those people.  You just find them (slaves, I mean, not the other people whom I just said you never interact with) wandering around or in MagicLand RiftTown, pay some ghost dollars, and get the slaves.  No muss, no fuss, no 13 year old jagaloon throwing racial slurs your way.And that's why I love \"Dragon's Dogma.\"  Because I don't have to risk talking with anyone.  I don't have people questioning my sexuality, making insinuations about my mother's promiscuity (or lack thereof), or explaining my ancestral heritage.  I don't have \"people\" screaming like howler monkeys in the background, bodily functions into microphones, or terrible music blaring.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Mario Takes U","reviewText":"There is no question about New Super Mario Brothers U, and the hype that Nintendo has made with the game, and the stamina of the new Nintendo Wii U. But, if there is one thing Nintendo has showed with Mario, simply is the magic has never grown old. That has shown to be the case with any Mario game, and this no doubt is exactly the strength. When New Super Mario Brothers came out for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii, it delivered with multiplayer action, and madness as you try and save Peach from the clutches of Bowser. But with the new game, comes a new challenge as well. But this time around, is it more for its money or less than a bite from a piranha plant.New Super Mario Brothers U is a great launch title for the Nintendo Wii U, as you can play Mario or one of his friends, Luigi or Toad, in a exciting challenge to save Princess Toadstool. The game takes you on eight different levels, against Bowser and his koopalings who fly around now in fierce airships, Wendy, Roy, Ludwig, Larry, Morton, Lemmy and Iggy. Along the way Mario also encounters returning foes like Spike from Super Mario Brothers 3 and Baby Yoshi's that now can become balloons, to help you collect star coins along the way that make great appearances. There is also new power ups here too like the flying squirrel suit that can help Mario glide from platform to platform without falling down and missing power-ups. There is also a few new challenges as well including boost mode, which can help you either speed up to collect coins, or lose a life at the end, trying to make it to the flag pole.There are two ways to control Mario, with the Wii U Pad, or simply with the Wii-Mote like a NES-style control, as was the case with New Super Mario Brothers Wii. Personally, I preferred the classic NES style because it was easier to play. The graphics in the game look amazing, and the gameplay is strong, as you can challenge yourself, even by tapping the Wii U pad to add blocks to help you gather coins, and block enemies from harming you. Yet, there are a few disadvantages to the game. The first one is that if you have mastered New Super Mario Brothers Wii, you might find this game a bit too easy to play. The second of all is with the Mii-verse where players can make comments on your gameplay. It might be alright, but it can be a bit frustrating and can hinder you from making it to the goal.All in all, New Super Mario Brothers U is still a great game, and a good launch pad for the Wii U. I was honestly hoping for more to drive this game into a home run, but I basically got what I was playing all the time, fun. The game definitely is a good sequel to what made New Super Mario Brothers Wii so captivating in the first place. Yet, I was craving for much more in on the fun. Nevertheless, this is still a great game for the Wii U, and for die hard Mario fans young and old that have never gotten tired of the fun of saving the Mushroom Kingdom. If there is going to be a sequel for the game, there could be more in on the fun.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo play; A- for multiplayerOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}

However after a few hours of gameplay I realized this is not the Next-Gen game we expected and while it is a huge game and at times can be fun, I find it tedious and repetitive. It is very much like the gameplay style of a Grand Theft Auto game, which is good, however we've all been there done that many times in the past.Last week I purchased Wolfenstein: The New Order and I have not been able to put it down. I am almost done with it and once I'm done I will play it again. It is fast paced, has action, violence and simply is a lot of FUN to play. Watch Dogs, while involving and vastly surpasses the complexity of Wolfenstein or other FPS, it simply is not fun. A game, should be fun, that's why we play it.Watch Dogs is a close copy of a GTA game. It has the same basic idea and playability, however it has a touch of modern technology and hacking abilities. Don't get me wrong, Watch Dogs is a good game, however I feel like I've played it before in some capacity before. Watch Dogs graphics are good for an open world game, however if it was exclusively on the PS4 it would look like Infamous or even better! They were going more for style and atmosphere, which they pulled off fairly well.+ Decent Graphics, good lighting effects and coloring.+ Complicated and thought provoking gameplay.+ Huge City! Good atmosphere and environment. A lot of time and effort went into the surroundings.+ Hacking is a technique which can become entertaining once you get a handle on it. A lot to see and do, and depending on how you play, this game can be very time consuming.- Control isn't the best, reminds me of Alan Wake, which was a great game bogged down by horrible controls. Very sluggish and slow-responsive.- Not as fun as a game should be, almost seems more like work to play instead of a release of stress from the real world.- Driving is boring, hard to control and frustrating at times when you must keep up with someone you're chasing.Over-all it is worth a purchase and a play through, however when I am completely through the game I may sell it or push it to the side for a year or so. When I get off work and want to relax and play a game, I'll be grabbing something like Infamous or Wolfenstein before I reach for Watch Dogs. It is a grand game, however it did not meet my expectations of over-all gameplay and fun. If you are a fan of the GTA games you will love this as it is very similar, however you must be patient and take your time with your playing style, as just shooting people may not be your best option.Recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"nafysmiley","summary":"Ah, the memories","reviewText":"When I first played Xenogears, I thought it was absolutely awesome.  Its been awhile, and after thinking about it this game is pretty messed up.  It has some good qualities, but isn't as incredible as I thought it was.First to mind is the characters.  They are really cool, and somewhat unique, like Billy the gun-toting priest, or Rico the arena battling green thing.  What could be better?  I did have some problems with the main character Fei though.  I have never been able to forgive games for having characters which refuse to fight \"because fighting is bad, and it kills people\".  Especially when their own and other's lives are on the line.  I can't stand that.  Anyway, Fei gets over it, and I got over it, but that is cliched, and quite frankly, lame.Xenogears has an excellent turn-based combat system.  It uses varying levels of attacks (you can do 4 or 5 light attacks, or 1 or 2 heavy ones), combines those with combo moves, and the ability to build up combo chains, to create a fun, challenging battle system.  There are magic attacks, of course, but they are almost always worthless (useless magic is another feature which annoys me).  The addition of Gear (giant robot) battles adds a lot more to the game.  Gear combat is essentially the same as normal combat, but they are tougher, have different moves, and tend to fight cooler bosses.  I don't think there were too many gear battles, but the second disk definitely could have used more unarmed combat (like I said, the characters are cool).The soundtrack is good, better than a lot of video game music, but I don't really remember anything spectacular about it.  The graphics are just okay, but Xenogears is old, and it is an RPG.  All in all, I didn't mind them.  They weren't good or bad enough to ever pay attention to.  The Xenogears jewel case claims that there are 10 minutes of Anime cut scenes.  There are about 30 seconds through most of the game, and 9 minutes at the end.  Although, Anime cut scenes fail to thrill me, in nearly every situation.Now, on to the story.  The plot line of Xenogears is potentially excellent, involving a nice mix of commentary on religion and ethics, and it was gratifying to have a change from \"Hero goes on a quest, saves the day, repeat\".  However, the story was flawed.  It was difficult to comprehend, and almost ruined, if not by its complexity, then by its poor translation.  The words the people say don't make any sense (especially towards the end).  In addition, most of the philosophical/religion/science/whatever stuff turns out to be sort of pointless (in a sort of \"lets have a cross somewhere, and maybe something about the purpose of life or something\" sort of way).  It is also full of the classic cut scenes that won't make sense until 25 hours later (or ever).  They add some ambiance, but several of them never do come back up again.  There were issues that left me scratching my head that were never resolved.  The ending itself was difficult and awesome.  It is worth it (at least, as worth it as any 60 hour game's ending will ever be).All in all, Xenogears is probably one of the best Playstation RPG's out there.  It might be somewhat overwhelming to younger players or those new to the RPG genre (although, it was only the third non-Genesis RPG I ever beat, and I was 14 at the time).  Xenogears is a classic that should be played by every RPG fan.  I highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Chris A.

Mario has starred in big games like Mario 64, Sunshine, Mario World, Mario 3 etc. Luigi however doesn't really have great games. He was in Mario is Missing and Luigi's Mansion and he only has co-starring roles like in Mario Party or Mario Kart. So finally they pair up and even then they reference the rivalry in the first game in awhile they star together in.Story: Princess Cackaletta is bringing a gift to Princess Toadstool only she steals Princess' voice and replaces it with explosive vocabulary. Her words are literally bombs that explode. So off Mario and Luigi, a reluctant Bowser and some other cameos are along for the ride(sort of) has the Mario Bros try to rescue the Princess' voice.Graphics: Some find it ugly, others say it fits perfectly in this context. I say it's both. It's not incredibly animated like Golden Sun and even one could say Mario RPG from the SNES looks better than this but it fits the atmosphere of the game.Sound/Music: The ever popular Mario theme returns, as usual remixed too. There is little to no voice acting besides Mario's \"let's go!\" or Luigi's \"alright!\" and some other things. Mario games tend to have very little voice acting anyway.Gameplay: You ONLY control the Mario Bros. This game is the spiritual successors to Mario RPG and Paper Mario, games where you controlled not just the Brothers, but here it's strictly a family affair. And so of course gameplay and battle screens A controls Mario and B controls Luigi always. It's kind of confusing at first, especially since RPG's were always one button for action commands but you'll get the hang of it.The Brothers can team up on both play areas. Let's say that that platform is too high for them to jump. Put Mario in front and activate Luigi's power with the L and they can do a high jump. Likewise, substituting Luigi for Mario, they can do a Spin Jump which allows them to travel platforms too spaced out. Other abilities come your way like shrinking Mario or pounding Luigi into the dirt.The game has a light-hearted feel with the dialogue and while not as sharply written as Paper Mario: TTYD, it's still enjoyable to read, especially to the nods to past Mario/Luigi adventures.The game can be slightly challenging to the young-uns but then again even some stages in Super Mario World will drive anyone nuts but at least it's forgiving here and it's a good game too so it won't hurt to pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2005"}

Each is good at specific tasks. Here is a fully unbiased review of how the PS3 performs as a next generation console unit.To start with, the PS3, like the XBox 360, supports full high definition. The Wii only supports a lower resolution. Since the Wii has a much lower price tag, that is a fair trade-off for people with a tighter budget. Gamers for whom a very high level of graphic detail is important will have to pony up for that ability.Along the same lines, the XBox 360 supports the HD format of high definition DVDs for movies, while the PS3 supports the Blu-ray format. If you haven't been following the whole format war for high definition DVDs, I have several articles on the topic on my gaming site. In short it's like the VHS/Beta wars when the VCR first came out. Is one better than the other? Will one format win out as the sole survivor? There's no way to tell. People will argue vehemently that one is better than the other. From a gaming point of view, the PS3 has the Blu-ray BUILT IN meaning every game can have 50 GIGS worth of game information. Think MASSIVELY huge maps, types of characters, etc. The XBox 360 only uses \"regular\" DVDs as its base game holder, which is about 7 GIG. That is much smaller. You can buy an add-on HD DVD unit for about $100 (shop around - they're there at that price) but the storage is still smaller than Blu-ray - about 30 gig.People will argue about graphics until they're blue :) A lot of this comes down to how a specific game company *uses* the ability of the system. Looking at graphics on a tetris-like game will be much different than viewing the graphics of Oblivion or Gears of War. I found 360 graphics amazing on Oblivion. I equally found the PS3 graphics quite impressive on Genji's cut scenes (no enemy crabs in sight). Since both are high definition, I think that both have the same potential in real life terms. Both really shine in terms of fluid motion, precise detail and realism. I've seen it on both systems, on certain games. I've also seen junky graphics on both systems. Both are much better than the Wii.How about sound? All of these can plug into your stereo system. My boyfriend and I are both musicians. We have decibel meters and other sound-sensing tools. All three systems can create amazingly complex sounds, music, and in general a \"gaming environment\". Again I think it comes down to specific game makers, how they choose to use or not use that ability. It also comes down to how much you the gamer spent on your stereo system :)Speaking of sound, I do have to comment that our 360 is quite loud when it runs, despite our many attempts to help it be quieter. The PS3 right out of the box is MUCH quieter. Score 1 point for the PS3.On the general operating system for the units, all three consoles are going for more of a \"general use entertainment system\" presentation. The XBox has customizeable tabs that let you download new games, manage your environment and so on. The Wii also has channels that let you organize your gaming world. The PS3 has an interface almost exactly like that of the PSP, complete with cool drifting smoke waves in the background. You choose which area you want to work on - game, music, internet connection etc., and drop down to alter whatever feature you're interested in.So on to the on-line aspect, which most gamers are now fully interested in. Where the XBox 360 makes you buy an external connector for wireless, the PS3 has that built-in on the 60 gig model. The 20 gig model still requires an external connector (these run about $100). All will let you plug in a cable if you're still running a wired household.[UPDATED JUNE 2007] Back during launch, people thought 20 gig was great and that 60 gig was overkill for a gaming system. After all, the XBox 360 had 20 gig as their top end. Now, only a few months later, Sony has discontinued their 20 gig as \"too small\". XBox has the Elite model with 120 gig. The difference is as that gamers are converting their focus from audio storage to video storage, and high def video at that. People are downloading and enjoying movies and TV shows on their consoles. It's something to consider, if you will be doing that with your console.How does the online world work on the PS3? The XBox definitely has the advantage here. Until this generation, *only* the XBox had a thriving community in their live world. The XBox 360 connected right into that XBox Live world, and they boast a *huge* community of gamers who actively gain points, play online and form virtual worlds. The PS3 and Wii both have to play catch-up at this point. Even if they have better interfaces, it's a matter of converting over all those players who have clans, familiarity and high point collections on the XBox world. Imagine if a new MMORPG came out right now that had fantastic graphics. Sure it might be wonderful - but will you really get all 800 trillion WOW players to drop their world and characters and friends to convert, especially if it costs more? It'll be a hard, slow sell.My summary? I definitely think all three have great games and that all three are worth owning. Of course I'm in a position that I *can* afford all three, which many people are not in. For example, I *love* the Zelda series, and I *love* the Final Fantasy series. I would be hard put to tell a person \"you need to get Zelda instead of Final Fantasy\". I would want the person to have both, because both are great for different reasons. If you really truly can only save up for one of the three consoles, it isn't going to come down to which console is \"best\" for all players in some sort of a global way. It is going to come down to which console is best for YOU based on your specific gaming style.If you're on a really tight budget and just want something better than the previous generation, go for a Wii. It's cheap, the graphics are better, and the remotes are great fun. It has Zelda :) If you have a larger budget and really want the high definition, you're now choosing between the 360 and the PS3. You really do have to look at the specifics of each, and think seriously about your gaming style, to see which matches you best. If I were to make a flip summarization, if you really love online gameplay, I'd go with the XBox 360. Its years of head-start really give it a robust environment here. If you are looking for more of a home-based one-machine media center for your MPs3, photos and huge world gameplay, I'd go with the PS3. It definitely has the advantage on large scale games.Feel free to email me if you have more specific questions, or for screenshots, graphic descriptions, or interface information on any of the three systems.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Andariel Halo \"Disillusioned Smark\"","summary":"A rental at best","reviewText":"Being as I'm something of a cynical jerk, and usually anything with the attached phrases of \"badass\" or \"kickass\" set off my \"ANGER\" button, I had absolutely low expectations for this game, whereas I also hoped it could convert me; similar to how Jedi Knights II and III had much of the attached phrases of \"badass\" and \"kickass\" attached to them, yet I found them enjoyable by themselves without the uninteresting stories.Because I'm a cynical jerk, I have to get out of the way the unimportant complaints first: the game trailers did absolutely nothing to convince me to want to try this game: commercial one featuring \"Generic Loner Badass #7001\" as I call him, doing some kind of KAMEHAMEHAMEHA~! on a Wookiee that destroys half the map.  I figured this was kind of ridiculously overpowered, but I'll get to that later.On another unfair point, Generic Loner Badass #7001 lives up to his name in both appearance and power.  He is about as unremarkable and boring a character as Kyle Katarn without the frilly beard or the \"I'm just an honest ex-assassin bartender\" jerk from Assassin's Creed.  His outfit is a random mishmashing of robes and other \"dark things\" you'd likely find at a robe-version of Hot Topic, to likely appeal as much as possible to the \"dude, this game is so badass\" crowd of gamers who set off my ANGER button.But back to the game itself... graphically, it's as expected.The pros first: the environment is highly interactive, and one of my favorite things to do in space levels is to use the Force to throw objects at the plasteel windows, sending atmosphere and objects out into space before blastdoors close shut on them.Despite being completely against the Star Wars canon of the Force being a mystical force whose ominence was in its invisibility, it is fun to do things like use it to grab objects and move them around with amazing control and amazing reaction---enemy troopers will leap out of the way of flying crates, but if caught will be swept off their feet or smacked aside.  It's amazing to see the Force used to pull TIE fighters off their racks, or bed metal girders to block the path of fly-by starfighters and cause them to crash.My primary aesthetic complaint is the Force itself.  The use of the Force in the movies and TV shows and most of the games is most memorable for having no appearance, and mostly no sound save for that ear-drum crushing hum it makes, such as when Darth Vader chokes Admiral Motti on the Death Star for a few seconds.  THAT makes it terrifying.  Here, it is given LOUD sounds when used, Force Push in particular sounding like a huge laser cannon, and given purple waves to accompany it, so you can always see where it is, and what it's doing.Then the action itself: If you've played the video games for Star Wars: Clone Wars (2002) or Star Wars Revenge of the Sith (2005) then you'll pretty much get this game right away.  It's the exact same format, rather God of War style, in which the only controls needed for your lightsaber are to hit the attack button as many times as you can, and Generic Loner Badass #7001 will swing it all which ways nonstop in a combo that can get you killed if you don't stop long enough to deflect blaster bolts.This is compared to a game like Jedi Outcast/Academy where specific lightsaber attacks differed depending on a combination of buttons used, and gave it a far more interactive feeling.  Here, it just feels like giving a command: \"Use your lightsaber to kill this guy\" and Generic Loner Badass #7001 will fight his own way, without your input.For all its beautiful spit and polish in lightsaber combat, they really badly cut back on blaster deflection; you absolutely cannot deflect blaster bolts unless you STOP and press one of the buttons (I think it was B) and hold it.  Then, Generic Loner Badass #7001 proceeds to do the exact same lightsaber swinging loop to deflect bolts, nonstop, until you let go.  This same loop is re-used, and never changes.The lightsaber itself that he starts with seems to be pretty weak, as most enemies I've found are taken out with usually one powerful swing, but a fairly large amount take more than that to be killed.  And considering the stilted, monotonous actions the lightsaber combat takes, it's impossible to easily attack and kill multiple opponents firing on you; you're better off just using your Force powers.And then come the Force powers.  If LucasArts is trying to sell this Generic Loner Badass as \"THE OMFG BESTEST MOST UBER JEDI SITH IN THE EVAR~!\" then they succeeded TOO well... he is grossly overpowered, to a point where he is more powerful than Yoda, Darth Sidious, Darth Vader, and Mace Windu combined.  It's utterly ridiculous to see him slice an AT-ST in half with one swoop, or press and hold the Force push button for half a second to unleash a KAMEHAMEHAAA~!!!111 type blast which kills the crap out of EVERYTHING in its path guaranteed, and takes up very little Force energy to use.So the game has little lasting appeal beyond a one-day rental that will see longtime LucasArts gamers feel a blinding gush of deja-vu from the days of Clone Wars and Episode III video game, and ultimately disappointed at how heavily hyped this rental game was, only to end up being Just Another LucasArts Release that will likely be forgotten within a year or more.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004CD9X2C","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Ayers","summary":"Does Alice transition well to next-gen consoles?","reviewText":"It's been eleven years since Alice Liddell began her descent into her deranged Wonderland, in American McGee's Alice, which had earned quite a cult following.  Now, haunted by the death of her family in a tragic fire, that only she escaped, Alice travels to Wonderland once again in Alice: Madness Returns (EA, Spicy Horse Games).  After her release from Rutledge Asylum, Alice still maintains quite a bit of guilt and confusion about the calamitous incident that has turned her life upside down.  Regular sessions with her psychiatrist using hypnosis, seem to be having adverse effects on her thoughts and dreams.  As in the past, Alice retreats to Wonderland to escape, but finds it has drastically changed since her last visit.  Will she be able to unearth the secrets and clues that have led to her \"Madness?\"  Do the vibrant atmospheres exceed the gameplay?While technically labeled an action-adventure title, Alice: Madness Returns is basically a 3-D platformer with slight bits of combat thrown in.  Alice has a host of people concerned about her, but who are her friends and who are out to harm her?  Additionally, the familiar cast of characters return, but in limited roles.  It's Alice's Wonderland, it's demise is her doing and she must be the one to repair it.  The story will not be rehashed here, to remain free of spoilers, but it was intriguing and kept me going when some aspects of the game became monotonous.  I kept playing little by little to unravel more and see what was around the next bend.  Before we get to the important stuff, I liked this game, I possibly really like it.  Initially, I was enthralled when I first set foot in Wonderland and that feeling remained with me, almost, to the final screen.  The problem was that the game's repetition in level design, not ambiance, kept it from being Alice's Excellent Adventure.GameplayWhat would Wonderland be without conflict?  Luckily, Alice has a bevy of weapons (by the end, a total of 4) in her arsenal, all of which have some thematic significance to Wonderland.  These are split into melee weapons, like her Vorpal Blade and Hobby Horse, and ranged weapons like her Pepper Grinder and Teapot Cannon.  The Clockwork Bomb, finds itself somewhere in the middle.  Although I had seen the weapon types in games beforehand, this new twist make them seem fresh and engaging.  Unfortunately, once all of Alice's weapons had been upgraded to the max, I found myself really only using one of the weapons in combat, as it seemed to do the most damage.Alice is also quite nimble.  In fact, get ready to jump.  A lot.  Alice: Madness Returns utilizes jumping, double jumping, and floating more than quite a bit.  She also has a power, called Shrink Sense, at her disposal.  When activated, it allows Alice to find hidden doors, platforms, or receive clues on what was ahead, etc.  She cannot do anything but walk, while accessing it, so in the case of hidden platforms that involve jumping to, you kind of have to jump to the memorized spot (although it does leave a brief glowing residue).  As you can imagine, this leads to a multitude of unsuccessful leaps.  I didn't get too frustrated with missing a platform, as Alice's demise is so peaceful and lovely.  When expired, Alice's form morphs into a cluster of butterflies flying away.  Additionally, when she does die, the place that she restarts is quite close to where she met her downfall, so it wasn't too much of a penalty, and surprisingly no loss from her health meter.  I think that the developers might have put those touches in, as they may have noticed that the game was a bit flawed, and their inclusion would reduce frustrationIf you've read my other reviews, I've mentioned my affinity for collectibles.  If done the proper way, I don't mind spending extra time on levels, in fact I enjoy it.  This game really does collectible hunting wondrously.  There are multitudes of collectibles, but in this case memories, to hunt for.  The majority are not right out in the open and involve using some crafty contemplation.  Each memory, when located, reveals a little bit about Alice's thought processes or past and delves into her mind, revealing the clues essential in resolving her inner conflict.The level design starts to get a bit stale on the third (of 6 total) chapter.  While the vistas and locales change, it's essentially jump from and onto platforms, pull levers, fight a few enemies, slide, fight a few more enemies, and repeat 1-2 times more until the end of the level.  The levels, or chapters, are also quite long.  Initially, it threw me, but didn't bother me too much by the end.  While they are broken up into smaller bits, or sub-chapters, they are inaccessible if you need to restart an area (missed a collectible), until the whole chapter is completed.  While I was collectible hunting, chapters could take a couple of hours, or longer to complete.  Obviously less, maybe by half, if you just rushed through, but then again you would be missing key clues to the story, by not accessing memories.Within each large level, are a few scattered mini-games.  I thought these were well done, as they typified the level they were in.  In fact, I think they should have figured more prominently throughout Alice: Madness Returns.  My favorites were where Alice turned 2-D and had retro side scrolling adventures.  In the underwater levels, she commandeered a ship and had to blast fish and mines, Defender-style.  Alice actually climbed into paintings in the Far East levels and navigated her way around (more jumping!).  Others had you guiding a macabre doll head Super Monkey Ball style, rearranging blocks, pressing musical notes, and even playing rudimentary chess.GraphicsAmerican McGee certainly has a unique creative vision.  I marveled at the contrast in styles which were exemplified in each level.  Since the Chapters are so long, the same graphical design does not stay constant, thankfully.  The first introductory chapter begins in a lush, psychedelic tropical environment vibrant in color, yet ends in a semi-monochromatic, steampunk kind of metal-infused world.  The creatures and inhabitants, also have taken steps towards the grotesque, as Alice's damaged psyche portrays them.  It's quite evident that Wonderland is in decay.The storytelling uses a mix of different types of cut scenes to convey what's happening.  Some are what you'd expect from a video game in 2011, but others are influenced by storybooks, with what looks like, 2-D paper cutouts.. The effects are this mix of nostalgia infused with today's technology.  Even in London, the other characters Alice meets have exaggerated features, and look like they could be creatures from Wonderland.SoundThe voice acting in Alice: Madness Returns is excellent, which makes Alice's story so much more believable and helps you form an attachment to Alice's circumstances.  Music throughout the game is the appropriate mix of violin and/or piano to make the adventure seem a little more creepy.Replay ValueWhile there is a New Game + feature available, I can't see much use in it.  Any collectibles missed can be accessed through the sub-chapter level selector.  I do recommend purchasing the DLC outfits and weapons pack for the game.  They make the game a tad easier through various bonuses you get while wearing, and it's only a couple of bucks.  Plus, they look pretty cool.  I played through using them and I think that added to my lack of frustration experienced.  For buyers of the retail copy, the original American McGee's Alice is available to download through a code included (Or available for $10 through PSN or XBL, if you purchased the game used)Rating7.7I enjoyed my time in Wonderland much more than I thought I would.  I expected a run of the mill third-person action adventure and got much more.  A little more of the mini-games and a little less jumping should be in order for her next game.  While the game at times feels a bit rushed and incomplete, I am definitely up for Alice's next adventure.  Alice: Madness Returns is a pleasant change of pace, and some of the sequences and experiences have stayed with me, even after I've moved on to other games.  A good deal now that it available for $40, and definitely worth a look when it drops below $30.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A fun open-world filled with random stuff to do","reviewText":"GTA V for me isn't like other games such as the Last of Us or Halo, because while it does have a central story the majority of the memorable moments I had came from just messing around in the game doing your own thing and just having fun experimenting. I've put my thoughts below on each aspect of the game.STORYGTA V takes place in a fictional Southern California with some bits of Nevada thrown in to round things out. You experience the story from the perspective of 3 central characters: 1) Michael, the retired bank-robber being pulled back into his old life, 2) Franklin, the street hustler who's got dreams of moving up into the big-time, 3) Trevor, the sociopath drug-dealing best friend of Michael from his bank-robbing days. The general story takes place with the 3 characters all being brought together by bigger events that keep adding up as you play the game. The execution of how the characters are portrayed feels accurate, and its fun getting to have such different mission types between the 3 characters. There is now the option to retry missions and try things out differently next time too with gold rankings to shoot for in each. And don't worry about getting frustrated over some levels which have annoying sequences that you just can't get past - fail a part of a mission 3 times and you get the option to skip it. While the storyline itself was sound in terms of game design, I felt that it frankly wasn't a very original story and at times to me felt predictable and cliche. This goes back to my main point that the best part of GTA V isn't the campaign story, it's everything else it's got to offer.GAMEPLAYThe dynamic switching between the 3 characters really adds a new layer of immersion and variety to the gameplay. Each character starts out with their own skillset, and kind of like Skyrim the more you perform any given activity the better you'll get at it. You drive more to improve your character's driving ability, take flying lessons to get better at flying, run/bike/swim more to build up your stamina, etc. It feels like a very natural process and kind of gives the player goals to work towards as you play the game. The shooting mechanic by default comes with a very generous auto-aim, that makes the game almost too easy in terms of combat, though you can change this. There is a great variety of weapons this time around, with plenty of customization and a shooting range to try them out on.Driving in terms of technical game design is built fine. The main issue comes from the cars that you have available to use. In fact there are only a handful of cars I even bother looking for to drive because the rest handle so poorly. Part of that I get is by design, since a prius isn't going to handle corners like a dodge viper. Still, I can't help but feel like a lot of the cars I expected to be great to drive felt like a mess on the road (I'm talking about cars like the Diablo aka. Lambo rip-off). I even maxed out my driving skill to make sure it wasn't something missing on my end, but my experience with the cars has been a unfortunate mixed bag. I am very happy with the few cars I did think handle well, and upgraded them immediately and haven't had many issues since then. I personally absolutely hated flying other vehicles like helicopters and especially planes, but I didn't really spend much time practicing flying either.Special abilities for each character keep things fresh, with Franklin getting a mode where he can slow things down while driving and make precision maneuvers, Trevor getting a rage mode where he can take more and dish out more damage, and Michael getting his own combat boost too. All in all, the gameplay is sound mechanically though it doesn't exactly do much to stand out aside from the special abilities either (which you could argue are borrowed from previous games like Max Payne and others).SIDE MISSIONS/RANDOM EVENTSThis was by far one of the more engaging parts of the game for me, mostly because of how ridiculous some of they are. Side missions range from the standard stuff like assassinations and street races to new ones like bounty hunting, Trevor's \"rage\" missions, stealing celebrities clothing, to paparazzi stalking. Side missions are often unique to specific characters, and encourages you to try out and advance each character through each one. I frankly loved them because of just how ridiculous they were and how different they are from the standard stuff you've seen in previous open-world games including previous GTA games. The dialogue and banter on these kinds of missions is just great, and really adds a lot to flesh out the game and make it more immersive. There are also random characters you can encounter that give you some of these side activities and missions (again, specific to each character) and there are also random events that happen like robberies or car thefts that you can choose to intervene in or not. This is very similar to what Rockstar did in Red Dead Redemption with random strangers asking you for help on the road-side that you can choose to help or ignore. You can even stop a thief and keep the stolen money for yourself if you want.HEISTSThe big heists are what are always shown off in the game trailers, and they are definitely plenty of fun because of the planning you have to do before you can pull it off. You even get to pick your crew, opting for the more qualified but higher cost members or going for the cheaper ones of questionable quality. Even how you set-up the heist matters, and will give you different results/rewards based on how well you pull things off. It gives you a great reason to go back and try things differently with a replay, and frankly makes it feel like a more authentic experience similar to a good crime movie. The great set-piece moments keep things fun, though like most things they lose a bit of their luster after you've seen it the first few times. I love the fact that you can switch around between the characters on the heists, and see things from a different perspective and always get to try out the really cool parts of each heist that each character gets to do.IMMERSION/THE WORLD OF GTARockstar did a fantastic job recreating Los Angeles, speaking as someone living in LA right now. All the big recognizable landmark locations are there, from the Griffith Observatory to the Promenade and the Hollywood sign. When I say they have it down, I mean I was able to literally walk to the exact area where I took a picture at the observatory overlooking downtown, down to the staircase and pillars. They did their homework, and it absolutely shows in several parts of the game. There are lots of activities to do including shopping, tennis (one of my favorites), yoga, golf, hunting, marathons, mountain biking, flying, shooting, etc. There's plenty to keep you entertained for a while, and that's not counting other things like playing the stocks or buying up real-estate. I love how tied together the world is, and it feels like you're living in a continuously moving world that's reacting to your actions. For example, if you lets say go out of your way to deface/devalue a company and buy up stock in their competitor you can catch the news to see stock prices jump around and reap the rewards. Even just switching between the characters shows them going on living their lives when you're not controlling them. Trevor was driving around still in a semi-truck from a mission that he was in when I was playing as Michael.It's the little details like that which go a long way to making you feel like Los Santos is a living breathing world. Even just taking a walk around town and overhearing strangers can give you a good laugh, not to mention going in to see a shrink. It's because of how great a job Rockstar does with the little things that it makes it all the more apparent when they do drop the ball. There are a lot of buildings you can't go into, and plenty you cannot interact with. I went down to the Santa Monica pier and couldn't go into the main restaurants there, or go into many restaurants anywhere really. This isn't like Skyrim where nearly every person you run across has a story to tell. What GTA does offer is great, it's just a shame that after 5 years in development there's not more of it. The world size itself is huge, though to be fair the actual city part of it isn't exactly huge and sprawling. I appreciate all the wilderness and desert terrain since it adds some diversity in my opinion, but some people might find it boring.GRAPHICS AND SOUNDThe graphics are absolutely a solid step above GTA IV. But honestly compared to other games out today this isn't anything to write home about. I found the facial animations for anyone outside of the main characters to be very lacking in cutscenes and gameplay alike. But I understand that concessions have to be made to run such a huge open world without load times (except for the really long one when you first start it up). It's not an ugly game by any means, and there's a lot of great looking parts to it. It runs incredibly smoothly on what is now pretty old hardware for the consoles, and that's a great achievement. Rockstar clearly put in some serious time for optimization on the framerate front and it is much appreciated. It helps keep things rolling even in high action scenes unlike many other open-world games that start to chug.The sound design is absolutely fantastic, from the radio station selections to the voiceover quality and variety. Rockstar clearly put in some extra money here and it shows, with the game always feeling authentic sound-wise from street sounds to cars to environmental noises in the wilderness. Rockstar absolutely nailed this, and I think it'll absolutely set a bar for future open-world games to hit. One slight downside is that listening to the same few radiostations means you're probably going to know every song the station can play pretty early on into the game. Not the biggest deal in the world, but more songs are always appreciated and they could easily be updated with new DLC content down the road too.ONLINE/MULTIPLAYERThis is the main reason why I haven't given GTA a 5 star rating, because how GTA Online is going to play out is largely unknown. While based on the trailer it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, it's simply not out yet for me to pass judgement on and so I'm going to defer giving my final score until I see what Rockstar has to offer on this front.WRAP-UPGTA V is a lot of fun with a rich open-world to explore and keep yourself entertained in for hours on end. Is it perfect, no, but it still has a lot to offer. It's the random crazy things that happen to you along the way that I remember most. Here's 1 of my most memorable moments. I started out driving down sunset blvd in a new mercedes SL that I just bought for Franklin since he just wrapped up a big heist and had some spending money. I got it all tricked out with the latest engine upgrades and a fresh paint job to top it off. As I pulled out of the auto-shop my screen flashed and the opportunity came up for me to stop a thief. So I did my civic duty and ran the guy down in my shiny new car and went to bring the poor guy his wallet. What ends up happening is a car I didn't see rams into me and pushes me into the poor guy waiting for his wallet, and the police car sirens started to screech. I was already up at 2 stars and they were gunning right behind me. Thankfully I had my upgraded car to help me make a quick getaway at first, but then some cop cars slid around to stop me and I accidentally rammed right into several street cops at a barrier, up to 4 stars. Now the cops were really gunning for me, and I ended up driving up a parking structure all the way to the top to help avoid the chopper on my tail. I shot out the pilot of the chopper and saw it crash down into some more cop and FBI cars below, 5 stars. Only way off that roof was courtesy of a stunt ramp which I happily revved up my engine to take. After gunning it for the jump I ended up doing a flip and landing perfectly (completely by accident), and making my way to a construction site to hide out. I found a nice little corner tucked away from site, and decided to go and check my stocks, make a few trades, and rush right back out to avoid the cop car getting a little too close. I end up making a run for the mountains hitting ever winding turn at near top speed thanks to my car's upgrades. I see a nice place in the woods to go hide the car and watch the choppers and FBI scramble around to find me. Then I get out of my car, behind the \"Hollywood\" sign and take in the sights before making my way back to Franklin's mansion. That was all a completely unscripted random event, and though it doesn't always work out this neatly it sure it a lot of fun every time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

One of GTA 5's huge strengths is all in the little things: the overheard cellphone calls on the street, the radio ads, the talk shows, the TV stuff, the movies, and of course, the spot-on commentary about where our society seems to be headed in many different directions. From the bizarre 'legalize marijuana' hallucination/alien abduction sequences to the radio ads for the blu light vapor cigarette, you can tell that the amount of effort that went into the humor and fresh takes on some old ideas. Even Weazel news has it's Fox News similarities(\"Confirming Your Prejudices\"); the computer 'finger' that guides you around all the PC's are no longer the index finger, but the middle one instead. And I have never had a mission before where I had to block all the porn spam on a \"co-worker's\" computer. And, as alluded to before, everyone on the street is generally talking on their cell, which is just like every day nowadays. So those are obviously just handful of many brilliant 'background' things you have to notice and seek out; but they are everywhere, and top notch at that. Laughs can be rare in games sometimes, and in many cases these things are funnier than some of the dialog in this game. Anyways...On a personal note, the exploding 'cell phone' assassination early in the game was the most surprising moment(a very current day way to go I would imagine...), but there are many moments close behind; the frantic switching between characters under gunfire can also prove to be challenging(if not frustrating at first...), but certainly adds to the tension and difficulty. Luckily the save points are fairly forgiving too if you fail at a certain point during a mission. You almost always end up where you messed up(or outside the hospital after putting a sticky bomb on a car at a busy intersection, blowing yourself and about a dozen cars up...).The cell phone is the greatest 'non weapon' addition, w/it's quick save to the cab rides; def a time saver, and some of the character's voicemail messages are pretty funny, esp. Lester's...Lets face it, it is hard to do an open world game and make it fresh, let alone present a whole bunch of new additions, characters, locations, and risks of all kinds that work together, esp. if it is a sequel to a much loved franchise. To be honest, while I enjoyed GTA 4, I thought it was a little too slow and not as involving for whatever reason. This game, with it's 3 characters you can switch between, keeps you more than busy in a fun way. Yes, there are those kinda dumb at this point 'drive me here' type of missions, but new gamers need them, and there aren't too many of them; some even give you the choice to help or not, which can be welcome at times. I guess one of the strong suits of this game too is that is very accessible to 'newer' gamers. And the option of skipping certain missions(and returning to them later)is a great addition just for replaying missions whether you skipped them or not. And the new takes on somewhat standard(now, anyways...)crime scenarios from robberies to taking out motorcycle gangs, are surprisingly fresh. Whether recruiting gang folk or casing the places to be robbed, you feel you are playing the familiar yet w/a level of thought-out, creative, and sometimes surprising results. You have to actually work and plan for most of your crimesThe writing is hit and miss as far as the dialog goes(some of the better stuff reminds me of a Tarantino style...), but the story overall keeps things moving nicely, and the options for how certain things can be approached keeps things fresh. there is def a learning curve--as w/most games--w/the controller and all, but once you get that familiarized it all works quite well; stick w/it and it will be worth your time(it may take a little while, but not that much!); the cars even improve as your driving skills do, and certain cars obviously run just a little better than others. The variety of styles of the cars reminded me of Vice City(in a good way...)...The locations are well detailed, from the waves as you ride the jet ski's to just the sidewalk pavement when it is raining. Again, half of the fun of this game is just doing nothing but checking things out.The characters are solid, and there are many; but the main ones make things work pretty well too, and are def varied in their types of behavior. Trevor is always entertaining. He reminds me of someone out of \"Breaking bad\". Franklin def recalls CJ from \"San Andreas\". which is kind of cool; Plus I am sure there are 10,000 other nods and similarities I'm not getting.It is a hard game to review as there is so much to comment on. I def enjoyed some missions more than others, and the ending I got wasn't all that shocking, but it is one of the longer sandbox games that actually warrants another replay or 2(if not more by many I'm sure...).  I was not disappointed by anything really; but while I will say that I have enjoyed the radio music and actually picked up on a few artists I was unaware of that I liked, it would still be nice to create your own station and download your own music. And if that is the worse complaint your can have for this game, I guess you're pretty lucky anyways!Expect the 'GTA familiar' improved in every way, and then some. And then 'more some'.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007UM59AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Oh, No, He Doesn't Have White Hair!","reviewText":"Ninja Theory, developer of the brilliant \"Heavenly Sword\" and \"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West\", has one of the worst positions in the industry right now. Despite Capcom giving them full graces to do what they want with the perpetually popular \"Devil May Cry\" franchise, they have an angry herd of gamers with a disdain for change refusing to play their breakthrough game because of several moronic, petty reasons. The biggest one of these is that Dante no longer has white hair, and that it's not Japanese enough, and... well, you get the point. These talented men and women have put years of effort into this project, and people aren't biting because of the protagonist's haircut. Ahh, don't you love gamers sometimes?It's a shame, though, really. Those people aren't playing this game because of a silly little bowl cut, and consequently, are missing out on one of the best, most explosive and politically potent games in recent years. \"DmC: Devil May Cry\" is brilliant on virtually every possible level, and for those who don't give a donkey's rear end about hairstyles and just want a great game, it's simply a must-play.Set in an alternate universe to the previous entries, \"DmC\" follows demon hunter Dante, a rambunctious young man who enjoys threesomes, pizza, and parading around in the nude. Imagine his surprise when he finds out that he's actually an angel-demon half-breed, and that a demon lord runs the world's biggest bank, and that half-breeds are the only ones who can stop such a powerful foe. Further exacerbating this problem is the fact that the city he lives in is, quite literally, trying to kill him, and routinely changes forms and coughs up demonic foes to put an end to his demon hunting days. Add in a long-lost brother, a graffiti-spraying witch, and enemies that consist of soda companies and corrupt news organizations, and you've got a zany plot full of twists and turns.There are two elements that make the story such a winner, and the first one of these is simply Dante himself. It was admittedly risky tampering with such an established character, but lo and behold, the masters at Ninja Theory have pulled it off beautifully. Having even more style and panache than his predecessor, this reborn protagonist has a streak to him the old one simply did not: he's quite likable. While I thought the original Dante was just as pretty and flashy as the next guy, even diehard fans of the original games admit that he's a bit of a tool, and an unabashed dork. While I can understand growing attached to such a character, current gamers might not be as receptive to him. This isn't true with the new version, who is just the right amount of cocky and levelheaded to be instantly liked. Full of witty one-liners, unconventional approaches to troubling situations, yet with enough pathos to be easily sympathized with, the new Dante is a winner.The second thing that makes the narrative so engrossing is how bold it is. Ninja Theory is known for unconventional storytelling choices (Nariko's fate in \"Heavenly Sword\", the live-action ending of \"Enslaved\"), but this time, they've gone out of their way to send a scathing message to Americans. They start by making the world's economy rigged to satiate the whims of demons, making the little guys suffer. But they placate society by spiking the world's most popular drink with a \"secret formula\" (sound familiar?), which is actually a psychotropic to keep them fat and dumb. These fat and dumb people get their news from a corrupt news organization, spearheaded by a man with a receding hairline who looks almost identical to Bill O'Reilly.\"DmC\" is a vicious assault on American economics, news and consumer culture, and it's absolutely beautiful because of it. I would hazard to say this game may become unpopular because of how blatantly and gloriously offensive it is, and how many sponsors it probably alienated due to its outwardly political stance. Kudos to the writers for not backing down from their gutsy artistic vision.Not to say this game skimps on content when it gets down to hacking and slashing. The developers have taken their experience from past games and mashed it together with the classic, combo-driven gameplay people have come to expect from the franchise. It's a beautiful mixture, much like virtually anything from Starbucks, and with new enemies constantly introduced, players are forced to keep on their toes and not mindlessly button-mash to win. This never feels unfair, however, due to the routine upgrades you'll be doing to Dante, who has loads of unlockable moves and combos for his varied and satisfying arsenal. Combat is fast, furious, and full of depth, so whether you like laying the smack-down on hordes of enemies, or tweaking characters to your play style (all upgrades can be undone and swapped at anytime), you'll find something to love here.What should definitely be pointed out about this entry, in comparison to the older ones, is that the platforming is finally something worth calling home about. That's actually an understatement, because the simple act of jumping on stuff in \"DmC\" is something special, something fun, something fresh. Dante has a double-jump, a mid-air boost, a chain that pulls him into things, and a chain that pulls things into him. Keep in mind that the environments are always changing with every step, so when you're not staying alert during battles, you're on pins and needles trying to stay on solid ground. Heck, sometimes they even mix the two. On the gameplay front, much like the story front, \"DmC\" is positively flawless.Now, it's obvious that this is something Capcom threw a lot of money behind, because this game is a feast for the eyes. The world of \"DmC\" is full of imagination, with pavement that rips out of the ground and spirals into the ground, buildings that warp and compress in attempts to kill Dante, and a strange alternate dimension suspended in the sky. The set pieces are all gorgeous, running the gamut of different settings, from a demented carnival to a soda factory from hell. Especially worth noting is how much effort went into crafting a set of unique and varied enemies, which has always been a defining trait of the series. I'd hazard to say this is the most original and best-looking bestiary in a \"Devil May Cry\" game so far, in fact.  Art direction is more beautiful than anything we've ever seen in the franchise, and it's wonderful to see such imagination replacing the somewhat drab settings of previous entries.It's even better that the art direction pops from the gorgeous graphics. This is one of the best uses of the Unreal engine on the market, period. Animation is fluid, and every inch of the world is beautiful to look at... well, as beautiful as a city that's alive and trying to knock off the protagonist can be, anyway. Wherever you look, Ninja Theory's city of Limbo is gorgeous, as are its inhabitants. Once again, the developer has achieved perfection in this area.Making this the complete package is the killer soundtrack, done by Noisia and Combichrist. Taking a cue from \"Max Payne 3\", whose entire soundtrack was done by rock band Health, \"DmC\" has an entire score composed by these two talented groups, who come together and make a ode to gorgeous musical overkill. Noisia is an electronica trio, and Combichrist is a metal group, so you can pretty much guess the kind of music you'll get here. Loud, fast and pounding synthesizers pump hand-in-hand with wailing guitars and screaming male vocals for a good portion of the game, and surprisingly, this works.The main reason this type of music doesn't annoy here is that it really fits the entire mood of the game, which is one of decadence and flash. Even the brief dives into dubstep territory are enjoyable, and both groups know when to keep the music low-key for more emotional and serious moments. This soundtrack is triumphant, and a perfect match for the atmosphere.Finishing out the strong post-production elements is the voice acting, which is done by a relatively unknown cast who manage to pull it off perfectly. The biggest joy here is definitely Tim Phillipps as Dante, who brings a charming rogue streak to the character, balancing cocky, funny and angry at regular intervals. Here's hoping he stays on board for future entries. Another highlight is David de Lautour as the new and improved Vergil, who has a very \"Occupy Wall Street\" air about him. Other characters, such as graffiti-tagging witch Kat, and a truly ominous main villain make this the complete audio and visual experience.That isn't to say that there aren't a few niggling flaws holding \"DmC\" back from complete, sublime perfection, however. The biggest one would have to be the contrived and bothersome bonus stages. Sure, you don't have to do them, but if you opt to, prepare for some cut-and-paste racing and combat sequences. And if you don't do them, your overall level score gets brought down, which is relatively annoying. Another small gripe is the amount of time it takes to load levels; it's not painful, but it takes longer than it feels like it should. But because the game is gorgeous, and has a lot going in each sprawling level, it's forgivable.These are two tiny little chips in what is otherwise a glorious suit of armor, however. Perfectly balancing plot, gameplay, graphics and music, and mixing in excellent voice acting and brilliant social commentary, Ninja Theory's take on the \"Devil May Cry\" may very well be the best entry in the series since its inception. Devilishly brilliant and fun, \"DmC: Devil May Cry\" is already a prime candidate for Game of the Year.But hey, maybe you shouldn't get it. After all, he doesn't have white hair...Plot: 10Gameplay: 9Graphics: 10Sound: 10Overall: 9.75","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Let's Party!","reviewText":"Mario Party 4 is the 4th installment of the popular series.

There are even parts and sequences that are pretty much just re-textured levels from Gears. But everyone has different ideas of what is fun in a game. If you have played the first Gears of War then you have pretty much already played this game, just imagine kicking everything into slow motion first before shooting it instead.Here is the formula... Run down narrow pathway, \"oooh\" and \"ahhhh\" at scenery, find big open area with easy cover, have a shootout... hear the characters make a witty comment about the male anatomy afterward... walk down another narrow pathway to an open area, more pretty scenery... Another shootout, only with tougher baddies... More comments about male anatomy... Another narrow path, an epic boss fight (by epic, I mean ridiculous to the point of being boring.)... Some sort of comment about the boss battle and lots of poop.... Rinse and repeat!

With a more ambitious story - well, at the time, anyway - and a whole host of characters, IV is often considered a classic by many RPGers. While I will admit this is way better than what most companies can do, there was something missing that set it apart from ones like VI or VII. Maybe it's too dated or maybe it just wasn't as compelling or better structured and while I did like IV, I didn't necessarily love it either.Story: You play as Cecil, captain of the Red Wings, Baron's elite fighting force. Coming home from a mission which had questionable outcomes, Cecil disapproves and the King, infuriated, sends him on another mission to deliver a package to a nearby town. But when the package proves destructive, Cecil and a group of friends he meets along the way, have to somehow stop the King from what he's planning and figure out the mastermind behind it all.Graphics: Since this is more improved graphics of a SNES release, you'll notice things look more sharper and cleaner than before but there are by no means wow-inducing. But having Amano artwork for character portraits is a nice touch and the game runs quite smoothly. But the environments are just as diverse and although not immaculately detailed, they're fine within the context of the game.Sound/Music: Many would also consider IV's soundtrack to be the first classic soundtrack with Nobuo Uematsu at the top of his form. Personally, while the themes are lively and one track in particular (\"Rydia\") has a gorgeous melody, I can't really remember some of them. I could hum practically 3/4's of VI or VII's soundtrack yet if you would tell me what does the town theme sound like, I'd be hardpressed to even get it right. Just saying, it's a good soundtrack to have on but this was just the beginning, as they say.Gameplay: IV was another instance where characters had specific classes whereas previous games either had the Job system or user-determined classes. From mainstays like dragoons to thieves to bards to white and black mages, all the familiars are here. Some aren't as useful as others but they're all memorable and despite one character you get super late into the game, they all have distinct personalities.The Chronicles port was the Hardtype version which practically required characters to level up should they want to have a more comfortable playing and not get slaughtered. This port some would describe as easy and while there wasn't a lot of instances where it got frustrating, save some cheap shots, this isn't a game where it feels like a struggle just to get through. My one complaint is that sometimes enemies don't give as much EXP as they should and with 5 members of your team on hand, it makes levelling up a chore when you have to get into near 10-15 battles just for one guy to progress a level.Part of what made me want to play and finish IV was that it was the only one out of the IV-XII series that I haven't beat. So while the game does have some memorable moments, themes and solid gameplay, this didn't hit me as hard as subsequent games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2006"}

This is just WoW with a few skin changes and some names taken out of a couple of Tolkein books.To be fair, they did expand it a bit. Now as you grind pointlessly through kill and gather quests that have absolutely nothing to do with the story, you can earn \"Deeds\" and \"Titles\" to show off or improve your character's abilities.

If you didn't like WoW, you might want to hold off and see how it holds together at higher levels. WoW wore out its welcome for me when my grind got me into Desolace at about level 44. Whether this game will sputter and fall falt on its face as well remains to be seen.One final point: you might want to hold off briefly either way. While the whole thing is clearly nothing more than a direct copy of World of Warcraft, it's not nearly as polished yet.

There are slightly faster frame rates and a different use of controls to support the GC's controller. That's all.The RE3 PlayStation Dual Shock Version with the original and rearranged data is the same as this passed off port. I don't need to review the game itself, it is another chapter in the saga that is well-known to fans.If you don't have a PlayStation1 or 2, then this is a solid buy. If you've never played RE3 and don't have the PS, it is a solid buy again. Whoever is making up the stories about the better graphics or a remake is fooling you.Don't get me wrong, RE3 is a great game, but it is a port. Graphics, game, content and all. I rated it 3 stars because of the marketing tactic. The original PS version is a 4.5 star game.

But this review is for the game itself and not the different platform.I've always wanted to play this game.  The concept itself was very interesting.  Bringing down Colossal monsters with a Sword. What was cool about this game is you don't know how or what would bring the monsters down.  What is also cool is the monsters themselves!!  They looked awesome!!!PROS:1) Music was beautiful.  Very well done and actually complimented the gameplay.  The score felt \"BIG\".2) Graphics were amazing.  Especially the water in the levels where you have swim.  It actually looked like the water was cold.3) Colossus were awesome.  Each one had a specific area of weakness and the challenge was to find what that was on each of them.  Once you did, it's stabby-stabby time.4) The scenes when you rode the horse was smooth and neat5) Story was cool (Until the end) then it got weird).  But I won't spoil the end for you.  My son read on-line something about the character at the end but I'll let you find that out.6) Very little dialogue.  Which means no annoying long cinematic scenes like Metal Gear is notorious for!CONS:1) The character ran like a girl, but yet you are a guy?  Which when I first seen the opening movie, I couldn't tell if the main character was a guy or girl!?!?  The character had a head band like a girl would wear.  And the way it ran was silly!!2) Controlling the horse was very difficult.  I'm glad that you didn't need to ride the horse to stay alive or battle the monsters3) Traveling from one the main base to the next challenge was often times too long and I just wanted to get there quick to start the level.4) The ending!!!  W-E-I-R-D!!!  It seemed to fall flat.5) Very little if any replay value.The main things that really impressed me was the graphics, sound/music and the battles.

Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Chris A.

What we have is Star Trek Legacy, a game that seems more last gen then next gen on the 360. This game is at times fun to play, but you get frustrated with the controls for one thing and the missions are sometimes ridiculously hard or ridiculously easy. For me the biggest sore note was the controls. The larger ships like the Galaxy Class and the other battleships are a pain to manuever. You end up getting killed without just trying to go after an enemy ship. The smaller ships basically lay waste to a battleship. The Klingon ships are very weak which I found surprising. The Romulan ships are stronger than the Klingon ships which was also kind of odd. The power balance is obviously skewed. The story, a rogue Vulcan scientist c'mon, has that not been done numerous times before in various episodes and movies. It would've nice to play the game from the prospective of the other races and to simply have more races to choose from like the Dominion, Cardassians, The Orion Syndicate, The Breen, The Bajorans etc. This game seems incomplete and unfortunately joins the long list of awful Star Trek games.

I'll tell you right away I wasn't disappointed one bit, I'm not a baseball fan at all and I even hesitated playing the first game so you don't really need to be a fan of baseball to enjoy Mario Supper Sluggers. It's very much like Mario Super Strikers, as long you like Mario there are strong chances you will like this game, no need to be a sports fan. If you liked the first baseball edition of Mario you're almost guaranteed to like this one with everything the Wii brings to this game.The best mode of the game is obviously Challenge mode in which you pick as superstar (Mario, Luigi, Wario, Peach...) as you play in baseball kingdom and challenge other teams one by one and earn some of their players along the way in order the face Bowser's team, it's pretty much the same as the original Mario Baseball, the concept remains the same. There is exhibition mode if you just want to play with some friends for some fun, Mini-Game mode is entertaining and offers some cool mini-games like Bomb-Omb barrel, Toy Field was interesting but I didn't like it as much and of course there's the training mode to perfect your play. That's what's in the game right there, after you finished Challenge mode there is still some fun to be had.The controls are what you would expect; you pitch and hit the ball with the Wiimote in the same way a baseball player would, without the same intensity of course but you get the point. The controls are very easy to figure out and comfortable playing with, you'll get used in no time and there are practices just in case. There are many things to consider while playing for instance the special moves and when you can use them, the chemistry of the players which will make them do special abilities and the stadiums you play in because they're all different and some could make you lose or win some points depending on your chances ex: tornado hits the other team's player and you can score a home run while he's dizzy.The game looks very good, better than the first for sure. There isn't a huge improvement between the Wii and Gamecube graphics but it's certainly there and noticeable, after all I'd rather play a fun game with average graphics than one that isn't nearly as fun with great graphics. The colors are vivid in that Mario fashion and the stadiums look very good, nothing wrong at all.Don't underestimate this game it's harder than it looks and got me very frustrated at times because of the way the CPU would make a bunch of points in a row and beat me at the very end,  that would be my small issue with this game. It can be an issue to some and not for others, some like the fierce competition and will see it as a challenge, some like me get frustrated but it remains an excellent game Overall.Mario Supper Sluggers is a very fun game and is worth at least a rental, if you make an impulse buy you may find out that you wasted money on a game you never even tried. That would be my advice; unless you loved the Mario Baseball game you should rent it before you buy, if you're not interested in baseball or sports for that matter it's still worth checking out. Did Mario belt a home run with this one? Not totally but let's say he scored a few points for sure! I really ended up liking Mario Supper Sluggers and do not regret my purchase, 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

This game is what I'd refer to as a standard shooter.  It's not revolutionary, but it's not anywhere near as bad as some people say.  The only thing that bothers me about this game is the spoken dialogue.  It is incredibly cheesey and corny.  That aside, I'd say the game is just about on par with Halo 3 in terms of graphics and gameplay.  I'm sure the fanboys will be lambasting me for saying that, but I think it's true.  Also, the multiplayer is quite satisfying.  It works very well and is very stable (compared to Turok's).  Graphically, I think this game looks pretty sweet.  The foliage in the jungle is dense and detailed.  It's not as good as Crysis in that the leaves and grasses don't sway in the wind or bend as you pass by, but it still looks good.  Much of the environment is destructible.  The weapons look and feel good, and the sound effects are spot on.  The campaign is pretty standard fare.  The vehicles are pretty standard fare.  Overall, it's a good game.  It's not great, like COD4 or Gears, but it gets the job done.  If you enjoy shooters, you will most likely enjoy Haze.

It is a great, reliable console.  And there are so many good games on it.  Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank.  It also has good graphics and good sound.  It can also play DVD's and CD's, which I've never actually done, but it's still neat.  You can also play PlayStation 1 games on it, as well.  But, you will need a PlayStation 1 memory card (you can play the PS1 games with the PS2 controller, though).  I also like that the memory cards fit much more than the memory cards on the GameCube, which is nice.There's actually not much else to say.  This is just a super fun console that has a good variety of fun games, including the PS1 games.  This is one of my favorite consoles ever, if not my favorite.

{"product_name":"B00005UNWB","description":"The publishers ofGrand Theft Auto IIIare back with another game  geared towards a mature audience. But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way. Parents should note that this  game carries a Mature rating for its blood, violence, and gore.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Amazing number of characters onscreen simultaneouslySimple beat-'em-up gameplayA vast arsenal with which to inflict damageCons:Missions get repetitiveNo multiplayer modeBland soundtrack","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"RIOT!!!!","reviewText":"You will never have so much fun [ticking] off your parents as when playing this game.Chaos mode is SoE's cream of the crop - no definite goals or objectives, you just run around blowing up cars and throwing grenades into buildings.  Throwing a molotov cocktail into a building and watching it explode while people scream and run in all directions is definitely alot of fun.  Chaos mode sometimes gives you little goals, like a short time period where breaking windows is worth double points, or a time limit on blowing up all the cop cars in the level, but mostly you are free to do what you want.  The weapons are awesome, fun to use, and each has its place and function.  Rocket and Grenade Launchers are good for some vehicular destruction, and when the cops come after you, there is a good assortment of machine guns, shotguns, flame throwers, and even pepper spray.  These shoot-outs with the law are great - cops and soldiers swarm you, and you must retreat to a safe distance and then mow 'em all down (and usually a few civilians, too, cause they can't help but get in the way).  This inforces a style of play in which you run frantically from corner to corner, causing as much destruction as you can with whatever you can get your hands on.  Each area has local gangs, too, and if you attack them accidentally or on purpose, you will envoke their wrath and they'll be after you.  Chaos mode also has a \"Last Clone Standing\" varient, in which the only people out are bad guys, and you must empty the streets of them.  This is fun, as the bodies so start to pile up...And yet all this fun is about as deep as an arcade game.  At it's heart, State of Emergency is a simple beat-em-up, kinda like the old Double Dragon, except taken to a grand scale.  The crowds are neat and give a real sense of a riot going on, but there is very little you can actually DO with those people.  The camera is very difficult to work, especially since enemies tend to collect in your blind spots.  The story mode (\"Revolution\") is pretty boring, with endless missions that never seem to end.  Lastly, the game only has 4 levels, and of these, I only liked 2 of the levels.  Not much there.  These levels aren't anything like the cities in GTA3 - there is no \"breathing city\" theme - not much is going on, and after a while you'll feel like you've \"been there, done that\".Maybe rent this game first, see what you think.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2002"}

The game clearly wants to be a movie but the embarrasing plotting and cardboard characters ensure that had that actually been the case, it would have been roundly panned and laughed out of theatres.

{"product_name":"B000G7PMXC","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Great multiplayer","reviewText":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series of games have seen a whole lot of change over the years. The series started out as a slow, tactical, shooter with a heavy emphasis on planning. When the series made its jump to the Xbox with Rainbow Six 3, the game dropped the planning stage to attempt to appeal to a broader audience, while still retaining a tactical shooter feel. The game was extremely successful, becoming one of the most played games on Xbox Live. But after a well received expansion, the developers took a sharp turn and moved the franchise into arcade shooter territory. The majority of the fans were disappointed, and the game was a critical failure. But don't worry Rainbow fans, Ubisoft has indeed learned from their mistakes. Vegas is the most intense and tactical Rainbow Six game, making it easily the best in the series.Rainbow Six: Vegas takes place in Las Vegas as you probably have guessed. Most of the story unfolds while you are playing the game, either in helicopter briefings while you are flying to your next target or while you are on foot from an audio and video feed in the top left of your screen. This is a pretty nice change from the text briefings before missions that Rainbow Six players are used to. Without giving too much of the plot away, terrorists have attacked various casinos in the city, taking some hostages and planting bombs. You play as Logan Keller, a team leader for a group of highly skilled soldiers, and it is your job to go from casino to casino and take care of business. If this all sounds familiar, that's because it is. We have all heard this same basic story dozens of times in other games and Hollywood action movies. But while the storyline isn't exactly original, it is good enough to keep you at least mildly interested. What really matters is the gameplay, and that is where the game truly shines.If you have ever played Gears of War, your might be surprised how similar the two games play. They were in development around the same time, so it's hard to say if any copying was going on, but both games have a heavy emphasis on cover, requiring you to use anything you can hind behind to stay alive. However, the cover system in Vegas works quite a bit better then it does in Gears. You have a lot more control when it comes to moving around cover and shooting out. Also, the cover seems more important in Vegas then it did in Gears, mostly because you can take much fewer shots in Vegas before going down.Another element both games have in common is a squad of teammates that you fight along with. Controlling the team works similar to other games in the series. You can still tell your squad where to move, whether to hold fire or shoot on sight, to stack up behind doors before throwing in a grenade and storming in as well as all of the other commands you could give in the previous games. However, there are a few additions. For example, you now have a snake cam that allows you to peak under doors. Using this device, you can then give your team priority targets in the next room, to make sure they take down the most important enemies first when they enter. Your teammates also have some pretty good AI. They know how to take cover and engage enemies, meaning you really don't have to worry about them that much. They also do a great job taking down terrorists, making them very useful.Besides commanding your squad, the game has other features that allow for some complex tactics. Many of the rooms have multiple entry points. Using the snake cam you can scout out the room before determining how you want to enter it. You can even use two entrances at once, by having your team stack up outside one door while you go to another. Then you can order your squad to barge in guns blazing at the same time you enter from another door. You also have the option to do some repelling during some points of the game, which adds another entrance, the windows, to a room.Your large selection of weapons also allows you to take in some tactical considerations. Vegas features a ton of assault rifles, machine guns, shotguns, and pretty much any type of gun you can think of. Each of the weapons offers some level of customization. Pistols can have things like extended magazines or laser sights, while rifles can be fitted with different types of scopes depending on what is needed. Once you have selected your guns, you can choose from items like explosive grenades, C4, breaching charges, flash grenades, and more.With the cover system, team controls, multiple entry points, and a large selection of weapons, Rainbow Six: Vegas offers a lot of choice when it comes to tactics.But the single player campaign is only half of what the game has to offer. Rainbow Six: Vegas has a fully featured and expansive multiplayer option, which easily makes it the best on-line shooter on the Xbox 360. The core of the multiplayer experience is what the developers call the P.E.C., or \"Persistent Elite Creation\". When you first start out, you create your own character and have a limited access to different types of gear like body armor and weapons. After every match, your character gains experience, allowing you to go up in rank and gain access to more items. It's a neat feature that rewards you for playing, yet doesn't make the game feel unfair for new players that don't have access to all of the items. Different armor makes you choose between mobility and protection, while other weapons may be more powerful but are harder to control.There is a good selection of game modes to choose from that range from objective driven modes like attack and defend, to more standard offerings like solo and team deathmatch. The levels are varied and well designed for the most part. Though some, such as the Calypso Casino level, were clearly designed with attack and defend in mind and can be slightly unbalanced in other game modes like team deathmatch due to one team having a better spawn point. But if you are not into competitive gaming against other players, Vegas offers cooperative gameplay over live for the entire single player campaign with up to three other players. Or you can play \"terrorist hunt\" which is a mode that puts you and your friends in a level with a bunch of randomly placed terrorists that you need to take out.Overall, Rainbow Six Vegas is a great game with a lot of value. The single player is challenging and offers a lot of depth, and the multiplayer packs in a lot of features. You could easily find yourself playing this game until the next Rainbow Six game comes out. It is not often that developers try to reinvent such a successful series, but Ubisoft gave it another shot and ended up creating the best Rainbow Six game so far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2007"}

This was my 1st Katamari game of the series(i played the older Katamari's after 100% completing this game), and i have to say at first it was hard to reach the size in such a short time span, but after awhile i realized that was the point, and it felt rewarding each time that i played, becoming bigger and picking up objects i could not get when i was near the size, and some moments picking up buildings, galaxies to mythological creatures(no spoilers), and even cousins.This game has 40 levels divided by 20 for Roboking, 20 for the regular king. Each was fun and new, especially with the King Hop ability, it made things easier for me when i was stuck somewhat(press R2 for PS3 and shoulder button for Xbox360). What i really liked was that each time you beat the levels achieve new scores, and you can unlock new modes such as.- Speed Katamari it is so fast you do not even need to do the rolling ability and you have the same time limit, the hard part is that you have to turn around but that makes sense because it is very fast.Different looking colors and themes for levels- i love this feature a lot, it provides replayability on it's own, you can have the classic look, wood look, metal look, etc and it will make everything in the level look like it. It looks excellent on an HD-TV and even on a normal tv, but an HD TV is recommended.Eternal-imagine this as the relax mode, where you have NO TIME LIMIT, and you can collect everything, and just take things at your own pace. This is my favorite mode,  i wish there was more because there were some levels i could imagine being relaxing and just playing for 30minutes etc.Overall this game has a whole lot of extras for old Katamari fans, and tons of features to draw in new people into this game and make it's case as a new innovative game of the series. It has flaws such as the scores(in the older games it is a little lenient) it is nothing to bad you can do enough to unlock or do better, but i can not help but to feel that they thought only vets were going to play this game, other than that, it is worth the buy all the way. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants something funny, new and interesting in a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SVGW8","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"The Kirby game many fans have been eagerly waiting for","reviewText":"For the past several years, Kirby titles have been responsible for some of Nintendo's most daring and adventurous gameplay changeups; players have drawn him platforms, taken him into a world of yarn and stitchwork, commanded hoards of his clones and sent him off on wild air rides. In all these offbeat but oftentimes fascinating spinoffs and new ventures, it may have become easy to forget Kirby's roots and what made him such an endeared character to begin with: his famous ability to inhale and copy the powers of his foes. It has been a whopping 11 years since Kirby has seen a classically-formatted platforming title on a home console, something that has been sorely missed by many fans. Thankfully, however, the appropriately titled Return to Dream Land is also Kirby's long-awaited return to form.The story goes something like this: a mysterious alien-like fellow named Magolor crashes his air ship into Pop Star, and asks Kirby and his friends to gather the missing pieces to reconstruct it so he can return to his home world. It may seem silly and simple at first, particularly because it initially appears as though there's no villain or mastermind behind any kind of evildoing or mischief, but the story takes some unexpected twists and turns as the game progresses and in fact grows into one of Kirby's greatest storylines.This game is a gift of pure nostalgia that most Kirby fans likely never would have expected to receive. Avid fans of the pink puff will fall madly in love with it, and understandably so because it is such an obvious tribute to those fans specifically. Being a bit of an obsessive Kirby fan myself, this game has evoked a gratuitous amount of gaming-euphoria in me. Dozens of familiar and beloved abilities and enemies return (many of which we haven't seen for years), cherry-picking elements from some of Kirby's most memorable classics. There are sound effects and music directly from Super Star, abilities once exclusive to Kirby's Adventure, and enemies like adorable Nruffs and ghostly Wapods from Kirby's Dream Land 3. Even finer details like the food-themed world names, selection screen mini-games and Ability Rooms are incorporated. It will have the diehards squealing within minutes.These diehards will remember how this type of game plays very fondly: as Kirby, you can walk, slide, swim and float through various worlds all while sucking up everything in sight-until you've gained a nifty Copy Ability. There are more than 20 in this game, and they seem to have included all the favorites. Beam, Cutter, Sword and more all return, as well as some long-missing like Tornado, Ninja and Wing. In addition, the developers intelligently combined certain simpler abilities to make them more eclectic and usable in a modern game; the age-old Spark is now in fact a mesh of Kirby's Adventure's Spark and Super Star's Plasma, allowing you to emit electricity in place as well as build up energy for long-range blasts. This is great not only because abilities like Spark were a bit simplistic on their own, but also because it gives the impression of wider variation and inclusion of abilities. Ninja and Fighter similarly incorporate aspects of Suplex/Throw, and so forth. Details like this really make it a deeply comprehensive love letter to fans.There is also an all-new feature, the Super Abilities, which work like highly powered up versions of certain regular ones; very similar to the Final Smashes of Super Smash Bros., they allow Kirby to initiate mega-attacks that oftentimes go full screen and deal massive damage. Super Sword, for example, allows Kirby to wield various gargantuan weaponry and slash up enemies as well as parts of the stage and surrounding environment, while Flare Beam creates a large sphere of magic that can be controlled to move around the screen and crush obstacles in various directions. These Super Abilities can be gained by inhaling special enemies which exude a rainbowy light and appear only rarely. Super Abilities play a major role in some of the most delectable gameplay here, particularly when they're incorporated into certain boss battles.Although only a handful of Kirby games have sported notable multiplayer modes, Kirby's Return to Dream Land heavily incorporates the feature. Up to four players can play at once, and one of the greatest new inclusions is the option of a diverse character select. Players 2 through 4 have the option of playing as fan favorites Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Meta Knight, or a copy of Kirby himself; unlike most multiplayer affairs of this sort, however (such as Super Mario Bros. Wii), each character plays completely differently and has a unique set of moves. This offers a great deal of strategy and diversity to multiplayer mode, as certain characters can handle certain situations better than others. King Dedede is the slowest but deals the heaviest damage and can pound down stakes with his hammer, while Meta Knight is the fastest flier and sports a variety of wicked sword techniques. Waddle Dee meanwhile excels at long-range combat, capable of launching spears and spinning them like helicopter wings to hover. Although the characters may at first appear to simply mimic Kirby's Hammer, Sword and Spear abilities, they in fact have a variety of moves unique to them and are well worth trying out. The fact that Meta Knight is a playable character alone is a long-awaited and much-appreciated feature.What's more, popping in and out is seamlessly integrated; other players can opt out and then rejoin the fun again (or even swap characters) at a moment's notice, without ever having to endure a wonky activation process or even pause the game. Some minor gripes are that everyone shares a pool of lives rather than having a set of their own, and although other players can be instantly revived if they die, if Kirby (player 1) dies, it's lights out for everyone. IE don't plan on the least skilled player holding controller 1. Also, although players 2-4 have four different options for who to play as, player 1 must play as Kirby, meaning if you intend on going through this whole game alone you may not get an opportunity to play as any of the other characters, which is a bit unfortunate.The most common complaint this game has received is that it is very easy or overly simplistic; while it's true the first quest certainly shouldn't give anyone major trouble, particularly seasoned gamers, there are far more challenges available than given credit for. Some of the final stages of the game and particularly the final boss (which is a spectacular battle, among Kirby's most memorable ever in fact) present quite a challenge, and completists have the task of tracking down all 120 Energy Spheres to unlock all the game's secrets. In addition, after beating the game's seven initial worlds, you'll unlock Extra Mode, a revamp of the first quest which includes stronger, differently-designed enemies and bosses, halving Kirby's health bar and many other tweaks. This second quest is in fact rather difficult and should satisfy any Kirby fan hungry for a challenge.The mini-games are unexpectedly very entertaining and feel like much more than random tack-ons. Ninja Dojo makes great use of the Wii mote's motion control, allowing you to throw ninja stars at progressively faster-moving targets while competing with friends, while Scope Shot plays like an arcade shooter and is actually a sturdy challenge, particularly if you're playing it alone. Upon beating the game, you'll unlock not only Extra Mode but also The Arena, making its triumphant return from Super Star. Like before, you'll be able to choose your ability, grab partner(s) if desired and embark on a series of boss fights to see how far you can get with limited healing items. This is a wonderful inclusion and a great post-game feature, which really helps buff the overall content and replay factor.Despite some (very) minor setbacks, Kirby's Return to Dream Land is a pristine addition to Kirby's catalogue, and an unquestionable must-have for any Kirby fan. The Wii isn't known for its graphical capabilities, but this game is bright, colorful, adorable and gorgeous, with an array of eye candy visuals and minute attention to detail. It is among the few games in which you'll feel truly immersed in Kirby's cloudy, dreamlike world. Dream Land is truly worth returning to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00FM5IY38","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven","summary":"A ton of potential with a sub-par execution.","reviewText":"This seems to be one of the more controversial games out there. Critically it reviewed quite low but gamers tend to review it quite high. I'm somewhere in the middle.There is no doubt that this is one of the most beautiful games out right now for consoles. This game gave me a great first impression. The voice acting is above average, the characters move very smoothly even when the screen is cluttered with action, and the executions are neat and varied, but unfortunately this game suffers where it matters most - gameplay.The problem with this game is that it's very button-mashy and it's filled with quick-time events which really don't matter. The windows for blocking and attacking are huge, so once you get used to the controls after an hour it becomes very repetitive and quite easy, even on harder difficulty levels.After a few attacks your enemy will glow a sequence of colors corresponding to the buttons you should push to perform an execution, so for example they might glow yellow, then blue, then yellow so during this sequence you should hit Y, then X, then Y. One of the issues is that this is just a clever way to hide quick-time events but the larger issue is that it really doesn't matter if you perform these actions correctly as you will still execute your opponent. You just gain a few extra points and a cooler execution animation if it is done correctly.There are a few more elements to combat, for instance you can use the directional pad to set what kind of bonus you get after performing an execution. For example if you have 'health' selected then you'll get a bit of health after executing your foes. Also, there is a nifty focus attack which will stun your enemies and put your character in 'bullet time' mode for a short period of time. The focus attacks are very powerful and very easy to abuse making the game even easier.Ryse is worth a play through if you can find it for cheap but ultimately I found it to be very repetitive and all too linear. It's a short game that I will probably not visit again in the future. However, if you want a taste of the potential the XBOX One has in regards to graphics then Ryse certainly delivers on that front!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2014"}

This game is a fresh rebirth of the computer classic Wolfenstein 3D.  Purists may argue that that there shouldn't have been any look up/down, but then again was that by design or limitation of not having any floor/ceiling in the original....we'll give id the former.  But let's look at what this game is...fun!  Storline wise it stays true, and blasting Hitler's minions has never been so fun.  The graphics are clean, yet XBox has done cleaner, especialy when things get frantic and full on the screen, the framerate suffers.  On B.J.'s arsenal, he gets the usual run of World War II weapons, Thompson Sub-Machine Guns, Colt 1911 pistol, German MP-40's, plus here's where the rebirth really takes shape......sniper rifles!  You get two, a Mauser with a sniper scope, and another M1S Snooper Night Scope enabled rifle.  The FG42 German Paratrooper rifle has a great kick and sound, you'll really enjoy that rifle especially the controller feedback.  Plus the best machine gun of them all, the Venom, basically a mini-gun!  There's also a flamethrower, that at times seems cumbersome to use, and there's a RPG that really packs a mean punch!!!  The sound is fitting, orchestral type sound track throughout, a more industrial synth driven track would have been more suited.  The Nazi's don't speak German,...but English....hmmm, captions would have been better here.

As far as the naysayers, they aren't new and their arguments aren't new either. If they want a Korean style game heavy in pvp and grinding they can go play Guild Wars 2 in a good six to nine months.In truth, this is the best MMORPG to hit the market since late 2004.

The very beginning of any game is pretty crucial.  A lot of us don't have a ton of time to play games, so we can be turned off pretty quickly and move on to the next game.  The beginning of this game is really a bad representation of the game.  The very first thing you have to do is pretty far removed from shooting Nazi's (which is what I came to do!).  Then then next two or three things are equally unrelated to the typical gameplay and by the time I was able to start shooting at enemies, I was close to giving up.  Don't get me wrong, frustration is certainly part of the whole process.  Otherwise, things would be to easy and become boring quickly.  I just prefer that my frustration be related to typical gameplay.  If I was frustrated about how to pick up ammo or fire my weapon(s) (which I wasn't of course) at least when I got past it, I would now have a necessary skill.&#34;Finding the bailing wire and pliers in the tool cabinet next to the cockpit door and bringing them to the back of the plane to fix a leak&#34; is not what I purchased this game to do.

The sidescrolling platform action is spot on, the graphics truly push the limits of the DS, and the variety of equipment/soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play.As people have said in past reviews, the use of the touch screen feels tacked on. To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen, which can be frustrating if a) you have poor penmenship, or b) are left-handed (such as yours truly) and have to scramble to take the stylus out, switch it to your other hand, and draw the symbol. It's a neat little addition but, again, it didn't really need to be there.Also, the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy, even in the later levels. Don't get me wrong, there are some that are just downright nasty, but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go \"... that's it?\"Overall, this is another great game for the Nintendo DS.

NAUGHTY DOG'S MASTERPIECE!","reviewText":"First, before you read this review go buy a copy of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves NOW! This is the most spectacular, mind blowing, jaw-dropping game I've ever played and I've been playing them since the days of Atari. I'm about three-quarters of the way through the game and I'm still seeing amazing gameplay aspects that makes my jaw drop and ask how in the world did they do that. I really don't know how they got the graphics to look this awesome but they did. The lighting, water effects, character details, weapon details are all the best I've seen in a game. The way light shines off stuff will make you go cross-eyed from staring too long.The voice acting of not just Nate's character, but even the minor characters are top-notch. We're talking Hollywood A-list acting! The comedic lines are put in just the right places at the right times. The gun fire and explosions will immerse you in the game like it's been never done before. The story was fantastically written, as well. This is almost literally like playing a summer Hollywood blockbuster movie! There's so much action going at a frenetic pace that you'll sometimes feel overwhelmed. But that's a very good thing in this case because the use of weapons is a seamless and flawless experience. As easy as the weapons were to use in the first Uncharted they seem even more improved this time around. There are many climatic scenes and climax you will! The train scene will leave you gasping in amazement!!!From what I've read, this Uncharted is at least several hours longer that the first one. Awesome! That seems true seeing as though I'm 75% through Uncharted 2 and the time I've invested in it so far is about the same as what it took me to beat the first one. There's so much goodness to be had in story mode that it's ridiculous. To top it all off, we also get a co-op mode and a multiplayer mode that should add countless hours of fun to the mix. Both of which I've yet to play. There's so much to do you'll be playing this one until the end of the year. Is this going to be Game Of The Year? Well, I think it will come down to this or Call Of Duty 5. My money's on Uncharted 2 winning it. If Uncharted 2 were a painting it would hung in The Louvre because it's a masterpieceThis is the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. A game has never blown me away quite like this one. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10 score or 5 stars out of 5... this is one of those games that only comes along once in a great while and one of those that if you could you'd give it an 11 out of 10 score because it's that freakin' amazing. Highly recommended without hesitation. If you don't like this game you're either nuts or don't like video games!

In this game you'll be be utilizing jetpacks, planes, and even a hang glider to complete several different assignments. You'll get to fly all over the island to do so, and there's even a couple of hidden secrets for those willing to go find them.Graphically this game is on par with Wii graphics. It basically looks like they took Wii Sports Resort and removed those games and basically allowed for fly-overs of the island. You're going to be using a Mii as your character. I do have to say that the 3D does take some time to get used to while you're flying around, but once you get it down it does look good.The sounds are basically just like Wii Sports Resort as well.The controls you'll have to know build as you go through your rankings. You'll have the directional pad (or analog stick) and the A button, later you'll use B, Y and a shoulder button.I have to say that this game definitely a launch title, both in a good and a bad way. The bad way is that this looks like a demo with used pieces to allow for this to be added to the line up. Its good because it definitely feels polished in every mode except for the jetpack levels. Perhaps I just suck at the Jetpack levels but I have to say that the control of your character during those levels does not feel tight. That mode is probably the most trying out of the other modes. The plane does have some later complexity as you upgrade the plane to a jet, and you'll also have to shoot objects. Then there's the hang glider and the need to catch the updrafts so that you don't land too soon. I do kind of wish that on certain levels you could land wherever, but I do understand that the way the levels work is on accuracy, so I guess I can let that pass. By accuracy I mean that you have to aim for the rings, or the balls, or take a picture just right, or land in just the right spot at the right speed. My biggest issue with this game is how I play it. I'm a mover when it comes to this type of game, I want to tilt the system, and angle it in an attempt to make my character do exactly what I want. With the no glasses needed 3D technology, that's the quickest way to give yourself a headache as your picture will quickly go out of focus.If you're looking for a quick game that almost anyone can pick up and play to show off the 3DS then I'd advise getting this game. If you're looking for something a bit more substantial I think you're going to have to continue to play the waiting game until some other titles come out. This game gets a 6.8 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Vanquish is infused with Western shooter's big explosions and lots of shooting fused with Japanese fast paced action and quick controls. Vanquish is like a third person shooter on speed thanks to the ARS suit. Sam Gideon can slide around at super speeds on the ground as well as slow down time during dodges. This allows for very hectic gameplay against robots of all sizes and shapes.The plot is paper thin and only advances at the very end of the game since the middle has absolutely nothing to do with the plot because you're just dealing with in-the-moment problems, but the over arching story is pretty standard affair with Russia trying to take over the world with a giant microwave emitter that destroys San Fransisco. Its nothing to get excited about so just pop in Vanquish expecting fast shooting. The shooting is great thanks to useful weapons than can be upgraded throughout the game with droppable upgrades. Everything is done on the battlefield so there's no menus to fiddle with. I wish more shooters would use this idea so it doesn't draw you away from the action. You get a load-out of three weapons and two different grenades. EMP grenades stun robots and incendiary blow them up. Different weapons range from your standard affair of shotguns, heavy and light machine guns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles etc, but there are a few originals such as the disk launcher, LFE gun that shoots huge blobs of purple energy, and the laser rocket launcher.Thanks to the ARS suit it allows for what would normally be an impossible amount of enemies to kill in a standard shooter, but being able to slide around at fast speeds and slow down time isn't the key to staying alive. If you get shot too much your suit will automatically slow down time and burn up your energy meter. This allows you to kill any immediate danger and get to cover, but if you continue to get shot you will die. The energy meter determines all your special abilities and if you overheat you have to wait for it to cool down. I found this a little annoying especially when you start dying and you can't shut off the use of the auto slow down which will actually cause you to die during boss fights since you can't slide away after its burned up.The best part of the game are the boss fights since you have to shoot weak points and some times this will trigger cinematic QTEs (Quick Time Events) but the biggest fall back for Vanquish is the repetition. Sure there are some different gameplay stuff thrown in like firefights on rail carts, turret sections but I felt the game never truly took advantage of the whole ARS suit system. This is where the typical Japanese game generic atmosphere and aesthetics brings Vanquish down for me.  While everything is responsive and sharp it all feels generic with weapons feeling like they don't pack a punch and just feel like pop guns. There's a good variety of enemies in here, but they are all just robots and you can pretty much use the same tactic on all of them. Boss fights recycle after Act 2, and the environments all look the same after Act 1.The game looks good but it is also generic looking thanks to the typical Japanese art style of sterile white washed environments and copy/paste feeling levels. The characters are the usual stereotypical, cheesy voice acted, empty feeling people that you can't really get attached to or don't make much sense. I want to get attached to the characters but they just feel to cheesy and stereotypical and are completely forgettable. So why should you play Vanquish? The fast paced action is undeniably addictive and 6 hours is just enough to not get too sick of the game without wanting it to just end. On a side note the ending credits are probably the most original I have ever seen in my 19 years of gaming. The developers faces are on asteroids and you shoot them as their names pop up. The more important guys are harder to shoot and the lead designer ends everything as a final boss fight. Kudos to Platinum for making credits more interesting than scrolling text.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I was a great fan of the series that followed and, thus, was very eager to get my hands on this latest installment. In a short sentence: FALLOUT-3 is A DREAM COME TRUE! And now the dream is complete.It is a cRPG game in which the player can alternate between the First and Third person perspective roaming a world comparable in size with OBLIVION. The action has moved from Vault 13 and Southern California to Vault 101 and Washington, D.C. and the story brakes away from the previous bloodlines. However, the atmosphere of the original has been maintained and its scents sharpened: veterans will find it fitting like and old glove - whereas the new gamers are in store for a bag of pleasant surprises.The graphics are wonderful, the guns detailed and the environments highly interactive. Short of a screenshot, imagine what would HalfLife-2 would look if released today. And similar to HL2, FALLOUT-3 does not require an...ubercomputer to run smoothly. Once you see a NPC move though, you understand where the corners were cut.Character customization is carried out in great style using the new and improved PIP-BOY at the beginning. You exit the vault and the harsh reality of a world that barely survived annihilation slaps you on the face. Adapt or perish.The main storyline is there to be followed but FALLOUT-3 offers the greatest number of alternative choices I have ever encountered in a game! There is always a great number of paths to follow in order to achieve any goal - but every choice comes with a consequences tag. This is common feature of most classic cRPGs but in FALLOUT-3 I saw it implemented like never before. If nothing else, this sends replayability through the roof.Side-quests offer little besides distraction and experience points (XP) to be spend on character improvement. XP are gained solely by completing quests, emerging victorious from fights, finding locations, picking locks and hacking terminals - and they are not limited by the action they were earned. Leveling up is based on 7 basic attributes [Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility & Luck - acronym?;)] that, in turn, affect your (13) specific skills. Leveling up used to be capped at Level-20 (increased to 30 by installing the DLCs), as the game designers wanted to encourage replaying the game. However, with this increase, now your character can realize its full potential. Replaying the game is still a joy though.The game is violent and gory but well within tasteful limits. Not so with the language - but it is trade off with realism. In a radioactive world, Sunday-school niceties are bound to go out the window.What deserves a special mention is V.A.T.S. (:Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) which opens new vistas in cRPG design. It is an ingenious system which lets you pause the game and target specific body parts of your opponents. The success of your attack still depends on your skills but the end effect is cinematic and amazing (remember SWORDFISH?).This GOTY edition includes all 5 DLCs released so far: OPERATION-ANCHORAGE, THE PITT, BROKEN STEEL, POINT LOOKOUT and MOTHERSHIP ZETA. Compared to the basic FALLOUT 3, applying the above improves the experience immensely! As mentioned above, since one used to reach the Level 20 cap long before the endgame, increasing this by 10 levels will give you a brand new ballgame.Augmented weapons, new territories, novel foes and unexpected story branching - all for the price of the original game. I own the original game and coveted after these DLCs in the past months, waiting for a complete edition such as this GOTY one. When it became available I jumped at the opportunity to get them all. And did not regret it for a moment.After the nuclear summer of 2008 (with all the Limited-Installation/defective EA releases), this seems like a post-apocalyptic dawn indeed! BETHESDA decided to listen to the gaming community and did NOT cripple this beautiful game with any idiotic DRM scheme. Inputting a serial number and a DVD-check is more than reasonable.The publishers of FALLOUT-3 understand that there is a fine balance between \"protecting the product\" and...\"insulting your own customers\". And they obviously view respect as the two way street that it is - and for this they deserve our support: buy this game, today.Voting with our wallets is the only argument the gaming industry cannot afford to ignore.

Do I turn it upside down, make a precise swing, or flip the entire controller? Not since SSX Blur have precise movements been so important, which is a nice change from the usual \"waggle\" games.Zack and Wiki is a point & click adventure game. If you're a fan of the genre, it's similar to an old Sierra game where your character can die.  While newer adventure games remove all types of death and player punishment, Zack & Wiki embraces it's sadism. Death is around every corner. It adds tensity, making you really *think* your ideas through before you try them. Reasoning out a puzzle is more fun than trial and error, and Zack & Wiki's constant fear of death promotes thinking.What separates Zack & Wiki from the traditional point & clicks is a platformer feel. There are points for finishing quickly, coins to collect, well defined levels, and of course motion controls.If you decide to buy this game, please don't read spoilers or buy a strategy guide - it would ruin the experience. If you're stuck and it takes you a couple days to figure a part out, ask a friend to watch you play. 4 people can use Wiimotes to give you tips and help figure out puzzles - my friend solved the first boss while watching me, and she'd never played the game.Zack & Wiki is a masterpiece.

The graphics are just out of this world because they look so real. When you're sitting in the driver's seat your gloves look real and so does the leather seats and dashboard, you're rear view mirror reflects perfectly, the glass on the windows break in real time and it just looks so amazing. The cars handle great here, despite a floaty feel to them, but that's not necessarily a bad thing either. There are tons of races to do and lots of tracks to race on. The physics in this game are spot on and they don't miss a beat.The game has a damage system so you can check to see what you've done to your car when you pause it and it affects how the car handles as well. The menus are really slick as well since they float and spin are you select things and while the game loads it shows you your stats. There's nothing more than that to say since it's just a straight racer. It's a sim though so Burnout and Need for Speed fans should stay away and go for Sega Rally Revo instead. The only issues I found were the load times can be a bit long, and there are only 46 cars in the game which isn't much for a racer.

{"product_name":"B006KYYOSO","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Ross \"Lil' Ross\"","summary":"This game blows Tekken 6 out in every way.","reviewText":"First off, I am a hardcore Tekken fan.  I have a YouTube page that I run showcasing gameplay from the game.  As you may imagine, I have a certain love for the game that most casual players may not understand.  But fear not, for I will keep this review fair and balanced.  I will be looking at things from the perspective of a player like myself, and a casual fan.  Is this game worth it?  Read on to find out.Tekken 6 was a good game...good...but not awesome.  As a fan of this series from Tekken 1, Tekken 6 missed the ball in a lot of areas presentation wise.  This game completely makes up for that.  There is a HUGE roster of characters and more coming for FREE as future DLC.  Gameplay wise, I do not think there will be anyone who will complain of a lack of variety in the cast.  The graphics are beautiful and far surpass the last game.  The game looks great with the motion blur effect, but truly comes through in high resolution greatness with the effect disabled.  Everything looks crisp, clean, and COLORFUL.  Tekken 6 was so drab and dark looking.  The colors pop from the screen in this game and I love it.  The music is SO much better than Tekken 6 as well.  A great standard soundtrack is present, but we now also have the TEKKEN TUNES feature which allows the player to replace the music in any stage with custom songs from the hard drive.  Also, there is a mini store where tunes from the previous games will be available for purchase in the future.  This is the type of DLC that I have no problem paying for.  It is an added bonus and doesn't feel like some lame attempt to bleed my wallet dry.  Other companies should take note.The gameplay is a perfect blend of the things Tekken 6 incorporated combined with the tag elements from Tag 1.  This game is far deeper than Tag 1 was, however.  Combos can be created using any series of commands you can imagine.  Amazingly, no one character feels truly superior than the rest.  It is amazing how balanced this game is when you consider the huge roster and the amount of insane combos that can be executed.  If you lose a match in Tekken, you can generally blame it on your lack of experience with match-ups and your character's abilities.  This is why Tekken will always be better than 2D games in my opinion.  There are no fireballs and dragon punches to hold your hand here.  It all comes down to KNOWLEDGE.The online mode is SMOOTH AS SILK compared to the abomination that was Tekken 6.  It feels as though I am playing offline.  There is also a feature to set the rank level and connection level of potential opponents.  You are also shown their disconnect rates and given the option to decline the match before it begins...an option that was in Tekken 5, but strangely removed from Tekken 6.  Load times are a little slow, however, even with the HUGE 7.5 gig mandatory install.There is no real fancy story mode here or side games thrown in such as Tekken Bowl or Tekken Force which honestly does not bother me at all.  I was never really a fan of those mini-games.  There is, however, a training mode called fight lab which attempts to teach the basics of gameplay in a unique manner.  However, this mode is short and, as an experienced player, I felt that it did little to actually teach anything of relevance besides the most basic of movement and attack techniques.  I was expecting a much deeper experience based on previews.  Do not expect to become an expert from this mode.  Only hours of practice will get you to that point.The game also incorporates an online pass.  Many have complained about this, but this is one area where I do side with the developers.  Buying the game (or any game) used is fine, but I do feel that they deserve some form of compensation for the years they put in to make this wonderful product.  They are giving us DLC for free.  If you buy the game used they do not see anything for the work they put in.  In my opinion, the least you could do is spend a few bucks for the online code.  Especially when the team behind the game cares as much about the product as the Tekken team does.So what's my final rating?-For the HARDCORE FAN, this is a must buy.  This is the best Tekken game we've had in a few years now and will be the standard for years to come.  10/10.-For the CASUAL PLAYER-7/10.  You may have a little fun mashing through arcade mode for a few hours and playing with friends, but if you have no intention of dedicating yourself to the game, online will be hell and you will never truly master a character or appreciate the minute details of the combat.  There is no reason to pay full price for it...but no reason to not check it out if you like fighting games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2012"}

In fact, I think I cancelled & renewed holds 3 different times on this game out of indecision and finally decided close to release \"Yes...I am going to get this one.\"  I typically a lot myself about one brand new game a month and there was honestly not much else out there that I could see for that month that I wanted, so I said screw it and bought the game.The Loves:  I found the game to be actually pretty comical and fun to play.  I mean, what could be better than a sexy cheerleader slicing up a bunch of zombies with her decapitated head of a boyfriend, all the while popping quirky little jokes poking fun at zombies and high school antics & whatnot?  I also enjoy buying upgrades and other cool stuff in action/adventure games such as this too, so that's a plus.  Overall, I found myself to have rather enjoyed this game.The Gripes:  Sure, the graphics overall aren't top of the line, but that's no biggie to me...they're good enough.  My only main gripes really is that sometimes it got a bit frustrating, though not so much so that I couldn't surpass it, and the length...each level only took about an hour to complete, and since there are only like 6 levels or whatever, that makes for a pretty short game.  I did enjoy the ride though.  Replay value is moderate...I will probably trade this in though on something else, maybe Lego Batman.  It just didn't hold my interest enough to have any sort of collection or replay value to it.The Warning:  Parents, there are a lot of games they say are not suitable for kids or teenagers that they still play and aren't too bad...maybe mainly for just violence/gore or whatever...but this one really is not suitable for kids & younger teens.  There is quite a bit of vulgar language and sexual stuff in this game, so wise up and don't let them play this game.  Otherwise gamers, I say at least try it out...some of you may enjoy it more than I did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

Then there's Seymour, his voice sounds like Peewee Herman on steroids, and his hair style was bizare.2.  I was a little disapointed with the plot twists, or lack thereof.

The graphics on this game are absolutely phenominal, bright, clear and crisp.  The music isnt too bad either.  This game has a really good storyline, much better than the one for FF12.  Also, the battle system is very easy to use, you can bring in and out characters as you wish, in order to keep them from dying andto make surer everyone gets exp.On the negative side, I do not like the level up system of this game.  I like that in FF12 you can level up like normal, you know what level you are at, and all of your stats change with each level up.  With this game, you have to choose your priorities and pick what level up you want if you want to increase your speed, luck, magic ect.  This part I absolutely hate, I want that done for me.  I am thankful that the license system from FF12 was not used in this game as that was a real nightmare (Come on dont make me get a wepons license, I wanna just pick up and ax and just start hacking, I dont want to wait to be allowed to use it!)The story line in this game is great, I'm not going to go into details on it, becuase I am only about 1/2 way through the game, so I really dont know it, wiki it if you want.  The one thing I liked about FF12 that i dont about FF10 is that in 12 you can skip the cutscenes.. I know, the fanboys are going to get mad that i wanna skip the story, vut sometimes I have stuff to do and I am stuck in the middle of a 15 minute cutscene.. Please, WTF!Lastly the characters in this game are absolutely awesome.  I think it is unfortunate that Tidus, who is the main character in this one is such a whiney baby.  Go figure, the main character is the crappiest character in the game!  Lulu & Yuna are fantastic sorcerers, youw ill be using them constantly, but dont even think of using their attack, Wakka is kind of annoying, but his dark and sleep spells are necessary, and his \"rulebreaker\" (poison weapon) is fantastic.  Auron and Khimari are great especially for breaking through armored creatures).  Really, I have become spoiled I use Lulu for everything since her black magic attacks are more powerful than anyone else's crummy weapons... My only complaint about Yuna, while her healing spells are a real savior, I wish the Guardians were stronger, I would rather use Lulu than a guardian.Definately go out and buy this game, you will love it.

All the challenges of the popular sport combined with the weird, wacky fun of Mario's world come together, for laughs and thrills.","reviewerName":"Fred \"From http://fredsite.blogspot.com/\"","summary":"Mario Baseball, safe or out?","reviewText":"Mario Baseball is fortunately safe but only because it was a tie.  Sure it has all the elements a good game needs but some of the stuff in here is so annoying.  It has all the main Mario characters with some side ones such as Goomba, Paratroopa, and a lot of other ones.  The hitting system has no targeting system, which means that all you have to care about is the timing and where the batter is standing.  The pitcher only controls the speed of the ball and where it goes.  The game has all kinds of wacky things such as Chain Chomps in the fields, power shots for fielding and batting such as sending a fireball across the field or pitching a curving bananna across home plate.  The baserunning seems like crap at first but it actually works to the extent that you can have your players run and steal when you want them to.  Pitching is kind of hard at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll hear the umpire saying \"Strike, out!\" all the time.  Each player has unique abilities in the field such as quick reflexes or making a spectacular diving play.  Fielding is so annoying that I just turned it to auto so the comps can do it all for me.  Multi-player is only two player for the exhibition but you can do 4 people in mini-games or in toy field.  Multi-player in exhibition isn't that fun because it's a race to see who can choose all the good players first such as Bowser who can easily get a homerun every time he hits.  They should have a turn based choosing system where one person chooses a guy then the next person chooses a guy and so on and so forth.  This has become so bothersome that me and my brother have designated characters(Like he gets Mario and I get Luigi) when we play against each other.  Exhibition is a regular baseball game(You can change all sorts of options such as innings,mercy,who hits first, and more) with Chain Chomps and Pirahna plants in the field which can turn a single into a double or triple and possibly even a home run.  Challenge is probably the best thing in this game.  You choose a team captain who has preselected team members who fit in that team caaptain's world.  Such as Yoshi having Shy guys and Mario having Piantas.  You play through all the other teams to get ready for the showdown with Bowser.  Each game is 3 innings(Except for Bowser's which is 5 innings) and you get people on the other team if you impress them such as finishing the inning with the enemy team using only 3 batters or just getting a plain hit.  You can play mini-games along the way to get coins to buy items like the power bat which makes you hit farther.  Your players can improve along the way and you can unlock people for exhibition mode if you beat certain difficulties in challenge.  Toy field is where each player tries to get the most coins through fielding, batting, and pitching.  I don't do this mode that much because the enemies know where the ball is going to go before the batter even hits it while you sit there thinking about where the stupid ball is going to go next.  There are a bunch of mini-games from a version of a home run derby to a baserunning coin collector game, each with four difficulties and their own high scores.  Practice is a great way to increase your skills with things such as free batting, pitching, fielding, or if you're just wondering how to do stuff in the game.  Everything from bunting the ball to throwing a super charge pitch.  And you can look at records of exhibition games, challenge, and all the other game modes.  Some of the later difficulties such as the last one are kind of rigged so there's no point in even facing them.  Even though there are only six fields to play on, this game never seems to get boring (Unless you play like 10 hours a day).  Even though it has bad points, it's a great game and a must have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2005"}

I was your \"gamer of the masses\" playing mostly Halo and Call of Duty games.  The over abundance of those games has left a bad taste in my mouth so I went out in search of a game I can stick with for MANY hours and not get tired of, or really finish.  My store manager (I work at Game Stop) told me about Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age.  Because Dragon Age 2 was coming out sooner than Elder Scrolls Skyrim, I bought the first Dragon Age Ultimate Edition and quickly fell in love.  The only complaint I had with the first game was the map in the upper corner with your waypoint.  This game has a steady one which makes it easier for me to navigate.  Other than that, no complaints.  So, now on to this one.The game is beautiful.  The graphics aren't the most refined Blu Ray graphics you'd expect from 2011, but everything else makes up for it.  The soundtrack is superb.  Every clink of the swords to the rustling of dirt is in this game bringing a realistic and exciting world to life.  The gameplay and story are where the highlights come from.  From the first scene to the middle (where I am now) it is non stop action and exploration of new places.Developers didn't make this one as easy as I thought, and I like that.  So being new to RPG style games, I am very impressed with the Dragon Age series and feel I spent the money correctly on this title.  Peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"chadwick","summary":"A must have for Halo fans","reviewText":"Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary is a great throwback to the first Halo game for the original Xbox. This game is an updated, high-definition version of that very game; all game elements, story, and levels remain unchanged, but graphics and music have been remastered. The updated graphics and new, orchestral music are awesome to experience, especially if you owned and played the original Halo like I did. The game even features a function to change the gameplay to the old graphics and music while in game (just press the Back button). The multiplayer in the game is fun as well, although it is not as heavily trafficked as newer titles like Halo 4. If you played the original Halo on the original Xbox, this game is a must-have. Even if you haven't played the original, it is still a great installment in the Halo game franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2014"}

Fernandez","summary":"The NEW Racing Standard","reviewText":"Up until this point, I had always considered Gran Turismo the best racing game on the market. Forza 2 has taken the crown.There are alot of features I like about this game, I'll limit them to five:- Simple controls- Damage system (something Gran Turismo has never had)- Brilliant UI- Online features (career, auction house, car gifting)- Car customizationCurrently, I only have two minor issues with the game. One, it's pretty easy to upgrade your car to A Class or S Class after a few races while the computer continues to race D/C Classes. The other issue is that the tracks themselves are a little bland (of course, this is a tradeoff in order to create highly detailed car models and run at 60 fps).Buy this game. Then buy a GTI and upgrade it to 700HP. Good stuff.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2007"}

Gameplay is simple, you shoot, garrote, what a hitman does, and the graphics are good, not the best, and it looks a lot better during cutscenes, not so much during gameplay. I recommend renting and beating it, because contracts mode sucks, and replayability is small.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"Jamie Ratliff","summary":"Bad Company = Loads Of Fun Destruction","reviewText":"This game really lives up to the hype, both in gameplay and just plain fun. If you are expecting COD4, you may be disappointed because it's a bit different. But, if you want to have a great time fighting the enemy, blowing stuff up, destroying buildings & vehicles, then you will love Battlefield Bad Company. The game starts with you being assigned to B Company, with 3 other rejects. The dialogue throughout the game is pretty amusing at times, and you find you actually like the characters. I really enjoyed being able to grab any vehicle and drive it, and then destruction value is nothing short of awesome. You have to love a game that allows you to blowup just about anything. Overall, if you are looking for a serious war style game, Bad Company may not be it, but if you just want to have an amazingly good time, then this title is simply a must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2008"}

Despite the inferior graphics,compared to MW and MW2 I thought this might be a decent game.  The story started out pretty good.  When I got to level 6 (The Defector) a problem arose.  Toward the end of the level the screen went black (right after I was helping a soldier push in a door). I still had sound, but it was as if the lights went out in the building I was trying to enter.  Since you can't reload a checkpoint in this game (another problem) I had to restart the level.  The same thing happened again. I gave up after that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}
