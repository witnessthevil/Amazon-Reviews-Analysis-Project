The bog-standard detective work, fun though it is, is punctuated judiciously by action sequences including car chases, pursuing suspects on foot, climbing around inaccessible areas, puzzle-solving and, of course, shoot-outs.Between cases, you either get a flashback to Phelps' war experiences in Japan or a glimpse into his off-duty life; both those elements end up feeding back into the overarching storyline. The oeuvres of Shelley and even anarchist author Piotr Kropotkin are fed into the mix. Newspapers that you find when hunting for clues trigger yet another backstory (this time involving ongoing LA skullduggery), which yet again intersects with the main storyline in the game's later stages.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play.

I had seen it on the shelves of numerous videogame shops, but it never really stood out to me as a game I would like to play, but boy was I wrong.  I don't even like puzzle games, but this was good.  It was very good.  It was a short play... only about 6 and a half hours to complete, but it was well worth it.For its time, it is excellently crafted.  Absolutely stunning.  The AI is simple, yet effective.  The sound is little, and the little voice that is heard adds the dash of spice to the emotions of the game.  It is quite a sad game...Looking back on the graphics, as a first generation Playstation 2 game, it was absolutely beautiful.  The sun glare was clean, the grass looked grassy, and tree leaves swayed in the wind.  One part in particular stood out to me, and that was the Windmill.  If you ever get this game (which you should...it is really cheap now), work your way to the windmill.  The little pond that is next to it is absolutely amazing.  The water bends the light around the ripples as Ico swims in it, and the reflection of the windmill is also there.  So many games don't use reflections still, even in simple places like these.  But this scene is just beautiful.The gameplay is basic and very quiet.  There is little music in the game, but this is actually a good thing.  With music, the game wouldn't be as enclosed as it is.I'm having a hard time putting into words what this game is worth.  Shamefully, it was away underrated and virtually unplayed.  Pick up this game and try it for yourself.  It is very unique.I don't know if you keep up with upcoming releases, but the same team that made this game is coming out with a similar title called Wanda and the Colossus.  Strange title,yes?  Anywho, if this game seems interesting.  Play Ico first and get a feel for what you might encounter in Wanda and teh Colossus.  I can assure you that you will have a good time.  The team that made Ico did a fabulous job on their first game, and I know that with their upcoming title, things will only get better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2005"}

I recently did a review of GRAW 2 and complained about this exact same issue. Nonetheless R6V2 is a great tactical shooter and there is more good going for it than bad. Everyone's played the first game so I'll leave out what you already know. Some great new features is the new sprint. While I didn't use this much it's great for running down long hallways to get to where you need too.There are some new guns (I don't know what's new but I know there's new guns) and the multiplayer is as awesome as ever. Another new feature is the \"Terrorist Hunt\" mode in which you pick your level and hunt down all the terrorist either by yourself or cooperatively. The story is pretty good as well. You have to fight the Mexican terrorists from destroying and terrorizing Vegas while also hunting down a traitor among the Rainbows. The graphics are very disappointing. For using the Unreal 3 engine you think the graphics would blow you away but they are very weak. The game isn't much to look at, but you just play for the easy pick up and play tactical greatness. The game has a decent length (coming in at about 8 hours) and has a highly unbalanced difficulty which sucks since you'll try doing the same areas until your fingers bleed.If you liked Vegas 1 you'll love Vegas 2 but this game is only for R6 fans.

{"product_name":"B006MBZZSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"Subtraction by addition","reviewText":"I have to confess that the original Hyperdimension Neptunia caught me by surprise. While the game was pretty bare bones and low budget, the writers and developers had a good plan laid out. Why not gently tweak the game industry itself, rather than put out another bland, turgid JRPG with the same cliches that have been omnipresent for the last 25 years? HDN didn't always work, but there was enough about it to enjoy for the 50 or so hours that JRPGS now command. It was often humorous to meet characters from other franchises (and even systems) and see how they interacted with the personified versions of the main game systems. Often, it failed to be as funny as it thought it was (a common problem with \"Japanese Happy Fun Time!\" video games), but it did enough to justify a playthrough. So, what a shame it is that Hyperdimension Neptunia: Mk 2 fails so miserably to capture that spirit, making Hyperdimension Neptunia yet another in a long line of Pyrrhic victories for the JRPG this generation.Is Mk. 2 better? I guess that depends on your definition. The graphics are better. The dungeons are more varied. Battle is more involved. There's more paedophilic references. If that's your cup of tea, you're in the right place. Unfortunately, for me, the game removed the one thing that made the original Neptunia enjoyable: the tweaking of the industry.Supposedly, whereas the first Neptunia was about the console wars, this is meant to satire the handheld wars. I know this...because I read another review on Amazon. Honestly, I would have never guessed this if I wasn't told Yes, the main character has the name \"Nepgear\", which apparently harkens back to the (horrible) Game Gear of years ago. And yes, the world of Microsoft (Leanbox) doesn't have a junior girl, because MS doesn't have a handheld system. That's the joke. Nothing else really makes any sense after that. Lowee (the Nintendo world) has two very young girls personifying their handheld. Are there 2 because Nintendo has released both the Gameboy and the DS? But - why are they twins? Shouldn't they be older than any of the other junior personifications? And given the wild success of Nintendo over Sony and Sega, shouldn't they be a LOT more powerful?The fact is, little thought was put into any sort of satire of the industry, because apparently, this game decided that the characters were more important than, well, the entire purpose of the original game. What a shame. The only things they keep are the personifications themselves and the patently unfunny names of the planets (Leanbox? Lastation? That's not terribly funny).And honestly, once you fail to be impressed with the premise, the small improvements do nothing to soften the blow. While this game is more sophisticated than its predecessor, that's akin to saying that the original calculator is more sophisticated than the abacus. The game is still light years behind any of its contemporaries, and you probably have to go back 3 generations before you find battle systems more primitive than the ones in this game.So, lousy premise, archaic battle system, colorful but extremely-dated graphics...hmmm, what redeems this? Not much. There are multiple endings, but it's hard to care about them. One ending is so out of place that it makes me wonder what the developers were thinking. The game is rated M, and the rating is well-deserved. Outright (and tasteless) paedophilia is on display at times. Battle is easy, but a slog. The \"improvements\" actually do more to hamper playability. Outside of hunting for endings, the postgame is pretty much grinding for trophies (including the grammatically-incorrect \"Freshly Grinded Girls\", which forces you to get your characters to level 99, despite the fact that you can do pretty much everything in the game at around level 65, if memory serves), and battling in an arena against monsters that apparently didn't make the cut in the game.It's not the unplayable mess than many NIS-published games have been this generation, but it's hardly amazing. Fanboys and paedophiles only need apply.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2014"}

The scientist, Dr. Aiden Krone, steals the Alpha version of an experimental time travelling suit in order to reach the past and create his future.  Your character is given the Beta suit which is a military prototype to aid you in pursuing Dr. Krone.  TimeShift's story isn't its strongpoint, the game play is.  With your Beta suit you're able to slow, reverse and stop time while fighting, shooting and driving.  A concept and tactic that you'll learn to master very early on in order to successfully progress through the game.  TimeShift shines in abundance regarding this aspect creating an experience that is extremely exciting and enjoyable.  Here are my thoughts on this action filled FPS;Pros+ Great graphics overall with some really stunning and scenic backdrops.+ Amazingly well done time slow/reverse/stop game mechanics.  Combining these with various tactics during combat was what made the game amazingly fun.  It allowed for some fantastic finesse kills (melee, weapon theft, multiple head shots etc.).+ Nice balance of foot, vehicle and turret combat.  It wasn't as good as Halo, but it was a respectable effort.+ All of the weapons/guns had a great look, sound and feel.+ Some enemies could also shift time making for some very challenging, tricky and interesting firefights.+ Use of the time manipulation skill was essential to succeed in many parts of the game.+ Crossbow was by far the most useful weapon in the game.  It was also the most over powered (also a Con, see below).  Once I found it, I barely used any other weapons unless I was out of ammo.+ Plentiful ammo+ Save anywhere, anytime.+ Extremely affordable.Cons- Vague and easily forgettable storyline.- Time manipulation mechanic wasn't used to its full potential for the puzzle aspects of the game.- Game still retained a bit of its steam punk (not really a fan of the genre) look and feel even after the overhaul.  I remember playing an early demo which looked drastically different and much worse than the final game.- 3 gun carrying limit.- Crossbow, while extremely fun was vastly over-powered and simply made the game way too easy at points.- Standard on the rails shooter, not many environment exploration options.- Would have liked to see a 3rd person view option for play.  If for any reason, just to see how cool I looked in my suit!Timeshift really surprised me.  I was expecting a pretty standard FPS like so many games these days of the genre.  As I was playing the hours flew by and the game play never got old.  As I mentioned earlier the successful implementation of the time manipulation elements where were the game really shined.  These days, there's definitely no shortage of FPS games in the market, but TimeShift is a worthy installment of the genre.  With the incredibly low price of the game now, there's absolutely no reason not to give this game a try.  Hopefully you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2010"}

C. Obraztsov","summary":"Totally underrated","reviewText":"Looking for a game to play before GTA V comes out?  Well, you found it.  First of all - Square Enix made this game, which is a good sign.  Square Enix generally produces very high quality games and puts 110% effort into what they do.  They are also the creators of the Final Fantasy franchise.  What I like about Sleeping Dogs is that it took what GTA did and improved on a lot of things.  It's very, very similar, but that's not a bad thing.  I've beaten GTA twice and have 95% of trophies and have gone through SD once, so I think I can give a good comparison.What's similar?  It's open sandbox like GTA, so you can do all the things you'd expect like hijacking cars, beating up/killing whoever you want, getting chased by the cops, tons of side missions and random encounters, special \"massages,\" taking taxis, listening to different radio stations, buying food to regenerate health, etc. etc.  That part is very similar and doesn't deviate too much.  The map on the bottom left is also very similar.  You can use your cellphone like in GTA, but I personally think SD has made their cellphone a bit more sleek.  One of the things I also really like about SD is when you are driving to a mission and it's marked on your map, the road points to you where to go, so you aren't staring at the map and crashing into things.  That's pretty neat.One of the annoying things about GTA is that it took forever to start earning money, but when you did it was a TON and you couldn't spend it on anything.  In SD you can buy all sorts of swagger like clothes and cars.  It also doesn't take ages to load from outfit to outfit, which was extremely annoying in GTA.  Another improvement.Storyline wise it's a little bit different, because Shei Wen is an undercover cop, not a full-blown criminal.  However, he's not a totally clean cop (some depends on you) and is involved in a lot of morally ambiguous storylines.  That's what happens when you're this undercover cop who is part of the Triad and become close to some of the people in it, at least in this world.  You can still do whatever the heck you want, really.  It will just hurt your \"cop ranking.\"That's another cool thing about this game.  You can get EXP from Triad, \"Face,\" and Cop actions, which is pretty neat.  You can unlock special skills and wear special items depending on what you level up.  GTA is completely missing an EXP system, so this is something neat and very \"Square Enix\" like.  I appreciate how they added some RPG elements into it to make it more exciting.Also, there is a noticeable lack of guns in this game and a focus on martial arts.  The game says it's because it is more difficult to get guns in Hong Kong.  Yes, that is true.  You still use guns, but they are less prevalent than GTA and the kung fu system is really awesome.  You feel like a really ninja when you play this game and get good at fighting.  You can do special moves and also \"environmental\" moves, which is when you take someone and do something quite sick to them, like hanging them from a meat hook or throwing them in a furnace.  It's pretty gruesome and like Manhunt or something.Music = awesome.  Square Enix is really well known for having great soundtracks, and this is no exception.  Some of the music is just downright beautiful.  You can change radio stations just like in GTA, except obviously, most music has an east side feel to it.  Graphics?  Nothing groundbreaking, but very similar to GTA, so not so bad.I honestly don't know why this game is so underrated.  It's on par with GTA, if not better.  I guess everyone is so pumped up about GTA V that this has just gone under the radar.  But it's seriously really, really good, and I've played almost all of the GTAs.  Definitely get this!UPDATE:  One disappointing thing about this game is the ending - not the storyline, but the things you can do after the ending.  You can still do sidequests and stuff, but unlike GTA, you can't talk to your friends anymore or go out with them, hang out with girls, build relationships, etc.  That is kind of lame ;(  They could have easily made interacting with characters a lot more in-depth, and I kind of expected that from a developer like Square Enix.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2012"}

Sadly after finishing the game my conclusion is that Brutal Legend is more hype than substance and more filler than unforgettable experience.There is undoubtedly some fun to be had in this game. Brutal Legend is and odd mixture of open-world exploration coupled with Real Time Strategy elements known as \"stage battles\". The voice work headed by Jack Black is top-notch. As is the heavy metal soundtrack. I'm a bit torn whether to categorize the graphics as merely passable or the stuff of last-generation. For sure the graphics are nothing revolutionary. Though the art-style itself is great and the world of Brutal Legend is imaginative.Unfortunately the curious choices by Schafer & company to make Brutal Legend an open-world game ultimately harm the game more than adding to it. So much of this title is filler. Pointless side-quests that have you driving all over the world map to do a certain chore. The main storyline itself can probably be completed in 4-5 hours so I suspect the side-quests are mainly included to pad the game a bit.Another curious element are the stage battles. These are RTS battles where you must build up and army of various units to attack an opposing army. The goal is to ultimately destroy the other army's stage itself. To say that these battles are out of place is an understatement. RTS games have never really found a comfortable home on consoles for a reason - mainly the control interface. Brutal Legend's RTS battles are no exception. The battles are awkward thanks to clumsy controls and a sluggish camera. The disjointed and unbalanced armies add to the frustration. Unfortunately there are several of these battles scattered around the storyline.I was really hoping for a story driven, stylized game in Brutal Legend - the types of games Tim Schafer is known for. Unfortunately what I got was a game that would be more suitable in 2004 than in 2009. The tired open-world formula just doesn't work well here at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

They look fantastic, so no complaints from me.Music (score 10/10): The music is just phenomenal.  There are some really beautiful pieces of music here (\"The Resurrection\" and \"Beach of Nothingness\" come to mind).  There isn't a single track in this game that sounds out of place or grates on the ear.  You may even want to go buy the soundtrack!  The voice acting is extremely good too.  So, the music section gets a perfect score from me!Characters (score 10/10): Playing more modern games has really made me come to appreciate how important having likable characters is (I'm not going to name any names, but let's just say that certain more recent games may have failed on this account).  Anyway, out of all our main protagonists (Shion, Ziggy, Momo, Jr., chaos, KOS-MOS), everyone is likable, has a well-developed personality, and (with the exception of chaos, perhaps) has a well-explained backstory.  I really couldn't ask for much better in terms of protagonists.  As for the villains, they are awesome as well.  In fact, Albedo has got to be one of the creepiest villains I've ever encountered in an RPG - TO THIS DAY!  I'm not going to spoil that one famous scene he's in, but let's just say that it's really freaky...Story (score 10/10): Man is this story awesome.  It's really unique to anything you'd expect to encounter in an RPG from this time period since it's actually set in space.  I'm not going to spoil much, but let's just say that it's got spaceships, and robots, and aliens, and Nietzschean existentialist influence, and all-around awesomeness!  It's also very heart-wrenching at times, and at other times, very disturbing.  This story certainly touches on a lot of mature subject matter (cannibalism, racism, meaning of personhood, etc.), and if you've taken a course on Existentialism like I have, you'll find the Nietzschean influence to be fascinating.  The only thing is that while the story has a nice ending and feels decently satisfying, it's obviously not over yet.  Good thing there are two sequels!Battle System (score 9/10): The battle system is turn-based, but slightly different from your average turn-based systems where you have an \"attack\" command, \"defend, item, magic\", etc.  In this game, you assign various attack moves to the Square and Triangle buttons (special moves are assigned the O button).  You have AP (action points?) which refill some every round.  Each move uses a certain amount of AP and... you see where this is going.  Anyone familiar with RPGs will be able to get the hang of this in no time.  Well, what else to say?  You get Tech points from winning battles and you can use these to power up your moves (make them stronger or faster), which is all well and good.  There are also robot vehicles you can pilot called A.G.W.S., but I found that they're not too useful since you can't heal in them - you're much better off fighting in your usual human form.  As for your human characters, the only party member who's kind of worthless is Momo, since she's really a lot physically weaker than the others.  Oh well, at least everyone else gives you a good variety of choices.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Haters of random battles will be pleased with this game, since there are no random battles!  You can see all the enemies on-screen before the chase you down and attack you.  I don't really mind random battles, but I like this system too.  Unfortunately, haters of long cutscenes will be really irritated here - this game has the longest and most frequent cutscenes of any game I've ever played.  This didn't bother me in the slightest since I like heavy story development (and no, I don't care whether or not you think this makes me less of a \"true\" gamer or whatever).  Anyway, if long cutscenes are your pet peeve, you might want to stay away from this game.  As for the rest of gameplay, I have no complaints - well, except for the button layout.  The O button selects things and the X button cancels.  It's backwards to most other PS2 games, and it can take some getting used to.  Other than that, though, no complaints.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  This is a fantastic game for RPG enthusiasts, but only if you don't mind long cutscenes.  Also, if you have any interest whatsoever in philosophy and also happen to be a gamer, this is the game for you!  I'd definitely recommend it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000099T2G","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"One of the best PS2 games ever!","reviewText":"The PS2 has a lot of great games; and a lot of obscure titles as well. Chances are if you're looking for PS2 games, you're bound to stumble upon a game you've never heard of altogether.And while I'm certain many people have played this game, it almost makes me want to kick myself in the head for not knowing this game existed.Enter- Rise to Honor for the PS2.What a game!This game gives you control over Martial Artist Jet Li who's aptly named Kit Yun in ROH. This game is totally reminiscent of John Woo's Stranglehold for the 360; except it features hand-to-hand combat, gunplay and some nifty quick time events.The first thing I noticed about the game would be the life-like appearance of Jet Li. In fact, he looks exactly like himself only in 3D.Graphically speaking, this game supports progressive scanning, but the very first level looked really \"dusty\", while every other level looked just fine. The graphics are pretty smooth and \"jaggies\" aren't as noticeable here as is the case with many PS2 games. The backgrounds weren't particularly imaginative; ranging from back alleys to rooftops or bars. However, the fact that most of the backgrounds are interactive or destructible was a plus in my book. I really liked the slow-motion camera cuts when you pull off a combo or perhaps toss a chair in an enemy's face. The close ups are smooth and look fantastic. While playing, I'd have to say that I haven't encountered any framerate issues or slowdown.But the one part this game was lacking in at times would be the sound. I loved the voice acting (which actually features Jet Li's voice) and tossing someone into a window sounds awesome, but the sound effects used for punching and kicking seemed weak, lacking dynamics altogether. Still, for the most part, the sound in this game is pretty good. Music is kept to a minimal which is another problem being that at times some cutscenes sounded a little too quiet for comfort.With that said, this doesn't say anything against the gameplay.Rise to Honor is a beat em up, with some on-rails platforming elements and quick time events that progresses the in-game story in the tradition of a 70's kung fu movie; but with some modern twists thrown in. Namely, some sections in which you'll use a gun.The combat is handled by an innovative but satisfying analog control which replaces face buttons. In fact, you won't be using the face buttons at all. Instead, you're given a block button that's mapped to R1, adrenaline which is mapped to L1 and the right analog stick takes care of all the hand to hand fighting while R2 is simply used for shooting. The control scheme may not be ideal for hack and slash/platforming enthusiasts, but it feels quite comfortable considering all the combinations you're able to pull off with such a simplistic control scheme.Rise to Honor also tosses in \"interactivity\" which is along the lines of being able to grab weapons such as chairs, garbage cans, lobsters amongst other background goodies and use them against enemies. This comes in handy considering Rise of Honor tosses the usual odds of 6 on 1 at you. The problem with this is while the enemies do attack you, there are times they'll simply stand and wait to be attacked, while other times enemies will pull off flashy kicks or martial arts katas that rival your in-game character's moves.Still, I can't deny the fact that this game is quite a charming offering, especially for fans of martial arts movies. It seems the gaming world offers so little in this genre and unfortunately, Rise to Honor will stand as a unique example of innovative gaming though perhaps the last of it's kind.There are plenty of unlockables ranging from concept art to \"the making of\" and so on.Rise to Honor is definitely worth the buy for any PS2 fan or perhaps someone who wasn't familiar with the PS2 last gen would definitely find this game ideal.One of the best games on the PS2; period.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2012"}

In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Fred \"From http://fredsite.blogspot.com/\"","summary":"Yoshi rocks, period.","reviewText":"Fred's Review:9/10 starsEveryone has a hero, who's your hero?

I run a projector so the light I have is minimal. The chat feature on PS3 sets a white background and this (on a 100\" screen) is more than adequate to illuminate me on my old sofa.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Platinum Drake!","reviewText":"What a terrific game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is. Great visuals. Action. Suspense. Scares. Twists...everything that you could ask for in a third person action shooter. I liked Uncharted 3 as much as the first, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune...and that's saying a lot!Like the first two in the series, in Uncharted 3 you'll have to battle your way through obstacles, puzzles and worst of all hordes and hordes of bad guys. But unlike Uncharted 2 where the battles against the bad guys seemed redundant halfway through the game, somehow Uncharted 3 kept every battle fresh and unique.My only gripe--and a very small gripe--with Uncharted 3 was that while almost every battle was against enemies that were 100% human, a lot seemed virtually bulletproof and the armored guys pretty much were bulletproof. Not that I had much of a problem getting through most of them, but it was a little silly having to empty a clip into a guy--even after knocking off his bulletproof helmet--to take him down. Even more silly was hitting a guy with a grenade or grenade launcher only to see him stand back up or have a little of his armor fall off. Some of the seemingly invincible human adversaries were just kooky.But like I said, that was a very small gripe. The pros so far outweighed the single con of this game that I'd be hard-pressed to suggest that there was a better game released in 2011 than Uncharted 3. The game excelled at anything in a game that I've ever seen in beautiful, realistic surroundings and graphics...you never get tired of looking at this game.Most areas require you to clear the enemies out before you can get through, but there were one or two areas where you're better off just running for the exit; and the only way to figure out which way is which is by trial and error...you don't get a map. But not to worry...if the game senses that you're lost it encourages you to press the D-pad for a hint.There are 100 hidden treasures that you can try to find and collect along your way marked by flashes of light, and a plethora of weapons and ammo are also marked by flashes of light so the treasures (deliberately) are not always easy to spot (and not necessary to collect to get through the game any easier).I played on Normal and on Crushing (got my first Platinum Trophy!!!). You get some pretty effective weapons that get you through the levels, and the amount of ammo you find along the way is no different no matter what you set the game's difficulty to. You're allowed to carry 2 weapons at a time plus grenades, but you're restricted to a side arm and one heavier gun.Uncharted 3 adds a LOT more hand-to-hand combat. The Hand-to-hand combat is usually pretty easy and you'll only need to master 3 button commands plus a couple of stealth moves. Heed this advice: when you hear Drake say something like, \"We'll need to do this quietly,\" you'd better use stealth or you're in for some firefights that will have you cussing, dying and starting the checkpoint over.You'll also of course need to navigate yourself through some treacherous territory and perform some death defying acts and escapes (and you certainly won't defy death every time). But when you're not in a firefight or being chased by some vicious enemy, take the time to stop and rotate the camera to appreciate the detail that has been put into the graphics in some of the levels. There's some really amazing, real looking terrain.Oh, and almost forgot, as far as the online and co-op aspects go...I've become kind of a story mode / campaigner gamer. Uncharted 3 has multiplayer and co-op modes, but the co-op mode is for missions designed exclusively for co-op...not the ability to play the story with a partner (like Resident Evil 5). So I can't say that I've given Uncharted 3's online play a fair enough chance to comment, but I will say that my son seems to enjoy the multiplayer as much as if not more than Modern Warefare 3.So is Uncharted 3 a great game? YES! One of the best to hit the PS3 platform? YES! Should you buy it? YES! Even if you haven't played Uncharted 1? YES! YES! YES! No question here...don't rent this; add it to your cart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004EW948E","description":"","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"Too bad this didn't get more publicity","reviewText":"Binary Domain is a game that I feel sorry for...Oh not that it's a bad game, in fact it's actually really good.  But it's like a film that happens to opens up sandwiched between a couple of blockbusters and gets lost in the shuffle.  It's a game that came out with little fanfare...which is Sega's fault...but a game that is quite good...also Sega's fault.  Binary Domain is a squad/cover based shooter set in the year 2080.  Robots have become the primary work force in the world.  A new Geneva Convention agreement has banned robots that are able to pass themselves off as humans.  A Japanese robotics firm has ignored the agreement, producing humanoid robots called \"hollow children\" that are able to imitate humans and assimilate their way into human society.You take on the role of a mercenary named Dan Marshall, who is assigned by the International Technology Robot Agency (ITRA) to lead an interchangeable group of mercs to infiltrate and investigate the Amada Corporation, and ultimately destroy the illegal bots.  The game has parallels to many popular films like \"I, Robot' and \"Bladerunner\" and does a nice job of pacing its story.  While the plot isn't overly complex there's a nice back-story that plays out with a few twists tossed in for good measure.  The various characters you command each have their own unique personalities even if they are stock characters straight out of central casting with various cultural stereotypes.  Still, you're more likely to choose which two mates you take along on missions based more on their colorful personalities than you are their fighting skills.If you're played other squad-based shooters you'll find yourself right at home with Binary Domain's precision controls and the well-defined combat system.  Naturally you will carry the weight of the battle but your squad mates hold their own better than average and will even heal you when you're hurt.  You can issue your basic commands such as \"follow\", \"Cover\", \"Charge\", etc...however the really cool function is that Binary Domain can recognize a good-size amount of voice commands if you utilize a headset.  These can take the form of all the standard commands but you can also supply encouragement to your team and give them a pat on the back by saying \"Nice work\", or you can even ream them out a bit as the system will recognize a handful of choice four-letter words.  The voice recognition works (most of the time).  There's even the ability to train certain words and phrases as well as being able to reduce ambient noise.  Still the best bet if you're going to use a headset and voice commands is pretty much turn off anything else and play it without a lot of other people around.  Or at least tell them to shut up!There's also a trust system that the game incorporates between you and your men.  Take care of them, treat them well, and they will perform better in battle and obey your orders.  Things like friendly fire, or arguing with them can lead them to not be as helpful or responsive in battle.  But while this is an interesting element ultimately it proves fairly useless.  Unless you make it a point to being a total jerk to your men, you won't have an issue.  Mass Effect 3 it is not when it comes to decision making.The combat in Binary domain really shines as there's a great variety of robots to kill.  But what makes the combat truly standout is the robot damage.  These are not like most organic enemies that just fall down and die but you literally can blow these bots to pieces.  You can blast off their armor or limbs and they will still pursue you like undead zombies, crawling or hopping along towards you.  I can't tell you just how cool the destruction is in this game.  You can even take control of some of the bots and use their firepower against them.  The fantastic combat and robot designs more than makes up for ordinary levels and scenery.The campaign game runs bout 10 hours in length and there are both multi-player and co-op modes included although neither is what you would call robust.  The campaign game is definitely the meat of Binary Domain.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0012N3ZXS","reviewerName":"Mr. Ben \"ctsamurai\"","summary":"Check your ego at the door","reviewText":"Street Fighter is the granddaddy franchise of fighting games.  I bet most people forgot that there had been a Street Fighter III (or the Alpha series, etc.) But Capcom's famous brawler is back, in a big way.I like that, having not played Street Fighter in a fairly long time, it was easy to pick up and get back into it.  There are a lot of classic characters (Chun-Li, E. Honda, Guile, Ken, Ryu and more) and enough new guys to make it interesting.The game is visually great.  Maybe not as knockout gorgeous as Soul Calibur, but these characters are more cartoony and fluid.  Watching Dalsim or Rufus are perfect examples of this cartoony/rubber element.  The stylized impact animations add a nice graphic touch.  The character \"movies\" that try and tell something of a story are in general cheap basic anime style.  Some fans of the Street Fighter series and anime may enjoy it, but I had to roll my eyes at it.  The music is very J-pop, not a plus for me.However, those of you who are looking for a classic update are in for a surprise.  The challenge of even the computer controlled opponents is much higher.  This is probably due to the better AI capable of modern consoles, but it is also because the control/fighting system has changed.  Its not apparent at first, but there are counters, super combos, \"revege\" combos and a lot of other interesting features just underneath the classic six-button controls you're so used to.You really should spend some time \"sparring\" with a friend before you even think about playing against random online opponents and in general, you'll have your work cut out for you against the computer even on the medium setting.I strongly encourage people to rent this game before they buy it (or perhaps download SFIIturboHDremix on Xbox Live).  Its a great game, and I think if you have a group of fighter friends (I don't, sadly) you'll get some great mileage out of this.  In addition, I would look into buying an arcade style controller, because I think some of the combos and moves are little hard to execute with the xbox controller (primarily regarding stick directions).  The game itself is tight, looks great and has a deeper fighting system than before.  Unfortunately, I think the challenge level here will turn off some people.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2009"}

Those are all cool features, but it's a different story when you get to the main portion of the game. The graphics have been polished with detailed textures, but the already problematic camera angles have gotten worse. The visuals also break up and have serious collision detection issues. These collision hiccups also adversely affect the controls, which otherwise feel good.The audio has been spiced up with a Dolby Pro Logic II option, which sounds great albeit a tad too loud. The dialogue is the same as in the Dreamcast version and is not intended to be as goofy as it sounds, but it's certainly not irritating. Who would have thought a few years ago that virtually every major Sonic game would be available on the GameCube?

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Isn't hype wonderful?","reviewText":"What did you expect? The first Halo was a lot of hype. I was truly amazed that the game got as popular as it did with it's clich&eacute;d story, and it's sluggish controls, and uninspiring graphics. Nevertheless the game has become one of the most popular titles out there. A sequel was inevitable, and people lined up around the block, and camped out for this sequel only to walk away from the story uninspired, and sorely disappointed.I wasn't expecting much from the story. I only ever bought the two Halos so that the cry baby gamers I play games with can't say \"You wouldn't beat me if this were Halo\". Well, now it is Halo, and I'm still beating you so neyah!The multi-player mode is where this game shines. There is really a lot going on, and a huge variety of game play options, and admittedly some pretty neat weapons, but it seems that Bunjie has all but abandoned the single player experience, as it never really lived up to its potential. I still don't care about Master Chief, I think the name is both ridiculous and silly, I don't know much about this \"dark and foreboding\" anti-hero, and I feel no emotional attachment for him. Now why is that? Well I guess you're not supposed to feel for the guy who plays the lead in a sci-fi shooter... the game is all about blowing stuff up, after all, isn't it?That is probably enough for most gamers, especially between the age of 14 and 18. But at 26, my tastes are evolving. I am beginning to feel that if you've played any first person shooter you've played them all. They're are all either a knock off of Goldeneye 007 (IMO still the best FPS ever made) or Halo, so playing this title late, AFTER playing through the mega disappointing Perfect Dark Zero I just wasn't able to develop any love for the Halo series outside its superb multiplayer mode, or the silly parody Red V Blue. I am simply having trouble identifying or feeling the emotions of the story. The potential for something more refined and sophisticated is there, I just hope that Bunjie can capitalize on that in the 3rd installment rather than making another Jerry Brokheimer the video game.At any rate Halo 2 falls into yet another ho-hum sci-fi tale that will probably excite the average gamer, but being that I prefer more sophisticated stories it didn't do much for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2006"}

First and foremost all of the main villains are in the game. You have the Penguin, Joker, Catwoman, Poison IVY, Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Killer Croc, Scarecrow, Two-Face, Bane, The Mad Hatter, etc.. The game is basically split in two as half of the game you play as the villains and the other half you play the side of the heroes. This is one of my favorite aspects of the game and it really works in regards to keeping things entertaining. The game never gets old as your always playing as new characters. The game is split into chapters, 3 for the villains and 3 for the heroes. Each chapter has 5 distinct levels. So basically there are 15 levels in total and you play each level as both the villain and the hero.One of my favorite aspects to this game is the different suits that Batman and Robin wear. Each suit has different abilities and you need to use the suits, in different combination's, to proceed through the levels. For example Batman has a gliding suit that allows him to glide long distances, a heat suit that makes him resistant to fire and heat, a munitions suit that allows him to plant bombs, a sonic suit that allows him to shoot a sonic gun that destroys glass objects etc. The suits are specific to Batmam and Robin and they are not interchangeable between the two. Only Batman can wear Batman's suits and only Robin can wear Robin's suits. These suits really add significantly to the game play and ultimately I think the suits are one of the main reasons why Batman is my favorite Lego game. Like the assortment of characters, the suits help keep things from feeling old or repetitious. On top of this, each character has unique weapons and moves. All of these things keep the game fresh and exciting.I also have to mention how outstanding the level design was. This is another aspect where I think Lego Batman tops the previous Lego games. Each level was interesting and well designed. Some were better than others but all of them were fun to play through. I also have to mention the achievements as my son is a big achievement hunter. The achievements were entertaining and fortunately didn't require and sort of grinding. Some were a bit challenging for him but nothing that would cause any frustration. He got his 1000.Bottom line - I am a big fan of the Lego games and have played all of them except Pirates of the Caribbean. With that being said, this was my favorite Lego game yet. Overall I think the reason for that is the overall variety that this game has. When you combine the playing of both heroes and villains, the Batman and Robin suits, and the unique moves and weapons that each character has....well, you ultimatly wind up with a Lego game that is more diverse and ultimately more entertaining than Lego's other games and that is Really saying something as I have really enjoyed all of the Lego games. If your a Batman or Lego fan then this should definitely be on your game shelf. If you havent played the Lego games yet than what are you waiting for? Lego Batman is a perfect place to start.5 Stars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"D. Couse \"darkman1969\"","summary":"Snap, crackle and pop!

Forget everything you know about Far Cry. Blood Dragon uses Far Cry 3 as a base -- a building block to lay something seriously bad ass down. You play as a cyborg named Rex who is trying to stop a man named Sloan from taking over the world. Sounds cheesy, and it is, and that's the best part.Right when you launch the game you will notice the awesome 80&#8242;s vibe. The loading screen looks like a VCR with a tracking bar down at the bottom. Funny little hints flash across the screen like \"Sniper Rifles...close range weapons when you select the wrong gun.\" Once I saw stuff like this I knew I was in for a bad ass ride. The game is short on content, let me just get that out right now. You can beat the story in about 4 hours, but there are bases to take over like in Far Cry 3. You can use cyber hearts you rip from dead bodies to lure Blood Dragons into these bases, shoot the bad guys up yourself, or go all stealth. It's completely up to you. The dragons can hear you once you run or shoot, so stay low and use the hearts to lure them away. Other than that there are two side missions you can partake in, hostage rescues and hunting. Not exactly different from Far Cry 3, but enough to justify the small price tag.There are only a few weapons in the whole game, but they are really awesome. The shotgun has a cool reload animation similar to The Terminator 2, and Rex rests the gun on his wrist. He pops the shells in by letting them fall into the chamber. You get a sniper rifle, a mini-gun, and an assault rifle as well as a pistol. There are various throwables, but they are all neat and you will use them all often. One thing I particularly liked was the attention to detail in the animations. When you heal he fixes his cyborg arm by welding it, fixing cables, pulling bullets out with his finger, and a few others. When you run he looks like the T-1000 with his hand completely straight and pumping his arms real fast. I just love the whole aesthetics of this game. The Tron looking art direction with neon reds and blues as well as the enemy design. It's a fun trip back to the past when my parents showed me all the cool 80&#8242;s action movies. The first scene you are in a helicopter mowing down enemies to Little Richards \"Long Tall Sally\" like in Predator. The awesome just never ends.I also can't help but love the music. It's stuff straight from the 80&#8242;s and fits so well, I actually listen to the soundtrack outside the game. You can tell the team was pressed for time (they only got 6 months) because a lot of the Far Cry 3 stuff is just reskinned like the hang glider, the jeeps (the only vehicle in the game), the jet skis, and even the helicopters. There's not really much to do in the game, and once the story mode and all the bases are taken over, there's no reason to stay. You will see everything the game has to offer in about an hour, but the ending is just bad ass. You get to ride a dragon that curses and talks while shooting lasers from his eyes and mowing down everyone with a cannon. The story mode is highly entertaining, but I was disappointed with the low quality storyboard style cut scenes. They didn't do the game justice.In the end, Blood Dragon is one of the best downloadable games this year and a completely pleasant surprise. Even if you don't like Far Cry, the 80&#8242;s vibe should bring many hardcore gamers along. It's light on content, the characters are average (except Rex), and the animations and art style are one-of-a-kind, there's no other game out there like it. I really hope there's a fully fledged sequel, even outside of the Far Cry 3 engine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

As an assassin confronted by perilous new challenges and difficult choices, what path will you choose?Stunning GraphicsView larger.Roam FreelyView larger.All New WeaponsView larger.","reviewerName":"Carl Carter","summary":"Improves on the original in every way","reviewText":"I'll be the first to admit that the first Assassin's Creed had it's faults.  However, I did enjoy it quite a bit.  Although I was pretty sure I would enjoy Assassin's Creed II, I had no idea exactly how much I would love it.  Read on for the full review, or skip to the BOTTOM LINE for the short and to the point recommendation.GAMEPLAYAdmittedly, I haven't finished the game yet.  However, I can tell you that the structure is greatly improved from the first one.  Gone are the rigidly structured assassinations where you must complete a certain amount of the same sidequests.  Now, you can see the sidequests on your map (including race, beat-up random guy, etc.) but they are completely optional.  Another part of the first Assassin's Creed that I didn't like was the insane amount of collectibles placed in the various cities in the form of flags.  These are gone as well.  There are still things to collect (statues in the home city and codex pages), but they are a lot more fun to find and, in the case of the codex pages, are marked on your map.  In addition, there are secret glyph puzzles and crypts to find and explore, but these are revealed to be near when you get close to the buildings that house them.  The combat system has remained largely the same, but you get many of your abilities much faster.  You can also customize Ezio with various types or armor and weapons.  But by far the most fun is the hidden blade, which has been improved for the sequel.  How, you ask?  Well they just gave us another one to play with.  This leads to some truly spectacular assassinations, as Ezio leaps from a roof to take down two guards at once.  If you invest the time and effort to remain undetected, you feel truly powerful as you pick off guard after guard, then leap from the shadows to quickly eliminate your target.  You truly feel like an assassin.  And further into the game, I am told that you can acquire even more toys to kill your foes in even more inventive and, most importantly, fun ways.STORYThis is another area that the first game fell short, in my opinion.  Half way through I just got bored and had to take a few weeks off to play other things.  This game has succeeded in completely drawing me in.  You truly care about Ezio, and, without revealing any major events, his motivations make him a very realistic character.  As he is ripped from his youthful shenanigans into a plot bigger than himself, he grows into that assassin's cloak in ways that Altair never did.  Simple gestures like sometimes removing his hood when talking to friends and allies make him seem more real, like there's a real person under that getup that I'm actually interested in seeing through to the story's end.  As I mentioned before, I haven't completed the game, but it looks as though Ubisoft has succeeded in making me feel emotionally invested in the story and the characters in a way that the first Assassin's Creed never came close to.GRAPHICSSome people have said that the game's graphic engine is beginning to show it's age.  Maybe in some ways that's true, but in others ways this game is truly beautiful.  The cities have a busy feel to them, much like the first game, and when perched high above the ground in one of the many viewpoints, the scenery can truly take your breath away.  To be fair, there are some clipping issues with Ezio's clothes and weapons, but that's true of most any game.  And the characters themselves could look a little better, but that would be nitpicking.  Overall, this game has a beautiful environment that represents classic Italian cities very well.SOUNDSound is usually one element of games that I don't notice as much.  But I found myself noticing subtle touches added in to enhance the experience that really work well.  Like the best game music, it's unintrusive, but enhances what you're seeing if you pay attention to it.  No complaints here.BOTTOM LINEThis game is excellent.  It takes elements of sandbox games, stealth games, action games, and even a few quicktime events (but undressing your lover is an acceptable use of this often overused mechanic) and turns them into a game that exceeded my admittedly high expectations.  It's attention to detail is impressive, and it strives to be historically accurate where it can be.  The voicework is good, and I like that they included some Italian to be true to their setting.  The story is good, and does its job in making the characters interesting and three-dimensional.  It's even quite funny at times.  And if you're interested, there are a lot of very interesting lore-type bits of items to find and obsess over that really develop the already interesting Assassin's Creed world.  So, if you liked the first game you should get this.  If you found the first game too boring, you should get this.  If you like Italy, you should get this.  If you are even remotely interested in the premise, you should get this.  In short, this game is excellent and should be on your list of must-haves for either console.A note on the rating:This game is rated M for a reason.  While the aforementioned \"undressing your lover\" scene is quite tame compared to other love scenes in video games (or virtually every prime-time tv show) it could be a little much for the munchkins.  Also, there is a lot of blood.  You are an assassin, after all.  Particularly brutal murders are shown, like stabbing people through the face.  This is not overdone, and all you see is blood spray, but this is not a game for the kiddies.  In addition, there are several cases of harsh language, including some uses of the f-word.  You have been warned.A note on religion:The game opens with a screen explaining that it was developed by a multicultural team of various faiths.  This is because, to put it simply, the story of this game may be offensive to those of religious faith.  It is not truly hostile toward religion, and I would compare it to Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" in terms of offensiveness.  I viewed it as entertainment, as a fictitious story, and I took no offense at the story.  But once again, this game and its story are for intended for those who can appreciate it for what it is: a somewhat violent and (relatively) realistic take on Renaissance Italy society with mature sci-fi themes thrown in.  Adjust your buying decisions accordingly.Edit (11-22-09):Finished the game.  Wow.  If, like me, you liked the sci-fi style near-future storyline of Desmond, then you'll love the ending.  It literally blew my mind.  The story is immensely satisfying and comes to a completely awesome conclusion that sets up for the next game.  If you despise the collection elements of the game, you might be disappointed by some mandatory collection at the end.  I was lucky enough to have collected 29 of 30 codex pieces and so only had to find one more, but it is kinda jarring to be made to stop right at the climax of the story to find a few things you may have forgotten.  Thankfully, they mark every missing piece on your map, but it still breaks the flow of the game.  While this was a little irritating, the next hour of gameplay more then made up for it.The much-hyped flying machine sequence was (thankfully) a short one time thing that, honestly, seems like it was included only for the awesomeness factor and didn't, in my opinion, really seem to fit in with the rest of the game.  Ezio's character really develops into a mature and intelligent protagonist, even going so far as to lament about the seemingly endless killing that doesn't bring him any closer to realizing his goals, exactly at the point when I was thinking the same thing.  He is incredibly well written, and this makes him one of the more believable characters I've seen in a video game.Since finishing the game, I can honestly say with certainty that this game is everything the original should have been.  The story, while starting off slow, kept my attention the entire time, so much so that I finished the game in roughly four days.  The length seems about right, and I finished in about 23 hours.  If I go back and find all the collectable feathers I could probably get an additional five or so hours of playtime.  The replay value isn't very high, as there is no other difficulty level or any other reason to play again, besides a desire to see the admittedly good story again.  And I'll say it again: the story is very, very good.  The difficulty is on the low side, and I don't think I ever died, other than from long falls resulting from bad jumps and trying to get the Flyswatter achievement during the flying segment (the only missable achievement, fellow achievement hunters).  The graphics and sound grew on me even more as I played through the rest of the game and experienced the other cities and locales.  The many weapons and skills made for even more fun and amusing ways to kill my targets.  The story missions stayed varied and fun, and I never got bored with them.  I tried out every type of optional side mission and while they were amusing once, I didn't feel the need to do any more of them, with the possible exception of the assassination missions.In short, after finishing the game, my initial impressions remain accurate.  This game is very good, and is well worth adding to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

I played the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion when it was first released. The graphics were impressive, but I felt as though I had to adapt my gameplay to fit the class system. After suffering far too many game-crashing bugs, I abandoned the game. So I had very low expectations for Skyrim and paid very little attention to it beforehand. After playing the first five minutes it completely blew me away.I'm not even sure whether what the Bethesda developers have done can be called \"level-design\". They've taken what they've learned from previous games like Oblivion and Fallout 3, and designed and built an entire world in exacting detail, from the highest mountains to the smallest trees. The entire soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule is wonderful and sets an epic tone for the rest of the game. The understated intro and main menu is also a very nice touch. As for stability, I've only suffered one crash  in over 60 hours of gameplay.Visiting Skyrim is like travelling to an exotic and dangerous foreign country - all without leaving the comfort of your own home. I've found the side-quests and encounters to be more fun than the main quests. For instance, while taking a quiet stroll across the main plaza in the Mage College of Winterhold, a Dragon landed in the middle of the plaza. In Skyrim, the dragons are huge majestic beasts that evoke the same awe as the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. I was amazed that a Dragon would dare attack such a well-defended fortress. I was even more amazed that a creature that large could even fit in the Plaza. The resulting battle with the Dragon and Skyrim's most powerful mages was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had in any game in recent years. What's more amazing is that this battle was (as far as I'm aware) completely unscripted.In my opinion, it's unforgettable experiences that make Skyrim a classic game. Bethesda have set the bar very high with this game, and it'll be interesting to see whether other Developers will take up the challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2012"}

The fmailiar Final fantasy music is completely gone and is replaced with some very cheesy 70's type music.The sphere level system is gone as are weapons and armor. There are no more swords and shields to collect and find. They are now replaced with accessories like earrings and bracelets.Also, the strategical battle system of Final Fantasy X, in which you have to change characters in and out of battle, is gone too. The new battle system is super fast and wont require much more than holding down the 'X' button to attack.And probably the worst part of this game is how tedious it is.You will travel to the same exact places from Final Fantasy X. The maps are completely the same. Plus to get the most from this game you have to visit each location once a chapter. That means you will go through the same old areas 5 times each!No originality what so ever.Though i must admit that i loved the dress sphere system. The classes were mostly cool but there are some severe imbalances in some of them like the Dark Knights Darkness attack and the Alchemists unlimited supply of Mega Potions...All in all this is a terrific game and i enjoyed it quite a bit. Compared to every other non Final Fantasy game it rocks. But compare it to the old Final Fantasys and it doesnt seem to have the same type of quality.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2006"}

Just look at what it's doing to Square!!!","reviewText":"...yet again...despise the different artwork...Doesn't it seem an awfully big coincidence that as soon as Squaresoft become SquareEnix, the games begin to get worse and worse? Now this game isn't awful but they are starting to try and become something they are not.'Oh wow!! You get to chnage their dresses!!! That totally makes this game worth getting!'...we don't need some crazy cutscene with them changing their dresses. It's just a jazzed up version of the job system in FF5 which I think was very weak. It may let you customise your party but parameters just evaporate... 'I'm a Dark Knight I have high strength...ooh now I'm a Black Mage and I have low strength tee hee hee look at how versatile I am.' It's just plain irritating.The story is attempting to carry on the story which I think was very nicely concluded in FF10. However this new story is very dry and because of it they have crammed it full with so many side quests to hide this fact that the side quests actually outweigh the real story filled with incompetent villains (A women with a heart tatoo, with two henchman: one fat and one thin...kind of cliched don't you think?)and a bunch of other cliched characters (paine is an absolute pain). And the sidequests are mission based to make it seem like something worthwhile...when they are really random and pointless. Especially near the end where they steal the obvious and flawed random dungeon idea and make it even more boring. Oh yeah and sphere break? Sphere break!? What are you doing?OK the FMVs are impressive... but they don't require story creativity and just require expensive computers and graphic design. All this they had before Enix appeared and allied with Squaresoft. Enix are the reason they're going downhill, I mean FF12 was awful. We need to stop Enix before there is no Square left and they'll be called Enixsoft. THE HORROR!!!Now I may be exagerating a bit. This game isn't awful and Enix did contribute a little ('Um...how about when you press circle you can jump. Will that cover up the fact we ruined the storyline?) but you need to know that this is NOT a FF experience. Your best bet is to by FF7, FF8, FF9, FF10...or any of them in fact if you want a good old fashioned final fantasy. Stay away from this until your sober...or know what you're doing. Please.

He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

From the early subversions of superhero cliches to the tight, incredible story with all its innumerable twists to the characters to the narrative flow, the game never gets boring and never lets up the \"awesome\" right through the end credits song (the electrifyingly unique \"Silent Melody\").The game is living, breathing art. Yes, the visuals are nice, and yes, without a doubt, the details in textures, props, and scenery will at first be eye-poppingly incredible. Where the \"art\" factor lies is not only in the unique lighting mechanic in order to make the city come to life (an entire dyanmic lighting system had to be developed in order to make Cole's lightning powers and the city's various light sources change depending on the location, time of day, and other factors), but also in the emotional investment of the story that can give you chills.Without giving anything away, \"Infamous\" tells the story of Cole McGrath, who wakes up after a mysterious explosion to discover that he know has the ability to manipulate electricity, therefore becoming immune to it. The city is under lockdown after the explosion, and a mysterious man by the name of Kessler seems to be the source of all these strange events. Kessler, however, is not the only antagonist, and each of them is different, unique in their own way. The Karma choices of the game sometimes feel more like a surface mechanic than a narrative one, but in the (far between, but not at all few) times when they are executed in epic, believable ways, they not only affect the outcome of the story, ultimately, but also how the player perceives the game world... and the world outside.The game has a surprisingly intricate, fascinating storyline. The characters are well-rounded and believable, and their motivations are understandable and, at times, chilling. The majority of the missions have a Karma meter - depending on which action you take, your reputation will either become villainous, giving you red lightning and destructive powers, or heroic, giving you blue lightning and pinpoint accuracy. One of these missions, the first time I encountered it, actually made my blood run cold: as with most of the Karma missions, it is asking you to make a choice based on the choices you would make in real life. Five times through the game later, that same mission still gives me chills.Though the game loses much of its fun after finishing the main story missions, there are plenty of side missions and lots of shard hunting to do instead. Whether you choose the Dark or Light Karma changes the storyline and available missions considerably, and may even leave you feeling a little guilty about your Dark choices (if you go that route). Unlike most games that have good/bad choices, this one actually makes you think about them as carefully as if you were making them in real life.Now, on to the technical details: the game's graphics are some of the best and most detailed ever created for the PlayStation 3 system. As explained above, the lighting system (which was, like the rest of the game, created entirely from scratch) is simply amazing, especially when one takes into the account the sheer investment of time needed to build and render such complexities in the gaming world. The whole package truly shines on the Blu-ray high-definition system and is best viewed on a full 1080p television, though without a doubt it STILL looks fantastic on a plain standard definition screen - it simply looks that amazing overall.The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. The composer created a soundtrack made up entirely of \"urban sounds\" using \"instruments\" one would find lying around on the street, combining to create a unique urban vibe that permeates the atmosphere like nothing else on the market. Standouts include the primal, creepy \"The Courier\", the energetic \"Rabble Rouser\", the thrilling \"Anything For Trish\", and of course Infamous's theme, \"Silent Melody\". Sound effects are also very well done, from the crackle of lightning to the slap of water in the sewers. The voice acting certainly never fails to disappoint, with the voice actor for Zeke giving the character a nice, humorous edge and the actress for Trish making her fittingly bitter and even a bit unlikable.Though it draws comparisons with Prototype on a regular basis, Infamous is structured much more carefully, with a deeper and more involving storyline and a more relatable, everyman sort of protagonist. The comic-book-style cutscenes are perfect in fitting with the setting of the game. From the soundtrack to the storyline to the powers (including the ability, eventually, to call a lightning storm from the sky), Infamous is a perfect-ten PS3 exclusive title that deserves every bit of praise it gets and is well-deserving of the sequel, \"Infamous 2\", that all this game's fans have been waiting for, for so long.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2010"}

Wii Sports is fun when I'm playing with my little brother, but the Sports Champions game that comes with the Move blows it away. The camera really helps with the realism of motion and accuracy when playing. You can tell this isn't something that was rushed out by Sony. It might have stolen the idea from Nintendo, but this is even more of a step in the direction of actually living the game. No more big headed people and it's in HD! As far as the hardware goes, the controllers don't feel or look cheap and the camera is well made, but I wish it was wireless. You also get a demo disk with about 10 games to try out. Some look good, the others, well...The main problem is that you're gonna want to spend another $50 on top of the $100 to get a second controller wand. This makes all the difference, especially when playing Gladiator Duel and Archery. Those two games are my favorites as of now, but Table Tennis and Disc Golf are also great. Bocce and Volleyball are pretty good too, but I don't find myself playing them as much.

I absolutely know what it is like to be a gamer in this era. However, as a fan of the Need For Speed series, I enjoyed those days during the Hot Pursuit era. When it did hit the Underground editions a few years ago, I was definitely not as impressed as I thought it was going to be. The gameplay was thrilling, but it didn't have a whole lot around. Now for Microsft, thry have definitely pulled it all the way out with the Xbox 360. When I've played around with it, I thought this was one of the most unique game systems ever, and I was right. Now, those Xbox 360 owners, have a thrill for the speed.Need For Speed: Most Wanted for Microsft's Xbox 360, is a wild and fierce game that really tests your thrill of the chase to the limit. The object of the game is for you to climb the notorious most wanted list, by going at it against the thrills of the chase by the cops, and other villainous foes like Razor and Vic. Not only that, you also can unlock some fast rides like the Porsche Carerra GT, a definitive Lambourghini, the Ford Mustang GT, and the sleek Subaru Impreza WRX to name a few. The gameplay is truly remarkable, and is a marvel for those who have the definition of High Definition televisions. The graphics are absolutely some of the very best I've seen in years for a Need For Speed game, and really deliver not just in the gameplay, but the storyline as well. The control is absolutely easy to pick up with each car and mission you unlock in the fierce chase, while the music is the most driven that has ever delivered for the franchise. In this game you don't only have mission modes, you also have modes like drag racing, circuit, toll booth and free roaming modes too.  While the gameplay may seem like old hat for Meed For Speed: Underground fans, it is also a great return for those who've missed the Hot Pursuit days, and absolutely delivers to the bone.Need For Speed: Most Wanted is arguably a great launch title for the Xbox 360. I absolutely suggest this for anybody who just bought this most revolutionary console, and for anybody who loves the series. Although it has been showcased fairly well for the other systems like the original Xbox, and Playstation 2, this is one of the most definitive deliveries for Xbox 360. Do you feel the need to be most wanted? If you do, I suggest you buy this rush.Graphics: A 1/2+Sound: B+Control: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

The GBA SP puts the GBA to shame. For the extra 30 dollars, you get a lighted screen, which helps tremendously. The rechargeable battery saves probably about that 30 dollars in a year just in battery costs! If you must buy this GBA, I recommend you pick up a light and magnifier combo. When I was a child I had the original GameBoy, and had no light or magnifier. I had 20/20 vision to that point, and the next year after owning the Game Boy for a year, I needed glasses. The light you need to get for this GBA should be a light on the side with a magnifier.

Fueled by revenge for the murder of his girlfriend, Hector sets off to confront the evil forces of the night.

They said that there were lots of unlockables and extras to compensate for Lament Of Innocences lack of them. There are hardly any, and the ones that are there are very poor.The game is a far cry from Symphony of the Night on the PS1 which is regarded as the best ever castlevania game. In this there is a very rushed feeling, there is no character portrait you are referred to as \"player\". The item list is small, and not very exiting. Combat is decent and you can pull of some impressive attacks, especially with the unarmed fighting style. The music is dull and very repetitive.The game ending though brief is good and satisfying, though there aren't that many cutscenes in the game. Also Konami said there were 150 enemies, that's very misleading most of them are different colour versions of older ones. Thus you might see the same creature take up 3 or 4 spots in the listing. There is also no returning characters/enemies like the Succubus which is a shame.Trevor Belmont is back and the interaction between you and him is good and interesting. Also the dialogue is decent and instead of bad sounding modern speech they talk as if in the period which is great.Also the game is far too easy and those whining about it being too hard ought to stick to childrens games, You will rarely lose a fight in this game except against the end boss.Overall an OK experience but falls way short of expectation, and with Konami lying to customers you have to question their interest in the series anymore as they can do better than this.Overall 6.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2005"}

In a nutshell, you glide around as a cell-like creature looking for blue orbs that make your organism bigger while dodging other organisms that are bigger than you. While the game offers multiple organisms for you to play as and it is definitely pretty to look at, the &#34;gameplay&#34; rapidly becomes stale as you realize all you are doing is tilting the controller one way or another. It's fun for an hour, but I wouldn't buy the package exclusively for &#34;Fl0w&#34;.Flower:Flower is more of an interactive piece of art than an actual game; you &#34;play&#34; as a lone flower petal, looking to collect as many different types of flower petals while turning the desolate land around you into a flowing plain. TGC truly shows off their ability to mesmerize the player with solid visuals and great game physics. This short and sweet &#34;adventure&#34; lasts a little longer than Fl0w did for me, as there are multiple environments and flowers for you to play as. This is a nice distraction from the main piece of the package, which is...Journey:WOW. TGC really blew the gaming norm with Journey. Many might be turned away when I say that I completed Journey in a mere two hours; however, this allows players to play this masterpiece over and over again, finding every collectable and enjoying this experience of a game. You interact with your environment by flying/gliding through deserts, up waterfalls, and exploring mysterious ruins that are truly incredible to look at. The game also features something other games don't; throughout your odyssey, the game will incorporate other players into your game without any chat boxes or name tags, only revealing who your companions were after the game's credits. Journey is a masterpiece in ways that many wouldn't think of a traditional &#34;game&#34;, with its stunning visuals and rememberable physics and gameplay.While I wouldn't buy this package if you've already purchased the games via the Playstation digital store, the bonus content are nice, and they sweeten the deal that much more. Included are interactive wallpapers for the Playstation menu, the game's astounding score, and other little pieces of swagger for your Playstation.

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"I Haz Ps3 And X Bawks And PC","summary":"Lackluster and Overhyped","reviewText":"Don't spend more than $20 on this game. Dead Space 3 is not amazing, it's not special, and it's hardly worth your time alone. Sure, it has it's fun/special moments (the drill part being one) and it has a pretty interesting and well-done weapon crafting system, but the overall experience just isn't ENOUGH. Several times in the game you will come across rooms you've seen 10 times before and that you'll see 10 more times. It's as if they created a few sets, then copied them all over the game and changed the blood stains up a bit. The graphics are good and the sets are great, but you end up backtracking some of the few levels so much that they start to get old. The game wears on you so much that by around chapter 14 you're thinking \"Are we done yet? I've seen this room, these monsters, that puzzle - 15 times before.\" Another thing that bothered my co-op partner and me was the repetitive nothingness. There were so many occasions in which we were wandering the claustrophobic corridors that this game knows and loves FAR too much, wondering where the hell all the promised necromorphs were. There was nothing. The puzzles are trivial and repetitive.Notice how repetitive everything is? The game lacks substance and new material. Almost nothing implicated is fresh and keeps your interest. The story is so bland and stereotypical that I didn't even attempt to get into it. I paid attention but utterly did not give a single tip of the hat for any single character in the game. The development of the newer character, Carver, was so stereotypical and horrible that my friend and I didn't care about him either. The game uses a lot of recycled sci-fi and horror ideas, some better and some worse than others. Also, something INSANELY frustrating is the ladders and elevators. The elevators because the amount the stuck into this game is ridiculous. It's a slap in the face to have to get out of an elevator that took about 60 seconds out of your playing, kill about 5 necromorphs, pick up some ammo, and then proceed through another elevator. This process was repeated SEVERAL times on EVERY SINGLE level. It's formulaic and boring. The ladder system is flawed. Your co-op partner has to be 6 feet away from the ladder for you to go up or down it. It's insanely annoying. I wouldn't mention little gripes like this, but the game is SO freaking repetitive that you will see these issues the whole way through. The missions are generally \"go here get that\" \"bring this thing here\" \"build this to kill that\" and so on. Nothing new, nothing special. This game is repetitive, boring, frustrating, and a collage of things that have already been done to death. You will find a standard experience and waste of time with Dead Space 3, not anything groundbreaking.Still, there were a few things I enjoyed about the game. I really think more games should push for co-op like Dead Space 3 did. I love co-op because I love both campaign mode and playing with my friends, and not enough games implicate co-op at all, let alone at this level. The weapon crafting system was the start of something awesome. It just wasn't enough. It threw everything it had at you pretty early on, and then did nothing. It would be great to see this implicated in other games on a larger scale. The set pieces and environments were very well done, but after the 3rd time backtracking by that sculpture - I'm tired of seeing it. Yes Visceral, I saw it the first time. I marveled at it for 30 seconds, then decided to return to playing the game. That's why I bought it.I am sad that the 3rd and (I hope) final installment of the Dead Space series had to fizzle out like this. I loved the first two. The story was over-expanded, the game was over-hyped, and they wandered to far away from what made the original Dead Space so unique and special. I'm sure the budget on this new game was astronomical in comparison to the first installment, yet it was insanely disappointing. With other games like Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider out and even better games (Destiny) and new consoles on the horizon, a weak recycled collage of ideas with the label \"Dead Space\" slapped on it is hardly worth more than $20, if you have nothing else to play and don't have your hopes set higher than a mediocre experience.It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't spectacular. It was meh.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

CRYSIS-WARHEAD, its standalone sequel, was bound to do well. But it will not. Here is why.Similar to all major EA releases since June (MASS EFFECT & SPORE) CRYSIS-WARHEAD harbors the most malignant version of SecuROM (7.xx) and is also crippled by Limited Installations. And to no avail mind you: both MASS EFFECT and SPORE received ZERO protection from their draconian DRM scheme when it came to preventing their piracy!Exactly likeSpore, for which the customer backlash was heard around the world, EA is trying to force this DRM scheme down its customers' throats than do the reasonable thing: listen to them.Since piracy will always be a factor to consider and everyone has the right to protect his investment, a form of DRM will also always exist. But NOT at the expense of their own customers!- Revoking our rights as the Administrators of our own computer by creating irremovable folders or registry entries or subroutines that run masked is unacceptable!- Bundling a snooping, auto-updating and in-secret-contact-with-the-mothership utility that retains backdoor access to our computers is unacceptable!!- Trying to force legitimate gamers to pay again and again for the same game by Limiting its Installations is UNACCEPTABLE!!It might be just me, but I believe that, in the end, the best and more effective DRM method will prove to be reasonable pricing. Who would place his computer in danger of Trojans, Worms or slow Viruses for $20? And since even more people would buy the game, everyone should be happy.Now, at $30, CRYSIS-WARHEAD is indeed reasonably priced (it could do better considering its length but I digress). Why could it not be SecuROM-free and actually owned by the people who paid and bought it?EA, you had me as a customer for years. I even gave your products more than fair reviews.

What appears at first glance to be a random mish-mosh of a million different games is actually one of the most cohesive, creative game worlds ever constructed. Do not dare underestimate Jak II-first impressions can be most deceiving.Name a successful game, you can spot it living inside Jak II: Ratchet and Clank, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Mario, Rainbow Six, Panzer Dragoon, Banjo-Kazooie, Final Fantasy VII, The Legend of Zelda...they're all there, somewhere, tied together in the underground sewer network of Jak's dirty City. But this is hardly a criticism-it's actually Jak II's biggest strength. It uses \"3D platformer\" as a loose foundation for a towering monument to a million great gameplay ideas. Naughty Dog, it would seem, has been paying attention the last couple of years.Strangely enough, the game Naughty Dog seems to have been paying most attention to is Grand Theft Auto III, as evidenced by Jak II's enormous living City, a vast hub world connecting the more traditional \"platformer\" missions, filled with different vehicles to steal, police alerts to trigger, bonus missions to find, and innocents to run over-and, yes, kill (Jak II is a surprisingly dark ride-the opening sequence finds our cute hero fresh from two years of life in a pain-and-torture device). While there's still plenty of trick jumping to be done, the game takes a key step away from its roots by offering a huge variety of missions-squad jobs, gun-intensive hunts, hover-contraption races, and intense chases through crowded city streets. A visit to a sewer to retrieve a missing artifact for one fellow's shady operation, a trip to a pumping station to sabotage another's. The game is unreally gorgeous-no one should have ever realistically expected to see these kinds of graphics pumped from the PS2. The City itself is detailed to a level of sheer absurdity such that random fruit carts realistically spill their wares when you crash into them with a hoverbike. Opening a door to the world outside the walled-in city inspires awe every time. The voice acting is wonderful; the sound effects are tuned like a feature film, and the music is a cinematic symphony to perfectly complement the fully-realized narrative-these are characters to love, villains to hate, and motivations to question. Now and then, Jak II suffers somewhat from Wind Waker syndrome (a.k.a. lots of backtracking through the ocean...er, City). Some may be put off by just how often ol' platformin' Jak has to race and drive. Others still may hurl their controllers in frustration at a couple particularly evil missions. But this is the kind of game that you'll easily forgive for its sins. You curse and you swear and say \"this game sucks!\"...but then you triumph, smile, and eagerly check your mission list to see what task is gonna make you lose your next night's sleep.

Quite different and it looked very interesting and appealing.Behind the scenes, Hideo Kojima dedicated himself and resources toward the development of MGS: Peace Walker &#8211; a fantastic game in and of itself &#8211; however this resulted in a lack of attention toward Rising.  Duties were relegated to a more inexperienced section of Kojima Productions and the project derailed and was quietly cancelled without informing the public.For years we in the gaming community thought this title was still in development until the surprise announcement of Platinum Games spearheading the project.  This brought to light much of the problems behind the development phase of the game.The result of this change is a vastly different game than what was revealed all those years ago.  Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a game so nuts that it warrants the combination of two words.  The gameplay is fast, frenetic and calls for quite a bit of analog stick&#8230;waggling?  (I guess a term relegated to the Wii is applicable here.)  It is a fun Platinum Games&#8230;game.With that out of the way, it is NOT an MGS game in the slightest.  Not.  At.  All.  The only connection to established MGS canon is Raiden, the world its set in, and some peripheral cameos of older characters.The story seems to be present just to move the game along.  I can barely remember it but it had to do with something along the lines of cloning children, brains, and child soldiers.  Not memorable and a little on the weird side, even for MGS.  Just turn off your brain and play the game.  It&#8217;s all about the action and gameplay for this one.So, when all is said and done, it&#8217;s not much of an MGS game story-wise.

Not counting his multiple failures after the two solid efforts that were the Sonic Adventure games last generation, Sonic had the worst 15th birthday ever, where he stumbled out of the pub after partying too hard and fell right on his face. To put it bluntly, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) was one of the most poorly made games I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing, due to an awful camera, poor level design, terrible physics and character movement, and glitches galore.Later on we'd see Sonic Unleashed, which was definitely a step in the right direction -- until they revealed that half of the game would be played as the \"Werehog\". The other half, despite a few issues, offered what you'd expect out of a 3D evolution of the 2D formula. However, due to the introduction of the \"Werehog,\" it just seemed that SEGA had no interest in making a pure Sonic game that was actually good.Then came the Wii exclusive known as Sonic Colors, which was the beginning of Sonic's comeback. While the Wisps put a new spin on Sonic's formula, Sonic Colors was undeniably a Sonic game, and a pretty great one because of its well designed levels, art direction, music, and just epic space opera tone.Following in the success of Sonic Colors, we now have Sonic Generations, which is the return of old school Sonic along with new school Sonic. The gameplay is excellent; the graphics are colorful and crisp; the old music and the remixes are tremendous; the hub world is classy and easy to navigate; Sonic is back and impresses on every front in Sonic Generations.

Also of note, single player is much more enjoyable this time around. There's less down time, more dialogue and the enemies/environments allow for better individual strategy.So what are the negatives?The new menus are clunky and difficult to parse (everything is on a slight angle making it tough to read and navigate), while missions have more dialogue and humor they still consist of mostly \"shoot that\" or \"find this\" objectives, driving mechanics are about the same (though thankfully you don't take damage from hitting enemies as much), while you can set a waypoint on the map your co-op buddies can't see the same waypoint and sometimes there's simply too much dialogue happening simultaneously. For example if you're playing co-op the first big town you get to is a total cluster as multiple characters are introducing themselves at the same time, or enemy dialog and gunfine easily drowns out character/story related dialogue. This is sometimes incredibly frustrating since you feel like you're missing out on a crucial plot detail or funny quip. Also, for about the first 12-15 hours the environments are a little too similar, but that changes as you continue to progress through the game. That said, these are only minor complaints and the additions far outweigh the handful of small issues.Recommendation?If you loved the first BL you'll love this one! The game does start a little slow, but once you get going its clear this game is superior to BL1 in most regards. If you flat out didn't enjoy the first game I'm not sure you'd enjoy the sequel, but if you've been on the fence there's enough improvement in details, mechanics, humor, enemy diversity and feel to both single & multiplayer modes to warrant a second look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"2.5 stars at best...Bobby Kotick is probably at it again","reviewText":"Although EA is no stranger to this, Activision certainly is a master of milking a franchise to death.To be fair, COD MW3 does what it sets out to do and that is to complete the story arc established in the first 2 games.What it fails to do:1. Graphic engine. It still looks great, don't get me wrong. But when DICE updates their own engine (Frostbite 2) to make lighting and texture improvements look slick, Infinity Ward (or what's left of them after the Kotick debacle) fails to update anything significant.2. Story. The single player's story is wrapped up but, again, it's short.3. Multiplayer. My biggest gripe. I recently played with 3 people LOCALLY on a 4-player split screen Death Match. It looked blurry. I'm almost ashamed to say that Black Ops actually looked a little sharper. That's a major OUCH for me to say. The whole \"kill confirmed\" mode, while a novelty aimed at reducing campers, is not that much more significant than, say, blades of grass in EA's Madden 12. It's kind of an \"oooo\" for a few seconds, then I'm looking for the other novelties...and they're not there.I won't dwell on the complaints too much. Others have done a remarkable job covering that here. Is it a 1-star game? No, although this game has polarized its audience unlike COD titles before. It's 2.5 stars at best, and future releases have a long way to go to earn my trust again. I paid under forty dollars for it, and I'm 100% glad that I didn't pay full price. At a full price, this title would have been a travesty.Bobby Kotick is falling into the same routine again of relying on the coat-tails of previous good work to carry his cash cow forward. The same thing was evidenced in the swan song of the Guitar Hero franchise, which Kotick had the audacity to blame DJ Hero for. Yeah, DJ Hero killed Guitar Hero...it had nothing to do with the 3-4 releases of Guitar Hero each year.That said, COD has grown into such a monster that Kotich is unlikely to see past the black accounting values to realize that he will ultimately make a fatal error...again. Why no one deposes this clown in his own company is beyond me.It's sad since I loved COD MW 1 & 2 immensely. While COD MW3 provided a cathartic ending, it seems like a death rattle to me. Infinity Ward is not the name of quality that I once knew. Here's to hoping that they have the tenacity and legal capability of orphaning themselves from Activision...at least one can hope.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2011"}

The characters from the first game are not playable and only a couple make brief appearances in the story. Noel and Serah could be more interesting if given the chance, but story is lacking here and most times you are running monster to monster with very little cutscenes in-between. The monster fusing and leveling system is interesting and very similar to Persona games, but no matter how you slice it, this system just isn't as great as having real characters on your team. FF13-2 is also far too short at 20-30 hours while the first game was 60-70. Not really enjoying the Live Action thing either...CG & cutscenes are gone and the characters' graphics aren't as nice (blocky pixel hair, anyone?) without them.It does have a great soundtrack, shorter battles (I do prefer the longer ones though and these are way too easy), and the story is not as confusing this time around. You do get to explore more and do things on your own, but I feel like they sacrificed many things just to put that in there. Overall the game does feel incomplete and lacking in comparison to the first, but being a big fan of XIII I still would recommend it and had fun playing through. It is nice to see a decent continuation of the same characters and story, and that is the bottom line.CONS:+ Too little story+ Too short (20-30 hours to story completion, not including side-games or fetch quests)+ Battles are too easy!+ 2 playable characters only (even being able to use Hope or Snow while in their sections would have been nice)PROS:+ Soundtrack+ Some free roam & more choices+ Graphics (even on FF's worst day, the graphics would still be pretty)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2012"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons.

W. Mullins","summary":"It could have been much better","reviewText":"Far Cry 2 does not have anything in the least to do with the first Far Cry, which is okay but worth mentioning. This game isn't perfect, but none are, and it won't appeal to everyone. It is very realistic in its approach to combat, no crosshairs, weapon malfunctions, realistic load times and procedures, all great. The variety of weapons is nice, as are the possible uses.A small note on weapon malfunctions and jams. You will often get weapon malfunctions when using enemy pick ups. I have seen it described as being unrealistic that an AK would jam, malfunction or destroy themselves after a few hundred round. Many of the weapons used by such groups in Africa have been used, carried, and abused for years and many thousands of rounds already. I have seen a large number of bent, broken and otherwise unhealthy small arms in several African counties. AKs, G3s, and FALs are amazingly rugged and reliable weapons but they are machines and with too much use and abuse they do fail.The physics are quite nice, and its really nice to watch a fire you start burn its way across the plains. The shadows and lighting is great, but can be distracting. It is often times hard to find enemies shooting at you with the huge amount of shadows drifting about. Which again is fairly realistic, but will annoy players who are use to having little red dots to tell them where to shoot. The detail on the weapons themselves is also nice, though the designers have mirrored several of the models. I think they did this to add more detail and action to the weapons themselves. All of the weapons in the game have their bolts on the right and would eject that way. Not a bit deal but something that takes away from the illusion, at least for me.The enemies are normally pretty smart (annoyingly so at times) and will try to take advantage of numbers and flanking, and usually even cover. Its not perfect but they offer a challenge, though a number of them seem to have eagle vision and have gone to several sniper schools before returning home to Africa to fight. By which I mean they are very good at hitting you with rifle fire from several hundred yards away, through cover and while running. The enemies in technicals also have an annoying habit of creeping up on you before unloading a light machine gun into your back.There are two things that very much take away from the game in my opinion. The vehicles are a bit annoying but needed, driving is handled poorly and its hard to see where you are going often. A lot of the missions seems to require you to get in your car, drive across four maps, hit your target and then come back. During that trip though you will constantly be under fire from every person in the whole area. Every check point, every dock, every road, random people will be there to shoot at you. When you factor in the enemies ability to make remarkable shots and take massive amounts of damage, its gets old fast. The difficult levels are pretty out of whack. Easy may mean it is the easiest setting in this game, but it by means easy to play through. The story is rather lacking, though realistic, its sparse. Which suits the game well enough.Another annoyance is that you contract malaria as soon as the game begins. Why anyone would go to Africa without getting their Doxycycline out of the way first is dumb. Your main character could also be in a bit better shape, getting blurry eyed and wheezy after even a short sprint. I suppose this can be forgiven since he apparently does have malaria after all. Small gripes for me but ones I am willing to live with.I recommend this game as a rental, but if you turn out to enjoy it and not mind the short comings then pick it up. There is nothing worse than to drop your hard earned cash on a game to find it annoys you to no end. Plenty of shooting, burning and explosions, how could you go wrong? Be sure you are willing to deal with the annoyances and often dying.(UPDATE) After several days of play I have to say I am getting utterly sick of the totally tedious nature of this game. The endless amounts of driving to get a mission done, just to drive across the entire map again and get another one is unnecessary. It is true there is a 'bus system' but you still have to travel from the stations to your targets. Add to this fact that from getting your mission and getting to your target sight you will get in at least five gun fights is ridiculous. Then when this is added to the save system and the rebels later heavy armament, you waste a huge amount of time to accomplish nothing. I have to move my recommendation to a rental on this one, if at all. Too bad though, there is a lot of promise in this title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}

My wife loves the excercise titles on the Wii and DDR titles on both consoles. My 7-year old and her friends love the Wii Sports and other kids games. I enjoy the superior graphics and gaming experience on the 360. I am planning to get a PS3 next year. I had never even considered purchasing the PS2. Like some of the reviewers that one-starred the PS2, I wondered why it was even on the market anymore when there's superior gaming consoles available these days.Well, my little brother still has his PS2, so I would play it sometimes when I went to his house. Although the games certainly don't have the same quality graphics and sound as the 360 or PS3 obviously, I realised I still had a blast playing them. I noticed that most PS2 games sell for really cheap on Amazon, so I picked up a few games to take over with me to his place when I would visit. I love classic fighting games, so I was very pleased to find the Street Fighter collections and King of Fighter series on the PS2. Not to mention Soul Calibur 2 & 3 along with several Tekken and Mortal Kombat titles. Playstation 1 games are also fully compatible with no problems. You've also got the classic GTA titles, God of War 1 & 2, Castlevania (two 3D releases and two 2D titles via PS1 compatibility), Jaws, and the list goes on. My wife was excited to find out there are eight DDR titles on the PS2 and my kid loves the Eye-Toy games. To top it off, there are retro game collections from Capcom, Namco, Taito, Midway, etc. featuring games from the 90's that I loved playing as a kid. That's just the beginning of a huge library of thousands of PS2 games available and thousands more via PS1 backward compatibility. That was enough to sell us. It's been three months since we got the PS2 and we love it and play it just as much as the other systems. The other great thing is that we've been able to bulk up our PS2 game library at only a fraction of the cost of the other two consoles. This particular PS2 model is lightweight and comparatively small to other consols.Now I know why Sony is still shipping PS2s and why people are still buying them even after a decade; It still delivers a high-quality gaming experience which is not too far away from the 360 and PS3, and it does so at a lower cost. I think the only people who wouldn't like the PS2 in this day and age are die-hard gamers who demand nothing less than the best current 7th-gen graphics and online experience. For lighter gamers such as myself and for families who are looking for alternate gaming entertainment besides the Wii, the PS2 has a lot to offer.Suggestions: If you have an HDTV with progressive scan, there are several PS2 titles that support that format when using a component cable. You just press the X and delta buttons simultaneously when starting up the game. For a better picture quality, use an S-Video or component cable. Also, if you plan on getting Playstation 1 games, you will need to get PS1 memory cards as the PS2 memory cards don't work with PS1 games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2010"}

I was disappointed when I put the controller in the #1 slot and saw no indicator light come on. I wasn't sure if the light was broken or the entire slot was broken, so I resolved to use my wiimote for a few days and then attempt to charge it. To my surprise, I set the controller in the cradle and BAM, the light comes on. I guess it was operator error, or some other issues I am unaware of, but the thing works very well.It's nice not burning through 4 AA's/month and being able to charge these controllers. It is a nice attractive cradle for your wiimotes as well. I keep mine next to my seat on the couch. The battery covers are different from the originals, arguably more comfortable (& a better grip). The battery packs don't weigh more than normal batteries so it won't throw off your game. Also, I think it is actually boosting the signal of the wiimote. I used to have it flutter and jump around a bit on the screen like it was trying to maintain a connection... and that is completely gone now.This is just a good way to not have to use a lot of batteries. The charge holds for a long time, so you can still marathon play without worrying about slow charge times. It takes about 3 hours to full charge.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Eric San Juan","summary":"Unexpected fun, with a cool turntable controller","reviewText":"Well color me surprised. DJ Hero is a lot of fun! I didn't expect that. I didn't have doubts because of the music. Though I'm a rock and roll guy at heart, I enjoy listening to what a skilled DJ can put together, too. I just didn't see a GAME in it.Well, it turns out there IS a game in it, and it's a pretty fun game thanks to the unique turntable controller.If you've played Guitar Hero, Rock Band and other music rhythm games, you're already three quarters of the way towards understanding how to play DJ Hero. A song plays, in this case DJ mixes of two popular songs. Colored markers scroll down the screen towards you (this time on a giant LP), and you press buttons or perform actions in time with those markers. Meters fill up and you get to perform special actions.Simple, right? But DJ Hero has a few twists that make it a new experience. Those twists come, of course, from the turntable controller.This thing is pretty cool. It's not a full-sized turntable, but it's big enough to hold a 45 (that's a 7\" for you young `uns). The turntable portion has three buttons set where your fingers would be on the record, and it rotates for \"scratching.\" To the left are a crossfader slider, an effects knob, and other controls. The whole device is relatively large, and feels nice and sturdy. In my several hours of messing with the game I gave it a real workout, hammering at that crossfader and ripping scratches with gusto. It never felt like anything less than a solid piece of equipment.So how does this new gadget work in the game? Well, the three colored buttons on the turntable correspond to colored lights on the screen, just like Guitar Hero. You press the buttons in time with the music (duh). Guitar Hero and Rock Band have up to five colors, but that doesn't mean DJ Hero is easier because it only has three. Instead of button overload, it mixes in scratching - during certain portions of a song you've got to manipulate the turntable just as if you were scratching a record - and gives your left hand a deft workout with the crossfader, forcing perfect timing on your part. It's really quite a challenge, even if you're already experienced with music rhythm games. Like I said, similar concept to other music games, but different execution.The music itself is pretty good, featuring DJ mixes and mash-ups of popular songs by big acts like Blackeyed Peas and Gwen Stefani. I often felt like I wanted more of a sustained groove rather than the DJ gymnastic the game threw at me, but it IS a game, I suppose. Still, it makes me wonder if DJ Hero will ever be the party favorite that Guitar Hero and Rock Band became.There is one nice feature that will for sure offer it some party fun. A second player can plug in a guitar for some special DJ + guitar tracks, created exclusively for this game. That means Guitar Hero aficionados don't need to be left out in the cold when you plug in the turntable (available at retail as a wireless controller, so no actual plugging in is taking place). They can get right in on the action. These mixes are quite fun and, like the best of this sort of game, offer a lot of smiles, laughs, and good times. Let's hope they offer more of these mixes as downloadable content.The bottom line is, this game is FUN. Unexpected fun, but F-U-N fun all the same. And not just for wannabe DJs, either. If you like music, slick grooves, and rhythm games, chances are you'll enjoy this unique twist on the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"A console that defined my junior high years","reviewText":"1996. Rewind your mind. Coffee was the popular drink in group circles and Windows 95 was the staple in every PC-owning household.I was in fifth grade. It all started when I was at my uncle's house, where we usually faced off in Sega Genesis games like Primal Rage and Mortal Kombat. This time when I came over however, he had a new toy. I couldn't remember what it was called, but I heard him say \"station\". Space-station? Dream station? I didn't know for sure. (hint : it was the Playstation.)When he showed me what it was I was psyched. The games were on discs so I instantly thought it was mega expensive (and at that time, it was). I was used to seeing video games on cartridge. The control looked like an alien space ship with all of the weird symbols (X? O? Square? Triangle? What the? Where's the A, B, and C buttons?!). I thought it was a mathematical equasion, I honestly did.I was awed when he put in a fighting game. It was 3D, and the characters were slick and shiny. The screen expanded as the characters moved away from each other, and I remember that I liked the jaguar character the best (he roared).This game would later be identified to me as Tekken 2 through an internet search at my mom's house. I wanted the Playstation so badly I could cry. I asked for it for Christmas. I asked for it for my birthday. I never got it. It was too expensive. BUT, I did get birthday money - and save, save, save I did.Fast forward to November of 1997. Tonight was the night that I had finally saved enough money to buy a Playstation Game Console. It was a school night - but I didn't care. I wanted it! \"Remember your bedtime\" my mom's voice echoed in my head. I grabbed the $150 out of my dresser drawer and we took a trip to the local BX. I went all the way back to the gaming section while mom looked at perfume or something boring like that. Playstations had JUST come down in price, and though they were still pricey, mom said she'd spot me the rest. I saw the N64 sitting next to the Playstation for the same price. Believe me, I thought about it. Instinct told me to get the PSX and I carried it to the register.I made the right decision.The Playstation instantly had me swooning. The demo disc in the package had cool games like Rally Cross, Crash Bandicoot, Blast Chamber, and yes, wouldn't you know it - Tekken 2. I played the crap out of that demo. I had nothing else. So I kept saving for a game, and I saved for another 2 months before I had enough to buy my first game - Tekken 2. $39.95 at Sears.The rest is history, as I was welcomed in by great titles like Ace Combat, Twisted Metal, Resident Evil, and Final Fantasy VII.Great memories. But I will say today, if you do buy a Playstation, get the tiny one - the bigger model had a tendency to stop working after a couple years and in 8th grade I had to buy the new PSOne. (That PSOne is still working today, 10 years later). I went through two greys and my cousin went through one. They were not built as well as the newer models, so buy the tiny white PSOne.Happy gaming.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2011"}

Only an entry from Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto cross the 10 million barrier with consistency and ease. But The Elder Scrolls series beats them all in gamers' loyalty; the recent research indicates that TES has the greatest franchise engagement over any other popular video game franchise including CoD and GTA.No one can deny the incomprehensible popularity of The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim and that also is indisputable.YouTube has been littered with Skyrim related videos and Skyrim became cultural phenomenon creating numerous memes and jokes both famous or infamous (depending on how much you love or hate Skyrim). It also induced so many musical and other artistic tributes including angelic and otherworldly cover songs by Malukah and the violin cover by Linsey Stirling.Skyrim also garnered unamimous critical praises and countless Game of the Year awards including Game Developers Choice Award, Spike and GamesMaster Golden Joystick Awards. You know how many popular video game claim to be the game of the year on the front cover, right?  In case of Skyrim, it is absolutely true; literally hundreds.What is disputable is whether Skyrim really deserves all that success and accolades.The majority of the people like the game, some people love the game like no other games, some people hate the game with passion. Some people like the game but prefer Morrowind or Oblivion, other entries of the famed TES series.No video game ever is perfect and will ever be. Skyrim also has its shares of bugs and shortcomings.If you already hate Skyrim or Bethesda with passion, nothing will change your mind.If you already like Skyrim, I will be preaching to the choir.But if you somehow never play Skyrim, consider these facts.The absolute majority of video game last anywhere between 5 hours (trust me, there are quite a lot of them out there) to 12 hours, averaging 8 hours to 10 hours for single player portion. Skyrim will last bare minimum 100 hours spanning over 16 square miles of massive open world map, not counting indoor areas, dungeons and underground environments. The new Legendary Edition comes fully patched with the latest offcial patch 1.9.32.0.8. It also comes with 3 official DLCs; Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, all on the disc, expanding the already massive game even further.Skyrim offers almost 400 unique individual quests and the infinite amount of fetch quests in the form of Radiant Quest.It offers hundreds of locations including cities, villages, dungeons, forts, ruins and other points of interest.It also offers hundreds of non-unique quests, interaction with other NPCs and environments and other things to do.You literally can go anywhere anytime and do anything in any order in anyway you like, jam-packed with endless things to do.And I'm not talking about mindless mayhem spree like GTA clones when I talk about contents and freedom.I spent well over 300 hours playing the vanila Skyrim in my first playthrough.I also spent 50 hours on Dawnguard, 5 hours on Hearthfire and another 50 hours on Dragonborn.That is total 405 hours or more hours (all according to the in-game save files) for a single video game.I also spent another 100 plus hours playing for the second time trying different user created mods, thanks to the Creation Kit;Bethesda's own construction set and Skyrim Nexus site.Does any other single player video game offer this much sheer amount of gameplay contents all for yourself without ever tying to the Internet connection, and all for mere sixty bucks? I dare you to come out with an answer.There are reasons Skyrim became so successful both commercially and artistically.The incredible freedom and detailed gameworld are the main attraction of Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls series in general.The console versions are exactly identical with the PC version, minus the obvious graphical and performance Prowess of the PC version, howerver, there's one extra incentive that the PC version has over the rest; enter Creation Kit.TES community has arguably the largest and the most active modding community for PC game, since the days of Morrowind and through the days of Oblivion, coming out with contents by the talented modders from all over the world on a daily basis thanks to the powerful construction set released free for the public, the same tool used by the developers to create the game. For the game that literally never ends, Creation Kit extends the life of the game to almost an immortal status.  No other game has several channels on YouTube devoted strictly for mods updates and reviews like Skyrim does.There are games that do action better than Skyrim. There are certainly games that do story-telling better than Skyrim.But whatever the shortcoming one might find with Skyrim, Skyrim is so much larger than the sum of its parts that comes as complete whole to achieve its greatness. The sheer amount of contents and freedom Skyrim offers will not be easily matched by any other games outside The Elder Scrolls series and Fallout franchise anytime soon, and that also is indispubable.This new edition is great for people who never played Skyrim or people who played Skyrim but never played the DLCs.Dawnguard costed $20, Hearthfire costed &5 and Dragonborn costed $20 when first released, so this still is an attractive option if you never played three official DLCs.  The latest and most likely the final official patch 1.9.32.0.8. encompasses all the accumulative patches including mount combat, killcam for range and magic attack, legendary skills that removes the level cap and legendary difficulty mode.  And of course three official DLCs add tons of new NPCs, new weapons and armors, new items, new skills and skill trees, new shouts, new areas to explore, lands to buy, house to build, children to adopt and your own family to raise.  They expand and complete Skyrim like you've never seen.There's really no shame in playing Skyrim on consoles at all, but if you want to expand the horizon of what Bethesda has already offered you, you should definitely try the PC version, if not for anything else but the possibility to play both Oblivion and Morrowind in Skyrim engine to go back to the world of Cyrodiil and Vvardenfell (morrobliviondotcom).P.S.If you also have Oblivion GotY and Morrowind GotY along with Skyrim Legendary Edition, you just absolutely and positively have to visit Enderal mod at moddbdotcom, Nehrim mod at moddbdotcom, morrobliviondotcom and skyrimdotnexusmodsdotcom.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2013"}

Now the castle is back and to the rescue come Alucard, an acient vampire slayer with a shocking past. The castle is huge, the action is huge, and the enemies are huge!Throughout some of the more recent installments of castlevania there have been several different powers to acquire. whether those be magical cards, or the collection of souls, its been around. In this installment Alucard collects relics. These relics can do anything from allow you to jump twice in midair, to summon a ghost to help you in your battle through the castle. The relics are all nicely organized uin the pause menu, and are easily tuned on and off with the simple touch of a button.Another great addition to SOTN is the spells. You are able to buy magic scrolls from the merchant, which contain button combinations of how to perform different spells. Everything from health regeneration to summoning souls for a quick attack on the enemy, with ease! with this merchant comes my one and only gripe. In this game you only have the choice to sell of different gems, zircon, aquamarine, garnet, and so on. Toward the end of the game a relic which duplicates any item use becomes available, the only problem? its 500,000 dollars! seeign that the most valuable gem, the diamond, only pulls 20,000 bucks, it takes quite a logn time to find all the money for this item. I thought being able to sell off old, useless weapons, armor, and accesories would have helped this problem a long a bit better than simply wandering the castle for cash.In conclusion, it is impossible to talk about the plot of this game and not give anything away, so you will just have to play it. Take it from me, a person who has been collecting videogames for years and years, this game is going to attain a very high price tag in not very long. The original version can go for upward of 50 dollars, and ive even seen the greatest hit version for 40!

At the top of the list is Mario Kart which I elevate even above the Mario platformers, Zelda and Paper Mario by virtue of its replayablity. A week or so of Mario or Zelda and I'm ready to move on but I can keep playing Mario Kart for weeks and months and then years later come back and fall in love again. In fact Mario Kart 7 is arguably the most replayable of all the Mario Kart games for reasons I'll get into later.Not every iteration of Mario Kart has pushed the series forward. Double Dash added some now standard additions to the game but overall I considered it somewhat disappointing and a step backwards. Mario Kart 7 adds coin collecting; last seen in the original Mario Kart, as well as submersible driving, gliders and kart customization. Driving underwater is somewhat forgettable but the glider is a fantastic addition that opens up all sorts of new racing strategies. Hopefully it will become a permanent fixture. The big one this time is the kart customization. Although it's about as bare bones as one can get simplicity has always been a staple of Nintendo. Besides choosing the driver players can now choose the kart frame, wheels and glider. The glider is pretty much a non factor when it comes to adjusting stats and is mostly just for look but the other 3 customizations can have a big impact. The other monster change is 3D but the fact is the 3D is a hindrance to driving and not an asset. It's nice looking but after a few days I turned it of and never turned it back on again. Keeping the 3DS in the proper position to show the 3D effect takes effort that should be devoted to driving and if the 3DS is not in its sweet spot the screen looks blurry. On the other hand the circle pad is a huge improvement over the directional pad from the DS.The coins in the race serve two purposes. They boost the karts top speed (for the duration of the current race) for a maximum of 10 coins and with enough coins they unlock customization which increases replayability considerably. Coins only add to your grand total if they're gathered in grand prix not in time trials. There aren't necessarily better customization parts, just different ones. A lot of times I ended up using the tires and glider I got at the start of the game. The total stats for a kart remain the same for almost every customization, it just matters where you want to allocate your stats. I've seen many of the world record time trials using Metal Mario, B Dasher and Slick Tires probably because they max out the speed but they put the acceleration and handling terribly low so you'd have to run pretty much a flawless time trial (no hitting of the wall) or the benefits are lost. There are a couple of tires that have higher stat totals and the Red Monsters are frequently used by veterans.Mario Kart 7 has the same complaints leveled against it as previous iterations. No matter how well you drive, a streak of bad luck can kill a race particularly in 150 cc. Getting 3 stars requires a ton of skill and a lot of luck. Not only do you need to finish first in each race you also need to have probably 10 coins and one ill timed lightning bolt at the finish line will take away 3 of your 10 coins. If you get hit with a lightning bolt or blue shell while jumping a gap you lose 6 coins. I won't deny there have been many occasions of profanity when I suddenly go from first to worst with a rapid series of unavoidable mishaps. I'm fairly skilled with a lot of my time trials in the expert range but even I get near or at last place occasionally in a single 150 cc race even when my driving is near flawless.With an amazing 32 tracks (now standard) it's hard to get bored. I always love seeing the upgraded retro tracks like Koopa Troopa Beach and Kalimari Desert particularly with the new glider and submersible features. The number of characters perhaps could have been more but it is the most ever on a handheld Mario Kart game. Mario Kart 64 may be my all time favorite for nostalgic reasons but Mario Kart 7 is an awesome addition to one of the greatest game series of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"eau","summary":"Innovative, addictive and somewhat terrible","reviewText":"Watch Dogs was so hyped up after the E3 announcement that I thought this would be the next-gen game to watch out for. Now I have finally played the heck out of it, I thought I would summarize my thoughts on it.Watch Dogs is basically a open-world fusion of GTA and Assassin's Creed with Batman Arkham City thrown in. The story surrounds the protagonist Aiden Pearce who is a vengeful hacker against the new central ctOS system in Chicago after a hack job gone wrongand his family murdered. Aiden would use his hacking skill to exercise vigilante justice. This seems like a fresh idea but in reality hacking is simplistic and becomes repetitive over time.The open world environment and tons of side missions make it fun and addictive to play. You can drive, assassinate, shoot, blow things up or in whatever way you choose to get the job done. However, there are disappointed and terrible moments as well. Driving is not exactly enjoying because the control is not fun and it's hard to see what's in front especially in a fast car. Also, sometimes things get absurd like blowing up a fence but the fence remains standing, or you get a clean escape from cops in a boat because they are too hydrophobic.Graphics is not exactly jaw-dropping next-gen. While it's very nice and detailed, it's not a significant upgrade from the PS3/Xbox 360 era. It's perfectly fine for the gameplay and I'm not complaining.The single player mission would take you many hours to complete especially if you have to do all the side missions and quests. However, this could be repetitive and diminish your desire to finish it. Multiplayer is fun but lacking at times. There is virtually no co-op game mode. Instead, you get a variety of competitive game modes to play. Two modes I like the most are Intrusion and Decryption. They offer some unique gameplay which is different from the online military shooters that I've grown to love.Watch Dogs received so much hype and also got delayed because Ubisoft Montreal said to need more time to finish it. Now the finished product is a mixed bag. While it's fun and addictive, it also has terrible moments in which I almost threw my controller at the TV. There is plenty of room for improvement. It's like a lot GTA with innovative hacking scheme, but not as polished and grand as GTA. Anyhow, I would give this game 4 stars, for its innovative hacking gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"imgreenlantern2","summary":"Although fun has many issues that WILL ANNOY.","reviewText":"I was one of the many that waited a year or so to play this game and when I finally did I felt pretty good about my purchase.  Of course the game is too short, the graphics are phenominal, and the game play is refreshing and a nice change from the typical First-person shooter game.  BUT, this game has a tremndous amount of flaws that can cause many to stop playing the game.First, there are several bugs in the multiplayer that are very annoying.  Because I don't have time to list them all one of them is where several times I went to change guns and it would get stuck on my back and I had no way of defending myself.Another enormous annoyance this game has is the way the multiplayer is set up.  It's the same way in which MM games have been setting up for 10 years.  Tell the system what you want, wait to see what's available, select it, get kicked out of the room, try again, get kicked out again, finally get in, sit around for 2-5 minutes waiting for 8 players, some quit, some stay, finally you get your team together, things seem to be going well, then the host quits 1 round before the 19 round game is over, everyone is kicked out of the game, and all your hard work and 55 minutes is now gone.  Waisted...  Epic should have taken some notes from the ingenious Halo 2 multiplayer.  There's a reason Halo 2 is still played so much 2.5 years after release.There are half a dozen exploites in the game that are terrible that are heavily used.The worst part of the game is how the host of the game will have a HUGE advantage over all the players in the game, which gives the host's team an enormous advantage.  It's completely irresponsible that Epic gives that type of advantage to a player.Once I accomplished the achievements I wanted I dumped this game and have vowed to myself to never ever play it again, and unless Epic makes huge advances in Gears of War 2 I won't be back.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001L8DKJ8","description":"InPrinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular role-playing (RPG) universe ofDisgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"Finnally dood.","reviewText":"I've been waiting for another good platformer for a good long while and this one certainly delivers, it's tough, it's fun, it's funny and has some great art. It really has some nostalgic value since it's a very traditional platformer in many ways but it still brings a lot to the table.The craziest part is you get a thousand lives, that's 1,000 prinny lives to get the job done. There's two difficulty modes, one you get 4 hits before you blow up and die, the hard mode you get one hit and you blow up, though in both modes you have 1,000 lives to complete the game. There's a good amount of Disgaea comedy to it, you'll hear dood more than probably all 3 disgaea games combined, but it's just a hilarious adventure.I'm about half way through and it's really a great game, it's hard and frustrating at times but the game is so much fun and is so well done so it makes it worth it. I had purchased this direct from Rosenqueen and it came with a sound track, a prinny plush and a PSP prinny case, something you can't beat for a fan of the disgaea series / turn based strat games","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2009"}

The question is, how much better is it than the regular versions that came out a year ago? First thing you need to know, I have a very powerful PC. I probably get near the 60fps and I have a pretty sweet graphics card. How does this hold up against my PC? I have to say, very well and in many ways better. Maybe not because it's more powerful, but it's the time the developers took to make this game look prettier. They painstakingly took a computer air brush and redid everything. The lighting, the shadows, the textures and Lara herself got a face lift. It's argued by some people her new look is too funky, and I've heard her eyes resemble a Siamese cat! I can also notice that they removed the emotion that she might have had with the PC version. That would be the only nitpick, is that she doesn't have the facial features of sadness in the DE. Not sure why they went this route. Looks like she might be suffering from overuse of botox in this version. Be that as it may, the blood, her skin, and of course her hair got the most love in this game and still looks overall fantastic. I had zero slow down and the frame rates are supposed to average about 51fps for the whole game and in most instances hold a steady 55-60fps. I've had zero hiccups on this PS4 version and I'm about 50% through the game.Unbeknownst to many right now, the XBOX1 is suffering from lower frame rate issues. Whether its showing the system's lack of power, or it's developer skimping, we won't know till we get more games.

The quick answer is--not right now. I'll put it another way: I ordered one with myPlaystation Move Starter Bundle. After playing 5 different Move games and demos, it's still unopened in the package. My guess is it'll stay that way for a while.The Move Navigation controller is really just a Dualshock controller that's designed to fit in one hand more comfortable. As with the Dualshock, it has a joystick, four directional buttons, and the most commonly used \"X\" and \"O\" Playstation buttons all within easy reach of your thumb.Sony designed the Move controller (wisely IMO) not to have a joystick nor directional buttons. That makes it simpler and more elegant, but it also makes certain things (such as scrolling through a menu list of options) awkward to do with the Move controller alone (although not impossible--you can navigate through menus using the Move controller alone by pressing and holding the Trigger button and moving the controller up, down, left, and right).But so far I've found so far that just holding the Dualshock in my left hand and controlling the buttons and joystick with my left thumb is sufficient, if a little clunky, for most of what I need to do (unless you have freakishly long thumbs the \"X\" button will be hard to reach--but happily, pressing the \"Move\" button on the Move controller will do what you need in most cases).I'd assumed that like the Wii Nunchuk the Navigation Controller would have motion control built-in so you can control the on-screen action with both hands. It doesn't. For games that require motion control using two hands, you'll need to buy a second Move Controller. Most games that support two-handed operation will also provide the option to play one-handed, but I strongly recommend getting the second Move Controller, as it makes the experience truly immersive. Gladiator Duel on Sports Champions is a great example.As new games are created for the Move I'm sure the Navigation Controller will become more useful, especially with FPS-type games where you need to move and shoot at the same time. But if you're looking to save a little money, I'd recommend holding off on the Navigation controller for now and spending the money on a second Move controller instead until you find a game that really needs it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

Anyways, aside from the story you can look forward to battling a variety of different monsters with a whip like weapon called the combat cross. There are health and magic power-ups that you will also collect on your journey to rid the land of evil. If you have the option then get the PS3 version. I've got both Xbox 360 and PS3 versions and the PS3 version is one disc with a slightly better overall frame rate. The 360 version isn't bad, though it had to be put on two discs. I got both.

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:Greatly improved graphics from the originalExcellent storytelling, especially for the genreStrong enemy artificial intelligenceCons:Cooperative mode is dullDeathmatch only supports 2 players","reviewerName":"Spendsters","summary":"Top 5 greatest games of all time","reviewText":"Let me just say that after playing this game, you will never look at FPS games in the same way again.  The PC version of this is better in every way, but that is to be expected no matter what the game is (usually this is true anyway).From the moment you step off the underground tram, you are thrust into a world that is very dangerous, and very intriguing.  This game, along with Deus Ex, has possibly the best storyline and gameplay of all time.  You are in danger every second of this game, and you have to be smart about your actions.  If you run blindly into an area, you will 99.9% likely be cannon fodder for whatever lies in wait for you.  The government special forces, mutated monsters, and various environmental hazards are all that separate you from freedom...and/or instant death.  Be careful how you run around this government facility or you will be reloading a saved game quite frequently.Obviously, this game is dated now but it is still one of the best games ever created.  The graphics, AI, and storyline are incredible.  I absolutely recommend this game to anyone whom is interested in a realistic, gripping FPS game.Overall = Excellent","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2007"}

In spirit, they are successors to the classic game \"Gauntlet\", where a small group of heroes (each controlled by a separate player) hack their way through some huge number of monsters.  You take control of a character of a particular \"class\" and then proceed to kill monsters, gaining stats, abilities, and equipment along the way.  A lot of the enjoyment in these games comes from playing with other people (whether they be your friends or random people on the Internet), so it's really great that Blizzard's online service battle.net is free and easy to use.  The price of this collection has apparently been slashed from forty to twenty-five dollars, which is a great deal for these excellent games.The main draw of these games is their carrot-on-a-stick design: there's always something for you to do to increase the power of your character just a little bit more, whether it be farming for better gear, or simply gaining experience.  The game (at least Diablo 2) can also be rather challenging, with the hardest of the three difficulty levels being particularly so.  The variety of classes and, within each class, skill builds (again, for Diablo 2) also greatly adds to the re-playability of this game, since no two classes play alike.  This sounds rather similar to the gameplay of most popular MMOs (massively multiplayer-online games), but the action in the Diablo series is considerably faster and more complicated.Blizzard has shown itself to be unusually dedicated to the support of its older games.  Both Diablo 2 and Starcraft still receive patch updates to this very day, despite being eight and ten years old, respectively.  The online Diablo community has always been active, although since the announcement of Diablo 3 there has undoubtedly been a resurgence of interest in Diablo 2.  It's still easy to find up-to-date Internet resources about these games, as well as online games on battle.net.The graphics in these games is rather primitive, since they were released so long ago, but the gameplay is still the best of its kind, despite the numerous copycat games that the Diablo series has spawned.  If you're new  to the Diablo series and wondering what the hype is about, buy this collection and see for yourself.  More likely than not, you'll be pleasantly surprised, and will be eagerly awaiting Diablo 3 like millions of other gamers out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"StephLadder","summary":"Fun enough, I guess.  So, what else can you show me?","reviewText":"Being the first 'hot' PC FPS release of the year, I was looking forward to a great FPS experience with a few benchmarks broken (read my Crysis 1 - and other game reviews to see where I'm coming from).  Many of the reviews here are correct and precise about the flaws, some bugs and 'dumbing down' of this game... so I'll only agree with them and not go into detail here.  However, I will say I pre-ordered this game and paid a hefty price - so I expected to be reasonably pleased for the money. Am I?  Wellll... to be honest, I am enjoying it.  The lack of instant saves can be VERY annoying, but I usually try a different tactic on 3rd or 4th try (and up - I guess I'm just not very good even on 'Soldier' level ;-)  - and don't really mind that much because I'm stretching my 'enjoyment' factor as far as my $60 bucks will take me. Graphics are just fine (Win7/64/8gigs quad/ATI Radion 4600).  And game-play is also smooth enough.  HERE'S MY BIGGEST COMMENT/COMPLAINT: WHERE IS THE COMPELLING ORIGINALITY?!  I'm still looking for a 'new' game that \"wows\" me like HalfLife(2), Far Cry (with I loved - and played thru at least 4 times!!!) - and even NOLF (No One Lives Forever 2 for those uninitiated - which I also loved! The music was great!)  Staying in the city with Crysis 2 becomes somewhat boring after a while (yes... similar to F.E.A.R. as others have noted). I can't recommend this for the current price... I'd suggest you wait a while. It is, again, fun.  My lack of enthusiasm should give you a hint.Question: WHY pre-order and pay near $60 when a week later the 'instant order' price is only $52 (and receding)?  Consider this the end of my pre-ordering anything on Amazon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}

Now, I know that multiple people have wrote the same type of review here, but this game frustrated me so much that I felt that I needed to chime in as well, along with the two others who wrote a similar review to mine.On one note, I actually loved the color and diverse environments in this game, but there are two major flaws. The menu is extremely excruciatingly difficult to navigate through, you have to keep pressing X and Y all over again to find what you need, and the battle system is simply unforgiving. You have to wait for your attack to charge and sometimes you don't have time to wait for your attack to charge, and you end up getting gang beaten by all the monsters around you because your sword does not even hit the monster half the time, (yes you heard me right!!) half the time!!! That is unacceptable especially for an action RPG.For a turn-based RPG I may understand, but even on turn-based RPGs enemy evades rarely happen, and only happen when the character has an agility lowering spell cast on, but no in Secret of Mana, you have to miss the enemy more than 50% of the time trying to hit it and it really aggravates me!! There is one more thing about this game that is an absolute deal-breaker. When you try to exit a room, you have to forcefully gather your characters by either hitting select, or going back towards them, but what if an enemy is still in the way, well you character meets the reaper!! This is the epitome of poor game design, I absolutely cannot fathom that this game has even passed testing, let alone getting the Nintendo Seal of Quality back in its release in 1993, and being re-released on Virtual Console without the AI problems addressed! Thank goodness I only wasted $8 on this game, and not $60 on a SNES cart.

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Nikodem Leszek Blach \"Nik\"","summary":"Better and worse than Demon's Souls","reviewText":"Forgive me for comparing this game so closely to it's predecessor. If you haven't tried Demon's Souls then you may honestly not know what you're getting into with this title, haha.  For many it's a very difficult fantasy game where the reward comes from succeeding where you once (or 100 times) failed.The games are almost identical in presentation and though Dark Souls says it's open world (and it is) it's really no different or any larger than Demon's Souls.  Simply, instead of teleporting to places through a hub you open up short cuts to different areas of the game. And, eventually, you can teleport anyway to about 5-6 different primary locations around the map to get anywhere super fast.Anyway, I had a lot of fun.  Dark Souls is definitely easier than Demon's souls by far.  In this game you can actually take a hit and you can kill a boss in 1-2 hits if you level up a weapon enough.  Hell, in new game+ I managed to kill 2 bosses with 1 hit each, and I was only 25 hours in (as In, I beat the game in under 25 hours, and within the first few hours of new game + I could do that much damage).The strongest point of Dark Souls Vs Demon's Souls is the online integration.  They really did a good job this time! The covenants are Awesome and staying in human form and playing online is the best way to go about it.  You'll reap enough benefits that it'll be worth your time and the occasional super hard opponent (My personal favorite is the forest covenant.  Every time someone 'invades' the forest you get summoned into their game to stop them).  The game also has NPCs that will help you with bosses if you get to them in human form (Demon's Souls had this for the dragon at the end but I don't remember anywhere else).And now the flaws and why this is a fun game but not a \"Great\" game -1. There is No Story.  And keep in mind, I felt Demon's Souls had a Great story, so I'm not that picky.  Dark Souls throws you into this world, some meaningless dialogue is thrown at you, and you start your adventure.  About the best story thing to follow is information about the world and certain characters, the general 'plot' or why you're doing what you're doing is never really revealed to you in a meaningful way (and the ending... well, let's just say, you beat the boss and within 1 minute the new game+ begins, they don't explain Anything after it's all said and done).  Don't get me wrong, there are lovable characters and you'll want to pursue continued dialogue with some... but, I won't give a name, but there is 1 awesome character you'll come across about 7 times in the game but turns out if you don't follow a certain strategy exactly you won't be able to see final scenes with him.  You basically Have to use a strategy guide if you want to get the most out of the story, and I hate that.  Literally, talking to someone More than Twice will cause something in the game to change, and in the specific situation I'm referring to, for the worse.  So, yeah, I hate to say but this is not a game to be purchased for story.2. Mechanics - They sorta screwed up the mechanics a bit.  I was a melee/heavy armor user so this didn't bother me as much but my girlfriend made a magic/dexterity class and the lock on system is completely screwed up in Dark Souls.  You'll frequently shoot magic right over an enemies head and your character won't re-adjust anything unless their actual body is moving.  It's a bit frustrating and even homing magic will just fly in a straight line sometimes when locked on and they're directly infront of you with a solid 10 feet for the magic to arc down. It makes no sense. So if you're making a magic user, be warned, it can be a little screwy (But she still managed to beat it without too much of a problem)3. Camera Angles.  Seriously, they can be Really annoying when the game tries to auto-readjust for you.And for those who haven't tried Demon's Souls I'll try to hit on the strong points --Great upgrade system where certain boss souls and rocks you find create custom and special weapons, and you can basically turn any basic weapon to build off any stat you want, even swords that do more damage based off your faith stat and so forth.-Very fun and interesting boss fights and you can genuinely fight any boss however you want - magic or melee - they're built very fair this time around and I appreciate that Sooo much.-Combat is hard but very fair.  This is one of the few games where enemies do as much damage as you do.  Shield up and keep that stamina high and you'll do just fine.-Lots of areas and secrets to explore.  You could potentially beat the game without fighting every boss too (I think...)-Decent length game.  It took me under 30 hours to beat it, but I think for most it would be in the 35-40 category.  I got a platinum on Demon's Souls and went all the way to New Game+++ in order to get those last few trophies so I definitely started this game with an upper hand.  You will die and it can get frustrating, but there is always a way to win and eventually, you will win.And one strategy if you find it hard - Utilize the covenants :D The online aspect of the game makes it Easier.  If you join the forest covenant for example and you kill a player who's invading (they'll summon 2 people at a time to stop them) you get their souls.  Now, this game is Really Sweet in the sense that in their game, they simply drop their souls, so they can run back and grab them, but you still get 100% of them to keep (luckily this game doesn't have any sort of economy cause that would screw it up, haha).  I Literally jumped from level 40 to 60 off 1 kill where the person dropped almost a million souls.  So, utilize those and everything will be Much easier.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00IIHU44E","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"Great System in a Slightly Disappointing Bundle","reviewText":"The Xbox One already has plenty of reviews that go into detail about its features and flaws, so I won't spend too much time rehashing those points. Basically, it is an excellent system with a game drought. Fortunately, Titanfall is here to wet our game appetites.My main thoughts about this have to do with what is included in this *TITANFALL* bundle:- Xbox One Standard Console- Xbox One Standard Controller- Xbox One Standard Headset- Titanfall Digital Download CodeHere is what is NOT included:- Xbox One Titanfall Edition Console (exists, but is unavailable to the general public; search Google Images, it looks awesome)- Xbox One Titanfall Edition Controller (available separately)- Official Titanfall Gaming Headset (available separately)- Titanfall Retail Disc (available separately)Can you guess where I'm going with this? Since this bundle is the same price as the standalone Xbox One console, there's no reason not to buy it if you were going to get an Xbox One anyway. But it is a TITANFALL bundle, yet doesn't even include the awesome-looking Titanfall controller Microsoft designed, nor the console, nor the headset, nor the physical game disc (which can be lent/borrowed/resold/etc). The digital copy is still good, and has its own advantages (doesn't require swapping discs to play the game), but with game installs taking up anywhere from 20-50 gigabytes, I personally prefer to have the physical copy since these 500GB hard drives will get filled up FAST. And re-downloading these huge games and shuffling around all your digital library will get real annoying real fast, and is much more easily done by reinstalling from discs than by re-downloading everything.Anyway, that's really my only complaint with this; the distinct lack of Titanfall in a Titanfall bundle. I'll move on now.Titanfall itself is actually pretty fun. None of the core elements of the game are entirely new, but it is nonetheless a fresh take on the whole Mech genre. It has a lot of focus on RPG-esque level-ups and challenges to help you unlock new weapons and armor abilities. Sound familiar? To keep up with the competition, you pretty much need to quickly learn how to effectively combat the titans as a little defenseless human, otherwise your average life expectancy will be around ten seconds. You'll probably spend about 20-30% of your time in games in your Titan, and the rest outside of it. The quicker you get kills and points, the faster you will reach \"Titanfall\", where your Titan drops and allows you to board it. This is pretty much the whole game, across several different levels.Fun as the game is, I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed they didn't put any type of single player/co-op campaign in the game. I always like completing FPS campaigns before jumping into the multiplayer, and I find 4 player co-op campaigns to be particularly fun. Being an EA game and multiplayer-only means you're really just leasing the game for a few years, since EA is known for cutting off its game servers well before the console is past its usable life (several of their 360/PS3 games have had their servers down for years now).I would also have to be honest and say that while Titanfall's graphics are certainly impressive and better than your typical Xbox 360 game, it's not by much. Going from, say, Halo 2 (Xbox) to Gears of War (Xbox 360) had way more noticeable graphical improvements than going from Halo 4 (Xbox 360) to Titanfall (Xbox One). So far, there still just aren't any PS4 or Xbox One game that really make me go \"HOLY CRAP\" like Gears of War did back in 2006. Oh well, maybe those games are still on the way.So overall, this is a great console with great potential still waiting to be fully unleashed. Titanfall brings some much needed life to the party, but I don't think it will be this generation's new blockbuster gaming franchise like Gears of War turned out to be back in 2006. But again, though I'm disappointed in the lack of Titanfall \"stuff\" in this bundle, if you were planning on getting an Xbox One anyway, you may as well still get this bundle since a free downloadable game is better than nothing. See you on the battlefield!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube.

When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies.

Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Resident Evil Remake is one of the best remakes ever..","reviewText":"STARS Bravo team has been sent into the Arklay Mountains in Raccoon Forest to investigate strange reports of savage murders. When the Bravo team fails to report in, the Alpha team goes in. Not only do they find the Bravo helicopter on the ground and destroyed with no one around, but shortly after the Alphas are attacked and forced to retreat to a seemingly abandoned Mansion. Your mission is to uncover what - exactly - is killing everyone, why its killing everyone, how it all started, and to find both the missing Bravo & Alphas soldiers.Resident Evil is a third person survival horror game, and honestly, its a masterpiece. You start off choosing who you want to control - Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine - and pending on who you choose the game plays slightly differently. For instance, when your Jill you meet Barry Burton but when your Chris you find Rebecca Chambers. From there you explore different areas, unlocking doors, solving mind boggling puzzles, gathering keys, and shooting monstrosities such as zombies and frog-looking things with huge claws called Hunters with handguns, shotguns, grenade launchers, and other weapons. You get these things called \"Defense Items\" such as daggers or tasers so when a monster grabs you, you can stab it so that way you not only get it off of you but gives you a few seconds to figure out a plan of action.In this remake of the Playstation 1 classic, you have to do something a little differently then in the original. When you slaughter a zombie you must burn the body to actually \"kill\" it or blow off its head. To do this you have to find a flask and kerosene, and from there light the bugger. If you fail to do so, over time the zombie will become a \"Crimson\" otherwise known as Super Zombie and come back to attack you with much faster & devastating moves.Theres a pretty decent replay value for a few reasons. For starters there are many different endings (I believe something like 10) depending on who you rescue, and who you let live or die. From there, if you beat the game in under something like 3 hours you can unlock different costumes, a \"hidden zombies\" version of the game, a single \"ferocious zombie\" version of the game, the rocket launcher w/ infinite ammo, and other things. Also, in this remake, they added a lot of extras such as a new place to explore, more enemies, more interesting cut scenes like a clip of Kenneth's death, new scares, etc.The graphics are not only about 100 steps up from the original game, but truley look AMAZING. I'm forced to admit that this is probably one of the most terrifyingly realistic looking games ever - especially for the Gamecube. The enviroments are dark, spooky, life like and downright scary. When lightning strikes outside, you can see the flash through windows. The characters (including monsters) look amazing and unique. The lighting is superb in this game as well.The music is just straight up freaky, and really truley help add some darkness to the already scary atmosphere. It helps keep the tension built and helps leave the gamer on the edge of the seat. The voice acting is not \"great\" per sae, but definitley better than the Playstation version's. The zombies moaning and dogs howling were great, and the sounds of the shotguns blowing them to pieces was even better :).What sucks about this game is, just like every other Resident Evil, the high amount of back tracking & the inventory management - though the management actually helps add some suspense if done right. Like I said, you'll be backtracking ALOT...and by a lot I mean it will take up a great deal of your game play time. But really, it's worth it. Also, they got rid of the live action people and replaced it with computer animated people.. I guess it fits more with the game but im an Old Schooler and I liked that stuff.RE isn't too long if you understand the puzzles, begin to learn the level layouts fast, take out enemies efficently & effectivley, or played the original game like I did. I'd say, for newbies, anywhere from 4-8 hours... other people woll have it done in 3 or less.The controls are a bit clunky, but you get the hang of them really fast - especially the useful 180 degree turn that can get you away from fights fast.To finish it up, fans of survival horror or Resident Evil will truley love this game, or those waiting for a game that will scare the bejesus out of them on the childish Gamecube. I know I did, and since this game only costs about $5 its a must have. Truley a great hommage and tribute to the original game that came out god knows how long ago.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2006"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Capt.

So far I have done a few missions, had duels, saved a woman, herded cattle, caught wild horses and broke them, stopped rustlers, worked nightwatch, hunted various critters from rattlesnakes to birds to rabbits and deer to name a few.  I have even picked wildflowers! lolYou can easily sit down and think you are only going to play for a few minutes but end up spending hours at a time on it.  Time just really passes by doing various activities in the game.I rode a stage coach, drove one too.  I haven't taken the train yet but you can do that as well.

To save a horse, just hitch it to a hitching post. =)  Don't forget to park your horse! lolYou can purchase properties to save your game and reload on ammo or change outfits.  You can also camp in the open terrain to do some of that as well as fast travel back to places you have visited.The terrain is wide open and pretty vast.

Start with a single character, then travel through the world, gathering a party of up to 10 different characters.","reviewerName":"Abhilash.R \"The Sagittarian\"","summary":"Well worth your time","reviewText":"The beauty of Dungeon Siege lies in its simplicity. It is not often that you get an RPG which has both a simple user friendly interface and an engine that automatically customises the way you play your character.Dungeon Siege is the work of Chris Taylor, the genius behind the award winning Total Annihilation. His goal was simple: Create a game that is not riddled with overhwhelming statistics and present a clean and understandable interface that is accessible to all kinds of gamers. And Taylor has succeeded in both areas.Dungeon Siege simply moves away from the hardcore D3D rule-based RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate etc and instead allows a player to expertise in either Melee, Ranged, Combat Magic or Nature Magic classes. The three essential skills that get affected according to your style of play are Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. But instead of customising skills manually, you play the character the way you like and the system will automatically enhance your character's skills in that class acordingly. This is an incredible and innovative feature. So if you want to expertise in Swords and Maces, your melee skills and strength evolves. If you want to develop in ranged combat, your dexterity and armor rating gets enhanced. Consequently you are awarded titles like Swordsman, Marksmam, Archmage etc. If you plan to infuse both Melee and Ranged skills you become a Man-at-Arms etc. The combinations are truly staggering. As the main character, you can hire folks, to a maximum of eight, whom you can cutomise to suit your style of play. So a well balanced team should comprise some fighter, ranger and spellcasters. Dabble with the group in any way you like. It's really fun.You have stores from where you can trade stuff and also have the ability to buy pack mules which carry three times your inventory. Another innovative , and really vital, feature introduced in Dungeon Siege is that you drink potions only as much as you need. This could prove valuable in certain tough-to-beat fights. So if you are a newcomer to the world of RPGs, Dungeon Siege doesn't bog you down with difficult levelling ups. You play in manner that fits your style and consequently have more fun. I think that's what Taylor was looking at. The fun factor. And he has definitely achieved that.But the game wouldn't have been fun it wasn't impressive to look at and Dungeon Siege has made absolutely sure you don't turn your face away from the screen even for a second. To this day, the graphics are one of a kind. True 3D environments allow you to gaze through the deepest gorges and stare the most vast and forbidding landscapes from a tower. The characters and animation is so well done that you can actually see their outfits appear perfectly distinct and in-sync with what is shown in the inventory. The spell affects are great and myriad enviroments are all distinct and beautiful. In short, this is the best looking game in the RPG genre. I would rate Neverwinter Nights alongside, but this game has true depth and grandeur. For a game of this scope, what is absolutely astonishing is that the game has practically no loading time. Each terrain seamlessly loads up without pausing or breaking the gameplay. Please do me a favour. If you ever come across a bridge, pan your vision so that you see the gorge from above or at an angle. It is breathtaking and a testament to the hardwork and talent of Gas Powered Games.The music is something that isn't as epic as you would hope. The soundtrack is mainly generic but it serves its purpose. However, there are a few set pieces that are truly outstanding. Almost classical in tune. I was absolutely spellbound, listening to a soft mandolin score while I gazed at the lovely ice capped mountains. I assure you, such moments come quite often and are memorable.After all the wonderful features that Dungeon Siege has introduced, it cannot but spill out a few disappointments. For one, the story is absolutely ludicrous. Being an RPG, there is no characterisation. Hence you cannot empathise much with any of the NPCs or characters in your group. The game comes with minimal conversation and the voice acting is pretty average. The world of Ehb, though fantastic, is a bit nonsensical in structure. And the gamers who have grown to love the rich D&D; rules used in the classic RPGs will sorely miss and get turned off by lack of manually customisable features.However, the positives far outweight these blemishes. Dungeon Siege is terrific entertainment. It is game that doesn't take itself too seriously but it presents the technology in the most accessible manner possible. Do yourself a favour and check out Dungeon Siege. Have a nice day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2005"}

Everyone back in july and may were saying this game was great.  Don't buy into the hype.  I promise you if this wasn't made by rockstar it would've gotten horrible reviews.  Everything about this game is good except WHAT TRULY MATTERS IN A GAME!There is nothing to this games free world, no destruction, no chaos to create beyond textbook GTA stuff and almost no sense of freedom besides tapping A for 10 minutes then in the singleplayer the horses are slow enough as it is so during quests you will have to hold A so your horse follows your friends who have no sense of urgency.Let me explain so a woman is about to get executed and you and a bunch of cops have to go save her.  They're trotting there horses while this beautiful woman is about to be killed.  So while you're forced to screw around or fail the mission someone who you're responsible for is going to die.Singleplayer is not why you play a rockstar game, you play it to run around destroying stuff and causing havoc.  Rockstar seems to think people play games like GTA for their story.  The story of every GTA I ever played has been bland and boring.Go help this guy shoot some people, go steal this, rape these women etc cookie cutterThe multiplayer is a joke too.If you seriously think you'll like this game buy it.  I played it till the end and can't stand this game.  It is an insult to good gaming, it's boring, lacks an escape from reality and has no replay value.

As have many reviewers had, this game is unfinished compared to the PS3 version. You can't play together with a friend online in the same house. You should wait until there's a fix for this. Update, they won't fix this problem.Also, if you don't like seeing content and have no way of playing it now - don't get this game! There are much DLC content on the disc that you have no way of using, but can buy later on to use. This is very hurtful to many people that feel it's wrong to not be able to use content on the disc without paying more money for it. It not even just a few characters, it's 12 characters! And, you can get them all for $20. But that's a lot of money for characters that are already on the disc and supposed to get until they were removed and now you have to re-purchase them again to use them on the disc. WTF? Is all I have to say about that.Finally, the PS3 ver has 4 more characters than the Xbox 360 ver. This is not fair at all. Capcom won't fix this and that just how it is. The characters are supposed to be Sony only characters and that's why they cannot be on the xbox 360 ver. This might be a even more reason why the PS3 ver is just plain out better!Since it's Crapcom, expect there to be a re-release for this game or something that you would never have thought would be done by Capcom.----------------------------------Update, there won't be anymore release as it's been over 10 months now and no word of it doing that. Instead, Crapcom will be doing more DLC for addition, but the way people are treating this game, there might not even be that, which than people are very please about too.This game is worth $5 or less anything after that is paying well too much as you still need to pay another $20 just for the other 8 DLC characters.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"W. Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"Could've been a contender","reviewText":"I have fond memories of the first Turok on the N64. The original was a very good ,well balanced game. I really enjoyed it. But this version leaves allot to be desired. The levels are painfully linear ,while that's not always a bad thing,it's just that in the jungle I had hoped for a more open jungle environment. The knife is also insanely overpowered against the majority of the dino's ,usually one screen prompted LT pull and there dead in an instant. While this also ins't such a bad thing, but unfortunatley  what it advertently does is take away some of the suspense of being hunted by dino's. Like the first game I remember being tense and worried about the next dino encounter ,this game quickly lets you know with a knife in your hand ,you can kill them in one fell swash of the blade. I digress though the very last boss battle is a sight to behold,you actually encounter 3 large T-rex's throughout the game, but the VERY last one is HUGE and looks quite good. Unfortuneatley a few well placed shotgun blasts to the head and he's down fairly easy. The last 2 levels actually are better than the first 80% of the game. I wish the devs had started there and moved up. You'll also encounter human enemies which all can be fed to the dino's with some manipulation from you,but this is more gimmick than a deep,meaty part of the gameplay. While I have fond memories of the first game's entire package , This version uses too many ,tired and overdone FPS staples. I expected much more from the Turok series and I had high hopes this game would've been much better. Instead you get a linear ,cookie cutter FPS ,with some dino's thrown in for the fun of it. I had imagined an open vast area ,with a bow on my back and a knife in my hand. Maybe some weird combination of Just Cause open-ness combined with the gameplay mechanics of the first game. But instead you get a linear,basic coridoor shooter disguised as an open jungle game. It's worth a playthrough for the LAST BOSS ,and the last 2 levels offer up some good FPS gameplay action. But I hold TUROK to high standards, if I was producer or developer I would'nt have signed off this game as being done. Turok deserves more respect. But for $20 it's a good deal IMO.

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Hauntingly detailed, mentally unsettling, but just a bit too short...","reviewText":"My initial fears that this was just an overhyped Resident Evil clone were quickly put to rest - although the two games share a genre and pieces of a control scheme, their personalities couldn't be further apart. Where the first three Resident Evils focused on the cheesier, blood-n-guts style with a hint of puzzle solving in the name of variety, Silent Hill 2 concentrates much more on the unknown, the unexplained and the psychologically disturbing. Where Resident Evil 2 is horror in the vein of Dawn of the Dead, Silent Hill 2 is more along the lines of The Ring or The Shining.It's that establishment of potential horror, not the actual moments of battle where the monster lies revealed, that are most successful in Silent Hill and, honestly, in most of the better films within the genre. To say that this game is lacking in real scary moments would be both unfair and untrue... I jumped more times than I'm comfortable to admit while playing through this one in the dark... but it properly uses such moments as an accent, rather than a crutch. It's been said that the most horrific monster in the world can never be captured on film, because it resides within the collective imaginations of the audience. Hollywood can never frighten you as badly as you can frighten yourself. It's this kind of mentality that I see reflected in Silent Hill 2 from the very get-go. Sure, they do eventually show you the monsters, and they're significantly horrific on their own, but they're all little more than pawns in this scheme, even the bosses. They're just around to nudge your mind in the right direction, so that the little shadows you'll catch darting around at the edge of your field of vision can be more effective and more relative to the story.In terms of atmosphere, there's very little that this game does wrong. It's learned all the right lessons from the progression and evolution of cinematic horror and applied them to the incomparably personal experience of a quality video game. It's established a unique style, a great cluster of settings, and a wonderful premise (the lead character, James, receives a letter from his wife three years after her death, pleading with him to visit the town of Silent Hill) but the actual follow-through of the story and the accompanying character interactions are lacking. This reminds me of Eternal Darkness in a way, in that a lot of the strange occurrences and developments seem completely random and are never connected to the story itself. Almost universally, the cast is detached from reality, lacking in personality and in emotion, which works within the confines of the plot but results in the player never being fully drawn into the game's world.I came away from this game feeling as though I'd read a short story that had been padded out and enlongated thanks to the inclusion of a dozen different unrelated asides. It's a fifty page story stretched over the course of a three hundred page novel. You'll meet five non-playable centric characters around the city, but only two of them have a real bearing on the plot, which is itself little more than a series of vague insinuations. It's a real shame, too, because all of the pieces have been set in the right place to accommodate for a much more striking, intriguing tale.Controlling James as he explores the city is fairly easy, if not entirely ideal. Several elements of the Resident Evil control scheme have surfaced with Silent Hill 2's configuration, most notably the \"boat steering\" movement controls. If you didn't like standing in one place, pivoting and then running directly forward or backward in Capcom's zombie-fest, you aren't going to like it here. Personally, I've grown used to it and the steering doesn't seem to get in my way any more, but I can certainly see why some players would have developed a bitter hatred for it. One thing that differs from Resident Evil's traditional setup, however, is a fully polygonal environment and a free-roaming camera. What that means is less cheap scares and monsters hiding in plain sight, and a much more interactive experience.I'll come right out and admit to savoring every last bit of the visual direction and graphical representations of Silent Hill 2. If there's one area that this game absolutely nails, it's this: everything from the character designs to the environments to the simple, yet undeniably successful, film grain texture that overlays every moment of gameplay... it's all an unbridled success. This is among the most thought-out, fully realized visual productions I've ever seen in a game, and even the hardware limitations of the original Xbox are addressed in a concise, effective manner that works within the confines of the big picture. The dreamlike state of your visit to the town explains away the boundaries around the playable area... you don't run into an invisible wall, there are just mysterious tarps or bottomless pits sealing off certain parts of town. You'll accept it at face value because, hey, you just fired three rounds into a set of animated mannequin legs.Another noteworthy visual innovation is the complete lack of any kind of heads-up display or on-screen indicator. With the multitude of potential actions and inventory items that seem to have completely overtaken the industry, it's a nice change of pace to see a game with just a character and an environment on the screen at any given time. It not only keeps the playing field open for some of the more subtle effects, but also makes the experience even more akin to that of watching a movie.The appearance of the monsters remains among the most successfully frightening I've ever seen. It's easy to throw sharp teeth, bumpy skin and red eyes onto something, call it an enemy and commence with the cheap scares. What's not so easy is introducing a baddie that's horrifying if just because you have no idea what in the living hell it really is. The bad guys of SH2 are, obviously, the latter. They don't always look so much like they're attacking you out of anger, so much as they're lashing out because they're constantly in pain and see anything that moves as a possible cause. I almost felt pity for these things, their existence is so pitiful, so filled with tragedy.I can't rightfully discuss the visuals of this game without giving some love to the incredible lighting effects, either. I'd truthfully rank this game ahead of the original Splinter Cell in that category, and Sam Fisher's first romp was released almost specifically to show off everything the Xbox could do in that respect. In Silent Hill 2, you travel the entire city with just a flashlight, which (needless to say) is handled magnificently. Everywhere you go, that single light source is playing with your surroundings to cast all sorts of bizarre, frightening, downright malicious shadows throughout the roomI adored the majority of my experience with Silent Hill 2. The story, while thin at times, is generally workable and never really insultingly self-indulgent. The length of the game bothered me a bit, as the main game map is quite elaborate and seemed to have a lot of unrealized potential, but that goes back to the weakness of the basic plot and the lack of any major side stories of consequence. If you've got a weekend to kill and want to be emotionally shaken, this is exactly the game for you. It features one of the best all-around identities in the history of the industry, takes dozens of hints from the lessons learned by its predecessors in film, and is truly horrifying on several levels. If the story had been a little thicker and the cast had been fleshed out a little further, this would've been close to perfect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B002B1TDV8","reviewerName":"J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"Delivers almost as much as it promises","reviewText":"Scribblenauts is a unique puzzle game that has been impressing a lot of people.  The concept is simple, but very ambitious:  present players with small 2d levels where the goal/mission/end can be reached using anything the player can imagine.The main character, Maxwell, is given a notepad at the beginning of the game, during the tutorial.  At any time, you can access the notepad with a tap of your stylus, opening up a keyboard interface.  Simply type in a word (with a few exceptions, i.e. nothing vulgar or copyrighted) with your stylus and what you type will appear in the level you're playing.  Every object has it's own cartoonish 2d artwork, behavior, properties and abilities.  The way these objects interact with Maxwell, the environment and each other is the focus of the game.  It's a big departure from pretty much any other game available.  It's a giant, exciting sandbox to play in...for the most part.There's plenty of meat to the game.  The developers of Scribblenauts took their time crafting hundreds of levels.  Most levels require coming up with the right tool(s) for the job.  This may sound too simple, but as the game progresses, the challenge ramps up.  Also, you are encouraged to go back to previously completed levels to replay them in advanced mode - you'll be tasked with completing the level three times in a row without being able to call upon objects used in previous attmepts.  Another excellent incentive to flex your creative muscles is the reward of Ollars - the games currency used to buy unlockables.  You receive more Ollars from a board when you complete with style, few objects and a quick time.As much as I wanted to fall in love with Scribblenauts, there are some major negatives.  The biggest fault is in the control of Maxwell.  Often, and I mean often, you will have to try several attempts to get him to do what you wanted.  Even simple things like climbing a ladder can become a chore thanks to the imprecise controls.  When the controls are working though, this game really shines.  It's easy to get lost in Scribblenauts when things are going the way you plan and that makes it all the more frustrating when they don't.  Hopefully, I'll get used to the controls and find them easier to use, but for a game relying on simplicity, there's little excuse for a learning curve.  Also, while the programmers did a commendable job with how objects interact, you'll inevitably run into many instances where things don't according to plan and even some where the interactions don't exactly make sense.  An improved physics engine would have gone a long way into correcting some of these issues.Overall, this is just an amazing concept for a DS game.  It's execution is certainly shy of perfection, but offers more than enough to warrant a purchase.  Given the scope of the game, it's hard to fault the developers for much of anything.  My biggest worry was never the controls or the amount of obscure objects included; it was whether or not Scribblenauts would end up being fun.  It is a lot of fun!  An educational problem-solving game that appeals to such a wide audience and is this much fun rarely comes along.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"G. Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"So far ,  very good!","reviewText":"I just wanted to make a comment. Anyone who has been using anything BUT the analog stick for driving hasn't really gotten what this game is all about. If you're pissed off because you can't use the D-pad to drive, puh-LEASE.I agree with all reviewers who say that you should start with GTA 3, then work up to Vice City and THEN tackle this game, rather than jumping in cold. I hadn't played this game when I first wrote this review, but I own and have beaten both of the previous games and I know it took a lot of practice. This game seems to be much more intense and frustrating than the others, so get some experience.I have now gotten the game and just spent the last 6 or so hours playing it. First the good...The size and scope is truly immense, I am still getting lost in the first city of Los Santos and environs, all of which is easily the size of all of Vice City and more. And we have two more cities of equal dimensions.Swimming is a lot of fun and now i don't wince everytime i chuck off a bridge through no fault of my own. The bikes are a cool addition, as are the gyms and the off-track betting, don't go to the betting store downtown if you have a gambling habit. I also enjoyed the video games in the convenience store, playing basketball, and i'm sure there are tons of other stuff I haven't discovered yet. I can't wait until I get to the trains, driving on the tracks with a car isn't the same thing...Voice acting and music is on point, my two roomates immediately asked me if this game was based on the early 90's L.A. without even knowing what it was about. As a Jamaican, i give Rockstar 100% props with K-Jah west, all authentic dancehall and reggae tunes from the period with real Jamaican DJs. I was there smiling and listening to 90's classics like \"Bam Bam\" by Chaka Demus and Pliers, and \"Great Train Robbery\" by Dennis Brown among others. Good stuff, good stuff. Wicked and wild, schidily-whoa-oh-oww. Zeen!Gameplay is similar to the first two, you should be able to land on your feet if you're experienced with them. To my eye, the graphics are similar to the first two as well, maybe not as slick as Vice City's but I really don't care about graphics that much. They don't suck, that is for sure.There is a HUGE selection of cars and drivable vehicles, at least 3 times that of Vice City which was quite a large library in its own sense.Now the bad.While I am still in Los Santos and haven't hit the other missions yet, the missions i've done so far are harder for the most part than those you'd see at this point in the first two. Cash flow is also a bigger problem, you don't get paid for most of the missions thus far and if you do get paid, it's like $200 or $500 for \"beer.\" It makes it more real but I'm not the kinda person to go hustling for cash. To be fair, i haven't had to buy anything of high value yet like guns or safe houses, most of my weaponry has come from fallen enemies or Emmett (you'll see) but that means I don't have anything decent. All in due course I guess...I've seen some other safehouses in Los Santos besides the one you start with, but I am not sure where i'm supposed to get $10 grand from.Haircuts are way too expensive, $500 for an Afro?? There are probably too many options for customizing, but i'm just lazy.The game's immensity is a two-edged sword, there's a lot to explore but also a lot of ground to traverse and you spend a lot of mission time commuting. I made a concious effort to work out at the gym, you should definatly make an effort to get toned and stuff. I'm not sure how to improve stamina quicker than I can, but buffing up muscle is pretty easy and can be done quickly, wish I could do it that quickly in real life :)Other points which should be noted include the language. Hoo boy, this game is realistic to a fault. F-bombs and mother-f-bombs are dropped as often as you'd expect to hear them dropped in real life gansta talk. So far it's not as bad as South Park Bigger Longer Uncut but it's pretty darn close. Also while the radio stations i've heard so far are pretty good, I must admit to being a bit dissapointed with the chat radio. The skits i've heard are good but it is all so disjointed, there doesn't seem to be a common theme to it. Liberty City had Lazlow and KChat, Vice City had both KChat and VCPR (all of which were great), but all San Andreas has is WCPR which is a mishmash of Kchat and VCPR. There are different shows with different hosts focusing on different topics, but I'm not sure yet if there are more hosts than the ones I heard or if I was just unlucky enough to tune in at the wrong times to hear stuff i'd already heard. It's not bad Rockstar, but you've done better.All in all, it is a worthy sucessor to the GTA heritage and puts its own stamp on the series. It isn't just the previous two rewarmed, it's the previous two expanded. It'll take its place alongside its predecessors as a PS2 classic and should be on the shelf of anyone who owns a PS2. Don't even think of renting it, go buy the thing.Other amendments:The girlfriend option is a bit annoying, who has time to take a girl out on a date when there's territory to take over and Ballas to cap? I guess there'll be more time for that option when the main storyline is over, at least for ME. I don't play this game to make some girl happy with me :D sorry babe.Got my first taste of Mount Chialo (spelling) and now I am really impressed, I can't wait to explore it fully. The feeling of elevation and risk of falling is real, almost. I'm almost at San Fierro...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2004"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"You have to be kidding me.......","reviewText":"Yet again, another Call of Duty game is released.  Yet again, we have those same boring action-packed trailers and commercials showing BS reviews from websites they probably paid to give their games a good review (ever hear the story of a former IGN employee saying they get paid to give games good reviews?)  And yet again, people ran out to buy Black Ops 2 because they had to have it.  No one learned a lesson from the horrid excuse of a videogame that was Modern Warfare 3, from the lies including the exclusion of death streaks to the fact that there were moments when the game literally froze online on the PS3 version.  Modern Warfare 3 had the worst netcode (save Uncharted 3 which is plain abysmal) for an online shooter I have ever seen.THEN comes Black Ops 2.I didn't even bother with the campaign of Black Ops 2 save for the first two levels.  And those levels were THE EXACT SAME THING FROM MODERN WARFARE 3.  You start off in a warzone shooting countless enemies.  Sound familiar?  How about the fact that you're randomly told to use some aerial weaponry to destroy more targets on the battlefield?  Sound familiar now?  THEN the second level takes you to rescue Frank Woods, where you must sneak past the guards, hoping to remain hidden in the grass, until you later blow your own cover by causing an explosion.  If that doesn't sound familiar, then you have never played a Call of Duty game before in your life, because it is the exact same style of campaign used in Modern Warfare 3, 2, and 1, with MW1 being released in November 2007.  Yes, that game is five years old.But why would anyone in their right mind play a Call of Duty game for the singleplayer?  It's all about the multiplayer, right?  Right.  So, of course they're going to make their selling point as polished as possible.....I'm sorry, I couldn't say that with a straight face.I'll be nice and start off with the things Black Ops 2 did right.  FINALLY we are allowed to customize our own classes however we want.  It's called the \"Pick-10\" system, where you get to pick ten items of your choosing and place them in your class.  Do you want to only wield a knife?  Clear your primary and secondary weapons and you'll only have a knife.  Don't care about lethal and tactical items?  Get rid of them.  Want to use six perks?  You can use two of each, meaning you can use two perks from \"Perk 1\", and so on.  To give a better example of a possible class, one of my favorite classes is the FAL DSW with Primary Gunfighter wildcard (allows three attachments), select fire (choose between semi-auto or full-auto), red dot sight, fast mag (the new Sleight of Hand), and gold camo.  So out of the ten slots available, the gun takes 1, the wildcard takes 1, and each of the attachments take 1, meaning I have 5 possible choices left.  I usually go Ghost for Perk 1, Scavenger/Toughness for perk 2, and Tactical Mask for perk 3, using another wildcard so I can have two Perk 2 slots.  Remember, I only had five more slots.  Perk 1 took up a slot, the wildcard took another, Perk 3 took up a slot, and both my Perk 2's took up a slot.  That's all 10 slots taken care of.  There are literally millions of possible class options for you to choose from, meaning it's almost impossible to see two players using the exact same class.Another thing they did was change how Prestige works.  Before, every time you prestiged, everything was reset.  NOW when you Prestige, everything is locked again except for your gun camo and whatever you decide to permanently unlock.  You also are allowed to obtain a complete refund of your unlock tokens, add another Create-A-Class slot, or to completely wipe EVERYTHING (stats, camoes, etc....literally everything) and start all over as if you put the game in for the first time.  Prestiging is a little easier considering that, for example, if you Prestige, you get to add a Create-A-Class slot AND unlock an item permanently.  So if you were level 15 with the AN-94 before you prestige, and you decided to unlock it after you prestige, nothing with the weapon will be reset unless you Prestige that weapon, which only unlocks a Calling Card should you complete both Prestige levels for a particular weapon.I wish I could say there were more things I liked about Black Ops 2 considering the first Black Ops wasn't that bad of a game, but unfortunately, that is where the fun ends.Let's start with everyone's favorite topic when it comes to Call of Duty, lag.  Because, yet again, they refuse to use dedicated servers, your connection depends on the host's connection.  So if for some reason the host has a ridiculously high ping to his/her nearest server, you're going to experience even worse lag.  To make matters even worse, this game features lag compensation.  Let's say that I have a very-fast 25MB connection and I'm playing against someone that has 3MB.  In reality, my connection is miles better than the other person, meaning I should have every advantage in the world when playing online......except in Black Ops 2 because lag compensation makes the person with the faster connection suffer so the person with the slower connection won't experience as much lag as they normally would.  Now why would I pay hundreds of dollars a month for an internet connection, only to hop on a game that treats me worse than the person with a slower internet connection?  What is this, opposite day?  It's as if Black Ops 2 is trying extra-hard to make average and below-average players even better at the game.Another problem with Black Ops 2 is the map design, which surprisingly is much worse than what we saw in Modern Warfare 3.  There isn't a single map where you can't find a dark corner, or a ledge to exploit the head glitch (granted the head glitch is in basically every shooting game), or a position that's higher-up on the map to camp from.  EVERY single map has multiple places where you can sit there, hide, and wait for someone to run past you so you can get an easy kill that you wouldn't get if you had to rely on reaction time and a proper aim.  To make matters worse (I'm going to be saying that a lot in this review), if one of your teammates pushes the opponent's spawn, the opponent will then SPAWN BEHIND YOU.  So you could have five people waiting for the opposing team to walk by, but have one person push their spawn, causing them to flip, meaning now the opposing team is running behind you and is shooting you in the back.  And you'll never know this is happening unless you either pay very-close attention to the mini-map or have a UAV/Orbital VSAT (Blackbird from Black Ops 1).  Speaking of killstreaks, they have a new name in Black Ops 2.  They're now called Scorestreaks, where instead of requiring a certain amount of kills to use them, you now need to earn a certain amount of points to do the same......however, this is almost completely irrelevant if you're playing Team Deathmatch because you can only get points for kills, destroying enemy equipment (worth less than kills) or assisting your teammates that got a kill (again, worth less than kills).  So they basically work the same as they have in TDM, except they have a new name.  However you can earn more points in objective-based games considering that, for example, capturing a flag is worth more than getting a kill, and racking up kills with a \"Scorestreak\" is only worth around 25 points per kill.The absolute worst part about Black Ops 2 is the hit-detection.  Modern Warfare 3's hit detection was pure garbage online, but Black Ops 2's hit detection is pure garbage, period.  Whether you're playing Combat Training offline or playing online with others, the hit detection will fail 9 times out of 10.  The sad thing is it'll even show in the final killcam, when the action is slowed down to better show how the person got the final kill.  OH!  Fun fact about the final killcam, if you're playing an objective game, the \"Final Killcam\" is really the final kill from someone on the winning team, so it doesn't matter who truly got the last kill.  It only matters if they're on the winning team.  So much for FINAL killcam.After playing this game for a week, I decided to give offline Combat Training a try.  I was so sick of the horrible hit detection and lag, I wanted to see if Combat Training would be any better.  Shockingly, the same issues I saw online WERE THE SAME ISSUES I SAW OFFLINE.  That means that the horrible hit detection isn't solely because of lag.  It also means that shooting at someone that really isn't there also can't be fully blamed on lag.  THE BLAME FALLS ON THE GAME ITSELF.  This is literally something built into the game from the beginning.  Whenever I tried to shoot the horrid AI, my first three or four shots would not register.  So I'm sitting here, firing six shots at an object that's not even moving, only to have the last three shots register and kill the target....that's not even moving.  God forbid they decide to move, because the auto-aim will literally track the target until they go behind a wall, and even then the reticle will follow the original target for a few feet while they're moving BEHIND A WALL.  Yes, make an insanely easy game to play even easier.  This actually makes quick-scoping insanely easy as well, with the only problem being, of course, the horrible hit detection.  I tried using a sniper rifle in Combat Training so I can learn how to quick-scope, and I was getting headshots on the bots without actually aiming for the head.  To add insult to injury, when I then tried to do the same thing online, I got the last kill in on Raid, which resulted in a headshot even though the game didn't say it was a headshot.  The final killcam showed me aiming for the guy's head, which is the only thing I could see thanks to the head glitch, fire, hit him in the head, and yet the game didn't declare it as a headshot.  So how is it possible that I killed someone and didn't hit them in the head, when I hit the guy in the head?Another thing I noticed in Combat Training was the spawns.  Remember when I said earlier that it's possible for the enemy to begin spawning behind you?  Well I played Free-For-All in Combat Training just to see how bad the spawns really are.  Thanks to the Orbital VSAT, I noticed that a shed behind me was a spawn-point.  When I say behind me, I mean me turning 180 and walking five steps forward puts me in the shed, yet if I make ANOTHER 180 and walk five steps forward, the enemy will spawn behind me, meaning all he has to do is look right, let the auto-aim lock onto me, and hold the trigger.  The best part is someone will spawn around the corner from THAT guy, and ANOTHER guy spawned on the opposite side of a house I was walking through.  That's three enemies spawning within a two-second sprint from my location, in Free-For-All.  I don't think I should have to explain why this is a bad thing.You know what's really fun about Black Ops 2?  That moment when I shoot a guy in the shoulder with the DSR, a 1-hit kill weapon so long as I hit the stomach, chest, head, and shoulder, only for that person NOT to die.  I also enjoy shooting people six times with a shotgun at close-range in order for them to die, THEN turn around and kill another person at the same range with one shot.  I love shooting someone point-blank with a shotgun only for them to walk away complaining of a headache.  I love the ludicrous amount of flinch when shot, which completely throws off my aim and causes my shot to land above the head if I originally aimed at the guy's torso.  I love shooting at a guy that's right in front of me, only to die and watch the killcam say that he actually moved to my left when he killed me.  I love how every single time you fire your weapon, regardless of connection quality, the game will lag behind the initial pull of the trigger.  In other words, your ammo notification won't recognized a fire shot until a few milliseconds after the bullet has left the barrel.  Does any of this sound familiar to you?  To me it does.  It sounds like Modern Warfare 3, a game I gave 3 stars on the PS3 version (really 2.5 stars), except this came out a year later on a console best-suited for a Call of Duty game, and is at least twice as bad.People, seriously, stop buying Call of Duty games.  They're only getting worse every year.  Modern Warfare 3 was better than this, which had worse hit detection than Black Ops 1, which had worse hit detection than Modern Warfare 2, which had worse hit detection than the masterpiece that was Call of Duty 4.  It is the exact same experience, every single year, THAT MANAGES TO GET WORSE EVERY YEAR.  Why are people lining up in the hundreds to fund a franchise that gets worse as it gets older?  Would you keep buying an iPhone if it dropped more calls and performed worse every single year?  Would you keep buying Hondas if they broke down and were slower and lost features every year?  Would you keep going to the same fast-food restaurant if the food tasted worse ever single year?  No?  Then why do people continuously buy Call of Duty titles every year?Go look at all the one-star reviews and look at how detailed they are.  Then go look at the vast majority of four & five-star reviews and look at how vague they are.  A lot of them sound like they were written by a 12-year-old that failed fourth-grade English.  Don't fall for the hype.  Save your money.  Go buy Borderlands 2, or Far Cry 3, or even Battlefield 3.  DICE can't ruin that game no matter how hard they've been trying (believe me, they've been trying).  Go buy any other game that doesn't have Call of Duty in its name, so you'll finally know what it feels like to get your money's worth.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003VR5PPY","description":"","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"One of the BEST DS Puzzle Titles Ever","reviewText":"This is not a game for children. Do not buy this title for your ten-year-old; the \"Mature\" ESRB rating on the package is very accurate. The storyline is very heavy in expletives (up to and including the f-bomb) and periodic sexual innuendo.I first found out about this game about two months ago while reading a synopsis on Amazon. As the title implies, nine people have nine hours to escape from a sinking ship. They were put there by a maniacal person named Zero, who kidnapped them from all over the world to participate in \"The Nonary Game\", a life-or-death challenge that will thrust the nine kidnapped people into a world of puzzles.The best comparison that I can draw to this game is a mash-up of PC classics Zork and Phantasmagoria. If you are not old enough to understand this reference, I offer another: Saw (the movies) meets Professor Layton. What Aksys has done is create a visual novel; you must solve puzzle elements in order to progress the storyline. If you ever played the classic point-and-click adventures on the PC (Myst, Phantasmagoria, Zork, & etc.), then it is fairly intuitive (and obvious) that they can be reincarnated on the DS. The touch-screen interface is a perfect way to introduce this style of mystery/puzzle games to a new gaming generation.GameplayNine Hours, Nine Person, Nine Doors (lets call it 999 for short) excels in intuitive gameplay. The concept is fairly simple: the game is divided into two sections: narrative and escape puzzles. For each puzzle, your character (Junpei) will be placed into an area, comprised of a room or a series of rooms, and he must find items and solve puzzles in order to open the door and escape.Now the title and the game itself does indicate that you have only 9 hours to escape. This is true, but the gameplay is very forgiving. Time does advance, but it is \"suspended\" while you are working to solve each escape puzzle. In addition, you are able to repeatedly attempt to solve each puzzle without fear of locking yourself out or dying. Solving the puzzles themselves is fun without being overly complex. Do not take this to mean that the game is easy; it isn't, not by any stretch of the imagination. The game's producer, Aksys, has done a masterful job in balancing how you have to find items and how you solve the puzzles. Granted the puzzles themselves can be somewhat math-heavy (two key concepts are a digital root and the hexadecimal system), but the game is generous about allowing mistakes to occur and even provides a calculator to help those who may not be as adept at mental math.Now, here is the caveat [minor spoiler]. 999 is a game that requires more than one playthrough in order to find out everything about the storyline. You may think this sounds like a cheap gimmick, and I assure you that it is not. Each playthrough gives you the opportunity to try different things (choose a different door to go through, choose different party members for each door, and so forth), and subsequently, each character will reveal slightly more about themselves and their past. Thrown in for even more mystery is the seemingly random interjection of history: the Titanic, glycerin crystallization, a priestess of Amun-Ra, and more. Aksys makes each playthrough easier by allowing you to \"fast forward\" through dialogue that you have already read. In addition, whenever a choice menu appears, previous selections are greyed-out so that you can easily remember the last action you took at that point in your previous playthrough.The only complaint that I have to this system is that you cannot \"fast forward\" through puzzles that you have previously solved. Since the narrative part of the game can be rather text-heavy, the option to speed through it is much appreciated; however, I would infinitely prefer not having to repeat the \"prologue\" puzzle in the 3rd class cabin over-and-over. If I had to open that danged red suitcase one more time, I would've gone looney. Fortunately, if you need to walk away from the game, you are permitted to save at any point. In addition, after you beat the game for the first time, you can access each escape puzzle in the main menu and re-enact the escape if you wish to hone your skills.In order to access every puzzle room, it is necessary to play the game at least more than once. Also, to get the \"best\" ending, you have to complete a specific \"bad\" ending first. Finding the \"best\" ending is at best a crap shoot, as there is no readily obvious way to find it without trial-and-error or consulting a game guide. The best ending, though, is worth it. In addition, each of the \"bad\" endings reveals a little bit more of the history of each character and can help you solve loose ends that may not be resolved in the \"best\" ending.StorylineThis is where 999 excels. The story is not forced. You will actually delight in reading the text and learning a little bit more about each character. Thrown in is a lot of humor (many of it adult); there were a lot of interactions with the characters that had me laughing so hard that I was wiping away tears. The author of the story is amazing, and it was truly a joy to play through the game several times (I completed it four different times, I still have two endings to watch) and learn a little bit more each time.In addition to having one of the best \"true\" endings of any puzzle game that I have played to date, the mystery and motives of everyone involved will lead to a rousing debate between members of the gaming community for a while to come. Personally, I have inserted myself into a board discussion on the Gamefaqs website, trading theories with other 999 players as to the purpose of a specific character as well as a secondary storyline within the game. I will not specify anything here, as I do not want to spoil the surprise for anyone, but suffice it to say I am very pleased that a game has had me thinking about it ever since I beat it.Graphics & SoundThis game is one of the better games for the DS. While the narrative itself is text, each character has a unique design and the backgrounds are very appropriate for an early 20th century ship. There are only a handful of animations within the game (usually limited to puzzle-solving), but they are well done. The backgrounds are detailed, but not overly cluttered as to make it difficult to find items for a puzzle. Overall, the graphics are a 10/10.The sound is good, nothing over-the-top, and does help to set the mood for the game. I usually play my games with the sound turned off, but while I did have it on, I found it appropriate to the atmosphere without being too cloying. It would have been nice to hear some voiceacting (reading about a character screaming, usually described in great detail, would have been more realistic), but the lack of it does not really detract from the game. The narrative itself is written with great detail, to the point that the desription of a dead body almost made me nauseous. That said, where the sound falls short the narrative itself picks it up. A solid 8/10.OverallIf you are a puzzle fanatic and love a good mystery, buy this game. The puzzles are fun without being overly complex, the story is extremely well done, and the game is a pure joy to play. I can find little fault in it. If you are sensitive to expletives, it may try your patience, but by-and-large, I did not find them to be overwrought. For the most part, the bawdy language did fit the action and situations presented, so I was able to forgive it.As stated at the beginning of this review, this game is NOT for children. While it would be lovely to give to a child to solve the puzzles (nothing like some mental exercise), the storyline, some of the graphics, and the language would not be appropriate. The game is very heavily peppered with the f-bomb, s***, b***h, and a few more. While there is nothing overtly sexual within the game, a few campy jokes do allude to some pretty erotic stuff, although it is tastefully done and I found myself chuckling.999 is perfectly balanced with comedy, a compelling storyline, a great soundtrack, and deep characters that will stay in your heart for a long time. If you are looking for a fun puzzle game that is truly a gem, this title is for you. This game should be one of the games of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"An Action-Packed Adventure That Every Vita Owner Should Experience.","reviewText":"I've been a fan of the Uncharted series from the very beginning, so much that I never questioned purchasing each game, they all delivered and left me wanting more. So when Uncharted: Golden Abyss was announced, I inmediately pre-ordered my copy and after having played it numerous times, I will give you my honest review.The Story:You (Drake) are in Panama, in the middle of jungle, working with Dante, an old friend of yours, but you don't know all the details, so unlike other  uncharted games, this one isn't a personal quest, but somebody else's. Later on you meet Chase, a girl know by Dante, whom is pretty interested on whatever is going on in this Jungle, she carries on her an amulate, the adventure begins. You will fight through jungles, high places, all full of action and plenty of gun fire. The traditional atmosphere that made the PS3 games a success is here, the Golden Abyss is a game that not only fans of the series should play, but every Vita owner.Graphics:If you look carefuly, you can see some choppy lines and bluriness, but 95% of the game looks absolutely amazing. The backgrounds were always my favourites on previous games, and this is not different, Golden Abyss has some beautiful, carefuly painted and designed levels that show the PS Vita's power. Even during heavy loads such as shooting and running, the frame rate stays balanced, not a single drop. Drake's clothes, weapons, face, etc. They all looks detailed, like I said before, you may see some choppy lines here and there, but you really have to look closely. This is probably, if not, the best looking game on the Vita.Sound:The musical score is top notch. As with previous games, the sound makes this one of those games that can take the player away and immerse him/her into the story like no other. The opening screen has the unmistakeable back track from the other games, the one we all know, so right away, you will feel at home. During the actual game, each music track has been carefuly selected for each scenario. If  you have a set of the old Logitech PSP speakers or just some speakers you can hook the Vita to, do it, you can't miss the musical score, it is perfect.Voices are on par with graphics. Drake's voice is done by the original voice actor and everybody else in the story sounds amazing, each character adds to the story with his/her unique aspects with the perfect sound. Gun fire and other FX, as expected, nothing, but perfection, each gun sounds different; from Desert eagles, to pistols, to assault rifles, plus others, they all sound original. This is the sort of stuff that makes this series, one of the best of this console generation.Controls:They big question...are the controls good? Hell yes! I admit it, I was a bit skeptical when I saw the video of the platforming segments done with the touch screen, but I'm glad to say, they work! and perfectly. The learning curve for touch-based controls is almost zero. But if for some reason, you are still not sure, the game has been programmed to work with both touch and standard controls, meaning, you can use the Vita's buttons and bumpers to pretty much do everything you need to do, with the exception of the machete and others that I won't spoil for you, but don't worry, they are easy to pull off.The fact that the Vita has 2 joysticks, makes this game a portable triumph. The original sensitivity settings was a bit too high for me, so I had to tweak it on the menu, but veteran console players, should not have any problems. Even though I've played all the Uncharted games, I do not consider myself a pro player, 'cause I'm a PC player and will always suck with a controller, but I digress, the Golden Abyss controls are tight and responsive, each input gave me an acurate output. The only time I had an issue, which I had on previous titles, was when trying to take cover, Drake would roll, jump, etc, but that was mainly me, and not timing the action properly.Conclusion:If you own a PS Vita and are a fan of the Uncharted series, DO NOT skip this title, it delivers from start to credits. Some may argue that the end felt a bit forced and rushed, but I disagree, it was perfect for this story, which again, does not start and does not end as Drake's personal quest, which is a nice twist for a change. If you played the PS3 games, this will not disappoint you, expect the same level of graphical, sound and control details that make the others so good. Any new comers, get ready for a \"true adventure\" game, the sort of game that will keep you entertained and asking for more. This is the classic Uncharted game we all know, with plenty of beautiful locations, mistery and an action-packed adventure that every Vita owner should experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Not to Be Lost in the Abyss","reviewText":"For the past few years now, the Uncharted series has entertained millions of gamers with it's beautiful scenery, fantastic characters and great stories.  When the Playstation Vita launched it turned out that an Uncharted game was going to be a launch title.  And no doubt that was enough to get just about anyone excited.  Easily one of the best launch titles you could have for your handheld system, right?  Well, in a way, yes.  It's a fun game although it seems as though it's mostly there to show off the chops of the Playstation Vita more so than anything.  You'll have fun, but you can't deny that the Uncharted games on the Vita's older brother are far superior.Let's get this out of the way immediately.  Uncharted Golden Abyss looks absolutely gorgeous.  You've never seen anything like this on a handheld system before.  The graphical power is amazing, the environments detailed.  From a production standpoint it's almost like you've got a little PS3 in your pocket.  And the voice acting is also incredibly strong.  Just about everything you'd want from an Uncharted game is there.  The writing is also strong as always.  There will be moments where you'll laugh as the characters interact and speak with one another.  From the standpoint of production Golden Abyss is unrivaled by anything you've ever seen on a handheld before.Likewise, the story is good, although not quite as absorbing as the console games.  Once again Nathan Drake is searching for a lost city, but this time he's with a friend named Jason Dante.  Were it not for the strong characters and some of the wit and charm Uncharted was known for, the story wouldn't be nearly as fun.  And this is primarily because the outings we've seen of Drake thus far, have usually involved searching for lost cities (or starting out that way, only to lead to something bigger).  Golden Abyss isn't really any different.  It is going to be familiar to fans.In fact, quite a bit will be familiar to fans.  It's got all the standard Uncharted tropes.  There are the nice elements of puzzles, platforming and gun fights.  Again, all familiar elements to fans.  But what makes them work is how the game is able to actually mesh them together.  It allows for ample breaks between the action where you can slow down and deal with a puzzle or perhaps just do some platforming.  It's hard to say how exciting Golden Abyss is, however, especially because Uncharted 3 just dropped down not too long before, and there are not quite as many amazing set pieces as what we saw in the third installment.  There's nothing here that will amaze you quite like Uncharted 2's fantastic train sequence or Uncharted 3's fantastic ocean liner sequence.  That's not to say there isn't excitement.  It's only to say the moments just aren't nearly as tense.Likewise, like every Uncharted game, the entire campaign is pretty straightforward.  Having you run from one moment to the next.  You'll never have to worry about where to go next or if you'll get lost.  It also means you'll never have to worry about backtracking.  There are also lots of checkpoints scattered around freely so there's not much to befall you if the worst should happen.  It sticks to many of Uncharted's tried and true approaches.In terms of the technology itself, Uncharted Golden Abyss manages to do quite a bit with the Playstation Vita's technology.  This game utilizes the touch screen a lot.  You'll use it to cut down bamboo in your way, for instance, making quick swipes on the screen.  You'll use it to finish off melee combos in the middle of combat.  You'll also use it for some of the puzzles.  During the platforming moments you can touch the spots you want Nate to go to next.  At first all this seems rather pleasant.  After a while you don't care for it as much.  The platforming, for instance, was never much of a challenge in Uncharted to begin with.  Being able to touch where Nate goes doesn't really add anything to the experience.  It certainly doesn't detract, but it's there mainly to show it can be done rather than because it's actually integral to the experience of the game itself.  The same could be said for some of the swipes in melee combat or for the bamboo.  They're not really adding too much to the game itself.  They just seem like bits thrown in to show what the Vita can do.  After a while you begin to feel like they're tacked on.  Gunfights are certainly easier with the controls, but once again you won't feel as though you need them.It's not that the touch screen controls are bad, it's just that the more you play the game, the more it just feels like the game could've been competent enough without them.  There aren't many moments when you feel like the controls are actually necessary at any given time.  They certainly make much of the experience easier... but Uncharted was never that hard to begin with.  It's just hard to get beyond the fact that some of the touch screen controls feel like a novelty rather than a necessity.  And the fact that the game can't be played 100% without them when that novelty wears off is a little disappointing.That does not detract from Uncharted Golden Abyss by that much.  You'll wonder if it was necessary to have all those controls, sure, but you'll be able to deal with them.  What is a little hard to deal with is that the campaign just isn't as exciting as the PS3 games.  The campaign isn't very long by any means, but there's not much reason to want to go through it again.  There's also no multiplayer suite for when the adventure is done.Fans will settle right into things and be delighted.  Some moments aren't nearly as tense or as memorable as what you saw in the games on the Playstation 3.  And some of the touch screen controls can feel tacked on, but the overall package is still good.  Especially if you're looking to show what the PSV can really do.  Uncharted: Golden Abyss is a pretty game with some of the best production values you've ever seen on a handheld.  It's charming and fun.  It's a great addition to the Uncharted series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

I'm not sure what game they were playing, but this certainly is a gem of a title.  This is survival horror in its truest form.  I love games like RE1, 2 and 3, Fatal Frame, Kuon, and Haunting Ground.  Unfortunately the survival horror genre doesn't really live up to its name anymore, containing run-and-gun action adventure shooters with maybe some atmosphere and creepy stuff thrown in.  ZombiU is a rare exception. It's not all that creepy, but it doesn't hold your hand and there are few second chances for each unlucky survivor.You wake up as a randomly generated survivor, with little background information (name and occupation only).  You could be male or female, and things like hair, features, and race are random.  ZombiU features perma-death.  Once your survivor dies, you wake up as a different survivor in the base holding only a gun, a few bullets, a flashlight and a cricket bat.  Key items and weapon upgrades are retained, but any weapons other than the basic handgun that the previous survivor was holding will have to be retrieved.  To get your gear back you must go back to where your previous survivor died and kill their zombie.  Each survivor can build up weapon skills, but these skills are not passed on when you die.  Each time you die you will receive a score which goes on the leaderboard.  Your score is based on weapon skills, number of kills, etc.  In story mode, your progress is retained, you just pick up with a different survivor.You can survive a few hits but one bite and you're dead (until you get the Virucide shot, which gives you one chance to stab a zombie before it bites you and instantly kill it).There is a metal container in the base where you can store some items that will remain there even if you die.  I like to leave found weapons, ammo, land mines and large medipacks there for when I really need them, since anything you carry has the potential for being permanently lost.You will not end up significantly stronger later on, and the game doesn't get easier.  You have to plan, conserve, and strategize.  Most enemies will not drop anything when you kill them.  Some might only drop one handgun round or a tiny health boost.  If you get overrun and have no way out or no ammo, you're probably dead.  If you have no patience, this game is not for you.  If you're one of those casual gamers who only plays shooters and sports games, chances are this will frustrate you very quickly.  If you're an old school survival horror fan, give it a try - you will probably love it!I only gave this 4 stars because amazon doesn't have a 4.5 option.  It's not a perfect game - though the gamepad works pretty well, it can be clunky at times.  The game doesn't pause when you loot, and sometimes trying desperately to swipe the gamepad to close the backpack (or BOB - Bug-Out Bag) doesn't work right (I found out you can solve this by moving the control stick backwards to close the BOB).  Sometimes you can't swing the cricket bat because you hit the button ever so slightly too early and the animation didn't fully reset, resulting in death.  However these are small complaints and can be worked around with some practice.  Sometimes zombies walking up angled planks or on the edge of things causes them to walk on air, but it doesn't happen often.  Don't let the critic reviews fool you - this is a wonderful game.  If you have a Wii U and love survival horror, don't miss ZombiU!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}

Since then I have been addicted to the platforming elements of PoP games.  The Sands of Time (PC version) was my first taste of the 3D changeover and boy it was addicting.  Even knowing what to do was an adventure simply knowing you had to have 'perfect' execution to pull off the stunts and platforming.  No other PoP game has really found that formula again but The Forgotten Sands comes the closest to date.Gameplay: It is prince of persia.  If you have played any previous game then you know what to expect really.  You are the dashing Prince and once again find yourself in a situation where time manipulation is required for you to save the day!  This time around instead of just the ability to rewind time for the most part Ubisoft has switched it up considerably. You now can rewind time, freeze water, remember collapsed objects and even threw in some basic RPG elements.  Once you get the hang of the controls through a well thought-out tutorial the game tests your puzzle solving skills.  That is what PoP are all about.  You are in a room, fight some bad guys and then figure out how you are going to get out of there/advance.  Early on things seem simple and a PoP pro would be chuckling but once all the elements come together... be prepared.  You will sweat as you have to micromanage countless buttons all at the same time, switching what you are doing in mid jump while dealing with projectiles etc.  Classic prince of persia platforming!Sound/Story:  The story isn't half bad.  While not as powerful or strong as the original Sands of Time that captured the hearts of many old PoP fans and made a ton of new fans, the story isn't over bearing.  It is there but not forced upon you at every turn.  The sound is not bad and I have no complaints with the game. The voice acting is spot on and sets the tone.Graphics/Presentation: graphically the game is pretty good. It isn't ground breaking or jaw dropping but it is good enough that in 720p the game looks nice.  The platforming aspects are well thought-out and get harder as you go along thus the game gets harder and continues to challenge you as you move along.  However this negatively impacted replay I feel(see below)Length/Replay: While the game isn't very long (easily under 7hrs) you can lose track of time while playing.  The game is fun, simple as that.  It is one of those games, especially if you like platforming or puzzle solving, that will keep you scratching your head and curious what might lie around the next corner.  Add hidden 'sarcophagus' items and a exp/leveling system you can definitely find some replay value in the game.  The exp you spent carries over into the next game as well so you can fully unlock the Prince's potential.  The downside is, once you've unlocked everything, found all those sarcophagus' etc.. there really is no reason to return to the game (unlike the original sands of time). The platforming suddenly will feel far to easy until the last moment since the game baby-steps your way along.  I still got a full replay out of the gameSummary of \"cons\" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)- Baby stepping your way through makes a replay seem far to easy.  Can almost blow through the game on a replay in half the time especially since you can't de-level.. thus starting at a high level and can just own anything in your path [in a way this works because if you simply want to have fun platforming the mobs you fight won't slow you down]- Not one glitch!!!(PS3 version)  not a con but a definite PLUS as everyone hates a game breaking bug/glitchOverall Score: 86%A must have for any platform junkie or Prince of Persia fanatic.  I was not dissapointed and can proudly say that I achieved a PLATINUM trophy for this game.While not the best Prince of Persia game I've played it certainly was one of the more enjoyable games.

I am about halfway through the game and I have to say its a pretty amazing experience. The art style is what really sets this game apart from other games. Its unique and original and that is something lacking in video games today. Graphically this art style makes it look fantastic even though its a port from a Playstation 2 game. Sound is done well and the music fits the game in a suitable type of way. Controls was what I was worried about since Wii games are either spot on or flat out terrible. At first using the celestial brush will take some time to get used to but once you get the hang of how to use that and timing your attacks its pretty much one of the most fun combat systems in gaming today. Some of the characters will have you just downright laughing your head off which adds some good humor to the game. All in all if you like Zelda games or action rpgs Okami is a must own game. This game is just pure fun and is worth adding to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2009"}

Forgot that too...","reviewText":"I just got Red Faction a few days ago, but it has already caused me trouble.  The day I got it I didn't go to sleep when I should have, and then today (a few days later) I was playing and got so wrapped up that I was almost late for work.I was going to start this review off with the good news about this game, but there is a lot of that, and very little bad, so I guess I'll start off with the bad, and work my way up to the good:The bad news is that this is one of the first console First Person Shooter (FPS) game that isn't really designed for multi-player, and since I am a huge fan of multi-player games, and not quite as much of a one player game person, this was quite a disappointment.  There just aren't the gameplay options that Time Splitters or even Unreal Tournament have.  If you are looking for a good multi-player game, go with Time Splitters.There are also a few other minor bad points in the game, but several of those revolve around the fact that this is not really a multi-player game.  Things such as the limited number of characters that you have to choose from in multi-player when you first start off, and the amount of time it takes to finish the game to get all the characters and levels (something that I have not even attempted yet, so I am not really sure that is what you have to do).That just about sums up the bad stuff, now on to the good stuff:Geo Mod technology is great.  If you like the big explosives (if you are thinking about purchasing this game, then you probably do), then this game is the right one for you.  Imagine a huge rock platform suspended by three stone walkways.  Now imagine what would happen if you wer eto start shooting rockets at those three walkways.  What do you think should happen?  Well, if you were playing Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Half Life, Unreal Tournament, Time Splitters, or any other FPS, then maybe the color of the walkways would change, but in this game they blow up!  And when all of them are gone what happens?  It floats in the air becuse some idiot programmer didn't think about gravity!Fooled you!  It falls down!  It acctually falls down, and you can see the bits and pieces of it scattered all over the place.The weapons in this game are also great.  Personally, I dislike the outrageous weapons you can pick up in game slike Perfect Dark.  Sure, they are cool and all, but make things a bit ridiculous.  I especially like that it is almost impossible to hit someone with a rocket, and the remote mine sare big and don't throw very far.  I think it would be a little tough to hit someone with a rocket, and Goldeneye's and Perfect Dark's mines are just too tiny for their power, and can be thrown wat too far.The only other thing I can say about this game is not good, or is it bad.  That is the length of the game.  there are something like 20 areas, and 60 something objectives in the game.  If you are playing for the multiplayer portion, it is bad, but if you are only looking for the single player aspect, it provides hours of fun.So, if you are looking for a good single player FPS for PS2, then Red Faction is the game you want.  If you want Multi-Player, then go with Time Splitters, or if you like Red Faction, and you want the Multi-Player options, look into Unreal Tournament.  Unreal doesn't have Geo-Mod, and I don't particularly like the game that much, but it is similar in character and weapon style, as well as having similar controls, and gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2001"}

Having played the other two I'd say GHIII is just as fun.  The graphics have been improved over GHII, but not by much.  The animations are sometimes questionable, but since they don't affect the gameplay it's not really an issue except from an aesthetic standpoint.  I also noticed a little bit of frame rate stutter during some moments, and although distracting they didn't throw off the timing, so it wasn't detrimental to the gameplay.  The track list is great and perhaps the best of the series.  A new battle mode has been added and breathes a little freshness into a series that was in danger of going stale.  Unfortunately, some of the characters from the previous games have gone the way of the dodo for no good reason.  But for all it's small flaws the core of the game is still great, and I'd reccommend GHIII to anyone interested.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004RIACMW","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"The Captain Shows His Stuff But Lacks Polish...","reviewText":"It always seems that many movie tie-in games get a bad reputation, and some deserve it but not all. Captain America, while not a great game, actually is not a bad game. It shows that movie tie-in games can be good if there is enough effort put into them. However not everything is perfect here, as a lack of polish and a combat system ripped directly from Batman: Arkham Asylum, implemented poorly, puts a few dents in this otherwise decent super hero title.GAMEPLAYWith combat lifted directly from Batman: Arkham Asylum the gameplay itself can be a lot of fun. The combat system will feel like Batman:AA but have some roughness to it, as if they never bothered to polish up the mechanics. Shield throws and combat moves look great, feel responsive and hit with force; yet come time to get in close for some melee combat and grapples the controls suddenly feel unresponsive. This could lead to some frustration when you grapple an enemy and basically reach against them and nothing happens! It is probably the biggest setback to the game, in my opinion. The good thing is, this is something you can easily over-come as you play and learn the distance and timing needed to pull off grapples and moves. The platforming segments felt a bit like Uncharted, where the Captain would tend to snap to the objective if your timing was right. The problem here is there is no real direction to aim. Just tap the buttons and the Captain makes his jump which made these spectacular acrobatic sequences feel less spectacular.Pushing past the control problems, everything else functions as intended. The game mixes it up with your combat, and Captain America gains XP which he can use for upgrades. Collectables are also littered throughout the game which adds to the exploration factor(plus gives bonus experience). When it comes to enemy AI, I wouldn't expect much. Often you can just take out enemies from a distance with shield throw and in some cases just sneak around them as they stand there oblivious. As for level design, there is a slight open world feel to the areas. Levels are wide spread and offer some ability to explore, but other than bonus items randomly laying around there isn't much to see. Your objective sometimes might not be made clear to you but it adds that sense of exploration that avoids making the level design feel dull.GRAPHICSThis is where things tend to turn south for the game. While the graphics are not bad, they are not very impressive either. Animations during cut-scenes felt choppy, and the overall graphics of the game felt under-whelming. To make things worse, the frame-rate chugs in spots for no reason. I found this to be present on both the PS3 and 360 versions so it had to be something inherent to the way the game got coded. The game is 3D Capable but I was unable to test this feature. While not a total sour note, the graphics/frame rate could of been better or at least polished up moreSOUND/STORYWhile not the best storyline out there for Captain America, it does its job well. It is a means to get you from point A to B while keeping things flowing steadily. The Sound itself is actually not bad. The voice acting felt a little bland/sub-par but overall it was better than I was expecting. Combat has good impact, and the music / ambient sounds did a decent job trying to give added depth to each level/area.REPLAY/LENGTHFor a game of Captain America's style, it felt fairly standard in terms of game length. You probably will get around 5 - 7 hours of gameplay depending on your need to explore for bonus items, combat creativity etc. Replay value is mixed.  You can replay the game on higher difficulties and/or partake in various challenges to earn more Intel-points(xp).  I personally found no want to revisit the game once completed, or dabble much with the challenges.  However, for the Captain America fan I could see a possible revisit at higher difficulty levels and the challenges offer some interesting scenarios that could easily keep you busy for a while.OVERALL ... 75% (7.5) CWhile Captain America is not a great game, it is a GOOD game!  A welcoming surprise for a movie-tie in game.  What holds it back is that lack of polish that could have boosted it into the 4 star range. Choppy frame-rates and control problems put a damper on what could of been a really nice Batman: AA style game. Even with its problems the game can be enjoyable as long as you don't have high expectations. Another thing that works in this game's favor is the pricing. At release it was priced at $49.99, and on sale it has already hit the low price of $38(7/22/2011). If priced at a staggering $60 launch rate this game I could easily see as a rental, but instead it is priced fairly for what it is. For those Cpt. America fans, or those who enjoyed the combat aspects of Batman: AA, this is a title that won't leave a bitter taste in your mouth if you decide to purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2011"}

Cooper","summary":"Bought For the Hype.....Believed For the Ending","reviewText":"Of all the games I have played over the years, this was the first to warrant my own review.  Anyone thinking of buying this game after reading about the numerous awards and praises from gaming review sites should read this review.  And NO, I will NOT include ANY SPOILERS.  As discussed later, this game deserves much of its attention from how and what is later revealed...and I will save that for you should you decide to buy this game.The opening scene reveals itself much like an epic movie, although in vastly poorer visual quality.  For a game released in 2005, some of the visuals in the game feel severely dated circa 2002-3.  The main character himself is quite pixelated.  However, the game does allow widescreen progressive scan play which has both a pro and con side to it.  On the plus side, the game's color saturation and grandeur REALLY stands out with progressive scan.  The widescreen mode adds dramatically to the open world concept the game's designers tried to promote.  However, putting the game in progressive scan also causes the protagonist and his horse to show themselves in all their pixelated glory.  For me, it was a hard decision to choose between a more vivid world with Progressive, or more believable main characters with Normal.  After switching back and forth numerous times I finally opted for the widescreen progressive and was ultimately happy with the decision.  After one battle with a colossus (you learn right away there are 16) you realize this game is first and foremost concerned with the colossi and environment.  That being said, the choice of soft lighting and color for this game create a very tranquil and often surreal fantasy world.  The game also seems to be ahead of the curve by streaming all of the landscape into view.  Given how vast the world is, this is really quite a feat!  The load times in this game are virtually non-existent because of how they implement streaming.Visual acuity aside, one of my greatest frustrations in this game (and oh yes...it will be there for you as well) was the use of the camera.  Granted, with respect to the design team, creating a camera that would allow you to see massive skyscraper-sized colossi and yet also focus on where you are running or riding seems a huge undertaking.  To help ease frustration, the game has a \"colossus camera focus\" button on L1 which does help.  The game also has a zoom buttom with R2; however, it is utterly useless.  The game constantly tries for a cinematic \"sweeping effect\" which means that whenever you look one way, the camera will try to pull back the other way as if the character is panning his head side to side.  Therefore, when you are fighting a huge colossus about to stomp you and are trying to zoom in and search for a weak spot...the camera will be swaying back and forth across where you are trying to look.  At best it is slightly frustrating, at worst...it makes you feel sea sick!  Another poor point of the camera is riding your horse.  The right analog controls the camera, whereas the left controls the direction of the horse via a rein mechanism.  In theory, this is AWESOME, because you can control the horse while you also pan around the character like you are controlling the action in a high budget film.  In fact, there are a few sequences I will not discuss where you are FORCED to pan the camera while riding on your horse. The use of pulling the analog to pull the reins has a very life-like feel to it. In practicality, however, the horse will usually not be able to make sharp turns, and it is very hard to control the horse while also concentrating on the environment and colossi.  I often found myself running head first into a large mountain or the edge of a cliff (fortunately you can not fall off when on the horse).  The game also has several moments when the environment will obstruct the view of the camera. The camera was definitely the most frustrating aspect of the game. Fortunately the game somehow manages to overcome this shortcoming with its original, artistic and innovative design.The colossi and the battles themselves really are a fantastic achievement!  Each colossus maintains certain visual similarities while drawing from all varieties of the natural and fantasy world.  Two of the colossi ARE quite similar in size and shape,... but every battle is unique, fast paced and fun.  Each environment you find them in is different and may or may not play an integral part in their defeat.  Every battle seems vaguely reminiscent of later Zelda games (N64 and later) but, if it can be believed, much more exciting and grandiose. Another positive change to game design is that the character begins with only a bow and sword, and will end with only a bow and sword. Every battle can be won without any cheating if you take the time to search the environment and colossus.  There is a very high ratio of puzzle solving to reward ratio dispersed throughout the battles.The storyline throughout the game is virtually non-existent; that is, until the end of the game.  The beauty is that the sequential battles and lack of any story is what gives so much meaning to the end of the game.  The intro shows you a boy, a girl of an undetermined relationship, and his horse.  Until the end, you know little more than where you are and what you must do.  Throughout the game, the endless task of killing a colossus and returning to the main temple seems quite monotonous.  This plays out VERY similarly to the game Assassin's Creed.  However, the intentional choice to leave out any interior storyline truly makes the ending shine.  It may have been an artistic choice,...but it ultimately leads up to one of the best endings of any fantasy game.  The ending itself clocks in at about 15-20 min (make sure to stay around after the credits).Ultimately, this game has been hyped for its artistic and innovative approaches to gameplay.  The world design, although devoid of a lot of the smaller life found in games like Elder Scrolls, is still beautiful, mysterious and most importantly - epic.  The game could have fallen prey to such shortcomings as an often frustrating camera and less than God of War character (people only - not colossi) visuals; however, it somehow soars above any problems due to the cohesion of all elements into one definable experience.  Rated only for the camera/controls and visuals, I might have given this game a 3/5...but all together this game represents a 4/5 if not more.  Not quite the best game of ALL TIME, but This is one game that definitely represents an Epic Masterpiece that is greater than the sum of its parts!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2008"}

This second part in the story added more features like allowing you to call upon assassins to help you in combat, and also you can act like a defacto general in this game.

The multiplayer adds some pretty good stuff to the field, and that is incredibly addicting.  THe multiplayer is what turn this game from a rental into a buyable game.  Don't get me wrong this is an awesome game, but I just wanted more for my buck and Ubisoft delivered on that.Pros1.  This was an awesome story, great twists, great characters.2.  This game was full of suprises.  You will have to find out why.3.  The new feature with all the assassins you can control was great addition to the game.Cons1.  My only complaint about this game was my game froze on me a couple of times, and I had a personal distaste for the ending.  Some will like it, but I didn't like it and it completely pissed me off.  I felt like it was cop out to move the story along in a surprise event.Overall without the ending this game rocked.  I believe this game was GOTY material, and it has awesome replay value cause of the multiplayer.  I hope you buy this game.  9.0/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Burke Schneider","summary":"The HONEST Review","reviewText":"The GOODThis game is spectacular! The graphics are extremly fluid and life-like. Everything you can think of is interactive, you can hold up guards, drag bodies, shoot pipes, step on cokroches, the list just goes on and on. Also when you shoot someone in certain part of the body, it causes a reaction other that just bleeding and dying. For example shoot someone in the arm, they can't use thier arm, shoot someone in the leg, they limp. Its just amazing at how much work went into this game. The enemy AI is quite intelligent, because they can notice shadows, hear and see foot steps, and hear you drop empty maginzes. It took Konomi over 3 years to perfect this game and I have to say that I am extremly happy with the final result.The BADOk now whenever a game is created there are always flaws in the storyline, gameplay, ect. The bad part about the game is totally outweighted by the positive side, but lets mention the bad anyway. Ok well the worst part about the game is that there are a lot of movies. This may not hurt some people, but others who want constant action may be afected. About every 10 minutes you will experience a short movie, but sometimes they tend to be quite long and tedious. Another annoying feature of the game is the fact that it is somewhat short with only about 14 hours of PURE gameplay. However the game has alot of replay value, and you can earn cheats such as infinite ammo, and play on extremly hard difficulty. And one final note is the storyline. The storyline is extremly hard to understand, even if you are an extremly smart 13 year old like me. It would literally take the intelligence of a college graduate to figure out the entire story.Overall: 85% This is a very nice game and I would highy recomend it to anyone.

Featuring a clear polycarbonate housing that reveals the controller's inner circuitry, Afterglow signature lighting, and upgraded with PDP's new custom engineered SmartTrack technology, these officially licensed controllers are the perfect blend of performance and value.","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"Nice!","reviewText":"This is a lovely controller. The colored lighting is very pretty, and can be turned off or set to vibrate only if you desire (although why you would deliberately buy a lighted controller and then turn off the lights is beyond me). If like me you like to play late at night with all the lights out this combined with a light-up headset is just the ticket.In terms of overall performance, this unit is VERY close to a normal Xbox 360 Wired/Wireless controller. It is slightly more stiff in all buttons and controls, and the amount of play in the analog sticks is slightly different. If you are crazy sensitive about that sort of thing it may throw you off (fighting games, etc). The controller itself likewise feels very hard/solid. I had a slight discomfort playing racing games due to the way the controller rubbed/pressed against my hand while holding down the analog triggers. Nothing casual players can't adjust to.One thing I really appreciate is the controller is fully compatible with Windows gaming PCs and was instantly recognized by my PC and auto-configured. I was able to start playing PC games with it immediately.I already have two wireless controllers I use for my 360, and another official Xbox 360 wired controller. With this setup I can play two-player games on my PC with the two wired controllers, or play four player on my 360. This makes me very happy. For people who want an extra controller for guests and like/don't mind the pretty lights and slightly different feel, this one is a winner. For the hardcore or those with sensitive hands, they may want to pass, especially if they don't like the lights/color/style of this controller. It's the same price as the official Microsoft wired controller.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JIQW","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The best puzzle game of 2011 is a one-of-a-kind game that must be played by all gamers","reviewText":"The Good: Fantastic level design, completely original and wonderful narrative, tons of new game play mechanics, puzzles feel just right, looks good with nice effects, co-op campaign is just as goodThe Bad: Looks a little dated, puzzles can be daunting for some, some weird checkpoint placementsPortal was a phenomenon and redefined how puzzle games are made. The narrative was original and also helped create one of the best video game songs ever created (\"Still Alive\" by John Coulton). Portal 2 helps build upon this in so many ways and really helps show how a sequel should be done. Instead of just being stuck in lab testing rooms through the whole game there are more environments to enjoy and the narrative takes leaps forward instead of just GLaDOS's voice droning on through speakers.You play as the voiceless Chell once again, but you awaken after being in a coma for some time. A mysterious robot named Wheatley helps you escape your room and you finally get to see what Aperture Laboratories is like outside the testing rooms. You get to see glimpses of the outside world, vegetation has taken over the facility, and the puzzles now take form in so many different ways. Half way through the game you get to see what Aperture was like 50 some odd years ago and find out back stories on yourself, GLaDOS, and the founder of Aperture. The narrative is top notch with lots of cinematic moments, but everything involves puzzle solving and it's so mind bending that each one of the 50+ puzzles feels satisfying. It also goes to show how clever Valve is that I didn't need a walkthrough once to figure out any of the puzzles. There's so many \"AHA!\" moments that you just don't want to put the game down.However, there aren't just portals involved, but other game play elements have been fused into the mix. There are three types of gels that you can use to solve puzzles such as propulsion gel (orange stuff that makes you go really fast), fusion gel (blue stuff that makes things bounce), and conversion gel (it allows portals to be made on non-portal surfaces). Due to these new elements you have to totally rethink how you work with portals and it's a great new mechanic and super fun to use. There are a few other things such as jump pads, new types of companion cubes, turrets, and other items to solve puzzles, but explaining is almost impossible because you should just play it.The puzzles are just so uniquely fused with the narrative that you never feel like your just jumping from room to room anymore. This really feels like a puzzle/adventure this time around and some of the puzzles span two to three rooms even. There's constant chatter from characters while solving puzzles so it doesn't feel as stale this time around. All the new characters are great and you'll like them (or hate them) quickly thanks to Valve's one-of-a-kind storytelling abilities. The music is one thing I love about this game because when you start bouncing around a room or sliding there's unique music that instantly plays when you're doing these things. You get a strong sense of vertigo thanks to the game's new take on heights, but the music is just phenomenal. This soundtrack is purchase worthy and the new GLaDOS song at the end is just as good as \"Still Alive\" but in other ways.The visual quality is great, but Valve really needs a new next generation engine. Portal 2 uses the Left 4 Dead 2 Source engine, so everything looks nice and there's some great visual effects (the gel mainly) as well as great lighting, but it's not exactly up to par. Thankfully there's a huge variety of things to look at this time around (the game is over 10GB!) and the addition of a co-op campaign with an additional story and two new characters is a huge plus so it's like two games in one. There's also some quality extras such as developer commentary and you can customize your robots in the co-op campaign which is a nice touch.Portal 2 is truly something unique for this generation and probably the most innovative puzzle game ever made. With a strong narrative, lovable characters, and tons of new game play mechanics its like the first game didn't even exist. Don't be overwhelmed by working with portals because this game takes your hand for awhile and slowly lets you go when you feel confident enough you'll know. Valve knows how to make great games and other developers need to follow suit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

E Jackson","summary":"Crash's best game","reviewText":"I am shocked and *very* pleased to report that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is a DRASTIC improvement over the original Crash Bandicoot.As you may have heard, I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996.  I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998.Just so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one.  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot.Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got.For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage.Simply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING.  It desperately needed variety.  Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring.  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity.  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel.  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage.  I like that.The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game.  You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in.  For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world.  You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem.  Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss.  By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world.  That comes to 25 stages total.The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages.Oh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete).  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs.  Yup, it's awesome.  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level.Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge.  That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either.  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games.  If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then.  It's definitely not a hard game either.  You WILL beat it.  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic.The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction.  This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect.  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes.One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems.  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage.  I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT in front of you!After you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard.  It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING.  It means you have to run run RUN!  Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement.  It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge.  I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally.I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple.When Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells \"whoa!\"  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top.The reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN.  The game company made the direction the wrong way!  Oops.  At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left.  The same with right.  Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake.  It needs to be corrected once and for all.I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit \"down\" on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed.  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards.There's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge.I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2006"}

Undoubtingly, the series that started from the Nintendo 64 back in 1999, has been the dominant force in the Mario spin-off franchises. It has proven to do so well from the N64, 4 editions for Nintendo's last home console, the Gamecube, and the recent success of Mario Party 8 for the Wii, the mini-game series has still remained as popular as it has been before. The biggest glitch though has remained in the handhelds. With the faults that have occured from the Game Boy Advance edition of Mario Party, many hanheld gamers have still been anxious for something a bit more to hold on too for the party. Now, with a new version for the Nintendo DS, it has proven to be a different course.Mario Party DS brings the popular Mario board game series to a different handheld, and does deliver. There are over 70 different mini-games that range well from the simple use of the stylus, to the button mashing we all loved from before. There are five differnet boards for you to play on ranging from Toadette's Music Room, to Wiggler's Garden, the caterpillar from Super Mario 64, and many more to play with. There are also so many games to play around with that take full advantage of the Nintendo DS like more boss battles like Hexoskeleton, where you have to knock down a king-sized Dry Bones, to his knees by kicking fruits at him, to make him spill down to the floor, or the all-new Rotisserie Rampage, where one player is spinning the meat the other three players are on top of, as you try to roast them out to dry.The gameplay takes full advantage of the DS as you even use the stylus, and the microphone in a game like Blowdown, where you'd have to knockdown a giant whomp by blowing into the mike. The graphics have proven to work much better here, than the e-card and the GBA versions of Mario Party, and takes the gameplay to a whole new innovation, as was the case with the Wii version. Sadly though, there is one big disadvantage with the game, there are 5 boards to play on, a few fewer than the editions from the N64 and Gamecube versions. Nevertheless, it still remains big on the graphics, sound, and fun all in one. It takes a step in the direction DS owners have desired for the franchise.All in all, if you haven't played any edition of Mario Party before for the Gamecube, Wii, or N64 days, you'll definitely love this one for the Nintendo DS. It has so much fun at a great value in gameplay, excitement, and everything you'd expect from Mario, Luigi and company in a game that is fun and loveable in the palms of your hand. I absoluetly recommend this a whole lot, so party on down.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ for solo play; A- for multiplayer actionOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}

Besides having better graphics, the ease of play has increased over the difficulty, making the game that much more enjoyable for vets and entry-level beginners alike. Despite the lack of a background for your characters, the selection is moderate for an old RPG such as this (my favorite character is the Black Mage). I strongly suggest getting the strategy guide as well for this gem, because when you get to certain areas it's hard to ascertain where to go next. The villagers in a nearby town don't provide much in the way of clues. As far as Final Fantasy II goes, I haven't really started playing it yet, however, from trying it out I'm impressed with it. I did not play the Japanese version of this game, so this review is about Final Fantasy I. Since you get two great games for the price of one, I can't see where you would go wrong.All in all, a great classic RPG that doesn't disappoint old-school fans, and gives beginning dungeon-delvers something to experience for the first time with enjoyment.

This special 15th Anniversary Edition also brings tunes from the original soundtrack which you can unlock as you finish the stages.","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"The game that literally never was","reviewText":"The hotly anticipated Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 was intended to celebrate the Blue Blur's 15th Anniversary. That's probably why it was called Sonic the Hedgehog instead of Sonic Adventure 3. As anticipated as it was, though, it was incredibly rushed in development and the result was arguably one of the worst Sonic games ever produced. Not the worst game of all time, of course, but this was still unbelievably BAD.Sonic the Hedgehog follows the formula of the first Sonic Adventure pretty closely. Unfortunately, it's taken the worst of that game to the freaking max! Seriously!Don't be surprised if you spend a good chunk of time wandering around the uninspired and bleak HUB worlds just so you can get to the next level or mission. Absolutely nothing sticks out in these HUB worlds. You just see same-y looking buildings, and whatever you're looking for is more-or-less hidden beneath all the monotony the HUB worlds offer.Actually, monotony plays a semi-big role as one of the game's many major problems. Levels occasionally pit your character against enemies that you're forced to fight to move on. The problem is that you don't have many attacks to work with to kill them, causing you to perform the same attacks over and over again, which can become quite repetitive, especially since the Homing Attack (Sonic & Shadow's main means of mid-air attack) is slightly delayed every time you use it, unlike how you could freely spam it in the Adventure games.Admittedly, the levels can feature some pretty decent level design, as there are indeed some multiple routes and crannies hidden in secret areas, similarly to the classic Sega Genesis Sonics. Unfortunately, there's so much frustration and annoyances thrown into the levels as well. Accompanying the monotony I described earlier is confusing navigation. Sometimes, you'll be likely to wander around the level not knowing where to progress next. And since the camera is also a technical enemy to fight off, don't be surprised if it doesn't give you a good view of anything at certain points.Sonic the Hedgehog is divided into three campaigns + a \"Final Story\" segment that you unlock after completing the three. These campaigns have you play as Sonic, Shadow, and newcomer from the future Silver.Players that have played the Sonic Adventure games may be somewhat familiar with how the game plays, but otherwise would remain puzzled as to what odd changes were made to the mechanics for this game.Sonic's speed has been drastically reduced for this game. Some may see that as a good thing, but it doesn't help matters when the only instances of actual speed in the game are through the automation of dash pads and springs. It's still pretty fortunate that there's a giant emphasis on legit platforming action. Too bad you can't even jump on enemies anymore. Nope. You're forced to use the delayed Homing Attack. Granted, getting the Bounce Bracelet upgrade or leg sweeping can help at times, but in the end, it really wouldn't have killed Sonic Team to allow you to jump on enemies. Imagine if you can't jump on Goombas in a Mario platformer!The highlight of Sonic's journey is the ability to purchase unfinished gem power-ups from the shop very later in the game. By unfinished, I mean that you can abuse the everloving crap out them! And we've got some pretty sweet powers coming from these gems. One gem behaves like a grappling hook, another lets Sonic boost, and one more allows Sonic to jump infinitely! This is why you don't rush your game development.Shadow plays a little similarly to Sonic, except it's even more tedious to use the Homing Attack, because now this dude's \"combat-orientated\", meaning he has to perform a few kicks in mid-air if you wanna bash down baddies with health bars. Shadow also doesn't get to use the gems, and instead, has to deal with carrying around utterly useless Chaos powers (Until the final boss in the campaign).For one reason or another, Shadow also has to be sporting vehicles in several of his stages, and their control feels rather sloppy, and some things you have to do with these vehicles ask for excessive precision (EX: When you have to shoot down Dr. Eggman's train while on a motorcycle).Silver's play mechanics bring in a bunch of new things to the table. For example, he packs a little technique called Psychokinesis and he uses it to throw things at enemies! It's actually kinda fun to play around with, and it's not too shabby to have the ability to fly for a few seconds. Just wait til you have to try to pick up enemies themselves, though. You'll have a rough time doing that, because the hit detection absolutely SUCKS. And don't even get me started on the infamous BALL PUZZLE (In one level), which requires you to use your Psychokinesis on a metallic ball a limited amount of times so it can be thrown into the last of bunches of holes. If you fail here, the ball explodes and respawns back to start. It is much, MUCH easier said than done.If playing as these three hedgehogs wasn't enough to satisfy your needs, the game also unnecessarily and abruptly switches your character to another every once in a suspiciously long while. These characters only appear exclusive to one hedgehog's campaign. Tails (fox guy) & Knuckles (red guy) make their appearances in Sonic's campaign, Omega (robot guy) and Rouge (supposedly a bat) are playable in Shadow's campaign, and Blaze (cat thing) and Amy (Sonic-obsessed fangirl) are in Silver's campaign. Each of these characters, despite not appearing that much at all, bring in some of their own unique tricks and problems.Tails plays almost like he did in Sonic Adventure, except much worse. His weight (Actually...every character's weight for that matter) can never stay put. His ground speed is way too slow, but he moves fast when flying, and then he flat-out DROPS when out of breath in flight. His tedious attack? The Dummy Ring bomb, which while effective, takes too long to do, and this is his only method of attack. How creeeeaaative.Knuckles/Rouge can glide in the air, but it couldn't feel any further off thanks to the heaviness of these characters. And as Knuckles sports almost useless punches, Rouge has bombs. Eesh. And even when climbing on a wall, it's difficult to LET GO.Blaze is the most tolerable side-character of all, because she borrows assets and moves from Sonic. She's got a Homing Attack, effective fire attack, a double jump, etc.Meanwhile, Amy's double jump is pathetic. This girl has also borrowed mechanics from Sonic Adventure, and they too have worsened here. On top of being as slow as Tails, Amy doesn't seem like she could attack in mid-air, and for some reason, can turn invisible, but what use is that? I mean, really.Lastly, Omega the robot guy thingamabob shoots missiles that are usually hit-and-miss when it comes to collision. However, this robot also has a hovering move that can be easily abused thanks to how it cancels all vertical momentum. Just repeatedly mash the A button and explore.Perhaps the most infamous topic this game has fallen under is physics, and how badly the game fails at capturing them. Sonic can stand upside-down on loop-de-loops, and you can make blocks fly and drown in sand. There's nothing more that needs to be said, other than you may as well watch some YouTube videos of people finding hilarious oddities like these all the time.The huge lack of polish can also be seen within the game's multiple missions that you can access via the boring HUB worlds. They often consist of enemy sprees, orange rings, etc, but there seriously isn't that much of a variety. Some idiotic ones include that one mission where you have to guess who the Commander is (Who is the first person you speak to), and the three trials. Oh dear lord the three trials....Thank GOD you only have to play a COUPLE of these god-forsaken missions..................I think this review has gone long enough for you to get the point I'm trying to make: This game is really, really bad. There's a BIT of fun to be had, but those moments are so incredibly far and few between.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B006ZPAXYW","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Ross","summary":"Finally, Something Different ... This is the MMO We've Been Waiting For","reviewText":"Funcom as a developer has had a somewhat checkered history among gamers.  While Anarchy Online, its earlier title, had a strong yet small following, Age of Conan disappointed many due to its premature release, which was reflected in a lack of content and many bugs in various game systems.  So, to be quite honest, I didn't expect anything in particular at all from The Secret World, other than perhaps a better version of The Matrix Online.Well.Funcom has created a secret masterpiece.  The Secret World is an MMO which, in many ways, reflects the desires of MMO fans who have been playing the genre for 10+ years, and want something different from yet another clone of World of Warcraft.  And this game delivers that, on pretty much all levels.The gameplay is reminiscent of other 3D MMOs, yet the action system is different, being based on synergies between skills and weapon choices.  The game affords the player the flexibility to choose their own skills in whatever way they wish -- which also allows players to mess up their decisions with an old school approach of having to live with one's mistakes in this regard.  As a result, the game has a steep learning curve, but rewards players who want more complexity in their MMO experience as compared with most of the offerings since 2004.The mechanics of the game involve the familiar quest system, yet in TSW the focus is very, very heavy on story telling (even more than in TOR, the first MMO to focus heavily on story telling .. and it has quite better writing than TOR does as well).  And quest design is not monolithic.  There are storyline quests and main quests and then side quests -- and the main quests can be either combat, investigation (puzzle solving) or sabotage (stealth) in nature.  This makes for a very diverse gameplay set as compared with almost any other 3D MMO.  Quests advance in \"tiers\", and the story focus is underscored by a strict limit on the kind and number of quests one can be \"working on\" at any one time (gone are the days of going to a quest hub, loading up on its quests, and powerleveling through them to \"level as efficiently as possible\" -- you are following stories here that have their own pace).  And speaking of leveling -- there are no levels, either, but rather Action Points (used to purchase new abilities) and Skill Points (used to upgrade abilities in weapons and armor slots) which are rewarded based on experience and certain quest completion.  The player can allocate these in any way they wish (there are no set classes), although research is recommended to optimize one's choice -- in that sense, the degree of complexity and prep required is moving in the direction of EVE Online, although not nearly as complex as EVE is.I will say this, however.  If you are looking for a light-hearted pew-pew type game, this is not that.  If you don't want to invest time to learn the game's systems (which are not really like the familiar MMO systems), you won't like this game.  If you are looking for another game where you can rush to max level and look around \"to see what the endgame is like\", then you won't like it either.  As a result, I believe this is a niche game, similar in that respect as well to EVE Online -- a game that will appeal to a certain segment of gamers, but not the \"mass market\" of MMO gamers like WoW or TOR or GW2.So... if you're a bit of an experienced and jaded MMO gamer who is looking for something a bit different, a bit more complex, and quite a bit less mainstream, give TSW a try.  It's a great game for people who are looking for the kind of experience it offers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

You begin to imagine that you can play this with the little kids and have fun for hours.Then you get into the game. The main story - a remake of the N64 \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" has all its built in nastiness and fun. It's a game adults can enjoy for hours and hours.The graphics are rather impressive, in their cartoony way. If it's raining out, the raindrops cascade down the monitor screen. The HUD is easy to read iwthout interfering with your shots. The maps provide a cartoony visual interest while being fun to play in.The sounds are pretty straightforward for a platformer. In fact, when you're doing multiplayer type capture-the-flag sorts of games, they bleep out some of the swears so you're being shielded from some of the nasiness.You have to give these guys some credit. With the graphics and sound work, they could easily have made a simple kid-friendly game that families would have bought up and played. We could have had yet another standard platforming game with \"furry creature\" and including a multiplayer aspect to it. However, these developers aimed for something different. They created a platformer that was directly aimed towards adults. They created a multiplayer world that involved furry rodents. So this isn't the normal audience for platformers - and it isn't the normal way that combat-oriented multiplayer guys want to play either. Still, the game is fun and it draws both groups in.I'm always very much for games that help to stretch the boundaries, and this game is definitely one of those. Again - not for kids - but it can be great fun for adults who are willing to give it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00DV16N6U","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Solid Game","reviewText":"It feels like it's been a long time since we had a true Ratchet and Clank sequel.  We had spinoffs such as All 4 One and games like Full Frontal Assault that didn't quite feel like Ratchet and Clank.  Into the Nexus certainly feels like a true Ratchet and Clank game, and yet it still falls short of the glory that the two Ratchet and Clank: Future Games released earlier did (not including Quest for Booty).The game begins with our heroes escorting Vendra to the Vartex Detention Facility.  Things don't go as planned, however, when her brother comes to her aid and things get a little screwed up.  It forces Ratchet and Clank to have to stop her.  It's a simple story that contains many of the things you'd expect from Ratchet and Clank.  Though it never really hits the notes of Tools of Destruction or A Crack in Time, the story isn't bad.  The only thing about it is that it's just such a short experience without feeling like a fully complete one in some respects.  Previous outings have typically been bigger and filled with more intrigue but Into the Nexus is short and sweet, even when including all the side quests.On the other hand, those familiar with Ratchet and Clank will, more or less, feel right at home as the basic formula isn't really all that changed.  The game is still throwing various obstacles at you and there's still a lot of fun to be had with weapons.  There's not a whole lot new here.  You've got weapons like the Winterizer that turns enemies into snowmen for good measure.  Other weapons such as one that gives your enemies nightmares for good measure.  There are also some that return like the fusion bombs, but for the most part there's nothing that makes Into the Nexus stand out in the same way that previous games have.  That's not necessarily a bad thing and at this price there's not much reason to complain.  It just feels like it's not quite a leap forward when compared to previous titles in the series.  It's still good and will be loved by any fan of Ratchet and Clank, but it still doesn't quite feel like the next big thing for Ratchet and Clank.Like the gameplay, nothing about the presentation has really changed either.  The character models are the same.  It's still a gorgeous game with a great design.  Though it doesn't look any different from A Crack in Time that's not bad at all.  A Crack in Time was a marvelous looking game and so is this one.  By now we know what the PS3 is capable of and sometimes the aesthetic quality is important.  Into the Nexus has that.  The voice acting and cutscenes are also really well done. Likewise, the music is absolutely amazing here.In the long run Ratchet and Clank Into the Nexus doesn't do anything wrong.  It just feels like it doesn't want to change anything either.  A lot of the stuff here feels like they're running down a checklist of what needs to be included for a Ratchet and Clank experience.  Hunting for those gold bolts or acquiring skill points can't exactly extend the length of the game by very much.  Some gameplay segments are really well done (the opening moments especially) but there is certainly the feeling that this one was a little more rushed out than previous installments.  What's going to keep it down the most is the excruciatingly short amount of time you'll spend getting through the campaign.  And it isn't that the campaign is short that's so strange about it.  It's actually that the story comes to a close somewhat abruptly.  You'll feel like perhaps more could've been done with it.  Nevertheless for the price it's worth checking out for Ratchet and Clank fans","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

There's the Mario Bros. There's the legend of Zelda. And then there's always Castlevania. Having wooed fans all around the world for almost 20 years, the legendary Castlevania makes its debut now on the Nintendo DS, and it looks better than ever. Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, to put it simply, is an instant classic.The events in Dawn of Sorrow are set in the year 2036, a year after the last GBA Castlevania game, Aria of Sorrow. The hero in that game, Soma Cruz, returns to fight another day. If you didn't already know, Soma is the reincarnation of the notorious Dracula, who was the villain from many Castlevania games of past.  With an evil cult hell bent on using him to resurrect the dark lord this time round, Soma was forced to pay a visit to their headquarters, and generally take up the task of stopping the rebirth.The process of taking on the bad guys, inevitably, happens in a labyrinth-like castle. The design of the castle is similar to previous establishments. Enemies, tough bosses, booby traps and environmental puzzles are littered all over the place, and as Soma, you'll need all your combat and strategizing skills to complete your ultimate objective.Dawn of Sorrow throws in a fair amount of enemies for you to fight. In fact, there're a total 116 to take on. Some of these are new enemies making their first appearance in the Castlevania franchise, but many are familiar faces that fans of the game will no doubt remember from previous instalments. To fight these enemies, you'll be given a wide range of weapons. Depending on the abilities of your enemies, different weapons are required. For example, a pole that strikes horizontally may not be effective in taking out a flying enemy, but a large sword that deals a vertical, frontal blow will do the job very well. This basically means that you'll have to master the advantages of your weapons, or face the possibility of being totally overwhelmed.Weapons are sometimes found in hidden rooms of the castle, and you'll find it worthwhile to pick up some of them if you happen to see them. If you manage to gain your enemies' souls during fights, however, you can cast them into your weapons to form bigger and more powerful weapons as well. This process of upgrading, called weapon synthesis, is one of the most important features of the game. To get the upgrade FOC by killing enemies, then grabbing and casting their souls, the game allows you to increase your effectiveness in combat without the need of spending precious gold on buying these improved weapons. This is definitely a welcomed feature for any player of this game.You may ask then, what's a soul? Well, if you've played Aria of Sorrow, the concept of souls should not be new. Basically, by killing enemies, you'll get the chance to grab their souls for your own use. Not all enemies give up their souls easily though. In order for you to get some of them, repetition is required. In fact, repeatedly killing an enemy just to get its soul is one of the most mundane parts of the game, and for completists who have to collect every soul, the challenge will be even greater.Apart from improving your weapons, getting souls also allow you to utilise the special powers of your enemies. For example, if you've the Skeleton soul, you can use it to throw bones at your enemies. If you get the Waiter Skeleton soul, you can start attacking your foes by throwing plates of delicious curry (!). Well, you get the story. While some souls are practically useless, some, like the Axe Armor soul (which allows you to throw flying axes), are very useful in taking out the various bosses in the game. It's advisable to spend time grabbing these souls if you want an easier time in the castle.Boss fights, like fighting enemies, are frequent occurrences throughout this game. You'll usually get more powerful abilities after taking out bosses, again in the form of souls, which allow you to proceed in the game. For example, you'll need to kill the first boss to get the Flying Armor soul, so that you can \"hang\" in the air while jumping. This is essential to reach a previously unreachable area because a high platform is blocking your way. Environmental puzzles like this are common in Dawn of Sorrow, and when you encounter one, you'll have to ask whether you've the required souls to solve them. So, even when grabbing souls could be tedious, you'd want to spend some time doing it, if only just to get what you really need to progress. In any case, if you're really out of sorts, you may consider trading extra enemies' souls with your friend through Wi-Fi.Soul-searching is not the only thing that requires repeated effort though. Recent Castlevania games have included a levelling up element that is commonly found in RPGs, and Dawn of Sorrow is no exception. Fighting (and beating) enemies earns you experience points, and gaining these points will in turn make you a stronger fighter. For example, an enemy that takes you three strikes to destroy at level 1 will be a breeze at level 10.Enemies in the later part of the game are very tough, so gaining a respectable level will definitely help your quest better. However, as the game is pretty short in the story mode, you may not reach a high enough level to take on the game's more powerful bosses. As such, you'll need to spend time killing enemies over and over again to raise your levels, and this gets annoying after a while. The good thing is, while soul-searching and levelling up take up a lot of time, at least the enemies will always respawn, thus speeding up the process a little. Still, if repetitive gameplay bores you easily, you may find these portions of the game really tedious.Apart from weapons, you'll also come across a variety of items in the game. This could include healing items (potions, meat strip, milk, etc.), protective gear (tunic, scarves, breastplate, etc.) and even performance-enhancement rings (get more gold, increase luck, gain more experience points, etc.) Some of these items can be purchased at a permanent shop, while others require some exploration. Again, this gives you the incentive to check out the castle completely for any hidden rooms. Apart from these items, you'll also get seemingly useless items like rotten food, which reduces your health if you take them. But then again, if you gain a soul that allows you to eat unpalatable food, the same rotten food can become a healing agent when the going gets tough.The shop also sells items like periodicals, which include stuff like tabloids and maps. The tabloids will inform you about rare souls that hide in the background of the screens they appear, and how you can get their souls. These are important if you want to achieve 100% souls.  But the most important periodical to buy is no doubt the castle map. The map will appear on the top screen of your DS, which means that the days of pausing the game just to check your map are over!  This is definitely a handy improvement from previous versions of the game, thanks to the DS' dual screen.Dawn of Sorrow also utilizes some the DS' touch screen, even though not in abundance. After earning the soul of Balore, you'll be able to break ice crystals that block you path by touching them with the stylus. The game also introduces the concept of Magical Seals, which are essential in completely destroying a boss. When a boss' health reaches zero during a fight, a magical seal will appear on the touch screen. You'll need to draw the seal with your stylus so as to \"seal\" the boss for good. If you don't do it properly, the boss will regain health, and you'll have to fight it again. This is a nice little idea that makes use of the DS' feature, but it's not entirely user-friendly for left-handers.  Thankfully, you don't really need to draw the seal in an exact fashion. As long as you get the strokes right, the game will register it, and you should be fine.The graphics of the game are also top-notch. Yes, they're 2D, but they're also as good as you can get for a 2D presentation. The background of each level of the castle, for example, is simply breath-taking. The levels are also separated by various themes, so you'll end up visiting an eerie garden, a creepy playhouse, a dark chapel, and even hell. The designs for each area are drawn to such perfection that you'll find yourself immersing into the background as you go along. Also, while the characters do look a little small on screen, the details on them are still amazingly rendered. The mood of each level is also aptly complemented by some great music. In fact, the music is so good that Konami decided to include a Sound Test as an unlockable if you manage to complete the game with the \"good\" ending. This allows you to listen to the various tracks without having to play the game. Ideal for enjoying them without worrying about the dreaded Medusa Head floating around on screen!Recent Castlevania games have a similarity. They all have a \"good\" ending, a \"bad\" ending, and a completely \"fake\" ending. Ideally, you should achieve every one of them if you intend to watch all the possibilities, but you'd really want to achieve both the good and bad ones, because they unlock some really awesome goodies.As I mentioned, the good ending unlocks the Sound Test, which is really cool. It also triggers a brand new play mode called the Boss Rush Mode. In this mode, you'll take on the bosses that you fought in the story mode in quick succession, and beating the specific time requirements will earn you special items not found in the regular game. Sounds good? Well, there's more.Completing the bad ending will unlock the Julius Mode, which allows you to engage the current castle with characters like Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades and Alucard, who're established characters in the Castlevania universe. Telling more about this mode will spoil the fun, so I'll just leave it at that.Apart from these special modes, completing the game will also unlock Hard Mode, which is essentially the same game you've played, only with a host of tougher enemies and environment. And if you fancy playing the game with a friend, you can take the Enemy Set Mode, which allows you to design your own castle, and then take on your friend through Wi-Fi to see who can finish the areas faster.  Regardless of what additional modes you decide to play, they've all been included to encourage replayability, and they should add to the 10-12 hours of estimated play time you can clock on the main story mode.This game is named Dawn of Sorrow as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the DS, but it's really a dawn of a brighter future for the Castlevania franchise. Dawn of Sorrow has the potential to be the game of the year, at least for the DS, and it's not difficult to understand why. Great gameplay, impressive graphics, awesome audios and a whole lot of goodies to boot - what do you mean you don't have a DS?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2005"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular, maybe the best third-party game of the year","reviewText":"Calling Assassin's Creed eagerly anticipated is saying it lightly.  In what may be the best holiday season for video games ever, Assassin's Creed may very well be the best third-party, multi-platform game to come out all year, as it delivers on every level and then some.  From the minute you plunge into the huge, absolutely gorgeous world of the major cities of the 12th Century Holy Land, you will be immersed in the story progression of the game, as well as the overall presentation of this long in-development project.  Assassin's Creed puts you in the shoes of Altair, a master assassin who has more than one trick up his sleeve.  His graceful moves are what makes Assassin's Creed so good to start with, as you run, jump, and take out targets.  Altair's stealth moves are performed surprisingly easy thanks to the incredibly fluid controls, which shine even more in the heat of combat.  Presentation wise though, is where Assassin's Creed will receive the most accolades.  The three towns that take up the game; Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus, are brilliantly realized.  Everything from the townspeople to the brilliant sound designs and effects will get your attention, but it's the little things that really make Assassin's Creed special.  Little touches in terms of character movement and behavior as well as environmental effects are what also help make Assassin's Creed a real winner, as well as the brilliant music score to boot.  If there's any drawbacks to Assassin's Creed, there are occasional graphical glitches, but nothing that super noticible.  The game's ending may cause some confusion as well, and leaves the door open for an inevitable sequel, but if there ever was a game that deserved a sequel, Assassin's Creed definitely does.  All in all, Assassin's Creed is a spectacular game that lives up to it's hype, and saying it's an essential pick up is saying it ever so lightly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2007"}

(I believe that Gears of War, Fear, and Halo 3 have the best shooter type controls.) The one gripe with control that I have is the sheer amount of accidental grenade tosses that I've done so far. Fortunately my friend was no where near the blast zone except once. Otherwise spot on and good job.My next gripe is the story seemed a little light from my brief time with the game but it might get better as you play.Those two things out of the way, let's get on to the meat and potatoes of the review.Characters, each character brings unique abilities and ability trees to the game. No Final Fantasy syndrome here. (Where every character ends up identical save for their limit breaks) There's a character that snipes, a character that beats people with his fists and blows *** up, an all around soldier type, and a psychic. You choose your character at the start. I kind of wish there were more aesthetic customizations at the start but that's a minor issue. Each character is also capable of leveling up specific weapon groups faster or does something unique with each weapon type.For example the Soldier really shines in my opinion using the Assault Rifle, the Psychic girl on the other hand, only fires one round at a time using Assault Rifles. Not exactly the weapon for her to be using by any means. However, she gets a great deal of abilities which increase things related to her firing rate, and elemental properties of weapons. So she is better with the SMG (sub machine gun) type of weapons or pistols.For abilities, each character has a variety of talent trees that they can gain abilities from. This is not entirely disimilar to Diablo II or World of Warcraft or many other games in this genre. It works, so don't fix it.These talent trees, can create a very wide variety of play styles, making it unlikely that you'll run into someone that is the -exact same- as you. Each weapon group levels separately as well, which only further increases variety.Speaking of Variety, let's talk about the weapons in this game. Oh my God. Each weapon falls under a specific weapon type (This is so you don't have 2.2 billion ammo types to lug around), within those types however there are countless (It's some where in the millions but you get the idea) build possibilities of each weapon. It's unlikely that you find the exact same weapon twice unless it's off of a boss. I have yet to have an exact repeat weapon. Especially since there are also levels of each weapon to increase the variety even further. For example, a friend of mine found Bone Shredder, an SMG with a scope, an accuracy booster and a recoil reducer. I found one I think was named Dragonfire, which shot flaming bullets and had improved damage.You kill things, and take their loot. It's basically the new Diablo, but for the Consoles and for the modern age. I like to say this game is what happens when Halo has a baby with Diablo because that's alot like what this is. If you enjoy one, or the other category of the two named games you'll enjoy Borderlands. If you like both, you'll love this game.The game is also filled with some quirky humor, and a great art style that I think more games should try to do. Cel Shading has really come into it's own on the 360. More games need to utilize it rather than trying to go for the \"Super realistic\" graphics which we all know from the PS2 and the PS1 before it, will become a little ugly to look at when we come back to play our \"old\" games in the next console stage. Better to go stylized. It endures much better.I give the game five stars on a scale where 2.5 is average on fun factor, and four for overall. There's just a couple of niggling details which keep me from giving it a full five.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}

I beat Chains of Olympus in a few hours.The story line and game play of Chains of Olympus, I feel, were much better than Ghost of Sparta by a long shot. It actually doesn't even feel like Ghost of Sparta has a story line, and whatever story line it does have seems like they threw it together quickly just to make another title.I feel like the God of War line has gotten worse as it went on. The first one was still the best with way more challenges and puzzles. Now they are just seemingly becoming less puzzles and more hacking and slashing.I recommend playing these games if you're a fan and want a better scope of the story (Chains of Olympus), but considering the short play time and replay value, maybe your better off renting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2013"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Survive a Nightmare","reviewText":"The Good:+Very good story+Simple to learn gameplay but difficult to master+Multiple endings+Very pretty game+Fantastic Soundtrack+The meter of \"lawful\" or \"chaos\" presented here is much more unique than in most games.  There's not being a \"good\" or \"bad\" guy, it is only about figuring out who Vincent is.The Bad:-The difficulty is going to turn off some gamers-It's a little too easy to screw up unintentionally-The stages near the end seem based a lot around luck rather than skill---Note: The Following review is lengthyIn recent times there haven't been a slew of games that have really stuck out.  A lot tend to be either the next first person shooter or have you facing off against aliens as some kind of super soldier or something along those lines.  And as much fun as those games can be, it is always refreshing to see something slightly different.  Atlus often strives to give a good gaming experience and it shows here.  Catherine is a very unique game that will challenge players and give them an experience that few video games can give.  This is because of Catherine's unique design and style.You take on the role of Vincent.  He's been dating Katherine (with a \"K\") for five years now, and it's come to the point where she wants to take that relationship to the next level.  A level Vincent isn't sure he's ready for yet.  While thinking this over at the bar one night he suddenly meets a spunky young woman named Catherine (with a \"C\") and she's almost everything Vincent wants in a woman.  He begins an affair with this woman, but as the narrative goes on we see that Vincent is a conflicted man, confused by what he wants.  To make matters worse, young men have been dying of mysterious deaths in their sleep and Vincent himself might be next if he can't figure out how to escape his nightmares.  But what do his nightmares have to do with this mysterious woman named Catherine?  Quite a bit actually and as Vincent dives into this mystery he'll learn more about what's really going on... as well as himself.The narrative in Catherine is quite amusing.  Vincent is actually a likeable and sympathetic character.  Despite his predicament the game manages to get you to understand just who Vincent is.  But in the end it is ultimately you who will lead Vincent to what he really wants.  Is he ready to settle down with the woman he's been dating for four years or is she truly not right for him?There are two aspects to Catherine's gameplay.  The first and probably most unique is what happens during the day.  You'll watch cutscenes, none of which are really long, and then you'll usually find yourself in the Stray Sheep.  A bar where you can go and talk to your friends, send and receive text messages and get a few drinks.  On the surface this doesn't seem like much, but as you talk to certain people you'll often be asked questions.  How you answer showcases the kind of guy Vincent is.  There's a meter in the corner that shows you going closer to a \"Lawful\" side (blue) or a \"Chaotic\" side (red).  While most games make their choices quite obvious, no one way is truly \"good\" or \"bad\".  No side is either \"heroic\" or \"evil.\"  The game even encourages you to be as honest as possible when playing through the game.  It gives a nice little twist as some of the questions you're asked don't have obvious \"lawful\" or \"chaotic\" answers.  And again, because it bears repeating, neither side is better than the other.  The impact of these choices will change Vincent's inner thoughts during some of the game's crucial scenes.  Ultimately it's about deciding what Vincent wants and it's actually quite important for the player to be as honest as possible--at least during your first play through.The second aspect of Catherine's gameplay comes during Vincent's dreams.  The nightmare stages are where the crux of the actual gameplay come out.  You'll ascend towers by pulling out and pushing blocks that allow you to scale higher and higher.  It's a simple game to learn, but as you progress things become a little more challenging.  In early stages you'll be faced with sheep who are also trying to climb the tower who will do their best to knock you down.  You'll also be faced with different types of blocks as you get further.  There will be cracked blocks that will slowly crumble under you, ice blocks that you'll slide on, trap blocks where spikes shoot out and more.In between levels you'll be on landings where you can save your game and talk to some of the other sheep.  Some will teach you techniques, others give you a chance to make choices that will affect your lawful/chaotic meter... but the most important aspect is what happens before each level.  You'll enter a confessional and be asked a series of questions.  These questions have a greater impact on your meter but are also interesting questions.  You'll be asked odd question such as whether or not you prefer boxers or briefs and then you'll be asked other strange questions such as what really constitutes cheating: An emotional tryst or a physical fling?  The questions aren't all black and white.  And sometimes the answer you'd think would lead you more toward the lawful side will actually lead you more toward the chaotic one instead.  Again, the game encourages you to answer them as honestly as you can.Catherine is an easy game to learn, but it's difficult the master.  Some of the puzzles are very difficult.  Without utilizing some of the techniques you'll learn from the sheep you probably won't find yourself getting far.  The lower floors beneath you are also collapsing away.  You can \"undo\" moves a certain amount of times, but that doesn't always make the game easier.  Gamers who are frustrated easily might not enjoy Catherine as much.  You're given rewards for getting to the top of the tower as fast as possible without stopping, including some unlockables if you're really skilled.  But it's not hard to find gamers who find some of Catherine's challenges to be a bit much.  You'll also encounter bosses from time to time and some of those levels feel as though luck plays a bigger part than skill itself.  Luckily Catherine is quite generous with giving you extra lives, and being able to undo moves helps the difficulty somewhat.  They also give you items to help you along the way.Catherine isn't a very long game by any means.  Your first romp will probably take you just over ten hours to complete.  But there is incentive to play through again.  You can experience the story in different ways if you wish by making different choices which affect your meter.  This also plays a big role in the kind of ending you get.  Catherine has eight different endings.  And which one you get depends on your choices.  I won't tell you there are no \"bad\" endings in Catherine, however, each side of the meter actually has a different set of endings.  This is partially why being honest is important.  Because going the \"chaotic\" route doesn't give you a \"bad\" or \"evil\" ending anymore than going the lawful route will guarantee you a \"good\" ending.There's no doubt that Catherine is a beautiful game.  It has a very anime like quality to it and some vibrant character models.  The game is also populated with lots of different characters that you'll talk to, who are all well developed in their own way.  The voice acting and the writing are also not so bad.  There are some moments where the voice acting encounters a hitch, but not too many.  The music, however, is a real treat.  Much of the music you'll hear in the game are remixed classical tunes from some famous composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Holst, Handel and Chopin.  You'll recognize most of them when they begin to play.  Those who bought the game brand new will receive a music CD where you can listen to these tracks.Catherine isn't a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination.  We talked about some of its difficulty, but it also has a couple of control issues every now and then.  The biggest issue being they feel a little loose.  It's easy to make Vincent do something you didn't intend, such as push a block or run in the wrong the direction unintentionally at just the slight tilt of the analog stick.  Likewise, the final set of levels seem much more dependent on luck rather than any actual skill.  You'll be more than happy to have that redo option once you get there.In the end Catherine is a great game.  It's narrative and overall structure of its story makes it a game worth checking out.  It also provides a challenge for players willing to undergo the trials.  Though some will find the challenge a bit much, those who slave through it will find a sense of accomplishment for doing so.  The dynamic of the meter and multiple endings also help Catherine out a little.  Simply put, if you like puzzle games and good stories, Catherine is worth picking up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2011"}

It was nice to get closure for our two assassins and I found Altair's story to be especially poignant. There are some great setpiece moments and there's enough action and general craziness to keep even the most jaded gamers satisfied. The bits where you get to play as Altair were really action packed and made for very satisfying interludes in Ezio's story.Ezio's new weapon is a hookblade which you can use on ziplines to get you around the city, which is a nifty new feature but really the only thing that makes any kind of noticeable difference in gameplay. In combat, you use it to put a serious hurting on your enemies and it also helps you scale the heights of Constantinople even faster and easier than you could in previous games.They've brought back the multiplayer portion from AC: Brotherhood and it's vastly improved. New game modes, new character models and a more detailed level of customization make this one of the standout multiplayer games of the year and shamefully, a lot of people won't give this the time of day. If you like the gameplay style of the AC series, you absolutely must give the multiplayer component a shot, it's some of the most unnerving and tense competition you can find online.Each game in the series brings forth new ideas and scenarios but the additions made to AC: Revelations kind of lack that flair from the previous games. What I didn't like about this game was the whole new tower defense element that has you and your assassins protecting your dens against the Byzantines. I liked the idea of it, it was the execution that was simply awful. It's not very much fun and you're hampered by a control scheme that doesn't work in your favor when there's a lot going on at once. You'll be forced to endure these moments several times and it's a factor of the game that should've been polished before it was inserted. There's also a first person element that has Desmond retracing his roots in some weird metaphysical realm that in all honesty could've been done much better and could've been much more enjoyable. Here, it just feels out of place and I could not wait to be done with these sections while playing them. They've also made the assassin missions more involved this time but I feel they dropped the ball there also in terms of fun. It involves a bit of micromanaging and gets annoying when you're trying to keep these other areas out of the Templar's grasp. I didn't care much for this either.I'm hoping the next AC game doesn't get released for a bit so they can take the necessary time to make sure it's running on all cylinders but I believe that next year will see a new installment in the series. AC: Revelations would get a recommendation from me, especially if you already enjoy the games. There's a lot to see and do as usual and of course, lots of item collecting and hoarding to busy yourself with. I just hope the next installment really brings forth some better implemented ideas and a change of scenery.Resquiescat in pace, gentlemen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2011"}

While I do play FPS games, it's on consoles. (Don't hate! Someone's gotta keep Sony in business. ;).  You can change everything from the power save settings to the DPI, acceleration, lift-off distance, and of course all the LED colors. One cool thing you can do with the LEDs in both the mouse and the charging dock is set them so they will show you what you're mouse's battery life is. So as it goes down, it goes from green when fully changed, through the colors of yellow, orange and red as is loses it's charge.The charging dock is used for both charging the mouse and as the mouse's wireless receiver. So there isn't an additional piece needed to take up yet another USB port. But you'll want to keep that in mind for desk space. The charging dock is actually one of the nicest parts to this set. The mouse drops into it easily and the colors glow on it really well. It has a slip resistant backing too, so it doesn't move around on you.The option to use this as a wired or wireless mouse is outstanding. I've been using the mouse mostly wirelessly since I got it and it's been incredibly responsive. However I will say if I was playing something as intense a FPS in online multiplayer with this mouse, I'd probably end up choosing to use the wired option. Anything to get that extra edge, even if it's just an extra millisecond.  But that's easy enough to do since you just remove the USB cable from the back of the charging dock and plug it into the mouse to create a wired connection. This is also handy in case you're using the mouse wirelessly and the battery goes dead. You can just plug it in and start using it again.The mouse design and build quality is going to be one of those things that each person will either love or hate. It's really light weight and it's not covered in all sorts of various ergonomic and cool looking angles like some other gaming mice brands are. However for certain types of gaming, having a light weight mouse is essential or preferred. So to one person it might feel cheap, to another it's a must-have feature. And the simplistic and smooth design allows it to work with all sizes of hands, and also those who are right handed and those who are left handed.This is an awesome mouse, loaded with customization options in the software and works great as both a  wired and wireless mouse. However it's price right now at launch is steep. What makes it stand apart from so many other gaming mice is the choice to use it wired or wirelessly, and I'm not sure that alone is enough to make it worth all the extra money. It may however be for some. For everyone else, I'd suggest waiting for it to come down some in price to a more comparable match to other gaming mice of similar quality. You'll like it a whole lot more that way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2014"}

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

By the time you get out, she's gone.Graphics: don't expect ...graphics here, it's a very simple look but then again, that's all you need.Music: you're gonna laugh at the Sim language. It's basically just gibberish. Music isn't bad. When your Sim dances, his wooing is quite funny.Despite some hits in the gameplay department, this is actually an addicting game...if you can keep the bugger happy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!","reviewText":"GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.(Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

This game is still amazing. You truly feel like you are playing the ps3 version of the show. I have not played online so i cant comment on that. The road to the show is pretty much what i play on the show and is still as addicting as ever. Really not much to say about this game if youve played the ps3 version you you can pick this game up and have no problems. The touch screen works so well and is a great shortcut to navagate the menus. The graphics are wonderful in this game. Blows my mind that a handheld game can look so good.

I am about 8 hours into playtime and it is definitely the best racer I ever experienced. I have never played any GT games, but I played most other famous racers like the Burnouts, PGR2 and 3 and NFS. I would like to address some perceptions to help the potential buyer make an informed decision.Sensation of Speed - Give the game time to build up your collection of cars. Once you are awarded the high-end cars, the sensation of speed is undeniable, especially at 60 frames per second. One can't really compare this game to the Burnout titles which give a totally different and arcade-like feel.Graphics - There are complaints out there that the game has \"jaggies\". I just don't see them. The graphics and especially the modeling of the cars are the best I have seen in a racer with not a single frame-drop ever. I do have an HD set and perhaps the game doesn't look good on a 480i set. I couldn't tell you.Sound -Although the music is B- rated at best, the sound where it counts, in the cars and ambient sound, is excellent.Tracks - This is where I agree with most in that the variety of tracks is definitely lacking. Also, the tracks are quite plain. That may be the sacrifice the design yields from sticking to 60 FPS.Wheel misperception -Unless you have been racing with a wheel or don't have much experience with racing games using a dual stick controller, I DON'T recommend getting one. I have been playing racing games with a dual stick controller for a long time. I thought too that getting a wheel would improve my experience. I bought a good quality wheel and had to return it because the paradigm shift was too great. Keep in mind all the nuances that your fingers are used to in adjusting the dual stick controllers and triggers for gas and brake. These movements now have to be translated to a wheel and your feet. I winded up returning the wheel because I couldn't keep any car under control and I realized it wasn't the wheel's fault, it was my inability to translate from the sticks to the wheel. Again, that is just me.Difficulty - Again some people think it is too hard or too easy. I just don't see it. This title has an unprecedented amount of difficulty settings from any video game, not just racers. One has to spend the time to see the many different options available to adjust difficulty from almost arcade-like to extremely difficult with many increments in between those settings.This is a superb quality title and I highly recommend experiencing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2007"}

All the graphical bells and whistles are here: dynamic shadows and lighting, high resolution textures, the ability to densely pack together hundreds of NPC's into a single level, ragdoll physics, and amazing cloth animation are all present and run like a well oiled machine on the PS3.The campaign is also fairly long (20 missions) and takes you across a large range of different settings, some of my favorite levels being the ones where it is jam packed with people in them (Chinatown, Subway Station, and a Strip Club).  That being said, I was a little disappointed that most of my favorite levels in this game were in the beginning and middle portion of the game, whereas the last half really bogged down into levels that contained fewer NPC's (who were just more heavily armed) in each map.This game also seems to run a lot of event driven sequences, an example being that enemy's will only begin speaking and then walking their pre-determined route once you come within range of them.  This leads to playing the game a lot like you would be playing out a movie script, and also makes the game feel a little simplistic in nature.  I think the previous games played out like this, but the most fun I've experienced while playing this game was when I had no idea what the heck was going on.This one's still definitely worth a play through, 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

Overpowered/overused noob tubes, sniper rifles, killsteak awards, shotguns (also having shotguns as a secondary weapon), and perks. It was also a major campfest. Black Ops tweaked it nicely. I have a nice 1.8 kdr which the highest I've ever had in a COD. Noob tubes, sniper rifles, and shotguns are nerfed. Shotguns are only used as primary weapons instead of a secondary. Killstreak awards are not overpowered/overused with maybe the exception of the chopper gunner. Perks are balanced now but a few seem worthless. There are some camping but it's not as bad. Me and friends love it as most of the BS is gone. Takes more skill now rather than depending on overpowered stuff in my opinion. New recent patch has a little more stable server and lag.

{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"ReToM7 \"Patrick\"","summary":"NFS Series needs a swift boot in the behind","reviewText":"I'll start off with a little background. I have been playing NFS games since NFS 3: Hot Pursuit. From there I played Porsche Unleased, Carbon, Most Wanted, Pro Street, and NFS: HP2. I love the series... at least I thought I did... but I can't tell you the last one I enjoyed after Porsche Unleased. This game was bringing back all the right memories when I saw HP in the title.I will say that the fact that there's a single use online code with the game should be known to those of you who plan to resell the game. Resale value will be devalued by at LEAST $10 because of that. More because the game just isn't worth the new price. That has no bearing on this review because I completely understand the reasoning for it and while I don't support it, I can't knock it either.Back to the game, there are goods and bads;Goods--Graphics are beautiful-Car selection is great-Unlock system is a lot of fun (frequent new cars and levels based on XP online and single player)Bads--Driving physics are terrible. You HAVE to initiate a full on drift to get around turns or slow down to a snails pace. Meanwhile, AI can corner MUCH faster. You can't pull a pit maneuver on anyone because hitting another car just shoots sparks and that's about it. For high performance cars, they drive like dumptrucks. It brings the fun level down to a low level when you get a more difficult car to drive.-AI ranges ALL over the place. When you are doing the events that require you to chase down a single car, any time you get close, they pull a quick 180 and start flying the other way. I have gotten gold in a couple of these events, but it requires luck over skill. In races you will be going max speed, but because of handicap, the AI will catch up to you with slower cars at an extremely quick pace.-Camera angles suck. It's a low angle, which is fine, except that at high speeds, AI can blast throw your police blocks and you can't see well enough to recognize where the hole is, so more often then not, you'll blast into the block yourself. I FINALLY recognized this one and this is the reason I hit the wall so often or go out of control. When you touch the stick in the slightest amount to turn left or right, the camera turns a little bit, like it was helping you look around a turn. The trouble I have with it is that it makes my mind want to correct it and straighten the car back out by turning the opposite direction, so I essentially make myself go out of control when I was just trying to go straight. This typically leads me to large time penalties on the cop missions where you have to do a solo timed race.-Maps are annoying. Some shortcuts that are shown on the map are blocked in the real game courtesy of colorful semi-transparent arrows. This can cause you to sometimes attempt to go towards them just to see they're blocked and lose speed. Also, you can't go off the road because of walls and barriers everywhere. Some roads are just too narrow and traffic packed to get through unscathed.-Inability to turn off police lights, while they look awesome, can make it hard to drive on dark courses or in tunnels. I wish you could turn them off and turn them on to move traffic, which seems to continue driving instead of following traffic laws and getting out of the way of emergency vehicles.Overall, the game just has so many annoying things that could be corrected. This title feels more like a rushed release than the nicely polished and smooth game we were promised in all of the photos and videos. Still a fun title, but would recommend buying it at the 30-35 range (new) and 20 range (used - thanks to the necessary $10 code to play online). Car selection is good, but there are SO many things that could have been done to improve this game. Seems like another case of a high budget game that did not do proper testing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}
