Rivals Knights of the Old Republic as THE must-have xbox role-playing game. First off, it looks absolutely gorgeous, killer graphics, easily on par with anything I've seen from the Final Fantasy series. All of the dialogue is voiced rather than just subtitled. The voice-acting is great with each character (even NPC's) having a distinct accent and tone. The music is perfect, and did I mention the killer graphics?Second, the real-time combat is absolutely flawless. Two characters with mad melee skills that attack with killer combos Return of the King-style, and two ranged attackers that fight in first-person shooter style like Halo. You can switch between all four as waves of enemies pour in. This is too much fun for words. The skill strikes are especially ass-kicking attacks that must be seen to be believed (they often send blood and pieces of enemies flying everywhere). Easily the high point of this game.Third, the story (though not on par with it's FF brethren) is very cool and the characters are very likeable. There's Tal the swordsman whose commanding officer, his father, verbally beats him down mercilessly. He is also good for moving blocks and such. Then there's Ailish the sorceress (and a princess to boot) who loves a good adventure and uses her magic to break magical barriers hiding valuable items. Buki, the animalistic claw-bearing warrior who scoffs at Tal's immense weapon (\"Humans always hide behind their swords. I like to smell my enemies' sweat and fear\"). She can also scale walls. Lastly, there's Elco the scientist who has a rocket pack and fights with guns. You use various combinations of these four warrirs as you travel the land looking for asses to kick in search of powerful crystals (a la FF2) in other kingdoms for use in a defensive device Elco is working on. From there, who knows what could happen?The only weakpoint to this game is it's lack of depth.  The characters are established, but then aren't completely developed and the ending is horrendously unfulfilling.  I couldn't even spoil it for you if I wanted to because NOTHING HAPPENS.  After I'd beaten the game, I knew I'd done everything I could possibly do and felt no need to play it again as I did when I beat KOTR.  More customisation and a deeper storyline would have been great.  Also, the world is tiny compared to other RPG's.  You don't even really even need alternate transportation sources.  Still, my bigest complaint is simply that I want more, more, MORE!Overall, this is what xbox RPG fans have been waiting for. I was hoping for a game to tide me over until Fable drops, and I got an incredible game that combines many of the aspects of Halo, Return of the King, Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, and Chrono Trigger that made those games so awesome. Hopefully, it's lack of depth will be fixed in future sequels.  Buy it now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYZ2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"great for limited play areas","reviewText":"There are so many Kinect games that need space to fully enjoy them. I've been disappointed with many titles because you're required to move too much in space I don't have. The Nyko Zoom ended up being a flop, and didn't correct the problem for people like me who have limited space.So, I pre-orderedKinect Sports Season Twoand tried it out. First, I was impressed by the fact that you really don't have to flail your arms, move from side to side, and back and forth. The tennis is the best tennis on any motion controlled system, in my opinion. I especially liked that I could take a small step forward before I swung to fire a return shot or swing my arm from high to low to lob the ball. I thought this was very clever, and felt the Kinect was very accurate with this. I then played football for a couple of hours, and can't understand all the hate. The football is really fun. You squat to get ready, and stand up to have the ball snapped. There are 6 plays, and you throw the ball when one of the receivers turns green. A couple of times, I threw to an open receiver, but the Kinect sensor threw it to a different receiver who wasn't open, but this was rare. I then just had the coach to pick to expedite the play, and get back into the action. Once you throw the ball, you are the receiver and have to run in place. You can't juke, or run faster, but it didn't bother me, because I was getting a workout. The other best game in my opinion is skiing. You start out by squatting, and can move left or right by leaning with your upper body in the direction you want to go.  The skiing is the best skiing I have ever played including the Wii, which is also a great skiing experience. Golf was also a lot of fun, but mostly I played the minigame, in which you can get 1, 2, or 3 points by aiming your shot. I found the minigames on all the sports to be entertaining.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2011"}

I played as a medic since i like to bring people back alive. since i'm a search n destroy person from COD i played defuse which was kind of confusing. 6 rounds. but after 6 rounds it kind of loops to another map without you really knowing. like after the six round you don't get that popup saying your team won overall, it just goes back to the summary page for 10 seconds then loads the next map.

It has an Nvidia Geforce 9800M and wow it makes things come out like crazy. Sure this game can get repetitive if you let it, just like with any other game, so, take a break. The psychics in this game are amazing, nearly everything you shoot, breaks or blows up and even though it has rag doll effects when you kill the enemies it still is very satisfactory and looks awesome. As for the story i never really cared that it was like Half-life 2, other than Resident Evils i never care much about story lines anyways, or very little. Stopping, slowing down, and especially reversing time are just awesome, theres so much you can do with it. The funniest is reversing when some guy does a flip through the air and u have him do it about 3 times, then shoot his assets in mid air!!HA. But overall this game is just loads of fun, also another thing is the elements, rain, snow, lightning etc. it really gets you into the feel of the game, so by the PC version so you can get up close and personal. Also if you pan up the rain drops will actually hit your mask and run down it. Gee i dont see anything like that in Gears or Killzone, while it may not look like those it is a much more creative game.

{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The Blue Bomber's first adventure","reviewText":"When you talk about Capcom, the developer and publisher has a long and celebrated history. They got their start during the 1980's making video games for the NES. In 1987, they released several of them in hopes of showing that their games were fun to play. Little did they knew that a major franchise was born to humble beginnings; Mega Man almost didn't see the light of day outside of Japan. Capcom decided at the last minute to release it in the U.S. and it led to one of the worst box art designs in the history of video games. It didn't matter because the few players who got their hands on this game realized that there was something cool about it. Word of mouth quickly spread out through the gaming community and Mega Man had gathered a cult following. Oh yes....the Blue Bomber's first adventure left quite an impression on gamers everywhere.In Mega Man, you control Mega Man (AKA Rockman in Japan), a human-like robot created by Dr. Wright (later on, Capcom changed his name to Dr. Light.) He sought out the game's main villain, Dr. Wily, who re-programmed Dr. Wright's robots to work for him and wreck havoc in the city of Monsteropolis. As Mega Man, you chose from six stages filled with enemies, traps, pits and a Robot Master. Beat the Robot Master of each stage to acquire his special power. After you clear all six stages, you ran through four more stages filled with more boss characters, the chance to fight all six Robot Masters again and finally, you fought against Dr. Wily. You did not have access to passwords or battery backed saves but you were able to pick up extra lives and had unlimited continues.The PROS: Out of all the games Capcom released, this one stuck out. It was a one of a kind game involving robots, a futuristic setting, the ability to gain enemy robots' powers and interesting stage layouts that put your shooting, jumping and memorization skills to the test. For its time, the graphics were pretty sharp and bright. The sound effects and controls were spot on and easy to appreciate. The music was excellent since each Robot Master's stage got its own theme so it fit the mood perfectly. There was a lot of variety when it came to enemy robots and some were exclusive to certain stages. Mega Man quickly became known as a hard as nails game to play through so if you beat it, you were among an elite group of gamers that managed to pull it off.The CONS: Since it was really hard to beat back then, it also proved to be its biggest fault. At the time, most games were pretty easy to clear compared to Mega Man. The game had been too much for some players which led to most people who attempted to beat it to give up completely. It was a bit demanding to beat the game in one setting even though you had unlimited continues and enemies would randomly drop extra lives though not as often. It was also one of the few games where you didn't earn extra lives through points so it didn't help at all.Despite the steep learning curve and the fact that it demanded high gaming skills, Mega Man earned its place in video game history and gave birth to one of Capcom's most recognized video game characters. They would go on to release five more sequels on the NES, a new spin off series for the SNES and PS1 and multiple portable iterations. If you missed your chance to play this diamond in the rough title, you can search for a used copy or pick up the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2 or Gamecube consoles. Also, if you own a Wii, you can download this game from their Virtual Console Service for US $5.00 (500 points.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2011"}

Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"Sometimes frustrating, but still remarkable","reviewText":"Before writing a review for a game, I usually either finish it (for the good ones) or deem it unplayable (for the bad ones).  These people who write reviews before ever having played the game sort of boggle my mind a little.Anyway, I was all set to buy this game for my Xbox as I knew it was going to be a resource hog, one that my aging PC was unlikely unable to push.  To make a long story short, I ended up getting the PC version for three reasons; 1. It came out weeks before the Xbox version (weeks mean years for those of the short attention span), 2. it has a massive campaign editor and construction set, 3. because of 2., there are going to be lots of official and unofficial add-ons and plug ins, one of which I've already downloaded.Always give bad news first: This game is the resource hog I feared it would be.  If your running anything less than the best, prepared to either upgrade or lag.  My PC has a 1 ghz processor, 512 megs of RAM, Soundblaster Live Platium, and an old 32 meg Geforce2.  I was able to play the game reasonably well at 1024 x 768, but it was nothing to write home about.  The performance was poor at best, especially in the out of doors.  The graphics look pretty lame at this \"low\" resolution and those sophisticated textures look like poo-poo at anything less than 1600 x 1200.  Fortunately, I found a 64 meg Radeon 7500 video card a couple of days ago REALLY cheap, and decided to go with it.  This has helped immensely.  I can now go as high as my monitor will allow (1600 x 1200) and the graphics look much better. I still experience some lag outside, but the performance is MUCH better.  If you don't have a beast, can't afford to upgrade and own an XBOX, I advise you to get the Xbox version and save yourself a lot of headaches.More complaints: Morrowind has some very irritating little glitches that cause you to get stuck behind stuff, on the sides of hills, between objects, etc.  The movement is pretty clunky to begin with, which is further hindered by your characters attributes.  There have been several instances where I've had to revert to a previous save because of this whihc can be absolutely maddening.  Save often and be prepared for this one, it's one of my biggest complaints.Ok, a few more random complaints and then I'll get to the good stuff.  The interface as a whole will take some getting used too.  I still don't like the inventory menu with the teeny tiny little items that you couldn't possibly tell apart if not for the pop-up windows.  Also, be prepared to do a lot of wandering around aimlessly to find certain buildings and items.  When a NPC sends you on a quest, he updates your journal with text based instructions (if you think to ask for them) and doesn't update your map for you.  The map is so huge, that it can take awhile to get where you're going.  Also, I tried walking from one city to another with my first character: big mistake.  It took forever and I never did get there.  The scale on the game is huge, this is a good thing and a bad thing.  Get attacked, start running for your life, and the next thing you know you're lost.  There are signs posted here and there, but somtimes you can get way off track before you find a new one.  Also, no multiplayer, 'nuff said there.Ok, now for the good stuff: this game boasts what may be the largest, most detailed simulated world ever created.  Just wandering around gives you a sense of awe an immensity unlike any game I've ever played before, including Everquest.  The rich textures, huge mountains and detailed terrain must be experienced in the finest detail possible, or quite frankly, you aren't getting your money's worth.  While games like Baldur's Gate rely on strong story to create a compelling world worth returning too, Morrowind doesn't really have too.  From the moment you step off the boat, you're there.  Fortunately, Morrowind's beautiful world is supported by a strong story.  Like any RPG worth its salt there are hundreds possibly thousands of quests, mini-quests and hidden details that make the most mundane walk through the swamps worth your while.  The style and look of the game is just breathtaking, and honestly like nothing I've ever seen before.  It is equal parts weird and amazing.  Bottom line: it's an incredible world worth exploring which will be directly affected by your actions (unlike those Everqust type games).One of the things I liked immediately is the character creation process, which you can do one of several ways.  First, you pick a race, some of which are fantasy staples, like elves and orcs, but also includes a race of cat people and lizard men that look really cool.  Once you've chosen your race, you can choose class by either answering a few simple questions that will determine your class by gaging your (or your characters) personality and preferences; you can choose a class from the list (there are lots of classes); or you can create your own custom class.  These options really provide a lot of diversity.  I test drove a couple of characters from various methods before settling on the one I use now.It takes a while for the game to get going, but once you build up some momentum, it is incredibly fun.  Save often in the beginning as even the peons will be taking you out, or so it will seem.  Finding a character that fits your playing style is almost as fun and challenging as the game itself.  There is so much variety between races and characters it is unbelievable.  I'm so glad I bought the new video card and didn't give up on this game after the first couple of days.  If you've got a system that exceeds the recommended requirements and are patient, you will be rewarded.  With all its flaws (hopefully a patch will remedy most of them) this game is worth your while.  It is a true achievement.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2002"}

There are plenty of reviews out there explaining that this game is the greatest work of Western civilization ever, but as someone who isn't all that into getting randomly headshot online or worrying about my kill/death ratio, there are a few features of this game that render it less than perfect.-- Plot.  The plot in the one-player MW2 storyline borders on insane.  It simply makes no sense -- and yes, I played the original.  Random characters flit in and out of missions like strangers getting on and off a bus.  One mission seems to set up one soldier as the main character, only to have the next mission see him randomly executed.  It's like trying to follow a movie where not only is there no main character, but even the various supporting characters never even meet one another.  This is not a Tarantino-esque multiple storyline/flashback model, it rather feels like the programmers had a bunch of cool level designs cooked up, and then had to go back and figure out a way to slap them together into a story.  One mission you're a soldier in dusty Iraq, the next you're a completely different guy careening down a frozen mountain on a snowmobile.  Even though it is easy to get lost in the delicious chaos of a particular level, the connecting storyline is simply baffling.-- Gameplay.  The gameplay is to be lauded -- mostly.  Enemy AI is extremely good, the physical level designs are fun and non-linear, and there is a wide range of weapons and ammo to be found everywhere.  However, certain annoying affectations remain.  Foremost among these is an ingrained disdain for simply shooting at people with your gun's crosshairs.  MW2 derides this as \"firing from the hip\" even though your gun is clearly held at shoulder level, and it also happens to be how almost every other FPS in existence operates.  But MW2 practically demands that you specifically aim each gun rather than \"fire from the hip\" -- said aiming gives you a momentary lock on a target and hopefully allows you to put them down in a quick burst.  However, it quickly becomes extremely difficult to do this in actual combat when there are dozens of enemies running around and peppering you with shots.  Although you can duck or lie down, there is no \"cover\" button like that found in Rainbow Six Vegas 2, so the time it takes you to actually \"aim\" at a target means you are exposed and getting blasted by the inhumanely fast computer enemies.  Most weapons don't have scopes so aiming means trying to use crude rifle sights, which immeditely go off target from the recoil when your automatic weapon fires anyway.  And when you get hit, your entire screen fills up with blood splatter like someone hit you in the face with a can of tomato soup.  Which -- wait for it -- makes it almost impossible to see through your sights to aim at anyone!  This results in painful and exhausting battles where you have to pop out of cover, quickly aim at someone, try to get a shot off before you get tomato-souped in the face, duck back behind cover, wait to heal, and repeat.  There are checkpoints in missions, but after a while getting whacked over and over and over in the same blind alley filled with 100 guys gets a little old.  Much of this agony would be alleviated if you could just hit guys with your regular crosshairs from more than 10 feet away.  But no.  For a game that purports to love surgical precision, it's telling that a more effective approach often involves shotguns, grenades, and blind screaming kamikazee charges.-- Fun.  Unfortunately, most of the visceral fun of the game is to be found online or in co-op, neither of which particularly lend themselves to plot or character development.  Co-op is a nice addition although it is really a penned online equivalent where nameless co-op buddies engage in various set-piece battles.  What would have been fantastic would have been a co-op main storyline, which has been done well elsewhere (Army of Two, for example).  Simply fending off armies of computer drones gets stale after a while.  The co-op experience is ultimately a shallow one, where you repeatedly play missions just to better your time or accomplish other arbitrary tasks.  Worse, the missions themselves are adequate but overshadowed by the more impressive ones in the one-player storyline.At the end of the day, MW2 couples an impressive but truly bizarre one-player storyline with the more fun but significantly shallower co-op and online options in a way that is extremely fun in the short term but ultimately unsatisfying in the long run.  I'm as big a fan of mindless violence as the next guy, but its overabundance here is actually what keeps this from being the ultimate game.  This is a great rest stop along the way, but the search for the perfect game will soon move on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"","summary":"Boring!","reviewText":"Whatever happened to the Shinobi plotlines in the old Genesis games such as Shadow Dancer, Legend of Shinobi and Shinobi III?

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"The fun of BF, with quite the improvement...","reviewText":"--------Bad Company 2--------Overview: a FPS that continues the story of the four-man squad of Bad Company. Engage in battles on foot or by a variety of vehicles in the single player campaign. Then take the game online to try out some of the large maps and different multiplayer-modes. Continuing the \"fully destructible\" environments found in BF:BC, this sequel improves quite a bit from the first.--------Single player--------Good: Has an interesting story and many different environments for you to play around in. While there are some linear areas, some offer some leeway for flanking and improvisation. The first BC had terrible AI, where they were always aware of your position. You could not sneak up on an enemy unless it was scripted as such. In BF:BC2, if you move slowly along and are not spotted, you can move along and knife several enemies without raising suspicion. The fully destructible environment is a lot of fun to play around with, especially when there are several enemies bunkered down in a building, and to send it crashing down around them.Bad: There is some pop-in with enemies. Depending upon where in the map you are, you could trigger enemies to appear elsewhere or right in front of you. Only noticed this one or twice at most, and when I deviated from the story-line path.--------Multiplayer--------Good: Tons of fun to play with a good squad and lots of large maps to explore. Enjoy sending buildings crumbling with explosives or tank rounds. The vehicles are easily piloted and can be taken out if properly done. The helos are difficult to pilot, but there's an associated learning curve with them, which actually turns out to be a good thing. The big rewards for online play come with squad bonuses: heals, revives, resupplies, assists, savior/avenges. It was also mentioned that this part of the game plays like a MMO. And in one regard I would agree. You gain XP, but only in the class that you're currently using. Likewise goes for vehicles. You only gain XP for when you use that type of vehicle. The reward for gaining XP in a class is unlockable traits, abilities and weapon mods. For example: red-dot scope, higher explosive damage, ability to carry more grenades, higher healing radius for medpacks, and in the vehicle category: faster load times and higher damage output for weapons. Each class has a primary weapon, a secondary (handgun or tracer-round), 1 grenade (or more if using the upgrade), a class-particular weapon (RPG, C4, grenade launcher, motion-mine, mortar strike), two class upgrades (scopes, abilities, etc.), and a vehicle upgrade.Ugly: Can only hear your squad. This can be good or bad depending upon how you look at it. Since there isn't proximity mics you don't hear teammates (just their characters pre-scripted swearing on screen), only your own squad. Spawn camping can occur on some maps if enough members get behind the forward lines. This can happen on Conquest or if defending on Rush. Also, it can be frustrating if you are playing Rush and your entire team decides to snipe from a hill and you're the only one trying to take out the MCOM stations (replaced the Gold crates from BC1), but that's the risk with any online game.Summary: Definitely an improvement over BC1, and a lot of fun to team-up. I'd definitely recommend trying this one out. In addition to the standard Conquest (capture the flags standard of Battlefield games), the Rush from BC1, there is also Squad Rush (squad Deathmatch-- basically pits squad vs. squad for the most kills).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}

Initially I thought that the game was going to be average based on how Eidos tried to rig the reviewing of the game and when I heard that it had a 1 button attack.  However, the game greatly exceeded my expectations.Positives- Combat is very deep.  In direct combat you can strike, counter, stun, jump over, throw baterang, batclaw (put enemies down or off of ledges), throw, and 2 types of take downs.  In addition, in true Batman style, you can also take down enemies silently and/or with you Bat-gadgets.  So much variation once you find out what you can actually do.  My suggestion is to look at the challenge rooms to see what all is possible.- Mark Hamill as the Joker.  No need to say more.- Lots of extras and easter eggs.- Graphics are great for the most part.  Not quite as good as MGS4 but up there.  Only complaint is the aliasing which is always a problem with multi-console games as they make it first on the 360 and don't really optimize it much for the PS3.- Challenge modes are fun and more are probably on the way through DLC.Middle of the Road- Story.  It starts of great and up until the very end is great but fails at the very end.  I am 99% sure I saw this in an episode of The Batman cartoon.Negatives- Bosses.  Nothing original or that really stands out.  Been there done that too many times already.- Too much hand holding by the game.

I'm not going to go as far to say it's better, but in my eyes it's just as good in terms of game play and graphics.  The one area where this beats Modern Warfare hands down is in drawing you in to the fact that this is a real war, where real people are dying on missions like this daily.

Since that time I have been trying to formulate my thoughts to write a review on this game, but even still weeks later I find myself unable to put into words how I fully feel about this game.I am confused as to how I liked \"Fable\" so much and this game is really just more of the same yet it literally bores me to tears. I literally had to force myself to finish the game the first time through.The story in this game is seems more a side quest than anything esle and is very unimaginative and rather hollow (lacking substance). I really didn't care about it in the least. Not to mention that in general the world of Albion was not the least bit interesting or inspiring in this episode of Fable. In the first Fable even though you could warp between areas I usually walked, but not in this one. I even got so bored checking out the areas that many of the last parts of Albion to open up went completely unexplored. I just didn't care to see anything more as there was NOTHING interesting to explore or find.Another irritating aspect is how quickly certain things about your character change. For instance I didn't want a tub-o-lard character so in general I sold everything fattening as quick as possible. However given that certain item will just appear on the menu when you start loosing health I accidently ate a couple....and I mean less than 5....pies and sure enough my character is a lard-butt. That doesn't even make sense given that he runs all over the place. Then I had to run all over Albion trying to find celery to take of the wieght, which really wasn't fun in any regard. I'm all for character customization, but I think the way they went about here is dumb. For crying out loud I have to deal with calories, fat and cholesterol all day everyday in the real world, it isn't something I look forward to in video games.The ending was extremely weak and I actually couldn't believe it was really over. I thought no way. It is obvious they ended it that way because the want to do a whole \"Lost Chapters\" thing again. I don't mind them doing it, but they should do it the way they did in Fable and really end the game the first time around. Not to mention the big \"choice\" at the end was stupid and I didn't give a crap about any of the stupid options.After reading the reviews of others I am ecstatic though that I didn't experience any of the XBOX-killing glitches others had. My game froze a couple of times but all I had to do was cycle the power on my XBOX when it happened and all was good. Even the freezing happened rarely so it wasn't like it was extremely annoying or anything, just and inconvenience every now and then.Even though the world appeared larger here (and the map is hands down the least helpful and most annoying I have ever experienced in a video game) Albion just seemed to offer less in this game. It feels like all they did was try to remake Fable in a hurry so they left out a lot of things in turn making it worse than the original.I would definitely rent before you buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

Haven't they ever heard the old saying, \"Dance with the one that brought you???\"This game is horrible, and if you say otherwise you're in bad need of therapy because you're so desperate for a video game that you've convinced yourself this is worthy of your time.Or maybe your time is truly that worthless...in which case you should contemplate drastic measures.First off, the game is VERY linear.  \"Call of Duty 2\" truly felt like an open battlefield, whereas this one feels like a ride at Disneyland.  Sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful, but how about those character animations?  The mouths aren't synched to the dialogue, and they do that mindless hand-waving thing when they talk...just like all cinematics did back on the PS1 and N64.The AI is horrible.  In Call of Duty 2 you couldn't just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot German to pop up in the same place so you could plug him.  In this one you CAN---but you just don't care to.Also---\"IT'S GLITCHERIFFIC!\"  I shot a German and he flew straight up into the air, completely off the top of the screen!  I snuck up behind another German and hit him with a melee attack----the friggin' dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards.  Mind you, he was in the standing position the entire time.  Not unlike tossing an action figure across the yard.This game left a stale taste in my mouth, and really just pissed me off.  Call of Duty 2 was 360's only killer app.  If nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great game---all we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack!  They could've added 12 more hours of additional content to Call of Duty 2's campaign missions and I would've paid $60, cash on the barrelhead son.Way to go jacka@@es. ...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

So in the beginning of my review I'm going to talk about whether you want the regular or the deluxe.  And I'm here to tell you: maybe you don't have to buy the deluxe.I've checked it out and here is the deal.The Deluxe gives you:1) 24 GB more memory than a basic.  Of course, you can add a cheap USB drive and duplicate this.2) A cradle for charging, but, the battery on my video remote isn't lasting long so I usually have the video remote plugged directly into the wall (because you can't play when its in the cradle!). So the cradle is not worth any extra money.3) NintendoLand, which you can buy separately.  Nintendoland is a suite of mini games.  Nintendoland does a good job of introducing you to everything the Wii U can do.  If you love minigames, maybe you should buy the deluxe.  If you just want dedicated titles like \"ZombiU\" or \"Pikmin 3\" then you might choose the basic Wii.  After 2 weeks my daughter wants us to buy another game, because none of the mini games in Nintendo Land are very deep, and some are about as good as a $1 game you'd buy in an app store.  (race game, balloon game, yoshi game: I'm talking to you)4) The Deluxe also gives you 10% back on all digital purchases, for each $50 you spend.  So to get $5 back, you have to spend $50.  Most people I know prefer to buy hard copies of their game so they can resell or trade them.  But if you like to buy software online then you would want to get the deluxe.You would want to consider the basic Wii U if:1) You don't like minigames (aka Nintendoland)2) You only buy hard copies of games.Otherwise, consider the deluxe.In regards to the memory:  A 32GB memory stick will run you about $15-25, in fact, you wouldn't even know this one was there:SanDisk Cruzer Fit CZ33 32GB USB Flash Drive (SDCZ33-032G-B35).  And you get to keep that USB drive even if you get rid of your Wii U.You will see in the comments that someone claims the SanDisk won't work on the wii, but, I'm using one right now.  What can I say?  One test is worth 1,000 expert opinions...  Installing the SanDisk was easy.  In my case, I inserted it when the Wii U was off.  Then I turned the Wii U on and it said \"There is a new USB drive... do you want to format it and yes it?\" I hit the button that said \"yes\" and it was set up just like that!I'm a positive person in general, so I will be happy with my 32GB, but, if you are considering the 8GB, take heed.If you are on the fence about the wii U, here is my main review:I remember that Nintendo came under a lot of criticism for not having an HD version of the Wii. HD was around when the first Wii came out, and a lot of people were a bit skeptical that they stuck to the lower resolution. As HD became common, Nintendo told fans that they had to do something \"more\" than just come out with an HD version of the Wii.Well, thats just what Nintendo did. The Wii U is more than \"just Wii HD\". But Nintendo hasn't changed the Wii experience very much. You still use Wii remotes every time you play. The Wii U is not \"completely different\" like the Wii was when it came out. The Wii U is the Wii's younger, smarter brother. And if you liked the Wii, you'll like the Wii U.The 3 main features of the Wii U are:1) Its HD, which brings it (finally) up to speed with the Xbox and Playstation ... and everything else out there.2) The Wii U has a single video controller. The video controller opens up new game experiences. Whoever is playing on the video controller sees something different than the other players. For generations people have wanted multiplayer games that didn't use a \"split TV screen\", and the Wii U gives you that in one console. This is a really big deal. The video controller is also a touchscreen which you use to flick something at the screen, or move things on screen. The new video controller allows for new control options ... just like the \"Wii balance board\" allowed Nintendo to sell yoga and ski games.3) Videos, videos, videos. Netflix, youtube, TiVo, amazon instant video. It will keep track of the TV shows you want to watch, and when they will be on. You'll also be able to use the Wii U as a social outlet to chat about TV shows and movies. Nintendo calls this Wii TVii, and it would be a revolution in TV watching... if only all the features were available now. So you can use the Wii U as a control for all your Video experiences with your TV. The video controller will act like \"PIP Picture in Picture in the palm of your hand\". I use the Wii U with Amazon Video to watch movies for free, and the Wii remote lets me see information about the movie on IMDB WHILE the movie is playing. For sports, you'll be able to watch instant replays on the small screen... while the rest of your buddies continue to watch the big game on the main screen. So its going to be a remote controller on steroids. To be honest, this is going to be a really big big deal but since not all the features roll until \"later\" I can't give the WIi U a star for it yet. Maybe it will change your life, maybe not. Time will tell.And that concludes the main appeal of the Wii U. We finally get HD, the video controller adds a new dimension to the usual Wii gaming, and it also serves as a \"TV command center\".FAQ:::Some people have asked me about the Wii U, and the short answers are:1) No, you don't have to own a Wii to have a Wii U.2) You can only use ONE video controller with your Wii U. All other players use the old Wii remote.3) 5 people can play at once, making it even more of a \"game party\" console than before.4) You can't play DVDs or Blu Ray discs. Blue Ray is Sony Playstation territory, as you probably know.5) You can surf the internet on it (why would you want to? I don't know)6) Should I get the deluxe? Probably. You get 32gb of memory, which will become more important the longer you have the console, and the more you do with it. You get the Nintendo Land game. You get the cradle for charging the video gamepad. And until 2014 they will give you a store credit of 10% every time you make a purchase of digital content (games). If you buy digital content regularly, you might \"earn back\" the extra $50 you pay for the deluxe Wii U. (I tried this yesterday, read below for more info on the credit)The Wii U has a host of \"lesser\" features:1) A person can play the Wii U without having the TV on. Expect a smack on your head if you want to play ZombiU while your wife watches a movie.2) Its backwards compatible with all older Wii games (but maybe not dance pads!), which is nice if you bought Zelda Skyward Sword this summer.3) Just as with the old Wii, you can download games from the Nintendo store. If you buy online content for your iPhone, Xbox, or PS3, you know that this is a big deal. I used to buy songs for guitar hero to add to the songs that came in the box. If you buy this DELUXE version, you get a 10% credit back for all online purchases, see more about this credit in \"The Bad\" below.4) The Wii U video controller is like a universal remote. You can turn on your TV and change the volume from the gamepad which is a convenience.5) Most of the old Wii hardware is compatible too, which is nice, EXCEPT that round \"gamecube style\" connector is not present on the Wii U. Games that use a mat like \"outdoor challenge\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution\" become history in your house.6) There is a big, easy to find \"download again\" button for all digital content, so if your Wii U got fried by a power surge you wouldn't lose your purchases. That's always nice.The bad:1) The menus aren't intuitive. There are two menus... the Wii U menu and the Home menu. The Home menu is found by pressing the Home button. Note that now that downloads are automatic, the unintuitive menus aren't so bad. But they still seem redundant.2) Transferring data from the Wii to the Wii U should be easier. In particular I didn't like that when I imported my Miis, I had to do a separate step on the Wii U before I could actually use them in the games. The day I got it the patch took way too long to download and install, and after I transferred my data from my Wii I felt like I had spent 2 hours on the whole thing. But, since then, there has been no problem.3) Freezing. I did have a problem with NintendoLand locking up, but, that went away after one day. This will be something they fix and becomes a thing of the past. I wouldn't sweat it.4) Long updates. I feel that the time that it takes to download stuff and install it has improved over time.5) Installing downloaded content. I wrote a long rant about how annoying this was, but as of the most recent update you can buy items in the store and they download and install automatically, as they should.Ok now that I'm done complaining...Your decision matrix:1) If you still like playing on your Wii, and you have the money to spend, buy a Wii U and sell your Wii. You'll enjoy it.2) If you are considering between an Xbox+Kinect and a Wii U, I think its a tough call. I really like the \"second screen\" gaming, it really opens up a lot of possibilities. But most of the wii U stuff looks really juvenile. The kid down the street told me he still wanted an Xbox because the Xbox has games for teenagers. I said \"whatev.\"3) As a side note, every kid who has seen and played our Wii U in the last two weeks has put this as the top item on the Christmas list. Its the \"next big thing\" for them and you can be sure that the little things that I complain about in this review won't matter to them. Not at all.Games: Nintendo now has decent amount of digital content to buy online. I paid .35 for \"kirby's great adventure\" or something like that. Its a grainy looking old game, but it was only thirty five cents. Nintendo has started offering games at the $2, $5, and $8 price points as well. I'm VERY pleased to see this, because I want to be able to log into the shop and grab a game for cheap when I want to.I rate this item 3 stars out of 5 because three stars means \"it's ok\". Nintendo has made a lot of improvements in 6 months, and while they have fixed most of the problems with the system, I find myself reluctant to raise the review to 4 stars until some more exclusive games are released. Pikmin 3 has been delayed until August, for example.The Wii U is getting better. I think it may turn into my favorite console of all time, if they can just get some good exclusive games out, and improve the use of the video controller in those games. I really don't want another game where the video controller shows a map. Gimmie a break.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics aren't as mouth watering as they were on the Gamecube, but RE4 still looks amazing in this PS2 conversion.  You play as Leon Kennedy, six years after the Raccoon City disaster of Resident Evil 2, and you're on a mission to rescue the President's daughter.  You're led to a creepy town where the locals, well, let's just say they're not too happy to see you.  I don't want to say much more about the story so not to ruin it for those who haven't played this, but make no mistake that it's the best storyline you'll ever see in a Resident Evil game.  The enemies are challenging and the boss battles are nothing short of epic, making RE4 the most action packed edition of the series yet.  The controls aren't as responsive as they should be, in fact, they can be downright clunky when they want to be, but for the most part they don't deter how amazing this game really is.  Capcom threw in some extras here as well, including side missions where you can play as the mysterious Ada Wong and alternate costumes and such.  Make no mistake, Resident Evil 4 is the best RE game ever made, and just like it was on the Gamecube, this PS2 conversion is an absolute must own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"BooBoo","summary":"All aboard the non-game train!","reviewText":"I play a lot of RPGs. This is in general, JRPG, WRPG, all types all walks, have for about 20 years.I have to say that this one may border on one of the worst I've ever played. Now I have to commend the presentation, the aesthetics, the art, the music, the visuals on the whole. It's also a very smooth, kinetic title. It's pretty spiffy to play through.The problem is just how vapid it is. We're talking just... ridiculous levels of non-game. This is from the team that put out FFX-2, while, outside of being VERY goofy and girlpower happy had some fantastic gameplay systems associated with it. FFXIII does not. The entire progression for all of the title sans Chapter 11 is walking down a hallway from A to B. This may not sound like the pits, but once you tie that in with no deviations, it really grates.There are no towns, no real subquests or elements, several key character points are actually ABANDONED because there is no way to present or address them due to the limitations of the design. Now that's bad, but you can still make up for that as an on-rails experience, well, it doesn't. The combat engine can, from start to finish, barring the last couple dozen \"hunts\" be breezed through by mashing X and rarely doing a class swap in order to defend or heal up.Everything is automated, all ability selection, (bad) AI  team mates, if they took away that random class juggle the game wouldn't be a game.Usually RPGs make up for lack of action or input with micromanagement or planning or strategy there is none of that. The character development here is done through a Crystalarium (sp) board which is completely linear and weapon upgrading which is also completely linear. There is no thought, no deviation, you grind and you grind more and you mash X.Bad enough yet? Well you get no choice over your party, character classes or anything else for the first 25 hours of the game.Just unreal.That's the gameplay, now the story is a whole 'nother trainwreck. Basically just prepare to hear:1.) Fal'cie2.) L'cie3.) FocusRepeated ad nauseum for the 35-40 hours the main quest takes because between hours 2 and 39 there is no narrative progression. It's a lot of jargon, a lot of dwelling on the same points, a lot of awkward grunts and sighs and a dash of D-tier anime \"charm\".One single character has dialogue that isn't so completely banal that it'd make a high school AV club moan. And that's Sazh, Sazh is a character still rooted in the 50's as far as black characters go, but he is still a big improvement on say, the likes of Barret from Final Fantasy VII. Kudos Japan!The game actually tries to present itself like a big character drama, and also a big story sweeping two vast worlds but fails rather spectacularly in both, with a vastly underdeveloped cast and world designs that have no lore, history or general consequence to them and act more as a general potluck of random themes and designs, sort of akin to a themed Mario world.The worst part of all of this, is that any little bit of story or context or sense you wish to gleen from the game has to be read, through a haphazardly written datalog in the menus. If you expect the game to actually tell its story through actual sequencing and design, then guess again.It's not the WORST game ever made, it's easy to cut through, as it puts absolutely no strain or resistance on the player and it looks gorgeous while being cut through. I can think of bigger crimes than merely being a design train wreck, there are titles that are technical AND design train wrecks!Still, worst in series, avoid. My suggestion would be to scope out Resonance of Fate, which is a challenging, mechanically innovative title with some good charm. Probably the best JRPG this generation after Demons Souls.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"MikeB \"Metalhead\"","summary":"Don't miss it","reviewText":"I held off buying this game because of the criticisms I heard on review sites.  I finally bought this game on a lightning deal on Amazon for a great price, and I have to say after playing this game I'd easily pay $59.99 for it.  In the past I've played Final Fantasy games, and although I enjoyed most of them, there were some annoying parts.  I feel that FF13 removes those annoying moments and streamlines the experience to make what is in my opinion the best in the series.  Although the story lulls a bit early on, it is quite good, and because of the fast pace of the game, it kept me engaged.My first complaint about other FF games was getting lost/stuck.  Sometimes you'd find yourself trying to find someone or something to continue on and having no clue where to find that person or thing.  FF13 has a clear map showing you where to go and how to get there.  Some people complained that FF13 was too linear.  Throughout the whole game I never once got lost or stuck.  To me, that is a plus.Previous FF games were stingy on the save points.  FF13 has an abundance of them.  This means less backtracking if you found you had to suddenly turn off the game.  Another plus.Other FF games had random enemy encounters that would initiate every five steps and eventually became annoying.  FF13 lets you see your enemies as you approach them and gives you to option to avoid them, attack them, or even try to sneak up on them!  No more annoying random battles.  Plus plus!Most FF games had slow battle systems that could take anywhere from 2 to 30 minutes per battle.  The slow nature of battles made them feel tedious and chore-like, especially given the frequency of random battles.  FF13 is fast and most battles will take less than a minute.  The game rates you based on how fast you defeat enemies.  This encourages you to try to end the battles quickly.  Battles are quick and exciting and throughout the entire game I never dreaded a battle.  Instead I looked forward to them.  A big improvement.Previous FF games forced you to stock up on tents and potions and waste your precious money on items you'd need for the grueling battles ahead.  FF13 is a fairly forgiving game.  If you should lose in battle, you just restart moments before you entered the battle, giving you the option run forward and fight again or head back and try a different strategy.  No more restarting from your last save point (which, given the infrequency of save points in previous FF games could mean going back an hour or more).  Also, if you should win a battle, all HP lost is immediately restored and all status ailments healed.  This keeps the focus on the battle at hand and not on spending all of your Gil on potions.  This feature went a long way to making the game fun instead of tedious.Other FF games required you to level grind just to complete the game.  This is not necessary (however it is still possible for those of you who just have to max out your character) in FF13.  You level up using a Crystarium that you fill with Crystal Points that your earn from battle.  As long as you keep leveling up the Paradigms that your characters start with and don't avoid too many battles, you'll never be too under powered to continue with the game.  This eliminates another reason players would get stuck in previous FF games.As for the presentation, which is the main reason why I play a FF game, FF13 is the best so far.  I won't argue that the story is the best, but it isn't as bad as some have claimed.  The cinematics and cut-scenes are gorgeous and truly a sight to behold.  The graphics and animations are top-tier stuff, and the lip sync was even re-animated for the English dub.  Speaking of, the dub is great.  The voice work is what you would expect from modern day video games and anime.  Is it Academy Award level?  No, but for a Japanese game it works well.  The entire game, from start to finish, is fully voiced, so no need to read subtitles (unless you like that).  The music is also very good, with some memorable tunes that will get stuck in your head.  The game is full of cut-scenes, so if you don't like cut-scenes, WHY THE HELL ARE YOU PLAYING A FINAL FANTASY GAME?Overall this is an incredible package.  The game is long (60-80 hours), gorgeous, and most of all fun.  It is slightly easier than previous FF games, which I think is a plus.  The price has come down considerably, so if you haven't picked this one up yet, now is the time.If you have a choice between the PS3 or Xbox 360 version, pick up the PS3 version.  The FMV runs in full 1080p and looks better than the low-rez video compression on the Xbox.  Besides that, the games are identical.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2011"}

Taking place in an industrial, steampunk-esque world where emperors, magicians, old gods, whaling, and a rat plague live side by side, Dishonored's gameplay is as unique as its setting. Combining elements of stealth, action, exploration, espionage, political intrigue, and a unique mechanic that always makes you think before you act, the brew that is Dishonored is a rousing success and should be played by every gamer who loves games that give the player original and riveting experiences.As the most loyal bodyguard to the Empress of the Kingdom of Dunwall, the protagonist Corvo is framed for the Empress's assassination and must go into hiding while trying to clear his name and get revenge upon the real assassins. In doing so, with the help of some allies, Corvo navigates through the world of Dunwall, a land in ruin. Set to a backdrop of a deadly rat plague that has decimated the kingdom, Dunwall is one of the most fascinating video game worlds ever seen. Fantastic art design combined with a strange mix of Industrial Age, steampunk, and fantasy imaging create a world that is unlike anything else. Designed by Viktor Antonov, who also designed the iconic City 17 from Half Life 2, Dunwall is a triumph that will keep the gamer endlessly intrigued and never expecting what is around the next corner. I was so intrigued by Dunwall, that I spent hours reading lore, exploring, and simply just observing. It is an amazing place that you won't forget.Thankfully, Dishonored's gameplay more than matches the incredible setting. Dishonored, like Deus Ex: Human Revolution before it, let's you play the game how you want to play it, and makes the game rewarding no matter what. The stealth/non-lethal route is incredibly satisfying, given the unique powers Corvo gets such as teleporting across short distances instantaneously and the ability to possess animals like rats and fish. The quiet assassin route is also incredibly done, as Corvo is one of the most capable assassins ever seen in a game. And if you want to violently push your way through the game, that option is perfectly viable as well, as Corvo has an arsenal of deadly weapons to choose from, as well as a full slew of vicious magical powers.Mission structure is just as flexible as the options in play style. Every mission can be completed in a number of ways. There are multiple routes to your objective, multiple ways to handle every situation you come across, and multiple outcomes to every mission. And one of the most innovative mechanics I've ever seen in a game, the Chaos level, permeates through the entire game. The Chaos level is basically a measurement of the state of the world that you can direclty affect. High chaos is exactly that...there will be more rats, more soldiers, and more despair. Low chaos is the exact opposite, and everything you do in the game determines the Chaos level of Dunwall. Deciding to help people in need via the game's various side quests, murdering people and leaving the bodies out for the rats, frightening civilians, or restoring order where there is none...all these things will affect the Chaos level, which not only affects the ending of the game, but also elements of your playthrough of the game. It is a mechanic that makes you think before you act, and it's brilliant.Dishonored is a fantastic game. It's different, intriguing, and extremely satisfying to play. This is a gamer's game...one of those rare special video games that illustrates how far this medium has come and how wonderful it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0023CC0M4","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A great action game for all ages.","reviewText":"This one surprised me. When I first got my ps3 10 months ago, I went nuts and downloaded tons of demos. One of them was Mini Ninjas, and I figured it'd be a dumb ninja game that wouldn't keep my interest for more than a few minutes. Boy was I wrong- I loved the demo and bought the game soon after [though Fallout 3 took up a lot of time and I didn't play through it until just recently]. Mini Ninjas is the kind of game that consoles need more of. Too many games these days rely on run 'n gun gameplay and try to wow players with kills that get more graphic each year. I'm not exactly against that (again, I just brought up Fallout 3), but I get bored with things like that. Mini Ninjas is the definition of 'fun for all ages', and it's surprising that there are so few games like this for the ps3 and 360. Well, quality ones anyway.The game puts you in the role of Hiro, a young ninja whose village has been invaded by evil samurai. The samurai are actually created when magic is cast on the forest animals, similar to the cute animals in the Sonic games being turned into robots. It's up to Hiro and 5 of his friends to defeat the samurai and free the animals. You'll have a lot of ways to take out enemies- from basic sword slashes to magic spells that let you summon tornadoes or rays of light that obliterate the undead, to special moves that can have you target several enemies at once for quick dispatching or spin your spear into a flurry of pain. Each ninja has their own unique weapon, ranging from a ninja sword, big Gallagher-esque hammer, flute, bow and arrow, tiger claws and naginata/spear. And honestly, while their gameplay isn't that much different from one another, I did enjoy playing as all the different ninja. Hiro is the only one who can use magic and take over animals and weaker samurai though. This is a pretty fun part of the game early on- taking on the form of a panda or boar to whoop enemies was entertaining. Smaller animals didn't really do much, such as the raccoon who just does a little dance for his attack, and it doesn't do any damage. 'still cute. The developers also put in some nice touches here and there, like using your hat as a boat to travel faster in water, and holding the shoulder button to tiptoe and sneak around. It's so much better to do this for stealth rather than hiding behind objects like in so many other games.There are many things to collect in each level- Jizo statues, different kinds of flowers, coins, animals, etc. And in another great design choice, they have an option when you reach the end of the level to keep playing or go on to the next. If you want to get 100%, which is required for the platinum trophy, it'd be smart to keep playing a level when you have almost everything rather than starting over again later on when you're less familiar with it. I can honestly say that I enjoyed trying to find everything, and am still trying to get 100% for that stupid trophy! To wrap up the good things with Mini Ninjas, the game never gets too dull with the action. You're not stuck fighting wave after wave of samurai, but get nice breaks in-between and have time to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Yes, while the graphics here are very simple, and could've probably been done on the Dreamcast and look the same, the art direction is fantastic. One level that immediately comes to mind is one where lamps are sent down a river at night as a distress signal from another village, with the lighting in the stage being perfect. And the game's not very violent for any concerned parents. Aside from some painful looking stabs during boss fight cutscenes, there's no blood or dismembering going on.So what's keeping it from getting 5 stars? Most people who've played the game will agree with me when I simply say 'the downhill snow level', which, rather than has you using the analog sticks to control your character, has you use the ps3 controller's motion control. Why they did this, is beyond me, and it ruins the flow of the game as much as the asteroid shooting part of Dead Space. I also wish that checkpoints in the stage were automatic, and you didn't have to find the corresponding shrine to activate them. There were several times that I lost a good 15 minutes of gameplay because I couldn't find a shrine, and had to start over from the previous one. Also, there are a lot of different secondary weapons you can get and create, like a smoke bomb and others. I actually never used these until near the end of the game when I did it out of boredom. Your standard weapons are more than enough, though the throwing stars are probably the only other thing you'll use. But even then...Finally there should've been a co-op mode. This game BEGS for two player action, and I would've loved to have played it with my daughter instead of taking turns, or play with other people online. Mini Ninjas was received well by critics, so hopefully if there's a sequel, they'll throw a co-op mode in there.Even with those small cons, I can't recommend a better game if you're looking for some good, fun action. I don't even like ninjas, but this game won me over!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

They just bored the heck out of me.  So going into Rage I was already expecting a letdown, but to my surprise the game is actually pretty fun.  The references are accurate though, because the game starts out identically to Fallout 3 in that you awaken from some bunker to a post-apocalyptic state, then you start visiting towns and locales that look very similar to Borderlands.  Unfortunately, fairly or not, I feel that it is because of these similarities that have caused all the negative reviews about the game.  If you can get past the similarities, the FPS aspect of the game is excellent.  The enemy AI is very good in this game and quite challenging to shoot at as they are lunging and dodging at you.  The weapons are the usual set of pistols, shotguns, sniper, bow and arrow sort.  The graphics are very good as you would expect from a game requiring 3 discs.  The story or lack thereof consists mainly of fetch quests to gather or deliver items--you are basically a gofer throughout the whole game.Now, the last thing I will mention about this game is that a large portion of it is vehicular combat.  I wasn't quite expecting this from a FPS, but they did make driving/racing/shooting very fun.  The driving mechanics are highly exaggerated, but very fun nonetheless.  This could be the deal breaker for some, but if you can get get past this, you may actually enjoy the driving and the actual game itself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}

The only significant advantage that I can report on is that the load times are considerably snappier on the more powerful platform.  That said, Rayman Legends is still eye-candy and the animation is simply stunning regardless of which console you get it on.If you were on the fence before and haven't picked it up yet, picking it up at its release price of just under 40 dollars is well worth it and you should read my original review below.[Original Review From PS3 Version]My daughter and I are quite familiar with platformers in general. In fact, we have been a daddy-daughter team ever since she first played with me on Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. We have also played Super Mario Bros. Wii and others as well.When I first picked up Rayman Origins (which precedes this title), I knew very little about Rayman in general. I picked up Rayman Origins for $19.99 as a Xmas present. Little did I know what a hit it would be with BOTH of us.Rayman Legends follows in the same vein as our main, limbless protagonist, Rayman, is once again awakened to rescue the lumas and teensies from the denizens of a multitude of evil characters. Rayman will need to jump, sprint, &#34;float&#34; (his ears will whip around like a helicopter), and punch his way to victory. What makes the game even more fun is the ability to have up to 4 people play co-op at the same time, albeit only on the same console. It's still sad that online support is inexplicably absent and it would have certainly encouraged other family members in other cities to purchase it and join in on the fun. However, it's still an absolute blast.If you loved Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends will stagger you. The sheer volume of unlockable content that is available will ensure the longevity of this title, especially for completionists like me. However, like Origins, if you're into it just to beat the &#34;main storyline&#34;, so to speak, the game does cater to that level of satisfaction for those of use who don't have the cat-like alacrity to nail every jump perfectly. It's a game that can be enjoyed from both beginners to experts alike, and comical for all.Special mention should be made to the art direction and music. Rayman Origins had beautiful visuals and Legends (despite being released almost on the heels of Origins) does not fail to disappoint either; I'd almost say that it exceeds Origins if it were possible. I love how level design has moved away from an almost Mario-like stage progression map to a gallery of artwork that your character(s) hop into to get to the levels that you'll play. The music fits the level designs perfectly and the cartoon-like artwork in each level is extremely fluid with no discernible framerate hiccups. It's flawless as a platformer could possibly get and I can't spot a single element in this game that didn't appear to have a great deal of love and attention. The same goes for the level design - everything that can be unlocked in the game is achievable without a single item feeling like a &#34;cheat&#34;. Truthfully, some areas require a significant amount of skill, but it's skill nonetheless--not poor level design--that will be your only hindrance for getting EVERYTHING.Rayman Legends is one of the few platformers out there that are worthy of the full MSRP release value. While the online component is still sadly missing, there is still plenty of side-splitting, couch-sharing fun to be had here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2014"}

That's GOTTA hurt!!!","reviewText":"Burnout has been one of the most suprising video game series ever since the release of the original Burnout nearly 3 years ago.  The combination of high-speed racing and the ability to create some serious havoc when you crash has made both Burnout and Burnout 2: Point of Impact suprise hits.  Now that the duties of the Burnout series have been passed down from the now-defunct Acclaim Games to the hands of EA (Electronic Arts)Games, the question of what would happen with future volumes in the series is answered with Burnout 3: Takedown.Takedown takes a few old things that have been Burnout standards and adds a few lovely new twists.One such is the Boost Meter, which fills whenever you make smart and slick driving moves during the race like nearly missing other cars, drifting (taking a curve or turn without gas/braking and leting your momentum carry you through it), driving in oncoming traffic, catching air off huge hills, and causing other racers to crash, which is now referred to as a Takedown.  Now the meter is available to use all race long as long as you make sure that you fill it, whereas in the previous games you had to fill it completely to use it.Another new twist is called Aftertouch, which is like Bullet Time for a crash.  The instant you crash, you can go into a slow-mo crash mode and use the analog stick to direct your wreck to hit any other racer's car, causing a Takedown.  The only downside is that if you take a racer down, that racer is going to go gunning for you to take YOU down.Several new modes are added to the experience as well, including Road Rage (use your car to commit as many Takedowns as possible within a time limit), Eliminator races (Racers in last place is eliminated, natch), A fun new Crash Mode (try to create huge pile-ups and score serious cash), Special Event Races, Face-Off races to win new cars, Grand Prix races and more.And some of the crashes you cause (or get caught in) are lovely to see (I had one where I literally made a car crash into the top of a very tall streetlight)and the graphics show that EA definitely took the ball and ran for a touchdown (or should I say Takedown) with it. If you want to have a little fun or release a little road rage while waiting for Gran Turismo 4, then get ready for a little Takedown!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2004"}

I hate it, don't want it, and will refuse to buy any game that has this level of invasive, consumer hurting malware.I should mention that I don't own this game, I played it at a friends house. I will not buy a copy because: 1. The game play is pretty boring, 2. the concept has been dumbed-down to the level where this is a game for 12 year olds, and 3. the draconian DRM.Now, on to the review. I'm always loved Maxis games, and own all of the sim city games, going back to the original for Nintendo. I also own the Sims, the Sims II, and enjoyed them quite a bit. So I was really looking forward to this game, and have tracked its progress for nearly two years.I was excited about the concept, and watching as my genetic children grew to take over the universe...Sadly, most of what was most exciting about that original concept has been stripped from the game. Now, as other have mentioned, adding more legs doesn't increase speed more than a better +5 foot. Many of the genetic options are self-excluding, because why would you pick an inferior body part even if it looked cool, knowing it would make your creatures ultimately inferior?The game play is tiresome and monotonous. I got bored at the begining, and then the space stage is nearly unplayable. It is so boring, I find myself wishing it were more like Stelcon3D, a game that is almost 20 years old! Seriously, if they wanted to add RTS elements to the game, they should have made it more challenging and less user intensive to manage every little thing...This game is a big piece of fail on so many levels. Hate it because of the DRM, or hate it because it is dumbed-down, or hate it because it isn't very fun to play.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2008"}

Well, each stage until you start reaching civilization is so brief, so boring and uncreative in gameplay that they've been designed to get through in an hour to save you aggrivation. I'm not exactly sure what they were thinking when they decided to include the first three stages in the game, maybe a marketing strategy? Maybe to hold up the games promise? Unsure. But they don't work and I think they should have been left out.The creature creator promised to create creatures of your own design, but are so dumbed down and restrictive that you'll quickly be bored. It doesn't really matter what parts you put where, each part has a value that raises a stat and including them is all that matters. I'm also more than a little disappointed by the parts available for your creature. You have to run around and collect them in the game to make them available, but there's no real challenge in getting them and most are just stamps of the same parts with the same stats with a little different look to it (and I mean little).Which creature you choose is simple: Cold blooded killer. Stop now if your not a meat eater, your doing it wrong, go start the game over - you can select your starting stage so it doesn't really matter anyways. You can be adventurous and say \"no I'm not going to be a meat eater\" but then your stupid cause all the other meat eaters just go feast on your little creations and an already boring game gets drawn out even further.I can't say what the worst stage of the game is, they're all equally bad IMO.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2008"}

I though this was a very fun game to play because if you really know what to expect from the game it won't disappoint you,  the game allows you to play any of the DOA girls from the game and so little games such as volleyball, watercraft races, water slides, playing poker or other gambling games, or just sunbathing on the beach.  What I also enjoyed is that you can either play the game with the original Japanese voice cast or the English voice cast a big plus in my opinion.  The graphics are great and the music they have for the area scenes are pretty good as well.  The one little quest that's a little problematic is that after a few days the original partner you get to play some of the games takes off and you have to try and befriend the other women with gifts that you can purchase from the stores and that the ladies like so that they'll partner up with you when you ask.  I know some miss the fighting like on DOA 4 but again the game info pretty much gives you the info on what the games really about so unless you just don't read the back of the case or don't bother to that's the buyers fault not the makers.  So with all that if your a DOA fan and are curious I say check it out you have fun and of course try out all the women after the vacation time is over(The vacation for the players is 14 days than the game concludes)....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2009"}

Your vocabulary is limited to single words or very short phrases like: no, yes, roger, roger that, hang in there, love you, i like you, cover me, fire, etc. In my opinion, answering simple questions with even simpler answers is not an RPG. As a matter of fact, it just gets in the way of the game itself. This is a third person shooter...period.If you are looking for a game that integrates RPG and shooter, then consider Mass Effect.About half of the time, you don't need to respond to conversation with teammates; if you say nothing, the game will move on.The voice recognition is a joke. Don't waste your time with it. If you try to use it, you'll be really frustrated. And even though you turn-off your mic and the voice recognition settings in the game, the game continues to flash &#34;no mic&#34; and &#34;no voice recognition&#34; on-screen throughout the game.The best part of Binary Domain is the seawall slide in chapter 1. It was fun and funny (funny to listen to Big Bo carry-on). That was the only memorable scene.The controls are okay. The underline character is the spacebar. I programmed my Logitech G700 mouse with the controls, except for switching between guns, which had to be done using the keyboard. Switching between guns should be done by mouse wheel, but you can't (each weapon must have its own key).Also, you can't configure keys within the game; it has to be done outside the game by running the binary domain configuration exe file (and that file must be run once before you start the game--but that wasn't evident...the game just failed to start and gave an error saying it must be config'ed first...so I went hunting for the exe).The boss fights are sometimes boring. When a robot gorilla tramples me, and my teammate revives me, but the gorilla is still on top of me and I die again (and this happens 4 times in a row), then the game comes boring to me. Some of the boss fights are like that...just not fun to play. For some boss fights, like the very last one, all you do is just keep shooting at your target...and keep shooting/running/shooting/running/etc/etc. That's boring. Eventually he will die...after you do it enough time...no skill, and not fun.I don't like to play a game with subtitles on. However, if you want to understand what the Japanese characters are saying, then you have to have subtitles on (and the game will show English subtitles when English is spoken too)...there is no way around that.Dan and Big Bo remind me of football players. Big and kind of dumb. Sometimes their conversation are funny, but other times they are annoying.The game is repetitive. And the dialogue is definitely repetitive (to the point of being annoying; I had to turn-off the volume several times). The graphics are good. Destroying the robots becomes very predictable/repetitive after a while. The story moves slowly, and it's also predictable. Ever seen the movies Westworld or Future World? The whole idea of robots looking/acting like humans is old; those movies came out in 1973 and 1976. That makes this story seem old.The game is rated M for Mature. Most of that rating is for strong language. In my opinion, there is too much strong language in the game. It is gratuitous and mostly unnecessary. Gore? I didn't notice any; these are robots you're shooting-up...not humans; even the human-life robots are still robots.I bought and downloaded this game from Steam during one of their sales. It cost me 12 bucks. The game is not worth it. Five bucks maybe. There are better games to play, so keep this one for when you run out of good games (or when you don't want to replay your good games). I played this once, but I don't plan to play it again (and I've uninstalled it). The part that I would enjoy re-playing is the seawall slide in chapter 1...and that takes just a few minutes.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2013"}

I even got my friends hooked and they bought XBox's just for Halo.  We stood in line to get this, and we are all dissapointed.  The weapons are watered down, the campaign is dark and dreary, and the multiplayer is filled with bugs and glitches.  On the bonus DVD, they keep saying over and over how they wish they had more time to do this or that.  It is an unfinished, and very unpolished game.  In multiplayer you can't just start a room with the map or game options that you want.  Bungie has a \"playlist\".  One is Team Slayer.  You can't control how many people play, what map you play on, or even what weapons you use.  One of the biggest gripes people have is that Bungie forces everyone to use the second weakest weapon in the game as their starting weapon.  This makes for a lot of weapon whoring and just frustration on the part of a LOT of gamers.  Not having a choice in what I want to play is a major downfall of this game.

{"product_name":"B002TDIEDG","description":"","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Being Dead Has Never Been So Much Fun!","reviewText":"Ghost Trick was made by the same developers who brought us the fantastic Phoenix Wright series (of which I am a huge fan) so I always intended to pick it up.  Unfortunately, I got distracted by other games and didn't get to it immediately.  Anyway, because I'm aware that the Phoenix Wright series was made by the same developers, a few comparisons between that series and this game are kind of inevitable.  I will try to be objective and take this game on it's own merits, though - it's only fair.Graphics (score 10/10): Let's start off with something that I don't usually talk about in a review: the cover art.  Is that not the most embarrassing position ever to die in?  The cover is just hilarious!  That alone is worth the existence of this game.  As for the actual in-game graphics, it's not the clearest thing I've ever seen, but the environments are highly detailed, with a lot of moving parts, so I forgive it.  There are also nicely drawn portraits that appear when characters speak.Music (score 10/10): No voice acting, but the music is very good.  It's catchy, full of character, and it definitely helps add emotional weight to the scenes.  In fact, it's some of the best music I've heard on a DS game.Characters (score 9/10): If you're familiar with Phoenix Wright, then you'll know what I mean when I say that this game is full of similar quirky characters.  However, I feel that Ghost Trick has a distinctively different flavor compared to Phoenix Wright. You're main character is Sissel, who is actually an amnesiac ghost who's recently died (hence the title \"Ghost Trick\").  He sets off on a quest to figure out exactly who he is.  There's also Lynne, a spunky red-haired  detective.  All the characters feel amusing and have well written dialogue (even the minor characters, like the security guard who does the \"Panic Dance\", are memorable), yet they have some emotional depth to them.  I can't say that they are quite as endearing or memorable as the people from PW, but they are very good (there's even a dog named Missile - I can't help wondering if this is a reference to the \"Missile\" from PW).  You'll develop some attachment to these fictional people before the end of the game, and you'll genuinely come to care whether they live or die (even the one's who are already dead!).  My only complaint is that something happens later that makes me identify a bit less with Sissel, but I don't want to give it away; he's still likable, I'm just a bit disappointed with the big identity reveal.  Still, the characters in general are very lovable and I'm quite pleased.Story (score 10/10): The story begins with your main character, Sissel, dying in the most embarrassing position possible.  He remarks that he would like to save the life of the woman who's being held at gunpoint, but that he can't because he's dead.  Your first order of business is to figure out how to do things as a ghost, and to save that woman.  Your overall purpose, though, is to find out who murdered you and who you really are.  Of course, over the course of the game, the story unfolds into a complicated mystery, and the writing is fantastic.  I won't give anything away, but let's just say that it's excellent and it's been a long time since I've played a game with a story this good.  I was absolutely riveted the whole way through.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  You basically play as poor Sissel (a ghost) and you can possess objects that are close to each other.  Some objects can be \"tricked\" -basically manipulated- into moving in some way (like opening a cabinet door).  It plays out with Rube Goldberg-type puzzles where you have to cleverly move from one object to another or set them into motion in a chain reaction of some kind in order to reach your goal.  He also has the ability to rewind to 4 minutes before the death of other people and potentially use his powers to save their lives (Unfortunately, he can't do this on himself.  Poor Sissel).  Yes, there is a real timer going on during these segments.  Now, before you freak out and run away, do not fret, it's not so bad.  If you fail, you don't get an annoying \"game over\" screen with a bunch of loading, you just get to try again.  You can also rewind whenever you want if you've messed up.  Timers in games never sound fun, but this game mechanic is surprisingly fun.  It's super fun figuring out how to achieve your goal by jumping between objects and making things happen.  There's even instances where timing is important to solving the puzzle (like if a paper is in mid-air - you may need to jump to it before it hits the ground).  Don't fret though, when you are in \"ghost mode\" (that's when you are moving between objects) the screen (and any timer) freezes so you have plenty of time to make your move.  So, you see, it's not a bad thing (even though sometimes it can be tricky trying to figure out what you need to do exactly).  I had a ton of fun with this game.  There's really only one complaint that I have: the saving.  If you save in the middle of a stage, then turn off the machine and start it up later, you have to start from the beginning of the stage all over again instead of where you saved!  It's madness.  Still, I can't really count off the score for such a small quibble when everything else is so fantastic.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  This is one of the most unique point and click adventure/puzzle games I've playing in a long time.  The gameplay mechanics are solid and fun, the story is deeply engaging, the music is a delight for the ears, and the characters are lovable and endearing.  You can't get much better than that.  The game is pretty short (about 10-15 hours), but given how good it is, it's still well worth your purchase.  Go ahead and give it a try; being dead has never been so fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

This was the only difference to beign with but in the end this has come out on top.Firstly is the amazingly good character creator system which may not be as detailed as other games (Tony Hawk games are quite accurate) it still feels really satisfying to watch your creation slice up classics like Voldo and Mitsurugi. Nice and simple.The modes here are very varied for those who have time and for those who just want quick relief. For those who really want depth there is the long Chronicles of the Sword mode which involves basic strategy with the same beat em up power on the real game. It also has a nice little story in it and although the strategy system isn't revolutionary it is enough to keep you entertained. Another mode is the Tales of the Souls, which is like the arcade mode but what you choose affects who you fight against; however after you've played it a few times you'll realise that everyone's story is very similar and the only thing seperating them is the ending. The other mode is Arena mode which is basically a random choice of very random modes (fighting a giant statue!?) that are used for quick relief and addictive gameplay which is what they do best.The characters in this series is literally the entire set. Although there aren't many ? squares in the selection process there is a small area where they've shoved random old characters (does anyone remember Li Long and Hwang?) along with some random other characters. One of the biggest selections so far.Overall...buy it if you have a craving for a good beat em up. If you don't like it then you don't like beat em ups so that's not my problem; everyone else is welcome though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"A Dying Breed","summary":"Disappointing, but still addicting.","reviewText":"I usually review cd's, but I decided to review this one, since the whole RE series is so damn cool.  Also, yes. I have this game and have been playing it for over a week now. I'm sick of seeing people putting in reviews before the release date. I've also read a lot of the other reviews. It's funny how one person raves about it and gives it five stars, while another person hates it and doesn't even think it deserves one star. I guess it's just a matter of taste, huh? Anyway...Anyone that owns a PS2 of course would be excited about any RE game finding its way onto their platform. So, naturally I scooped it up, post-haste. The first recommendation I have to make is don't buy this game without the strategy guide. I was completely lost and couldn't make it past the first scenario. I got as far as the rooftop before I considered returning the game. The guide helps a lot. Otherwise, you'll constantly be backtracking, going back to places you were sure you explored every inch of.As far as the online gameplay goes, I don't have it. I'm still in the stone ages with my slow as molasses dial up. So, I can't comment on that.The game goes back to Raccoon City. I don't really have a problem with that because the only other RE game I played is Code Veronica. Ok, confession time. I only started getting into the games after the movie came out. Yeah, go ahead. Call me a poser fan if you want.The first major disappointment was the movement. After Code Veronica, I fully expected all the bugs to be worked out. I was looking forward to 360 degree camera turnarounds and zooming in and out capabilities, just like most PS2 games now. But, no. They still have it set up so when you move to the edge of the camera, there's a new shot. Come on! Video games have come a lot further than that. Get rid of the 2D crap!The other annoying thing is the other players you have to babysit. The only good thing about that is you can trade items, but what happened to item boxes? Unless you're playing as the asian girl, you can only hold 4 items. to hold anymore, you have to discard something. Plus, although there are typewriters, they're not really save points. It only halts the game until you decide to play again. If you die, you still have to start the whole scenario over again. I know a lot of people have said it, but I have to agree. The loading times and waiting times between rooms is atrocious.Well, there are good points to the game, the first being the selection of characters. Because there are only 5 scenarios to complete, it's fun to complete them with the different people. Also, the graphice are dramatically improved. There is also more of a variety of weapons and other items, as well as combat moves.Overall, I expected better from this game. Ihey could have made more improvements, considering what's out there now. On the other hand, any addition to my RE collection is a good one. I do suggest renting this one first, since the reviews have been so mixed. I can't tell for sure if this is a flop or a hit for the hardcore fans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2004"}

I'll quickly hit on those points and then dive in to why I am only giving this game three stars.I'm not going to shower this game with praise -- if you want to see why people think it's a great game read critic reviews or the 5/5 stars here. The graphics are nice, it fundamentally is fun even though it's shallow, and there is a lot to do. I think, however, that the following issues definitely warrant at least two of the review stars to be banished to oblivion.Oblivion problems solved:Leveling:One of the first things Oblivion players will be relieved to see is that the annoying level scaling system is no longer in place; in Oblivion if you were a thief and leveled all your main skills you would almost instantly become fodder for enemies as they leveled up while you only leveled your thieving skills. In Skyrim when you level you have a choice of whether to add points toward health, stamina, or magic. It's a bit dumbed down but you won't even think about strategizing leveling like you had to in past Elder Scrolls games. One thing you may end up spending time thinking about, however, are the perks which you receive (like Fallout 3's perk system somewhat) which before they can be spent on a skill require some skill level to exist. These make the game somewhat fun and allow you to customize your character a bit more aside from just the pools of health, mana, and stamina.Exploring:Some effort has gone into the dungeons such that they no longer feel like the same exact dungeon but with a different creature guarding. In some dungeons you'll find unique puzzles to solve but for the most part they are trivial and after you deal with one you'll have the hang of it. Traps are back and in full force but aside from some very rare ones they tend to be weak enough where you likely won't die once you've leveled up any.Now on to Skyrim (I'll avoid any spoilers):Economy:The economy of Skyrim is fundamentally broken. By the time I was offered my first house (which wasn't all that late in my game play) I could already afford the house and many of the improvements on it. By the time I finished the game I had 150,000 or so septims on me and nothing to spend them on. Yes, I could have paid trainers to learn skills but what's the point? Is that the only thing worth spending money on? At least in Oblivion you had to pay enchanters to enchant -- since it's all manually done now there is no big sink hole to put money into -- I stopped selling items because it just wasn't worth it -- you'll quickly run out of things to spend on. On top of that it becomes even worse toward the end of the game as you do level up as enemies will start to carry ebony weapons so you'll instantly have some gear worth almost the lot of what merchants carry per kill.Main Quest:It's very shallow. I know some people are raving at the originality of the story but seriously, play the game and write down the story on a piece of paper. You'll notice you can't write more than a paragraph. The story starts out alright throwing in the possibility that this issue with the dragons could be caused by any number of interested parties and makes you wonder what's going on but later becomes one dimensional and easily predictable. I won't go into detail but don't buy this game for the story (Oblivion suffered a similar fate). The quests as well are fairly tedious and usually are fetch quest related.Dungeons:One more note on dungeons (I mentioned it in the comparison above but needs to be said) they are completely linear. There are no interesting paths through them aside from the main one where you'll pretty much avoid trap, fight monster behind corner, walk a bit, open door, and then repeat.Guild Quests:I played through the lot of the guilds before finishing the main quest and must say I'm not impressed. I don't want to give spoilers about the guilds but since it's common knowledge which guilds exist will break up the review into the guilds themselves. One thing to note is that unlike previous games where you had outposts at separate locations where you performed tasks this game limits each guild to one location. One thing to note as well: unlike other games there are no requirements to becoming a member or guildmaster of any of the guilds... it's all quest related -- aka you can become the mage's guild leader without knowing any magic aside from the one you're given when you go to visit them.The Companions (Skyrim's version of the Fighter's Guild): effectively clear enemies from locations quests. Nothing particularly entertaining aside from one of the first quests.Winterhold College (Mage's guild): Quest is alright but another set of quests where you go and kill everyone. They don't explain why things are happening often even after it's all over.Thieves Guild: Tedious. There are two types of quests... the main one and the side ones where you do a thieving job. The main quest line is fine (although it's mostly kill things related which doesn't make sense although if your sneak is high enough I guess you can avoid all kills). The thieving jobs are tedious and just annoying to do. In order to advance (even if you finish the main quest) you need to get 5 jobs done and a special quest each for 4 cities. The problem is the quests given to you are random so unless you found this out online (like I did after like 30 random tedious quests) you likely won't know how to advance.Dark Brotherhood: You will mostly fast travel and the creative elements to kills have been removed (in Oblivion you were asked to kill a guy by dropping a moosehead hanging above him on his head -- not here). There is an epic quest in this line but the actual execution of such was much less epic.Legion / Civil War quests: Mostly either defend this location from an onslaught or kill all the people at this location. Not going to spoil anything but the game makes this line much more of the story than the actual work in the quests themselves.Misc Non Infinite Quests:That is quests that aren't of the randomly generated but are misc. The quests were sometimes good and sometimes really bad... I guess it depends on which designer made the said quests. Some were interesting (Daedra quests) while others trivial and not well thought out.General Other Quests:One of the talking points for the game was their infinite quest system which finds a point to have a quest and sets you off. For the most part these are trivial (as you would imagine) fetch, kill, fedex quests. There is no thought in them and aside from a small amount of money given to you (who needs money in this broken economy world) no point in really doing them. I admit I did some of them if only to find out where there was a dragon perch, etc as the dragons themselves usually have good loot by their perchs.Character Equipment:Controls:As mentioned by others the controls are completely console focused. In order to speed up my mouse I had to quit the game and go to the initial splash screen options and move up sensitivity otherwise it was a hassle to play. This wasn't the worst of it though... The screen options are fairly large but often my mouse will hit the wrong item... sometimes when speaking it'll get stuck until I exit the chat and try again. Other times I'll be trying to eat an alchemy item to learn its first effect and it'll eat the wrong one. It's just a huge pain. Don't get me started on smithing though it's even worse there. You go to make an item (especially when you're grinding your skill up) and you have to select the item from the list (which you can do with the enter button) but then use only your mouse to click the okay button that you really want to create the item. I eventually found you could line up the item you want to make right under the okay button and then spam hit the mouse to build things.Companions:Companions are folks who travel with you and fight along side you. For the most part I wasn't impressed by the system. They aren't as dumb as previous iterations of companions but often get lost when you're on a dungeon crawl and you'll find them pretty far back once you go to find them. In general you can use them as pack mules but depending upon who you pick as a companion some are very powerful and some are pretty weak (this could be perceived though and actually could be the same strength, not sure as they don't show any stats in the game about anyone).Dragons:Very cool the first time you fight one but very easy once you've knocked down a few. It's pretty much the same moves over and over again. I did once have to face two of them at once but it wasn't so bad at that point as you'll start to see the pattern.Monster Selection:I was sad to see a good selection of the daedra were no longer in the game. The gator faced guy, scamps, etc all gone. I guess it makes sense since this game is based on the dragons and not the daedra but aside from one daedra god's shrine I really didn't see even the casters pulling any out (well aside from the fire, frost and storm monsters).In their place there are a lot of animals (saber cats, ice wolves, passive hawks in the sky, foxes, etc), bonewalkers are draug now and have different ranks, dragons (obviously), giants, and mammoths.Bugs:Save often in some of the bigger dungeons as the game has the habit of just shutting itself down... In the older games they usually put message boxes explaining why they were shutting down but for this one they just completely turn off. I'm hoping they are sending messages home via steam about the problems to be fixed but who knows.Quest Bugs:Save before you complete some quests especially the guild ones. I was asked to clear an area out for a guild quest and then later one of the main quests was broken completely (never given) because one of the pre-conditions was that at least one person was alive in the location. I had to find this out online so I went to an earlier save and waited 30 days for the place to repopulate and then was able to get the quest. You have to wonder whether the testers who played the game really tested all the right things. Even if the clear locations are randomly generated (which they may as they sent me back to the same dungeon to clear it out twice in my main quest) the testers should have tried accepting quests and checking to make sure the it repopulates the area if that's a precondition.On top of that several times I ended up with a quest item I couldn't get rid of any no indication of why or a quest to deposit it somewhere. One of the main quest items is 30 pounds. I have had to lug the thing around since I got it even though I finished the main quest. I later looked online and found where I can likely get rid of it but seriously you hold people's hands through all the normal quests but can't give me a stupid fedex quest to ditch this item?Other:Finally this gets me to some of the other areas of the game not deserving their own point such as marriage and home ownership and home storage.Marriage is one of the added features in the game which allow you at some point later in the game to get married. Once you do so your spouse will cook you a meal and potentially give you half of their shop earnings (if they were a merchant). However, aside from having that person live where you want them to, there is no benefit to being married. It really feels like it was added solely as a point on the feature list and not fleshed out.Home ownership is very similar to Oblivion's aside from the fact you can pay a person to improve your homes. It's really one of the few things you'll spend money on in the game and for the most part fleshes out the location. The homes aside from the first one you have a chance to get are usually a pain to get to, however, as there are no easy waypoints to get to them. Some of them are more majestic than others but I spent very little time at them aside from carting a load of goods from a dungeon out.Summary:Buy the game if you can overlook the issues I mentioned. It works because you can do fun things are run around for hours but it's not as great as the professional critics want you to think it is. It's in no way worth all the hype. I'm a huge storyline sort of guy so this just kills the game for me -- the lack of thought that went into things.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

But items and options have obviously been left out for you to have to buy from the EA website later, no ultra speed means sleeping and working (in-game) will leave you with nothing to do for 5-10 straight minutes, and worst of all, the game crashes. I mean, for pretty much everybody who plays it.THE LONG: A pre-release copy of the game made it online, but it was buggy and those who played it wondered if it was unfinished. EA themselves confirmed that the leaked copy was a \"beta\", in other words incomplete, and was prone to crashing. I played this early copy and was satisfied with what I saw, so I awaited the retail release for a full, great game.I bought it and was shocked to see that apparently EA was lying to curb piracy: The official release is the same as the pre-release one they had been calling buggy and unfinished. They simply released a buggy game. As I write this, it's the game's first week of release and with 200 reviews it has a 2 and a half star score. I feel this is accurate. The fun of the game is brought down by the fact that it literally feels unfinished.First, the game itself. The concept with this entry in the series seems to be an emphasis on deeper characterization. Now when you play a family, the neighborhood around you is \"turned on\" at the same time. This means that while you play your character, the other houses in the neighborhood are still aging, having relationships, and so on. Time moves for the whole neighborhood now, not just you. Of course you're supposed to be able to turn this off but that doesn't work, which I'll address later. Personally I love this feature- it will keep your game fresh as new faces and families will come and go furthering the random aspect of the game. I can see where there are problems as well- you don't want to lose a family you made because you're playing as a secondary one, for example.Pretty much every item can be color customized to your liking. You can make the mailbox outside your Sims' house bright yellow and purple if you so desire. This works for clothes, the house, your character's hair, almost everything. It's nice to finally, after 9 years of Simming, be able to color things how we want instead of having the same few choices for the best, most need-fulfilling objects. While it's easy to the point of boring to be able to coat your walls with the same cheapest, plainest wallpaper and then color it however you want, it's nice to have the option. The color customization is a handy feature and runs very deep- you can choose not only the style (metallic, wooden, etc.) but also choose individual parts like the fridge handle in addition to the fridge itself.But this concept brings up my first big complaint with this game. When we saw that pre-release game leak, we dismissed the lack of items as something they'd fix in the retail release. Not so. Perhaps due to this color customization feature, they have greatly reduced the number of items you can choose from in some categories. While it doesn't matter much to only have a few couches or whatever, it's inexcusable to have as few as about a dozen hairstyles to pick from. I haven't checked the females yet, but when I made my male character, I was upset with the very limited hairstyle set. Let's put it this way- I always make myself in every Sims game, and this is the first one where I wasn't able to make a character that looked a whole lot like me, with hair being a big reason. They still have a relatively similar slider system to adjust size and angle for mouths, eyes, etc. You can now also adjust body shape. But the fact that there are fewer choices than before is just a letdown. Some reviewers have complained that the characters look plastic and out of proportion, but I didn't think so myself.A feature of create-a-sim that I really dig is the new personality system. Instead of giving points between extremes like \"messy\" and \"neat\", you now get several slots to permanently choose from 50 or 60 \"traits\" such as messy, evil, dislikes children, couch potato, etc. This makes characters more unique and affects them more noticeably than the other games. For example adding a cooking trait to your Sim will make him happier with a chef's career and faster at gaining points in the cooking skill. A hydrophobic Sim will never get in the water by herself and get negative moodlets when you force her to. It's a feature you can ignore- just add the common traits of \"neat, friendly, lazy\", etc. if you want. But if you want to never have the same kind of Sim twice, this feature will really come in handy and give you much to explore.Now the neighborhood- the game comes with one, and there's a second one you can get from the EA website if you want to pay, which I think is a problem that speaks for itself. Anyway It contains around a dozen families already and EASILY room for dozens more. There are several \"community lots\" as well- scroll around the map and you'll see a military base, arena, central park, and small businesses. One of the nicest things in this game is that now everything is part of just one giant landscape. Going anywhere in the game takes no loading or seperate screens. Say you want your character to go from her house to the grocery store across town. Just go to the map, which zooms out really far instead of changing to a different screen or menu. Every place has an icon in this view. Click one, tell your Sim to go there, and out they go. Watch them go there from far above or zoom back in and watch as they get a quick car ride to the location you chose. In the map view you can even choose a lot to edit, and hovering over a location tells you info like who's home, where they are, where you work, and so on. Pretty useful.You can even just make your Sim walk the whole way there. No more hitting an invisible barrier at the end of your property. Walk your Sim across the street to ring the neighbor's doorbell or walk them through the hills and forests to the ocean on the other side of town. No loading screens. You'll even see other Sims walking around, going about their day the same as you. This is an awesome, much-needed feature that brings a real sense of life to the Sims. They seem to have done well with the game engine as well- I've seen as many as 14 other characters walking around on my screen at once with no performance hit, and I play on a capable but not notably powerful laptop.Other new features are things like \"moodlets\" which are indicators of how your Sim is feeling. Cook good food for example, and your Sim will get a moodlet that shows he'll be 40 points happier for the next afternoon because of the tasty meal. Neglect cleaning the dishes, and the dirtiness will lower your Sim's happiness 10 points until you do something about it. The new feature is quick to understand and if you don't like it, don't pay attention to it- the classic green/yellow/red needs meter is still there. There are a couple less needs, and now you only have to go to the bathroom only a couple times a day. Slightly more emphasis has been placed on interacting and exploring your character and your neighborhood than maintaining needs, though you still have to do so.Socializing, or rather getting to know people, is funner than ever. Gossiping will now tell you specific info such as who's mad at who or who is rich. If a sim is romantically involved they'll tell you who it's with. And as you learn a sim's traits, the game keeps track of them. Find out that someone is flirty for example, and that statistic is filled in on their profile. Getting to know sims is now less generic and more personalized. Instead of chatting repeatedly to fill a bar next to another face in the relationship menu, you now have reason to actually get to know the character more deeply because their personalities and status in life will be kept track of for you. It's fun to discover new things about new characters. And now, talking with people is easier as well because the game tells you what the character is thinking about the conversation.Going to work is now more involved as well. You can choose whether you want to work extra hard or suck up to the boss and so on with occasional repercussions and benefits. You'll get career opportunities as well- as a chef, you can be invited to have a cookout at the park or enter a cooking contest among many other possibilities. The PROBLEM I have with jobs is one of the biggest problems I have with the game- the speed system.The speed system SUCKS. At regular speed, it's fine. At double speed, it's okay for briefly skipping through showers or paying the bills. But in what I can only believe is a massive bug, there is no third speed option. It's there, click it if you want. But it does nothing. What this means is that when your character sleeps or goes to work, you get to walk around your own real-life house for a good five minutes because that's how long it's going to take for your Sims to be done. This is a major irritation that will get old fast, and while it's true that you can use this time to go play another family, you shouldn't have to. So, uh, patch then, EA?Another bug is the aforementioned lack of ability to stop town aging. If you don't want the rest of the neighborhood to age and have kids while you play, too bad- like ultra speed, clicking that option does nothing. If I had the choice, I myself prefer having the neighborhood evolve and change. But not everybody agrees, and it's realistic to expect the option to, well, WORK.But the biggest issue I have with the game is by far its instability. It crashes, and crashes hard- shutting down my computer at least once almost every time I play for a half hour or more. This has seemed to happen to me most while my character is doing the long, slow task of sleeping, so that's 5 minutes of sitting vulnerable (though the crashes could be random, who knows). Moving the mouse around and doing things in-game seemed to curb this a bit, but nothing works regularly. I panicked, thinking something was wrong with my system, but lo and behold, minimal research reveals that people with system specs that blow Sims 3 away suffer the crashing too. No one seems to be exempt and no cure has yet been found. Your game will probably crash, so take my advice and save often, and make a copy of the Sims 3 save folder every so often. This kind of crap doesn't ruin the game for me, but it haunts play with anxiety. To have to live with a game crashing and possibly shutting off your system every time is utterly inexcusable and potentially dangerous.So there you go. The game has even more features I haven't tapped into- subtle things like fishing, the wish system, hidden rewards and skills, and more- like the Sims 2, it's my opinion that the game was not greatly revolutionized but pleasantly updated to feel more natural, deep, and fun to play. Personally, I love the game myself. The average score of 3 that I give it is due to the couple massive bugs and the greedily shrewd nature of withholding basic things so they can charge you for them after you've already bought the game. If these concerns are addressed and fixed, the game would get a 5 from me. As it stands, it's a fun game that has to played with patience and frustration, and will hopefully be fixed so it can live up to its high potential.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2009"}

Nintendo is not the strong company that they used to be. With the awful launch of the 3DS, not being able to get people excited about the new Wii-u (although I am very excited), and stupid people who compare a DSi to an Xbox 360 (no lie), Nintendo is not doing so well. I do not know what happened. All I know is that I freak out and practically hug this console every time another game gets trashed. This machine is perfect. Everything about it brings me joy. The games are magic. Every time I am upset I just pop in a cartridge and forget about everything. Each game is unique. I don't know how I can be playing a photo-realistic game about monkeys trying to save their banana hoard and then end up changing cartridges to being in a resistence group in a darker fantasy adventure where magic and technology are colliding. After a little bit I am running through a haunted castle using a whip to hang on hooks just like Spiderman. I later find myself crashing an airplane and getting yelled at by a flight instructor. All of the games are so different, yet they all did one thing in common. They put the Super Nintendo's limited hardware to it's limits and creativity to a maximum. No other system has ever done that. Playstation 1 and Gamecube came close. With modern systems like the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 you know that they can do pretty much anything, but with the Super Nintendo surprises come when least expected. In The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Link is wanted because the bad guy claimed he kidnapped the princess. So I am walking through a town and I talk to a lady. She screams for guards and they come on the screen and attack me. It shocked me because I had under estimated the Super Nintendo. In a modern Xbox RPG we expect the people to yell for help if they see a wanted man, but was that possible on a 16-bit processor? I played Final Fantasy 3 and was blown away. The plot was dark with huge twists. Of course I would expect that in an Xbox 360 game, but on a console released in the early 1990s? Some games were overlooked. Ballz 3D (who would play something titled that) was a full 3D fighting game that never took off. The Super Nintendo has a lot of games to discover. I do not recommend it. I INSIST THAT YOU BUY IT! Do not buy your kids another expensive console where cliche games are rushed out with almost no love in them. Buy this. The games are simply pure magic. These are games that did not sell with excessive violence and explosions. The console is just a console. It does not have DVD playback or online leaderboards. Without the games it is a purple hunk of plastic. It is the games you put into the console that gives it charm. A unique variety of everything imaginable. This is not nostalgia either. I am 13 as of 2012, and it was my decision to get this console. The kids who have never heard of a Super NES do not know what they are missing out on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"One of the Most Replayable Games of Recent Years","reviewText":"Mario Kart Double Dash!! is one of the most phenomenal video games ever made; a game that makes me fondly remember what video games used to be.Firstly, for Mario Kart veterans (who I am sure have already picked this game up), this is the most unique game in the series.  Two racers now occupy each car.  The racer in front steers while the character in back handles weapons and attacks (you can punch nearby players now and steal their weapons).  If you play single-player, you control both characters, stearing and firing weapons, while a single tap of the 'Z' button will switch character positions.  This comes in handy, since each character can carry a weapon, while only the character in back can use them.  So, if the driver has a banana or a shell you want to fire, and the character in back has nothing, tap 'Z' and switch positions in an instant, without slowing down your car at all.Because of the two-character mechanic, there are now two types of weapon boxes that you drive through to recieve your weapon: single boxes give only the character in the back of the car a weapon - so if the charcater in back is already carrying one, switch the charcater's positions when you drive through a single weapon box so that both your racers will now carry a weapon.  Double weapon boxes give each racer on the kart a weapon, (if one charcater is already carrying one, the other racer will recieve a weapon regardless).  In single-player, if both characters have a weapon, and the one in back fires theirs, the characters automatically switch positions on the car, so the character with the remaining weapon is instantly ready to fire.In multi-player, you have a few options.  Each player can control their own car and both characters on it, or you can each pick one character to race on the same car.  If you choose the latter, both players will have to push 'Z' simultaneosly to switch positions on the car.  So, if one player prefers driving, and the other prefers handling the weapons, you can stay that way the entire race, since the characters will not automatically switch positions (instead, the player in front can tap the fire button to toss his weapon to the player in back when they are empty-handed).  Multiplayer is incredibly addicting; especially (surprise) in battle mode, which makes a welcome return.  For players used to ballon battle from Mario Kart 64, the levels in Double Dash will seem small at first (though you can unlock a few more, one of which is bigger), but give balloon battle a chance.  It is incredibly addictive, and nothing is more satisfying than hitting your opponent with an expertly timed shot of a green shell from across a level.  (There are also two new battle modes this time around, but I found balloon battle to be the most enjoyable.)One thing that surprised me was the game's difficulty.  The learning curve is perfect, with three difficulty levels as usual, 50cc, 100 cc and 150cc racing modes.  But for a Nintendo game, 150cc proved fairly difficult, which was a welcome challenge.  Computer opponents are smart on 150cc mode, but make similar mistakes to the ones you'll find yourself making.  They win races not by cheating (like in other games), but by firing weapons at strategic moments in the race, or using power slides around turns (do it correctly and you'll get a mini speedy boost at the end of the power slide).  So, regardless of how far ahead you may be on 150cc mode, one simple error can prove devestating.  On the flip side, if you are behind, one great, well timed shot can be all you need to take the lead.  The gameplay is expertly balanced, and there is even strategy involved now in selecting your team and your car, since different players and cars have varying weights and pros and cons.  Plus, each character has a unique special weapon.In addition, the course design, as usual in the Mario Kart series, is flawless.  Every course is unique, and you'll develop strategies for approaching each one.  Moreover, the graphics are sharp, bright and colorful.  Each course and each character has their own personality.The replay value is infinite.  There are plenty of unlockables in single-player, inlcuding new characters, courses (racing and battle), cars, and game modes.  Once everything is unlocked, multiplayer alone will keep you coming back for more, not to mention besting your best course times in time trial mode.This game is a great reminder of what used to make games great - gameplay and replayability, not graphics, physics or online modes.  This is a brilliantly crafted game, a game that will appeal to all ages, both genders, gamers and non-gamers alike.A true classic!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2005"}

After some research I found that they had previously done this game, Odin Sphere, and thought it would be worth a play. However, for whatever reason I kept putting off the purchase.A few months ago I finally spent the money. At first I was expecting Muramasa's combat, so I got my butt kicked. However, once I realized that Odin Sphere requires tactics, I had a much easier and enjoyable time.The story is spread out between 5 characters, with varying degrees of overlap. However, you start out with one character, and after finishing their story, unlock the next, until all five are unlocked. This is, quite honestly, a bit disappointing, but to some extent makes sense within the scope of the larger story.After the last character is finished a final level is playable, which allows for two different endings.You can replay any character's story, but you can't pick a specific chapter to play. So once you've finished the first character, you can play their story again but must start at the beginning. You can switch to any other unlocked character at any time, but if you start playing the first again, you pick up where you left off.4 of 5 stars only because I played Muramasa: The Demon Blade first, and how they perfected this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2010"}

This is probably the first NFS that did new things since Underground 1. The big thing here is the Bounty system and the Blacklist system. You start out at the top and then a racer named Razor cheats and gets your pink slip dropping back to the bottom of the well. You have to climb to the top of a list of 15 different racers to have a crack at Razor again. To get to each racer you have to raise your bounty a certain amount and complete a certain amount of races. There are many race types here, surprisingly, and they are fun and keep things mixed up. You have anything from drag racing, to speed traps (which clocks the fastest racer), toll booth (timed checkpoints), to regular circuits.The bounty system is really nice and fun since you have to run from the cops and as you smash into them and evade them your bounty increases. You can use Pursuit Breakers to get the cops off of you then you can find various hiding spots until your heat cools down. This in turn brings the heat up on your car and the higher the heat is the more likely you'll get spotted. The next thing is the big free roaming world which you, honestly, really won't want to roam much since it feels so empty and boring.Thankfully EA put a jump to safe house option and you can get to races from a menu instead of driving there if you want. The tuning is really nice here as well and doesn't boggle your mind like Gran Turismo would. There are a plethora of parts, visuals upgrades etc. to choose from. The main gripes here is that this is a typical EA port and they left in some bugs such as framerate hitches and crashes, but they never came out with a patch to fix this issue. The multiplayer is a nice setup but that's all you'll come back for after you beat the single player. If you missed this NFS or are new to it this isn't a bad entry point.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Featuring enhanced graphics, sound and control, Silent Hill Origins sets a new standard for this survival horror classic.","reviewerName":"James J. Schultz","summary":"\"Origins\" from the Latin \"dark\"","reviewText":"Or at least that's what you'll think when playing, the PS2 version at least.  I won't tell you the story because that's been said.  The controls and camera angles are what you'd expect from a Silent Hill game and if you've never played one before I'd suggest starting with 2 or 3 ( or the original I guess, if you've got a PS1 lying around.)  The graphics are pretty bad most of the time.  The video scenes in the very begining and end of the game show how good they could be, but the developers either couldn't fit that good of graphics throught all the scenes or were just lazy.The music is as good as always and Akira Yamaoka is truly a master at capturing the essence of Silent Hill in his music.I found the story to be pretty linear considering how good SH2's story was, and the game was short.  The Butcher came off as a cheap immitation of Pyramid Head of SH2.  He was more violent than scary and was only given two instances of screen time.  He doesn't come off as a big deal in the grander scheme of things.  And although Origins had a few fairly memorable scenes, they seemed to not linger around long enough to make an impact.But it seems like I'm complaining a lot which is weird because I really DID enjoy the game.  I would say number 2 and 3 are better, but this one isn't bad.  It held true to the Silent Hill formula while still adding a few elements (portals to the Otherworld; breakable weapons) and I liked the changes in the firearms used.The rifle shoots much more quickly than in SH2 and Travis can move while firing (helpful!) and the shotgun is a double-barrel rather than a pump-action, so you can fire twice in quick succession and reload in the menu.  However the \"Service Pistol\", an M1911 automatic, was incorrectly put with 9mm ammunition when it should have been a .45 caliber.  Normally I wouldn't care, but in all other rights the firearm accuracy was solid.  If anyone knows who the woman on the grip of the Redeemer is, put up a comment.But yes, let's get back to the light level.  It's low.  The game is dark, and very much so.  I often would tap the X button just to find objects I couldn't see.  I can't tell you how often I picked up weapons lying on the ground or against a wall that I didn't even know were there.  I know it's Silent Hill and they've always been dark, but jeez!  And the grainy textures from the blown up PSP version didn't help.But the story brough back the history of Alessa with Travis facing his inner demons in some memorable settings and managed it successfully, so is there even room to complain?  It's not as good as 2 or 3 but those were fantastic games, so this one is at least good.  And there are plenty (PLENTY) of games that can't say that.  It's a solid entry.  Silent Hill fans will love it, horror game fans would be best advised checking out one of the others.(Note: I didn't mention Silent Hill, Silent Hill 4: The Room, or Silent Hill: Homecoming.  That's because I haven't yet played them.  I didn't mean to suggest they weren't as good as 2 or 3.  I really have no idea if they are or not.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2009"}

In fact, it's quite the opposite, as each of the unique features (touch pads, cameras, tilt, etc) help transform the world/levels as you explore.  Can't reach certain areas, well bounce  your fingers on the rear touchpad to catapult your character into the air.  See something cool?  Take out your camera (and the awesome array of filters and lenses) and take a snapshot, or if feeling bored, take a selfie!Want to customize your character to look however you want?  No problem, you can do that too!  In fact, I created my very own &#34;Ryo Hazuki&#34; costume for my messenger to wear.  It's awesome.  What other game allows you to do that?

I didn't want this game to end, and thankfully (I've completed the story once so far) I can go back and relive each level collecting more items and snapping more pictures to expand the world even more.

I agree with the other reviewers that this game is a lot like Zelda.  However, Zelda had a long and engrossing adventure with some character advancement (stronger weapons, stronger defense, special attacks, etc...).  I will highlight a bit about the game and tell you why it didn't get 4 or 5 stars in my opinion.Story goes: birds kidnap all the residents in your town.  You are Rocket, a young slime that was left behind after being mistaken for a worm.  (chuckle)  You now have to find and release all of the 100 residents of the town in order to finish your adventure.  So the story isn't very creative.  There are a lot of the monsters and characters from other Dragon Quest games, and often the interaction is fun... but the story is definitely geared towards kids.The difficulty is also slanted towards kids.  It's pretty easy.  Enemies don't really attack very aggressively.  Most have predictable movements and indicators as to when they are about to attack.  It's pretty easy to dodge.  And since there is really only one attack that Rocket can perform, battling baddies is a bit of a drag.  And there are plenty of recovery items dropped along the way too.  Sometimes getting to a chest containing one of the residents is a bit of a puzzle... but usually the puzzle consists of bouncing around an obstacle and then reaching the chest.  Easy.The graphics are nice, colorful, vibrant.  The problem is that with only 7 areas, the backgrounds get repetitive.  Lack of variation and lots of backtracking can get boring quickly.  The music is simple and pleasant background noise, but nothing really exciting or catchy.The one plus here are the giant tank battles.  These battles provide a slight amount of challenge in an otherwise easy game.  Although, if you are well prepared with extra items found in your regular quest, then these are easy.There are some extras to be discovered after beating the game, but it is mainly beating up to 100 of each type of enemy to receive a trophy.  That's it.  A trophy.  And since battles are pretty bland, only the most die hard completion geeks would attempt it.There is a tank battle tournament which is fun, but it isn't too tough if you are prepared and once you get through it, it's boring to repeat.  Crafting is pretty simple and not interesting either.But it is a fun game most of the time.  Though battles can get repetitive and monotonous, the dialogue is humorous enough to keep you interested in advancing further.Pros:+ Nice graphics+ Inoffensive background music+ Funny humor+ Nice to see some DQ monsters in hero roles+ Tank battlesCons:- Really easy- Unexciting enemy battles- Lack of upgrade or advancement- Little replay valueSo get this game if you are a DQ geek (like me), but it is really geared towards a younger crowd that would probably hate the numbered Dragon Quest titles.  It's an odd game, one that has charm, but doesn't really stand out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}

First the good. The lighting effects, mob animation and movement are flawless. The diversity of sounds and the spookiness of the soundscape are the best in the business. What is wrong with the game? You can only open a door and have a mob waiting to shoot you so many times before it is dull. You grow to expect mobs to jump out at you *every* time you pickup something and more often then not you need to turn around when you open a door because mobs usually spawn directly behind you as well as in front of you. So, you expect to get pounded. The programming on the human/zombie enemies is *really* stupid by modern standards. There is nothing cat-and-mouse in trying to shoot them. They run into your face and shoot you. That is not much fun.The first two Doom games are here and they still are a blast to play. Unlike Doom 3 You can carefully plan your attacks and kill things without getting clobbered. They are great old solo campaign fun.If you played Doom on the PC you will miss the ability to quickly change weapons. The inability to program controls is a serious letdown.If you are looking for decent first person solo campaign and if your PC could not handle the graphics back in the day this is worth the 25 bucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

James Bond.","reviewText":"Agent Under Fire was the first James Bond title to appear on current-generation consoles, and its a decent if not spectacular effort. This game is notable in that it doesnt feature Pierce Brosnan's likeness as James Bond, but an entirely new face that seems to draw from all the James Bond actors over the years.Really, this is an average shooter all around. The enemy AI isn't particularly intelligent, and the graphics are decent but not noteworthy. Bond comes with some extra gadgets, but most of these seem like gimmicks without much versatility. There's a very sci-fi-ish plot here involving clones that seems to stretch believability even by Bond standards, and its capped off by a disappointing non-ending.The best parts of the game though, are the driving and rail-shooter stages between the first-person levels. At the time it was a pleasant surprise to get a nicely produced driving engine in a shooting game, and rail shooters are always fun for their simplicity in an old-school, arcade kind of way.I had fun with Agent Under Fire, and its an entertaining game if you go in with the right expectations. Later Bond games are much improved, suggesting that EA did learn from their time with this one. Bond fans can add this to their collection without worry, but hardcore gamers should look for an overall stronger experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2005"}

I was thinking it would be awful because they seem to be trying to sell the game by releasing it with an FF12 demo. But I didn't even bother playing that demo yet because the game is good.The cell shading is perfect. If you like Dragonball Z you will probably recognize Akira Toriyama's style immediately. The game looks great, and it feels good too as all the characters and environments work well together.The story of the game is okay. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I like it. It feels old school and that's a good thing. It's about a group of adventurers tracking down an evil wizard. Nothing spectacular, but you'll grow to like the characters as they aren't annoying.The voice acting is an essential part of the game. Although they do not voice act for everything, alot of the cut scenes are voice acted. What's more important is the fact that the voices actually fit the characters. The hero doesn't talk, but that's okay.The fighting is standard. In boss fights you will always be using this technique of high tension in order to do massive damage. That can be boring. Still, the fights don't feel wasted as each level up allows you to put skill points into making your fighter better. Each character can hold certain weapons. The main character can hold a spear, sword, boomerang, and fists. Each character has their own specialities, and it's fun to mix things up once and a while.The game isn't too difficult, but you better buy a lot of herbs before going to your first dungeon. Bosses do massive damage each turn, and you'll have to choose who lives and who dies. If your entire party dies you lose half your gold and revive back at the inn. This sucks as it will take you around 20 minutes to get back to the boss and kill him. Other than that, I think any noviced rpg gamer should figure it out.The only visible problem with the game occurs when you get stuck doing the same battles over and over because you can't quite find your destination. The overworld is beautiful, but big. If you go looking for treasure, you usually won't be rewarded with anything good as you'll spend too much time battling.One last point, I think the most important thing to remember about this game was that it feels like a lot of effort was put into it. It has it's own musical score which is great. And the art will make any DBZ fan nostalgic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2005"}

We were so happy with it, we decided to get a second one, an Arcade this time. I was tired of having to move the 360 from the media room to the living room every time we had friends over to play Rock Band, and I figured the back and forth couldn't be good for the system anyway. It was an added bonus that we would now have the media center extender in both rooms, and I would be able to play my games on the 360 when Mike was playing the PS3 or the other 360 in the media room.We're a dual income, no kids family, so we have disposable income and spend a good deal of money on electronics. When our 360 Arcade broke, it was a mild inconvenience, an annoyance more than anything. Purchased in January of 2008, and broken by March of 2009. It lasted all of 14 months, two months past the warranty period. It wasn't the RRoD, so to fix it, we would have to pay $100. Microsoft would warranty the repair for all of three months. We're very lucky, we can afford to fix our 360, or even just buy a new one. But not everyone is in our situation, and that's what makes me angry about this.There are kids everywhere who begged and pleaded with their parents for this console, and it was a big deal that they got it. Maybe it was a Christmas/Birthday combo gift, or the only present the entire family received. Some people don't have $100 to spend fixing a broken console, not to mention not everyone has something else to play while it's off for repair. It is NOT COOL that Microsoft will not do the right thing and stand behind their product.That being said, when the 360 is working, it's a wonderful console. The interface is very intuitive and it has wonderful features that make it much more than just a gaming system. I can't say that we won't buy the next generation console, because we will. And, I guess that's the problem, the reason Microsoft can continue to sell and manufacture substandard merchandise is that we let them.EDIT: Microsoft has, after this review was originally written, agreed to extend the RRoD warranty to include the E74 error message. Thank you, Microsoft, for standing up and doing the right thing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2009"}

My husband LOVES the 2K basketball games on the PS2 and Xbox, but our PS2 broke and the new 2k game didn't come out on the Xbox. so I bought NBA Live on the Wii for him. (2K doesn't make the basketball game for the Wii). He hated it. He didn't like the controls and he said the whole game sucked. The Xbox stopped making games I guess so I had to buy him a new console to play basketball on before I hurt him. The PS3 is ridiculously expensive. I do not own any blu ray disks and I do not plan to as they cost way more than DVDs and Red Box only charges $1 per night to rent new release DVDs. Thus, at this point in life, the benefits of the PS3 do not outweigh the cost. That left us with the Xbox 360. I bought the arcade console as he will only be playing a few games on it so memory wasn't that important. Also, he said that he wouldn't be using Xbox live so the arcade version serves its purpose for us. We don't even know how to setup Xbox live; so, no comment on that. (I hooked the wireless up on the Wii with no problem). Hubby is the only one who plays the 360 cause it's in our room. I warned him about the RROD so I'm sure it's because he doesn't want the kids to break it. Aside from that most of the Xbox games are for adults, and our kids are 8 and under and love their Wii.Bottom Line: My husband loves it and gets a lot of use out of it, but it is not good if you have young kids who'll be playing primarily...then you should get a Wii.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"Resident Evil 6 game review","reviewText":"Resident Evil was the game that defined the survival horror genre of gaming and became well known as one of the big titles for zombies in the video game world. However, over the years, Capcom's horror title has had very little to do with actual scares and with the latest installment to the franchise, a title that Capcom said would return RE back to its survival horror roots, lacks any real scares. Unless you have MichaelBayphobia (that's where you are afraid of explosions) then you probably won't find anything about this game scary. But scares are the least of our worries. This game was blasted by critics when it was released earlier this month. Destructoid called it \"not just a step back for the series, it's a step back for commonplace, unassuming action-shooters.\"  GameSpot said \"this long, poor sequel is the ultimate test of patience for even the most dedicated.\" And another site said that it `Killed the franchise.' So I really had to find out myself if it was really that bad and after playing through it, I can honestly say it is not that bad but it is a game that definitely has its flaws. Now I have to say, when I first started playing this game, I was about to agree with the critics and I really did not like how this game started but it does get better. So let's jump into this zombie mess and start the review.STORY (Spoiler Free): The story takes place throughout the year of 2013 and spans across Europe, the United States, and China as the outbreak of the C-Virus is becoming a worldwide epidemic aided by the mysterious and powerful terrorist group know as Neo-Umbrella (How this group function is very poorly explained.) The game spans across 4 campaigns that intersect with themselves here and there. You have Leon Kennedy's campaign where he and new comer Helena Harper must escape from the American city of Tall Oaks which has been infected by the C-Virus (the only campaign where you face actual zombies) and then make their way to China. Leon's campaign has been regarded as the best as it feels the most like the old Resident Evil games..... For the first quarter of his campaign that is. Then you have Chris Redfield's campaign with his partner Piers Nivans and other soldiers from the BSAA trying to put a stop to the outbreak and Neo-Umbrella activities in China. This campaign is generally regarded as the worst and I can agree for the most part because it really feels like a third person Call of Duty game more than an RE game. It's filled with every clich&eacute; line from every military movie and game in the book.  It doesn't help that there are some voice actors from Call of Duty games in this campaign. While 85% of this campaign is the weakest, last part makes it worth it as there is an epic last boss fight and a very sad but moving ending. You will cry man tears. The third campaign you play as new character Jake Muller and returning, all grown up from RE2, Sherry Birkin. This is probably my favorite campaign as it has the most variation and, for me anyway, the most likeable characters. Jake is a very brash, smartass who is quite amusing in his sarcastic and cynical sense of humor and I love me some cynicism. Sherry is cute but a strong female character and I enjoyed the chemistry between the two. That isn't to say there isn't chemistry between the other characters but they are not nearly as developed. After completing the three main campaigns, you unlock Ada Wong's campaign which focuses much more on stealth and her role in all the craziness that is happening.This game has a long, complex, and confusing story. There is a timeline under the cut scenes menu where you can watch all the cut scenes in order with their dates to make more sense of the story but still... It gets really confusing, especially with how the game starts out. It throws you into the last quarter of Leon's campaign where it acts as a very weak tutorial and then abruptly ends giving you the choice of playing Leon's, Chris's, or Jake's campaign. More or most likely, you'll be wondering what the hell was going on so you'll play Leon's campaign first which throws you into an even more confusing scene set several weeks before what you just played. It takes awhile for things to get flushed out and for anything to start making sense but after the first hour it does start getting better especially as you get some nostalgic feels from the old RE games but that doesn't last too long. There are lots of throw backs to old RE games and other zombie related media such as the reoccurring boss from Jake's campaign that feels a lot like the Nemesis from RE3 and the meaty grave zombies in Leon's campaign that look like the zombies from The Return of the Living Dead.I will say that this game is long and there is a lot of content so this game stays away from the problem of being too short like many games these days but each campaign feels kind of like a similar but different game from the other. In fact, there are credits at the end of campaign which means they had different people working on each. It feels like Capcom was trying to please everyone with the settings and game play which probably hurt their chances of having an overall great game. This becomes reflected in the game play.GAMEPLAY: This is where many of RE6's problems are. The general game play feels a lot like Gears of War and many other third person shooters. The game engine is built off RE5's engine and I feel it is generally an improvement in terms of action. Shooting is easy and the hand to hand combat is improved and even fun. Your HUD is easy to read and looks different for each character. Your health is divided into 6 segments that can regenerate individually but once one is gone you will have to use a healing item to fully recover. I like this more than the usual stay in cover and all your health will come back style that you see in most games. Speaking of cover, the cover system is not the best but you rarely truly need to use it unless playing on the hardest difficulties.Like I said before, the game starts out with a poor tutorial that really doesn't do the best to explain certain mechanics such as pulling up your inventory screen. I had to ask a friend how to do it once I couldn't pick up ammo anymore. Also you can store over flow items into a `case' for later but I have no idea how to access this case. The worst inventory screen for an RE game I've seen. The ways skill upgrades are handled in this game are slightly better than in RE5. For example instead of upgrading the damage increase for each individual weapon in RE5, you can upgrade your weapon damage increase for all weapons with just one upgrade now. However, it still runs into the problem of not getting enough points to upgrade with which you get by picking up chess pieces that get dropped by enemies throughout the game. You will have to play through the game multiple times to unlock everything. You can customize a set of skills to equip but I main just picked three and stuck with them throughout the game.The running and shooting game play does get repetitive after awhile and you feel it the most in Chris's campaign. Yeah, it's fun to run around shooting your way through mutant terrorists at first but it gets old fast. His campaign has the least variation when compared to the others but that isn't exactly a good thing. If you hate Quick Time Events, then you will hate this game as it is filled with them. RE4 is the game that made QTEs popular and that has continued with RE6. Some uses of the QTEs are creative but most often are just frustrating and sometimes confusing. The scene where you have to crash land a plane via QTEs was a pain in the ass for me. Leon's campaign seemed to have the most and that are partly why I didn't like his campaign all that much. Also, Leon's campaign has the absolute WORST swimming controls I've ever experienced in a video game. I hated that part. Another QTE mechanic that was difficult to use was the climbing mechanic used in a few parts of the game in which you must hit the L and R bumpers in a certain pattern. It is easier to mess this pattern up if you are not giving it your full attention. They also have vehicle segments that get thrown on you with little direction but most of them are simple enough, especially the ones in Chris's campaign. The snowmobile and bike segments in Jake's campaign are a less forgiving and will result in some trial and error and some instant deaths before completing them.This is also kind of where the co-op comes in as during these segments one character will be driving or flying while one shoots. The game's AI for your partners is generally good enough to not be an issue. NPC AI not so much. Other members of Chris's team getting in my way were an issue that I ran into a lot in his campaign. There are parts where you and your partner must split up to accomplish a task and this was never much an issue for the AI though I would recommend playing with another person. Capcom did a good job handling the co-op this time around by allowing split screen, offline co-op instead of co-op being online only like they did with RE5. This was a step in the right direction.Outside the campaigns, you have Mercenary mode where you play as one of the characters and run around shooting up zombies. It's pretty no brainer and good if you want just straight up action. You also have Agent Hunt mode which is online only where you play as a mutant and try to kill agents before they kill you. There are also unlockables such as files and figures though I have yet to unlock any figures. You can also unlock alternate costumes but I'm not sure if that is DLC or not. The game play, much like the story is a mixed bag most will find. Some of it works, some of it doesn't and it's the stuff that doesn't that will stick in your mind the most.GRAPHICS: It's hard to say if there is any improvement here visually from RE5 which isn't a bad thing. It's definitely darker than RE5 and not in a scary way, in an `I wish I could see what is around me' kinda way. I'd say this game is 80% darker than the previous title but when you are in a well lit area, the environments do look good and I especially liked how the Chinese city looked. The character and creature designs are what stand out most in the game. The character models look realistic and great. The facial expressions are what stood out most to me and really helped add emotion to the cut scenes. This continued well over from RE5. The horrific monstrosities you face throughout the game are disgusting and some of the best so far in the series. The BOWs make for some good boss fights, game play and graphics wise. Definitely a good looking game.SOUND: The game's sound design is good for the most part. The music works, the sound effects and monster sounds work and I love the sound of zombie's heads getting crushed. I really liked the sound when you pressed start on the title screen but why isn't there a disembodied voice saying `RESIDENT EVIL ... SIX!' in this game? That disappointed me a bit. The voice acting is good, especially in the emotionally strong scenes however, the script they are working with is nothing special and it's pretty bad at some points but they do the best with what they have to work with. One thing that bugs me is that Leon's, Chris's, and Jake's voices sound almost the same 90% of the time. Maybe it's just me but their voices sounded way too similar.Overall, RE6 is not as bad as some of the critics have made it out to be but I honestly have a hard time recommending this game to anyone that isn't a Resident Evil fan and even if you are, you will probably have a hard time trying to love the entire game. It feels like 4 different but very similar games thrown into one. Like I said, I think Capcom was trying to please everyone with this game and it hurt their chances of making one great title, instead it's just an okay game.  Capcom needs to think long and hard with where they want this franchise to go from here and wait till they come up with that good idea. They'll need another masterpiece like Resident Evil 4 to make RE7 anything special. In the mean time, I'd like to see Capcom try and revive some of their other survival horror titles like Dino Crisis. The RE6 style of game play would work great for a reboot of that series. That said, RE6 is a good way to close up this chapter of the franchise and is still better than any of those crappy Resident Evil movies that keep getting made.Overall: 6.5/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

I was very excited to play this, because I have been in a search of a decent RPG game since I went overtime with Oblivion, but this game sucks!Dragon Age depresses me greatly. Everytime I tried to play this, I exited the game feeling like I wasted my time in the worst way possible.The combat is emphesized to be TACTICAL. All that really means is, I found out, you can pause anytime and order commands then unpause. Where is the fun in this? I would hate to waste my time playing a video game that requires no skill and delivers me no sense of urgency when there are other video games that challenge me in one way or another. I genuinely appreciate good game designs when I see them, but I found no aspect in this game that 'wow'ed me because everything about this game is so plain and linear. Either way, since combat is such a big part of the game, it would take a miracle for this game to be 'decent' at this point, but as you will see, that is not the case.I cannot comment much on the story since I did not get very far in the game before I completely gave up. But the beginning story of the human noble I made (there are 6 different beginning stories that lead to the same story eventually) was very uninspired and was presented poorly. The demons are said to be coming back, and then a legendary Warden who hunts these demons comes in town, asks for your assistance, and the same day your father gets murdered by a betrayal of a friend that is linked with these demons. You be the judge of this...The way the dialogue is played out, with you choosing from a number of response options to respond to what other characters say to you, becomes really tedious very quickly. I watched some trailer and it looked good, but was I wrong again... Most dialogue options you are given do not affect the outcome, but they may trigger a different verbal response from your target. That is about it... The dialogue options are boring and dull and I felt helpless that it takes so much time for the game to get going because of all the useless chat you have to do when you don't care about the history of a poorly built fictional world or the name of the warrior who saved the same fictional world a hundred years ago.I read other reviews and am shocked that some people praise this tedious game by saying it is intellectual or tactical. I disagree. A lot of games today are tactical, but they're also fast-paced and require other skills (which I call video game skills), so the tactics involved in the process are not as obvious as this one's. Tactics found in this game are very shallow anyway. You pause when you get in a battle, you aim a faraway enemy with your archer, you use a spell or a skill when necessary, and you focus one unit at a time. You have unlimited time to tinker with these options...which makes this game even less rewarding as it is.Bioware should fire the team who made this because I'm sure it's the same team that made Never Winter Nights, which is also a boring game. Try Mass Effect instead. That is a much better game made by Bioware.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}

I guess those people haven't played this game and are just judging by other peoples comments and or the demo. I too was falling for the bad reviews, after reading some I didn't feel like buying this game anymore, but since this is one of my favorite series of all time, I still bought it. I got the game and started playing the game expecting it to be totally different and boring (like the reviews and comments I have seen). Man, I was  wrong, this game still feels very much like a Dead Space game, with Amazing atmosphere. great soundtrack, Necromorph dismemberment left and right!If you are worried that this game will be all open area, then don't be, there is a lot of small hallways filled with blood, flickering lights and Necromorphs! Specially in the first 7 Chapters of the game (which you find yourself running around different space ships), after that, when you get to the planet, you will get mixed areas, some open areas and some small dark hallways, specially if you do the side missions (I recommend). The story wasn't great but still really good, it could of been better. The  new crafting system is great! I love crafting new weapons to my likings, the thing I didn't like about the crafting was that you could craft some really powerful weapons, which could make the game easy to pass. The crouching system was kinda useless, you could hide behind stuff, but I never found my self in a situation where I needed to crouch. In this game you will also fight against humans, which I thought would ruin the game but it doesn't, you don't encounter them to much, it's still mostly Necromorphs that you are fighting. There is 19 chapters in this Installment, which makes the game longer than the previous DS games. While playing the game I encountered a few glitches like the elevator glitch, when I tried to lean against the wall of an elevator, it pushed me back to the middle, nothing that breaks the game. They don't have the online mode like in DS2, but they have CO-OP which is much better. If you play as Carver (the other character) you will see different things and you will play in a few different places, compared to just playing alone. Overall, Visceral Games did a really good job with this game. If you enjoyed the first two, then you will certainly enjoy this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2013"}

For those who bought the Xbox before the launch of the S-Controller, you should know that the button arrangement (i.e., A, B, X, Y buttons) are slightly different than the original controllers. The S-Controller uses the diamond layout, with the Y button directly vertical from the A button, and the B button vertically right from the A. This is more like the PS2 button configuration or other third party Xbox controllers like Mad Catz.

{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Better than the first","reviewText":"In 2009, gamers were treated to \"Borderlands\", a unqiue, genre-blending title that incorporated all the best elements of first person shooters and RPGs, and incorporated a good dose of looting just for good measure.  So how does the sequel compare?  Well, brilliantly.  This one is even better than the first.PLOT:  The game is set five years after the first game.  Unlike the first game, from the start there is a clearly defined villain.  The game's antagonist, Handsome Jack, has claimed the wealth that the vault hunters uncovered in the Eriidan Vault from the first game.  Handsome Jack now runs the Hyperion Corporation and is now Pandora's dictator.  Handsome Jack's first priority is to kill the colonists that makes up the main population of Pandora, clean the planet up, establish law and order, and bring in industry.  Like \"The Hunger Games\", Handsome Jack conducts a gladiator tournament where participants fight to the death for precious loot.  You start out in this tournament and the beginning of the game.  After winning the tournament, Handsome Jack denies you your prize,a nd you are contacted by the Guardian Angel from the first game and who informs you that Handsome Jack must be killed and the four orginial vault hunters must be freed.CHARACTERS:  The original characters from the first game all appear as NPCs.  There are four new characters:Salvador:  analogous to Brick, he can use two guns of any type at the same type.Zero:  An Assassin.  Like Ryu Hybasi from \"Ninjga Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos\", he can create a copy of himself and also turn invisible.  Similar to Mordecai.Maya: She can suspend enemies and is similar to Liltih.The Classes and differing abilities that you can use in tandem create unique gameplay experiences.  For example, you can use Salavdor to engage enemies in gunfights, and in conjunction use Zero (my personal favorite) as a deadly assassin to sneak behind the hordes and slaughter them.  Or using Maya's phaselock, you can blow the enemies away with Salvator, or have Axton slay them all with a turret.Although the character customization is weak on how the characters appear graphically (you are only able to change their skin), in class skill customization \"Borderlands 2\" far outperforms \"Borderlands\".  Although the four main classes (Gunzerker  - two guns at once, Siren - Phase locking, Assassin - invisibility and using surprise attacks, and Commando - turrett warfare) are all clearly defined, each skill tree offers a new nuance within these clearly defined parameters to suit a broad style of game play, far more extensive than the original game.Like the previous title, you share your loot, so choose your partner carefully in co-op.  There's a great new option called \"Duel\", where you select different items for wager, and whoever wins the duel takes all the loot.  The vehicle driving sequences are rather weak, being both limited in that you really only use the vehicle to get you to where you are going.  These sequences aren't nearly as much fun as Halo's vehicle sequences.For fans of the first game, \"Borderlands 2\" takes everything the first game did right and steps it up a notch.  Oh, and don't forget the guns.  That's only about a \"bazillon\" of them.  It's amazing how many different types of guns are in this game.  Between the highly detailed skill tree, the unique interaction the different character types that afford so many different possible stragetgies for different segments of the game, the expertly written story line and fantastic artwork, \"Borderlands 2\" is an essential purchase for those who love gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Much better than the first and a fantastic game in general","reviewText":"I'm not going to go in-depth here because I've already seen several Amazon reviews that cover just about every aspect of the game worth mentioning but I'd really just like to say that this game is worth every penny of its price and it hasn't left my Xbox 360 since I first put it in there.It's a hell of a lot of fun and right from the outset, you can literally feel that the game is a more enjoyable and genuinely improved game over the original. I liked the first Borderlands but the game was not without several problems. Borderlands 2 fixes just about everything that needed to be fixed the first time around and emerges as a very strong and polished title that will suck you in with its seemingly endless array of collectable weapons and equipment.The game looks fantastic and rarely have cel-shaded graphics been put to better use. The music feels like something out of a western, which truth be told is actually perfect for this game because it almost does feel like a western in a strange way, just a post apocalyptic one. The best thing about this game is the cast of characters you meet throughout, which help to move the story along by sending you to do quests and errands. The writing in this game is impeccable and I found myself literally laughing out loud on more than a few occasions at the outright audacity of some of the dialogue and actions that came from some of these characters. I'd also like to point out that the game's villain, Handsome Jack, is one of the best and truly hateful bad guys I've seen in a game yet. He's a complete douchebag yet he's incredibly hilarious while being really condescending. Try to pay attention to the things he says whenever you receive those random voice broadcasts from him. I guarantee you will crack up more than once.Online play is very smooth and works really well, one of the things that I felt the original lacked. Don't get me wrong, the online play in the original was okay but I feel that it's simply more refined here and it's way more fun.This game isn't without its little annoyances. While collecting loot and comparing weapons has been improved greatly, it still gets to be a bit of a hassle when you have to stop everything to compare your recent acquisitions. Some missions can be a little glitchy and result in some strange occurrences that you'll see from time to time. Online play can be hampered if you're playing with people who are way beyond your current level. In those instances, you basically become a bystander as these mega characters lay waste to anything and everything. That's not so much a negative really but you simply need to be mindful of who you're playing with and hopefully they will be respectful of the fact that you haven't completed certain missions on your own and will allow you to participate in completing the goals. All in all, these are very minor annoyances and nothing that ruins the game.This game will definitely be a contender for 2012's Game of the Year and if you even remotely liked the first one, you're guaranteed to fall in love with this game. It's a game that constantly rewards you for your actions and constantly offers something new for your efforts and raising the replay value up considerably. Add impressive Twitter support (following the official Twitter accounts gets you codes to get golden keys which in turn, allow you to unlock new and rare weapons) and this game comes highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"Excellent, but leaves you wanting a little more.","reviewText":"I can't find anything that stands out as being bad about Rogue Squadron, which was one of the first titles released on the Nintendo Gamecube.  It has many good things going for it, not the least of which is its Star Wars license, which is put to excellent use.  From the menus, which feature video from the classic trilogy, to the sound effects (ripped straight from the films) to the plot (which starts at the end of Star Wars and goes through to the end of Return Of The Jedi), it's all there.The game's easy to pick up and a lot of fun.  The missions aren't incredibly difficult to get through, though earning gold medals on all of them is next to impossible, at least before you've found all the hidden powerups and unlocked some of the extra ships.  Some of the requirements are a little *too* stringent, if you ask me -- why include the targeting computer, and a powerup that lets you keep it on all the time, if you're *not* supposed to use it?  Also, to kill enough enemies to earn a gold medal on most missions, you have to get rid of your wingmen, which removes the whole appeal of *having* wingmen in the first place.  There are also levels where it's too easy to lose (or miss a medal) because you made a simple mistake.  When a mission takes 10-15 minutes to complete, that gets real annoying real fast.In any case, I can't say this is a *bad* game; it just didn't jump out at me as one of my favorites.  The lack of a multiplayer mode (being remedied in its upcoming sequel, which is supposed to have cooperative multiplayer) might be part of it.  It could also benefit from more of an overarching storyline (like in the X-Wing games on the PC) -- each mission feels disconnected from the others.  Part of the problem is also that I had the first Rogue Squadron on the N64, and this feels like mostly the same game with better graphics.  I'm holding out hope that Rogue Squadron III will improve on all these areas.A solid game, and at the prices you can get it for now, I'd recommend it to any Star Wars fan.  Otherwise, rent it first before you plunk your cash down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2003"}
{"product_name":"B005YR308S","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Emotional Downpour","reviewText":"I recently took some old games to my local game-seller to see if they'd be worth anything on a trade in. To my surprise I got about 35 bucks in store credit for what I had to trade. So I asked the clerk for a game recommendation to use my credit with. When I told the guy that I'm a big fan of single player, story-rich games likeThe Last of Usor especiallyThe Walking Deadhe recommendedBEYOND: Two Souls, but I said that I'd prefer to be able to walk out of the store without exceeding the amount of my credit. So he said, \"No brainer: Heavy Rain used for under 15 bucks.\" So that's what I did and....What a great game!Heavy Rain is an intense psychological crime thriller where the decisions you make throughout the game will have a major impact on the end to your game (I believe it's 6 possible endings with the Director's Cut). You play chapters alternating between four characters, each with their own motivation to hunt for a serial killer. The game earns its M rating probably due to some nudity more than graphic violence, but make no mistake there is indeed some violence. But the real mature theme is the emotional toll that you'll experience during a playthrough, and depending on the ending you get the game will be more emotionally draining than you might expect.I forget what stopped me from playing this game when it came out in early 2010. I think that someone said or I read somewhere that the controls and QTEs were awkward. And as it turns out, that is very true; for some reason Sony and Quantic Dream felt that re-writing the traditional controller dynamic was a good idea for Heavy Rain. The most annoying aspect of the controls was that the left stick provided direction only; in other words it doesn't move you in the direction you are pushing unless you are also holding R2. This combined with often ambiguous QTE button prompts and hard to read onscreen button commands that often shake or rotate around the screen made for some unnecessary frustrations in the gameplay.Takes a star away from the fun aspect.But overall, like I said, great game! Definitely worth the time if the new releases aren't doing it for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

This in itself makes the special edition of GTA IV worth purchasing over the standard edition.As for the game?Consider me blown away. As if the movie quality story of the single player mode isn't enough, now you can experience the thrills and spills of Liberty City with 15, count 'em, 15 other people (a first for GTA games on consoles) and it's unlike any other multi-player experience I've ever had. From the moment I went online with this title, I was instantly won over by the sheer insanity on display before me. If you are familiar with the GTA series at all, then you already know how dynamic and unpredictable events can be. Now imagine what a room full of 16 people adds to that formula of uncertainty and you have in your hands a game that will give you hundreds of hours of gameplay in your future. The graphics and sound are a new benchmark for the series and the amount of detail in your surroundings is enough to make you want to stop and smell the roses. The soundtrack especially, is pure genius. If there's one nitpick to be made, it may be that the controls aren't pitch perfect (especially the cover system, which almost works in your enemies favor when you wind up taking cover on the wrong side of the wall you're against). Still, the controls are still pretty great in their own right, tiny quirks aside. You'll still be able to do just about everything you want to in the game.Seriously, if this is the future of multiplayer and videogames in general, I'm almost afraid to see what Rockstar will serve us next.

Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil.

This game has some fantastic graphics for Nintendo, and even its time! The challenge is incredible, however it is rather mindless, because you only have a whip and one other weapon at a time. You must use strategy and patience to defeat the five bosses, or they will destroy you quite quickly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2001"}

The Uncharted series is the pinnacle of Video Game Art, and I am very happy to include Uncharted 3 within my vast library of games, and to hold it easily within my top ten favorite games ever. I am even more happy that all of Uncharted 3 Game of the Year edition has all of the DLC on disc! If I don't stop now, I'll go on forever.

{"product_name":"B0050SXU3Q","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Best Sly Cooper game by a country mile","reviewText":"Many people were skeptical after Sony handed the Sly Cooper franchise to Sanzaru after Sucker Punch put all of their time and energy into the Infamous franchise, but I was pretty confident after their excellent work on the Sly Cooper HD Collection, and it turns out that there was absolutely nothing to worry out. Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is on par with Sucker Punch's Sly Cooper and even surpasses it in some ways.Most of Thieves in Time focuses on Sly and his ancestors, who all play similarly to Sly with their own little mechanics that differentiate them. Some of the time is spent with Bentley and Murray, though they're certainly not the main focus here. Bentley is a lot of fun, offering good platforming mechanics and solid old school shoot 'em up mini-games for hacking. Murray, though, is certainly the weakest aspect of Thieves in Time, offering brawler, beat 'em up levels that don't really add much to the game. But honestly, Murray's bits are a very small part of the overall game, which, I might add, is an excellent platforming game that any PS3/Vita owner should play.The graphics are obviously cartoony with a comic book aesthetic, but the whole thing is very detailed with great lighting, art direction, animations, etc. It's a visual package that's entirely cohesive and charming throughout. This is one of the best looking PS3 games of its kind. It may not be as realistic as Uncharted or Heavy Rain, but its graphics are very endearing.Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a win for the PS3/Vita, as it's a great platforming game all around. Sanzaru has shown that they're clearly very skilled at making games, and all of their hard work and dedication is shown in this great game. I hope Sony lets Sanzaru work on more of their games in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2013"}

Roman","summary":"I ain't afraid of no ghosts. Shooting them over and over again, however...","reviewText":"While the third Ghostbusters movie is finally coming out in the next year or two, the Ghostbusters game here is a fine installment in the franchise, and practically feels like it is the third movie. If it weren't for a lot of ghosts/monsters from the first two movies showing up, there's enough original material here that could be transferred to film. Every Ghostbusters fan should at least rent the game just to experience the story and jokes, written by Dan and Harold, and see that the guys haven't lost their touch all these years later. I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed the story and interaction with the gang, being put into their world and fighting ghosts as a team. They did a pretty slick job of having a new character, usually just called Rookie or Trainee, be a silent protagonist so you can be in their place and sit back while the vets are in charge. So with a fantastic story and writing, the rest of the game should be a blast, right? Yes and no.Playing the game is 60/40. It's fun getting to use different attack modes with your Proton Pack. From the standard stream, to a shotgun-like energy blast, to the powerful Meson Collider, and finally the Slime Blower. Each weapon is useful, and you'll be using each of them on a regular basis, as well as their secondary attack modes. The problem though, is with keeping a steady aim. Even with the assisted targeting (which I didn't even notice was an option until I was nearly done with the game, and even then discovered it was already turned on), I always had trouble staying on a ghost with my weapons, usually the Proton gun. Not that I'd expect it to be easy to use in real life if such a thing existed, but ghosts will always fly around the environment, around objects and behind things, and you'll be needing to vent the Proton Pack so it doesn't over heat every couple of seconds. It kind of ruins the flow of the game. But when you do wear down a ghost enough for it to be caught in a trap, you feel great. Slamming that sucker against the ground until it's ready to given- very rewarding. There's also an alternate way to take out ghosts sometimes, like connecting one end of a slime strand to a trap and then the other to a ghost so it automatically sucks them in once connected. Little things like that seemed cool to me, as well as some of the funny trophies, like frying a ham in the hotel for a Bar Mitzvah.Aside from the trouble aiming (really, why isn't there some kind of auto lock-on?), my other main problem is that there isn't enough variety in the game. All you're doing here is busting ghosts and now and then you'll have to go through a series of tunnels or hallways in the dark while looking for a way to open a door. You won't be driving in the Ecto-1, and you won't be able to roam the city or anything. The game is very linear, and while I'm usually fine with that, I can't help but feel that some extra kind of single player mode would've helped. A lot of people also complain about the difficulty of the game, which at times, I can understand. Your character can only take so many hits before he's knocked down for a long period of time, unless he's revived by another Ghostbuster, and being able to see your health stats on the Proton Pack isn't done anywhere near as well as the vital readings in Dead Space. Fortunately, almost all of the multiplayer modes are fun, and here you'll be able to play as any Ghostbuster you want. It's a blast getting a whole team on one map, fending off ghosts for as long as possible. Just make sure someone has a microphone so they can let others know if someone needs help, or if something important's about to be destroyed!Finally, the soundtrack is full of familiar tunes. But I think they overdid it a bit with the original soundtrack. A few extra new tracks wouldn't have hurt. The voice acting is all perfect for the most part, but Murray seems a bit off somehow, almost like he's doing an impersonation of Peter. As for the graphics, everything in-game looks really good still in late-2010. Only when the action gets really intense is there any slowdown, and character/weapon models look terrific. The cut scenes though, is where things look weird. Watch any cut scene and tell me the Ghostbusters don't look like their bodies are too small for their heads. Even Ray looks like he's on the Victoria Beckham diet.Even with the problems I had, I did enjoy playing the game, especially online. Again, you should at least rent or borrow it if you're a fan of the movies. Had the game been a little more polished, and maybe with even one good driving segment (how about trying to get away from Stay Puft?), I would've gladly bumped the rating up a little.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001BNFQKO","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"The darkest and most serious entry in the series yet, but still fun","reviewText":"Niko Bellic is a veteran of war and ethnic strife in the Balkans. Tiring of a life of violence and brutality, he receives an invitation to move to Liberty City, where his brother Roman reports he has made a new life for himself involving fast cars and beautiful women. Moving to the States, Niko finds his brother's stories were exaggerated. He runs a cab firm and is in debt up to his eyeballs with various shady characters. Proving his usefulness in eliminating opponents, Niko finds various factions in Liberty City vying to employ his talents and his new life in a new country becomes even more violent than the one he left behind.Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008 and at the time of its release was reportedly the biggest-budgeted game of all time (a record later lost to The Old Republic) and the fastest-selling (since outstripped by Modern Warfare 2 and 3). Despite the title, it was the sixth 'main' game in the Grand Theft Auto series and the first in the series to appear on current-generation hardware, featuring massive advances in graphics over the previous games in the series. It was greeted with near-unanimous critical acclaim but fan reaction was more mixed, with criticisms over the toning down of the wackiness of the series and the reduction in game size and character customisation from the colossal San Andreas.In general terms, the game plays in an identical manner to Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City and San Andreas. Your character has the freedom to pick from one of several missions from one of several characters at a time, or can go off and do odd jobs for money or can simply chill out and explore the city. Given the leap to the next generation of hardware, it's surprising how similar the gameplay is to the previous titles in series. Of course, graphically the game is a massive leap forwards in quality and players will likely spend early parts of the game simply gawping at the sun rising over the ocean, or the monumental size of the city and its dozens of skyscrapers when seen from a helicopter. On PC, adding a graphics mod (like the mighty IceEnhancer mod, if your PC can handle it without instantly exploding) can make the game even look semi-photorealistic and absolutely jaw-dropping. Liberty City's fidelity to the real New York City is also startling: one of my NYC-based friends reported even finding his apartment building in the game, let alone faithful renditions of the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, MetLife Building, Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building.A noticeable addition to the game is a cellphone, through which your character can receive missions and call up contacts. The cellphone (which also doubles as a camera and MP3 player) is a handy addition to the gameplay and provides the game with its biggest single step forwards over previous titles in the series: the ability to interact with other characters. In previous games, you could only interact with characters in missions and cut-scenes, and had no say over how your relationship with these people developed. In GTA4, you can ring up contacts and arrange to meet them outside of missions for drinks or going to shows or playing games. This improves your relationship with these characters, and at a certain point you can call on them for resources or favours. Additional depths to these characters are also revealed in conversations that take place during these meetings. The game essentially gives you some control over how interpersonal relationships develop during the story, which is fairly remarkable for a non-RPG.Unfortunately, a potentially paradigm-shifting mechanic bogs down into a minor annoyance when, whilst clinging to the roof of a truckfull of heroin with the driver trying to shake you off to your imminent death, you get a phone call from a friend asking you to play darts with him. When you say no because you are about to die in the face, they get the huff and your reputation points with the character go down. By the late-game period, when you have more than half a dozen friends and contacts, the calls and texts begging for you to hang out with them become a constant stream of annoyance, and this results in them being ignored by most players. Fortunately they are purely optional.The meat of the game, then, is the plot and the missions, and both are well-executed. The storyline is excellent, probably the best in the entire series, and is depicted through convincing writing and strong voice acting. Niko's character development is great, as he tries to be a good person but all too easily is dragged back to a life of violence and crime. This is Rockstar's latest attempt to present a three-dimensional protagonist who is realistic and complex but must also be capable of committing whatever mayhem the player wants him to and is their best attempt yet (Vercetti in Vice City being an unredeemable villain and CJ in San Andreas being too nice, conflicting frequently with the player's lunatic actions). Other characters are also excellently developed, with Niko's brother Roman and Jamaican friend Jacob being notable. For a game with an ethnically diverse cast (the game has lots of satirical commentary on American immigration issues), however, it is disappointing that the game's only gay character of note being presented as a mincing, effeminate cliche, although his role as Niko's conscience in several missions is important.The missions are great, ranging from assassinations to massive all-out battles to car chases to helicopter duels amongst the skyscrapers of the city. Towards the end of the game (the single-player missions will take about 25 hours to complete) things start getting a tad repetitive, but generally speaking the missions are varied and fun. Combat has been given a big overhaul, with the addition of cover mechanics. However, enemy AI appears to almost be unchanged from previous games in the series, with them being worse shots than Imperial Stormtroopers, and rarely challenging. Car handling has also been made more realistic, with the cars being heavier and more difficult to stop (aside from the best sports cars). This makes the choice of which car to take on a mission far more important than previously. The game's handling of police pursuits has also been made more realistic, with it being possible to escape the police's attention by getting out of a search zone and lying low. However, it's also much easier than before, and the police are much less of a threat than in previous games.Where the game succeeds is in its depiction of a modern city riven by competing interests (corporate, government and criminal) and its portrayal of Niko as a bewildered individual caught in the middle of it all. The game is a lot of fun, if not quite as insane as the previous instalments of the series, with occasionally effective musings on the nature of violence and its eroding effect on the soul. The game is also heavily satirical, passing commentary on the USA and the issues it faces on many levels (the war on terror, corporate power, the economy, immigration, civil rights) through dialogue and also the game's numerous, entertaining radio stations (and yes, Lazlow returns to Liberty City with a new show).Overall, Grand Theft Auto IV (****) is an impressive, engrossing game. It lacks the tonal variety that the different cities and cultures of San Andreas brought to proceedings, but it has more depth of character and a stronger plot than any previous GTA game. It's also a tragedy, a rather startling choice for Rockstar and a genuine risk for them to take with one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world. Artistically, it pays off handsomely.Technical note: The PC conversion of the game has been criticised in many quarters, particularly for its performance on dual-core machines. Running the game fully patched-up on a brand-new quad-core with 8GB of RAM and a 1GB nVidia 560ti graphics card, I had exactly zero technical issues. Gamers with older PCs may encounter problems, however.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2012"}

The trailer caught me by surprise, showcasing a story that not only intrigued me, but demanded I pick up.  So, I got the game...and while it stands up to nearly everything I could have hoped for, it disappoints on some levels too.Maybe it's the PS3 version (as critics have pointed out as well), but I have encountered a slew of little, but annoying bugs in the game.  Characters are broken occasionally and sometimes I got stuck mid-move and had to restart.  This detracts from the overall gameplay because it hurts it.  I also found Monkey's moves to be somewhat sticky and not fluid (in comparison to, say, God of War 3's amazing fluidity).  Gameplay is good, but not stellar by any means and could be much approved upon.The graphics are good, although not as polished as God of War 3's or even as pretty as Lost Planet 2's.  The voice acting is seriously one of the most impressive points because it's done quite brilliantly and it's actually believable.The story is extremely interesting, which is part of what sold me in the first place.  In post-war USA, people are trying to recover in a world scattered with \"mechs\" who are trying to kill them.  I won't go too into detail so as not to spoil anyone's fun, but it's seriously intriguing.Overall, Enslaved is almost everything its hype factor promised, but a game well worth playing nonetheless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.The return of Commander Shepard.View larger.A new cast of characters.View larger.Along with familiar faces from the past.View larger.New damage and dialogue systems.View larger.Integration with original game.View larger.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.Explore the Galaxy- Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in theMass Effectuniverse.Integration with OriginalMass Effect- Players of the firstMass Effectcan import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

I would strongly recommend the following :- buy a new not a used copy especially since the new copy is currently selling at a dirt cheap price from amazon.. you have  to register the game online apparently and from what I hear if you buy a used  copy then try to register it, it becomes  a REAL pain... you also get a certain amount of free downloadable bonus game content if you buy a new copy of Mass Effect 2- get a hold of and play Mass Effect \"one\" (the original Mass Effect game) before you play this.. seriously... if you do what I did, play Mass Effect 2, fall  in love with it then get Mass Effect \"1\" ... the first game will be fun but not as much fun as it could be because  you kind of already know what's going to happen in Mass Effect 1 due to all  the references to it that come out in Mass Effect 2 when you're playing it - which to me is totally awesome how MS2 builds on MS1 that way but it makes it a \"bummer\" going backwards tooAll the positive reviews for this game are right on the money .... gorgeous graphics, a cinematic storyline that draws you into the game and gives it an emotional impact, detailed realistic  responses and interactions with the \"non player characters\" (everyone other than the character you are playing) that really give the game it's \"wow\" factor.  The publisher of the game has this shameless thing going on where you can purchase additional game content online for Mass Effect 2 .. this ticks a lot of people off who feel it should have been included with the game in the first place when you buy it and I can see how that would be annoying.. but put it this way, I like the game so much that it worked as far as making money off of me ! :P  .. I will be purchasing and downloading that additional game content when I play through Mass Effect 2 a second time, that's how much I liked the game  ..The other reason you should buy and play Mass Effect \"one\" before  Mass Effect 2 is that you can \"import\" your character from Mass Effect one into Mass Effect 2 and it affects your gameplay in Mass Effect 2.. if you run into an NPC you had dealings with in Mass Effect 1 , that NPC will react accordingly in certain situations in Mass Effect 2 based on what actions you took in Mass Effect 1 which I think is pretty darn awesome.. for this reason you should probably not uninstall Mass Effect one from your PC  until you complete Mass Effect 2 ... likewise  when you complete Mass Effect 2 and find yourself itching to play Mass Effect 3 when the price for MS3 drops to a reasonable level you probably want to leave MS2 on your PC so you can import your  MS2  character..One other note.. the game will pop up this wierd sort of menu interface type thing when you install the game before you start playing the game \"for real\".. don't ignore  that interface , it lets you adjust the video options so  your game will  match the resolution on your PC  and monitor.. if you ignore this and just exit out of it your game will look bad on your PC and I found it to be a huge pain in the butt using the video options that are available once you start playing the game to make the proper adjustments..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Steep learning curve, but a satisfying new rythm game.","reviewText":"Much to my dismay the advance copy of DJ Hero I received today is in fact a Demo Version. Meaning that the Turntable controller is wired, and I only get to play 4 out of the 93 available tracks. This means that I will not be able to provide you with a comprehensive review of the product, but I hope to at least provide some insight for those of you on the fence.I've had previous experience with the \"Hero\" version of rhythm games, most recently with World Tour. Although I've found the games oddly addicting, I've never actually ponied up the cash to own one. This may change with DJ Hero. The irony is, I much prefer rock to hip-hop/club mixes. Perhaps it's my lack of familiarity with a real turntable as opposed to a real guitar and drum set. Regardless, the Hero team has put together another installment in its extremely popular line of rhythm titles that can stand proud among the rest.The formula is the same. Customizable characters, career modes, unlockables, co-op and versus modes, etc. It's all what you've come to expect, so don't be surprised to find that this is Guitar Hero with a hip-hop/club makeover. However, if it ain't broke don't fix it. The primary difference (perhaps the ONLY difference) is the controller. The button tapping you've grown accustomed to in guitar hero is still here, but this time they're attached to a fully rotating platter that's made to look like a record. This means that not only do you have to tap, but sometimes you'll have to \"scratch\" by moving the turntable back and forth. It takes some getting used to but after a while it's second nature. The real curve ball is the mixer which includes a fader, an effects knob and a \"euphoria\" switch. the fader has three positions. Central position is much like Guitar Hero where you see three lit lines carrying colored circles towards the player. However, at times the left or right line may go off to its corresponding side. When this happens you'll need to slide the fader in the corresponding direction until the line moves back to the central position. This makes things very hectic as you're trying to keep up with the tapping and scratching. The mixer knob adds a free-style-like function at certain points that allow you to rack up easy points. The Euphoria button lights up when you've reached certain streaks at which point you can press it for double points. Do well enough and you'll have the option to rewind allowing you to redo a segment by spinning the turntable in reverse quickly.There's a steep learning curve, as this is a new level of multitasking I haven't seen in a Hero game. However, as difficult as it can be, it's a lot of fun getting everything down. The mixes (at least the ones included on the demo) are very well done, even if I'm not a huge fan of many of the song's original versions. The mixer is easy to detach from the turntable part of the controller. Once detached, you can attach it to the other side for all of you southpaws with the itch to spin. I can't attest to the battery life as the demo version I received was a wired version. Retail versions will include wireless turntable controllers. If you have a Guitar Hero guitar controller, you or your friend can team up to play co-op mode. I see a lot of potential for future integration between the games and their various peripherals. If you're already a fan of the Hero series and are looking for the next installment, this is really a no-brainer. It continues the same high quality rhythm formula found in every other Hero offering. If you've never played any of the previous installments and are looking for a challenging and addictive rhythm game, then I can say that DJ Hero is not likely to disappoint.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003IEBO9Q","description":"","reviewerName":"andrew806","summary":"BUY","reviewText":"In the extravagant world of Marvel vs. Capcom 3, there is rarely a dull moment. You and your opponent each have a team of three characters to battle it out in one frantic, continuous round accented by dazzling finishing moves and triple-digit combos. But beneath all its style, the game's core combat mechanics have been simplified and work harmoniously to drive you, and the action, forward. Locomotion plays a large role in this, even if the characters are slower than before. This change feels natural in the game's large arenas and affords you the time to plan out your next move without having to rely on blindly overwhelming your opponent. But even if you are slower, you never want to stop moving. There is safety in mobility when every character can clear the length of the arena in a single bound or pepper you with projectiles from a screen away. Stopping only makes things easier for your opponent.Movement keeps the battle flowing and changing as you duck in and out of your opponent's reach, each side frantically searching for that break in the other's defenses. Sometimes opportunity is easy to spot. Other times you have to make your own luck. In either case, when it's time to strike, the number of tools you have in your arsenal is intoxicating. You might unleash a fierce flurry of blows, summon another character to take a quick shot, or employ a snap back attack for a more favorable match-up. When on the defense, a well-timed advancing guard can punish a nasty rushdown player, while a crossover counter can rescue a teammate under fire. Regardless, after each encounter you take away a little something to add to your repertoire--be it practice with your favorite go-to combo or knowledge that a new assist isn't all that great. There's a constant sense of progression as you endlessly experiment with new tricks and new combinations.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

It truly is an amazing game. What makes this game so spectacular is the ambience it creates. Although the graphics are over 10 years old, the colors are soo vibrant, and the orchestrated score is fantastic- prolly the best of any video game ive ever played. Each portion of the castle is like an amazing  painting. It truly is a work of art. The castle is dark, creepy, and full of life. The plot is really good as well, (despite some horrid english acting that will be ridiculed untill the end of time. lol) You control Alucard, the half vampire and half human son of Dracula, as he tries to stop his father. Alucard is an awesome looking character to control and with constant upgrades to collect, it is rewarding to see him progress into a powerful force. This game laid the foundation for the excellent portable castlevanias on Nintendo systems but it still remains the best out of all of them. The ambiance, the music, the simple, but rewarding gameplay, and the colorful graphics still outdo its successors. Definitely one of the greatest games of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

However, now that I have played and beaten the game, I'm a believer.  The plot, while it may seem candy-coated at first, is pretty deep, and there are some moments where your typical Disney villans get downright spooky.  The battle system (which is real-time) is pretty interesting, though it mostly lends itself to hack-n-slash rather than allowing you to do summons or cast spells very often (I think I summoned someone all of two times throughout the entire game).  Also, the camera angles and camera controls really could use some work.  There were a couple of boss battles where the poor camera cost me Sora's life.There are plenty of minigames and optional bosses to keep you busy, but once you've done everything (most of which is pretty obvious on your first go through), this game doesn't have much replay value.

It's very fun and the missions can be played when you have a few minutes free or sevearl hours to waste.  Non of the reviews really mentioned how challenging this game is.  If you don't have patients or not willing to spend an hour or more on one mission dying over and over again, you might find this game frustrating.  The High Value Targets and some Elite missions are tough.  Mainly since they don't have any check points.  Overall I'd rate this game a 8/10.

Before I go into the review, let me talk about my setup: XBox 360, HDML, Optical Audio to a 2.1 sound bar speaker system, and I have an Epiphone Les Paul Junior.[Good]This game really teaches you how to play with a REAL guitar.  From simple techniques, to really complicated ones.I really like the coordination exercises related to a song. I really helps you learn.It helps you become familiar with how to tune a guitar, and the system that they have is just nice, easy, and quick.To my knowledge, it works with all standard electric guitars.Good song selection.Cool guitar practice video games: They have a good arcade game for just pure practice.UPDATE: FREE DLC[Bad]Can't hear the guitar playing: With my setup my friends and I can barely even hear the guitar playing except during the loading sequences. I've even experimented with most of the sound options, turning down everything else (music, crowd, and voice) to like 20-30% while keeping guitar volume to 100%. I've even messed with the controls on the guitar. This kills a lot of the fun, and I really hope they fix this in a software update. UPDATE: As of the latest update, this issue is now fixed and it sounds great.Not enough sound configuration options: On a related note, you can't control how loud the menu or the narrator voice sounds. In order to hear my guitar playing during an actual game, I have to turn the sound up really high, so what happens is that the menu and the voice are just booming. There are just way too few general sound options for a game of this kind and it needs to be fixed. UPDATE: As of the latest update, this doesn't matter anymore. I can hear myself play now over the music.As of today, new songs and DLC are just way too expensive. Hopefully this will also change. Then again, I can barely play right now so it will take me a long time to get to new songs. UPDATE: To my knowledge they have added a lot of FREE DLC. This is a good counter balance. I don't mind paying for bundles either.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}

You'll race as a big rig barreling through mud and competition alike or as an ATV carefully maneuvering in between obstacles, or how about as a rally car blasting along at high speed, or even a motorcycle where it's necessary to avoid other vehicles and mud and instead sticking to cliff ledges and jumps. The unique aspect to MotorStorm is that it mixes all of these elements together and it works. The game is challenging but rewarding. You'll learn different terrain features of tracks and learn where to use those features to the advantage of the vehicle you are using.Mud, cliffs, and jumps are all important features in this game. Lightweight vehicles are fast but fragile and don't perform well in mud. Heavy vehicles are slow and more difficult to maneuver but can slam through the lighter vehicles and breeze through muddy obstacles.The graphics are breath taking and will make you gasp on when you are on the cusp of going over the edge crashing down to a valley bellow. The tracks feature deforming terrain that will become more and more challenging to traverse as you race. Tracks will also increase in challenge featuring everything from sheer cliffs to jumps and fast straightaways.MotorStorm also features one of the best soundtracks I have heard for a racing game. Featuring bands like Glucifer, Wolfmother and Queens of the Stone Age, the music fits the game perfectly and ramps up as the racing gets extreme.Online play features a thriving community even after being on the market for so long.

A secret war has begun - between shadowy corporations bent on world domination. Joanna Dark and her father Jack are caught up in the fight for the future of the planet. A routine bounty hunting mission rips open a global conspiracy that will change Joanna's destiny - forever.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Locked and loaded","reviewText":"The week of the Xbox 360 launch, I would have been terrified if I were in the shoes of a Rare developer. Their game, Perfect Dark Zero, was largely viewed as the spearhead game for the launch. Therefore it was subject to more expectations, more criticism,and more potential disappointment than any other game on the console. Not to mention, Rare has been frowned upon for a weak Xbox showing after being bought by Microsoft for a little short of $400 million. After completing the single-player campaign andspending hours on Xbox Live fragging both humans and bots, I'll start clapping now for the once-thriving British developer. Perfect Dark Zero takes a hopeful look, locks, loads, fires, and delivers a blow as the best Xbox 360 launch game and one of the prime shooters of the year.The story, which feels surprisingly tacked-on to an otherwise solid single-player experience, outlines the bounty hunter life of Joanna and Jack Dark. The Dark pair is tracking down the actions of Zhang Li, the CEO of the dataDyne Corporation, whichis hell-bent on uncovering and using a secret artifact found in South America. Along the way, Joanna is sent to chilly mountains of China, steamy jungles in Peru, and an underwater facility in the Pacific Ocean. Perfect Dark Zero begins as stealth-basedbut turns into an all-out hunt at the end of its story. The ending had me rolling my eyes and shaking my head, but by then the story had already rendered me uninterested. It was fun to learn why Joanna affiliates herself with the Carrington Instituteand pursues the dataDyne Coproration before the events of Perfect Dark, but the story just doesn't make par with today's standards.Despite the ridiculous ending Perfect Dark Zero does a fantastic job presenting and fulfilling each of its thirteen missions. There is a bit of variation from simply killing the artificially unintelligent enemies. Whether you're finding an importantobject inside a briefcase in the Sewer Retrieval level, sneaking into Zhang Li's mansion in the Mansion Infiltration level, or monitoring guards in the Nightclub Stakeout level, there is a lot to do and each mission plays differently. Each one is between five and twenty minutes long, making the single-player experience disappointingly short. Still, with four difficulty levels (including the Dark Agent setting that is quite excruciating) and more objectives for each setting, Perfect Dark Zero doesn'toffer a lot. What it does offer you can play with in a few different ways. There are multiple paths through each mission, and using the four different in-game gadgets (like the lock-picking 'locktopus' and the explosive demolition kit), as well as the weapons, opens up a lot more variety in each level.What I always loved about the Nintendo 64 classic was its staggering number of guns and gadgets to use. Perfect Dark Zero returns with another huge offering. Each of the 20+ tools has more than one use, making for almost fifty different ways to killenemies or complete objectives. For example, the high rate of fire and decent stopping power of the RCP-90 submachine gun is accompanied by a thermal vision that allows you to differentiate between friends and foes by outlining each in different colors.The tons-O'-fun rocket launcher is even more explosive with the guided-by-wire rocket mode that allows you to direct and explode a rocket on your own free will. The KSI-74 (which is decidedly just a fancy AK-47) is deadly at medium range withits regular bullets but for when the going gets tough and up-close, you can always shoot the attached bayonet at enemies. The return of the powerful, accurate Laptop Gun is my favorite, especially in multiplayer--when I wasn't unloading on enemies, I could always throw the weapon down as a self-activated, defensive sentry gun. It's this weapon variation that makes every experience different, and I certainly enjoyed the guns in this game more than in Halo 2 and other shooters.While the single-player might be lacking in length, the multiplayer allows gamers to increase game time exponentially. Both on and offline, there are two different types of multiplayer modes--Deathmatch and Dark Ops. Deathmatch is quite simply a deathmatch mode. There are a few types of play, like the free-for-all KillCount and a team-based version, Team KillCount. Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains round out the rest of Deathmatch. CTF and Territorial Gains are almost the exact same thing you've played in other shooters, and Territorial Gains is blatantly similar to Halo 2's territories mode. Deathmatch modes are much quicker and are aimed at the less hardcore crowd. Most of my Xbox Live time was spent here, as I appreciated being able to pick up the controller, play a few rounds, and turn the game off without getting too involved.On the other hand is Dark Ops. This mode features four more gametypes, each operating in tactical rounds rather than all-out battle. Eradication is an elimination-style mode where players are removed from the match after being killed and the team with the last surviving player wins. I didn't like this mode, as it invites a slow pace and too much hiding. Onslaught, which has teams defending a base against constantly respawning enemies, is the second Dark Ops type.  This is much more intense and exciting than Eradication. Third is Infection, which is similar to the popular custom-made game \"Zombies\" or \"Resident Evil\". There is a team of \"infected\" players and \"uninfected\" players. The uninfected players try to fend off the infected, but become infected themselves if they're killed. By the end of the match, infected and uninfected points are tallied and the team with the most points wins. It's fun, it's simple, and it's exciting like it was on Halo 2. Last of all is Sabotage, where teams try to destroy as much property and kill each other as many times as possible and the team with the most demolition wins.As if these match-based modes weren't enough, it's possible to go through every single level from the single-player campaign in cooperative play. The levels are actually a little different in this mode, as switches must be activated at the same time and players can strategize to take out enemies without losing as much health. Some of the weapon functions, like the Falcon pistol's Firecracker distraction, come in handy in cooperative play more than they ever do in single-player. I like that it's possible to play cooperatively. Even though PDZ's missions aren't as epic as those found in Halo, the fact that cooperative play is available is a sign that Rare worked hard to incorporate a lot for gamers to play in the game.Huge, wide-open levels, beautiful textures, and detailed character models are only a few visual feats under PDZ's belt. Details like particle effects, blood spray, muzzle flash, bullet shells, and vision blur are so perfectly done in this game that even without a high-definition television set, you're getting a visual treat. I got a chance to play this game in high-def and I can't even believe how amazing it looks. Surrounding the crisp, clear look is a futuristic art style that fits so well in each of the 13 levels. From the neon-lit port in the Nightclub Stakeout to the huge, open canyon in Bridge Assault, every single level looks fantastic. The physics system is a little buggy when a corpse falls and starts to twitch but that is the only visual complaint I can find to mention here. The music serves as a perfect way to set the pace of the action going on. I don't remember music being so great in a first-person shooter since, well, Halo. The low-key, moody stuff found in the slow, stealthy missions gives you a chance to listen for enemy chatter and footsteps. The electronica-rock that tears out of the speakers when the action gets rough will have your blood pumping hard while you're shredding enemies with your Laptop Gun. If it weren't for the annoying voices of Joanna Dark and a few other characters found in the game, as well as some laughable dialogue, I'd say that PDZ is a sonically flawless title.The only warning I must give my fellow gamers is that Perfect Dark Zero, despite being looked at as the \"Halo 2 of the Xbox 360\", isn't this at all. Perfect Dark Zero isn't a revolutionary shooter. It can be easily argued that the single-player missions are a joke and the multiplayer is unimpressive. I simply can't agree with that, but it's important to remember that Perfect Dark Zero is PDZ, not Halo 2. Perfect Dark Zero is a great shooter on its own right but it isn't a game that will redefine first-person shooters and it isn't a game that will redefine the Xbox 360. As a launch title, it's a huge success. As an anticipated launch title, it's simply a success. As a title that some people will instantly compare to Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, it's a disappointment. If you took one of these three routes, I hope you took one of the first two and you check out Perfect Dark Zero. At this point, it's my favorite Xbox 360 title and it is one of the strongest launch games of all time next to the Nintendo 64's Super Mario 64, the Xbox's Halo, and the Dreamcast's NFL 2K. Play this game because it's a great shooter. Play this game because it's got a lot to offer on Xbox Live. Play this game because it's one of the most impressive visual and audio packages of the entire year. But whatever you do, don't play this game because you think it's Halo 3.[...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"Great Handheld","reviewText":"The DS has always been my favorite handheld system. The amount of fun games along with the dual screen innovation and touch controls made it one of the great systems of our time. Now, Nintendo has successor to this great system called the 3DS. The 3DS has revolutionized this already-great system and is a great addition to your gaming systems.1. HardwareThe reason the 3DS is called the 3DS, of course, is because of the new 3D effect. Nintendo has revolutionize 3D and has made it possible to see it without 3D glasses. This feature is both cool and somewhat dangerous. if you're 8 years old or under, you shouldn't use it at all. Otherwise, using it for two hours can still cause eye damage. This, however, can be avoided by turning it off. Of course, as cool as the 3D effect is, it's not exactly a down point that you can't use it too long. If you're shopping for a child, the better idea might be to get him/her a 2DS, which is the same thing without the 3D.Another new feature is the slide panel. Now if you're playing a behind-the-back game, you can move around with ease instead of having to use the directional pad. Also, there are new features such as StreetPass and Miiverse (which originated from the Wii U) that also add to the system's features.Otherwise, the hardware is very similar to that of the original DS. There are two screens and touch controls on the bottom screen. It also takes some of the features of the DSi. However, unlike the DSi, the 3DS has multiple great games to go with these features.2. GraphicsOne of the improvements on the 3DS is its graphics. The actual graphics are as good as that of a PS2 or Xbox, which is very cool for a handheld. Games like Kingdom Hearts 3D or Kid Icarus Uprising that look great and really show what this system can do. These games actually look better with the 3D effect. The effect adds a certain amount of depth that no other systems have. However, you have to be okay with it hurting your eyes the first few times.3. PowerLike the graphics, the 3DS has the capabilities of a sixth generation console. Once again, despite this being a lot smaller than the current consoles, this is very impressive for a handheld system. Whereas the DS could only handle the power of games such as Phantom Hourglass or Spirit Tracks, the 3DS can fit the entire Ocarina of Time game.4. GamesThe 3DS, though its launch was a little slow, has a great selection of games. Some of the games I previously mentioned, Kingdom Hearts 3D, Kid Icarus Uprising, and Ocarina of Time 3D, are very good games, and are some of my favorites. Other great games include Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf.The VerdictAs much as I loved the DS, I like the 3DS a lot more. I really like the improvements and the games you can get on this system. I really think that this is the best handheld out there, and I would recommend this to any gamer on the go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

Highly under appreciated","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing graphics, art style, and soundtrack, smooth tight controls, all your parkour moves are here, decent storyThe Bad: Extremely short, combat is a bit cumbersome, time trials can be almost impossible to master, steep learning curve for controls, can we say Portal rip offs?For one, I rarely buy games like this on day one without knowing that I'll at least want to play it 2 or 3 times and Mirror's Edge was a great buy, but I wish I would have waited for a price drop first. Now don't get me wrong go spend $60 on this and you'll have one hell of a time, but for the length and content ME cuts it a bit short. ME is a parkour/free running/building jumping/limber skinny people running around like monkeys on roof tops game and is very well executed.The first thing I'd like to mention is the warming soundtrack EA created for this game. EA has finally listened to the fans and got rid of the horrible EA Trax; a bunch of wannabe punk and metal bands mixed with lame hip hop and R&B; that everyone with half a brain and decency turns off. EA's new IPs (Dead Space and ME) have an original rich sound track that fits the game very well. ME has a slow soothing OST with lots of low bass and some poppy techno thrown in. The game's main theme by Lisa Miskovsy (ironically titled \"Still Alive\") is a charming song that really gets the feeling of the game across: A woman, and message deliverer for the resistance, named Faith who's sister was framed for murder and she must find the killer of the person her sister, Kate, was framed for and must bring all of this to an end. In a rebuilt city corrupt and full of backstabbers Faith must scour the rooftops to find entrances into buildings to find her targets.Scouring these rooftops is both fun and beautiful thanks to the game's amazing graphics. EA's next-gen engine (used and updated from skate.) makes ME one of the best looking games ever made. Everything is highly detailed with buildings as far as the eye can see, reflections off of windows and everything is just highly detailed. The game looks similar to Portal (hmmm...just mere coincidences here?) with lots of HDR lighting and lots of blinding whites, blues, reds, and oranges. The art style really helps the game's feel and works brilliantly. The cut scenes however are a bit different and detract from the feel of the game with cell shading similar to those eSurance commercials (with that hot pink haired eSurance chick that has tons of porn available everywhere). While this style works it really is a detraction from the actual game. The voice acting is really good here, and the characters are decent except Faith is the only character you get attached to thanks to the game's absurdly short length (6-8 hours depending on how you play).Now back to how the game plays, it plays well and feels well with a few flaws. The game's control scheme has it's plate full with lots of different button combos that take a little while to get used to let alone master. You have all of the parkour moves available to you such as building jumping, wall running, pole swinging, zip lines, three step jumps (LB, RB, LB), wall climbing, shimmying etc. Additionally you can make runs faster by pulling your legs up instead of double stepping jumps or hopping over rails. This makes time trials go faster and keeps your speed up. Finding your way in ME is fairly simple since you have \"Runner's Vision\" which makes certain items turn red and you use them according to what they are. Boards leading off buildings usually means to jump down, small objects in front of a larger object means you double step your jump and vault to a ledge, you can crawl in vents, and a lot of time you must climb poles attached to walls and even jump to them! The game is fast and is very smooth, and you don't have to afraid of sluggish controls. The whole game is responsive and reacts on your command.The biggest flaw in the game however is the combat. Most of the enemies have guns and you don't...this always proves a problem. Most of the time you just run away but when you're forced to fight you must take on 5+ enemies in one room using melee combat, jumping kicks, sliding kicks to the nuts etc. The combat itself works well, but actually using it against enemies with machine guns, shotguns etc. doesn't work out too well. Try taking down 5 guys in one room with shotguns just with your fists...not too easy. This requires disarming (timing is a must of course) and either using their guns against other enemies in classic FPS action or just being very fast and outsmarting the enemy with kicks off of walls and all that. While the combat is manageable it's flawed and makes up most of the trial and error in the game. The game has little trial and error outside combat since most of the deaths are on the player. Try finding out where to go, without runner's vision, while 10 guys are shooting at you; that can be very tough to do and some spots I had to try 20+ times just to get it all right.With that flaw aside ME proves to be an amazing game and should be played by all FPS fans, parkour fans, or just action adventure game fans (PoP fans can come out of hiding now!) With ME's wonderful soundtrack, graphics, art style, story, and game play you will stay busy with the time trials and speed runs. I hope ME2 improves upon all of this and I will be there when it comes out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

When displayed on my TV,  The rght portion of my screen is partially cut off...I can't really see how many stars I have and sometimes it's a tiny bit of a challenge telling what weapons are being used or how many bullets you have left.- ducking the cops: Ok....this is a mixed bag of a new innovation. While I do like the idea of any trouble you start brings up a proximinty circle of where the cops will come to the scene of a crime, sometimes it's far too easy to get away, even when you have done something that warrants the SWAT team to come in. Even still if after you lose them and come back in almost immediately after the circle disappears, there is no particular reason for the cops to continually be on the lookout for you....maybe I am nitpicking but at least in other iterations, when you have set off every possible alarm, it was nearly impossible to shake the cops and made getting away very harrowing....because once you got up to 5 and 6 stars the cops were very persistant....but then...with as apathetic as cops really are, this may be real...LOL.- Speaking of, no real reprecussions and consequences for actions in some cases: One thing I think I would like to have seen more of is, if you do something, the is a bit more of a reaction for the crowd. For instance, I was at a club and some bouncers tried to jump me, I went to town with my shotgun...maybe 2 or 3 people moved. With the way that the AI was hyped in this game, I was hoping more for a stampede for the doors and maybe a 911 call.  Same with being out on the street, I robbed and shot someone in broad day light....now while a few people ran, most still carried on thier business and not one frantic call to 911...but again...this may be  sad testimony to what kind of empathy to people...LOL. The only time you do have to worry is if the cops are in proximity to the crime being committed.And that pretty much are my only issues with the game...as far as everything else well:I am very impressed with the storyline and voice acting. This has always been a very top notch standard with Rockstar and GTA games. I also like the fact that if you are with characters during missions, the dialogue doesn't just happen in the cutscenes, it also flows with you and the NPCs as you travel. For instance, you find out more about what Roman has gotten himself into, Michelle asks about your stay in America, Little Jacob, if you can understand his heavily West Indian accent explains why he needs someone he can trust to do his errands and so forth, so count on interactions like that throughout the game beyond cutscenes not to mention most missions do seem to run a little differently and sometimes have added twistsI was also graphically and aurally with the environment. The game really pushes the 360's power! No matter what GTA you have ever played it has always looked kinda sterile despite the grittiness. In this iteration, all you need is smells, good and bad. When you are nicer lookng neighborhoods, you can really tell...when you are in bad areas...ditto.And aurally, with all the ambient noices...second only to Assassin's Creed (despite all the shortcomings of the game, really listen to the background chatter!) in quality to make you almost feel like you are 'there'.Everything else that IGN touched on as far as getting around, getting missions and so forth is on point.The control, once you get the hang of it is fairly decent. The fight controls could have been a bit tighter, but it works. The cover system is actually pretty nice and an added improvement to the game.Now while I did talk a bit down about the AI, let me tell you how it is when it really does work. You can sometimes go along and see some really random occurances in a course of the day.There is more traffic on the street at 2pm than there is at 2am and this is still depending on what part of town you are in.  I saw a random instance in which a cop chased down a thief and held him at gunpoint. I saw people use thier cell phones. I saw where early in the morning you see people out sweeping the sidewalk. I alos noticed that late at night you see more garbage trucks...but what was most priceless was a womon walking along sipping a soda...walks PAST a trashcan...and drops the cup in the street....yes...she litters!!Yes, there are so many little nuances in this game that can be picked up on and so much randomness going on that it does make it seem 'alive' but you still kind of wish for more but.....that's not what the whole game is about.As far as multiplayer, it's a lot smoother than I thought it was going to be, I really haven't had a chance to delve estensively into it as of yet but I played around in a set up with 10 people and noticed no lag whatsoever...it's smooth like butter.What I will say, and this is one of the reasons why I am not big on doing multiplayers with a whole lot of strangers, is that the kids and the knuckleheads that have gotten this game will abuse the language more than what it needs to be abused. If you got sensitive ears...just be prepared..otherwise I recommend that you find a group of friends and set up your own private match and play.All in all, GTA IV is the must play game of the year, I can't fully endorse the 10 unless you count the story and all the random mini games but, so far the game is so tight , that I do believe that Saint's Row II will have it's work cut out for it.SO pick it up, go bowling, make sure you watch TV, and listen out for Jack Thompson's being a stripper reference!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2008"}

I'd already played Baldur's Gate, and I'd felt that the AD&amp;D Universe wasn't really for me. So I was pleasantly surprised by  Planetscape:Torment.Planetscape has improved markedly over its  predecessor. The most obvious difference is in its User Interface. You can  access items, inventory and spells using the main interface. In battle, you  can access each character's spells or items by right-clicking each  character. In Baldur's Gate, a characters spells and items were displayed  on the bottom window, which restricted your view. There's no such problem  here.Another difference is in the graphics. Planetscape still uses the  Infinity Engine (ala' Baldur's Gate), but the graphics are much smoother  than its predecessor. Characters are much larger, and some even perform  actions when they are idle. For instance, Morte (the first person to join  your group) juggles his eyeballs when he's bored.The main attractions in  Planetscape are, I feel, the most important elements of any game -  characterisation and storyline. The characters are NOT your ordinary  AD&amp;D fighters and mages. For example, we have Morte, a floating skull  that uses his teeth as an attack weapon. Then there is Dakkon, who carries  what appears to be a lightsaber as his weapon. He is also a mage, which  means he can cast some impressive spells. Then there is Nordom (who you can  find if you embark on an extremely difficult quest) who is a robot carrying  crossbows. And Ignus, a chaotic mage made entirely of flame.The  storyline is also intriguing. Imagine playing a character who CANNOT be  killed, who is extremely powerful but has lost all memory of his abilities.  The Nameless One is probably the most mysterious character to ever be  created in a computer game - and his story ranks as one of the best ever  told.There are only two minor, niggling, flaws in this game. The first  is the failure to display graphics any higher than a 640x480 resolution.  Having the ability to display a much higher resolution would allow more of  the buildings to be seen. This would make the map easier to navigate. The  other flaw is the failure to implement Aureal 2.0 support (Baldur's Gate  had the same problem). Anyone with a Sound Blaster Live! should be able to  enjoy EAX support however, so all is not lost.In summary, if anyone is  interested in exploring the AD&amp;D universe, I strongly recommend you  start with Planetscape: Torment. The game is much easier for first-timers  (like myself) to play, and less frustrating as well. Planetscape is not a  violent game, instead, its emphasis is on problem solving, not dungeon  hacking. Many situations can be solved through talking with characters, not  bludgeoning them to death. I sincerely hope that more games like this are  produced.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2000"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"As usual there's good (at the start) and bad (at the end and then some)","reviewText":"For background, I've been playing Bioware RPG's ever since Baldur's Gate I and II on the PC. I have loved a lot of games with the Bioware label except for Knights of the Old Republic II and Dragon Age II.[Good]Combat: The FPS portion has gotten better again. It's even closer stuff like Gears of War now, which is a good thing.Past Consequences: Almost everything you've done in the past 2 games has consequences in Mass Effect 3 beyond just getting a stupid email. For example a certain government official will be assassinated unless you saved at least one of two characters in the past games. There are a lot more examples. I'm glad they listened on this point. Playing the past 2 Mass Effects has value. I don't know of any other game series that does this. This is a great achievement. (More on this in the 'Bad' section.)On a related note, if you bought the DLC that replaces Mass Effect 1, you're still missing out. That DLC only accounts for major decisions. This only sucks if you're a PS3 owner.Inventory: They basically made inventory management way better without throwing it out like they did in Mass Effect 2.Story: As everyone else has already said, the game's story up until the end is both interesting and engaging with a lot of cameos from past decisions as well a good variety. More on this in the 'Bad' section.Loading time: One of the major reasons they changed the layout of the Citadel and the Normandy is to make loading faster. Compared to the first and even 2nd Mass Effect, loading times are just awesome. It is just great.Replay-ability: Not even counting the so so multiplayer add-on, this game makes the entire Mass Effect series re-playable. A lot of decisions you've made in the games, even from the 1st one matter, and they make subtle changes to the story. There are so many changes and variants, that I don't feel a single player can hit all of them on even 10 complete play throughs. More on this in the 'Bad' section.Bugs: For 360, this game is nearly bug free compared to other releases like Fallout games. More on this in the bad section.[Bad]Past Consequences (or lack of): There are few major decisions that didn't seem to have an effect on Mass Effect 3's world. Whoever you chose as the human representative for the Citadel council will probably not reflect who that person is in Mass Effect 3 (unless you were a Renegade in Mass Effect 1). It's a minor annoyance, but I think most people can get over it. My guess for this is because there wasn't a Mass Effect 1 for PS3 and it would add cost to making the game as well as story complexity. Also depending on who you ultimately chose as a love interest, you may or may not feel cheated (Hint: if it's not a main character in Mass Effect 3, you're probably not going to be happy once you see what they did for the main characters.)--- SPOILER START ---Regardless with how you feel about Cerberus from Mass Effect 2, you'll be fighting them in Mass Effect 3 which is a little stupid to me especially if you play as a Renegade. As a Renegade, everything Cerberus does makes total sense. Of course, I realize that everyone has budget. It would be nice to see DLC that lets you side with Cerberus. I will pay as much as what Rockstar charged for their GTA: IV DLC, maybe even more to see this happen.--- SPOILER END ---Conversations: I really hated the conversations with Kasumi and Zaeed in Mass Effect 2 where they never entered a conversation cut scene. They added even more of these in Mass Effect 3. It's just horrible. In a lot of cases this involves picking up new missions. So instead of talking to people, Shepard just eavesdrops on conversations like a weirdo creeper to acquire a minor mission. This is one of the most stupid decisions made that just cheapens the game.Story: Yes this is about the ending. What people like Mass Effect 3's director, Casey Hudson, and head writer, Mac Walters, have chosen to forget is that Mass Effect is not a movie or an art house game like Braid. Mass Effect is a world that gives mainstream players choices that greatly affect that world. No one beside Ebert cares about metaphor and symbolism in a game that has the feel of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Bioware is not Rockstar Games, and changing direction was just stupid. Without any spoilers, the ending essentially gives you several bad variants of the same choice which doesn't seem to be based on anything you've done so far. The explanation doesn't even make any sense unless you bend the words. To add insult to injury, they just show the same cinematic albeit in different colored explosions. The worse part is that the endings greatly change the universe of Mass Effect. They don't even give you a summary conclusion like Fallout New Vegas or Bioware's Baldur's Gate series. They would have gotten away with a few paragraphs of a narrated post conclusion summary before. Now they're going to have to come up with something way better to placate a lot of angry people. I would say the only people who are NOT either annoyed or disappointed with the ending are people who just picked up the Mass Effect series at its 3rd installment, and people who have some personal or professional connection to the developers and EA for obvious reasons.--- SPOILER START ---In my opinion, I don't understand why one of the last choices is essentially what Cerberus was fighting for. Why not join them from the beginning then, instead of fighting them at every turn? It's just bad writing. There really should only be two choices.Also as per the Reaper god child's explanation for why they wipe out civilizations, it only makes sense IF the Reapers were the original creators of advanced organic life, since \"the created will always eventually rebel against their creators\". Other than that it's stupid. \"Robots will always eventually rebel against and exterminate their their slave master organic creators, so to keep this from happening, we (the older more powerful robots) will wipe out their slave master organic creators for them.\" This is just retarded.--- SPOILER END ---My guess as to why the ending sucked is because they chose to work on an included multiplayer game instead, and they just ran out of both time, money, and disc space. I'm pretty sure that they were dead set on keeping it limited to two DVDs max. According to rumor, this was something that the head director and head writer came up by themselves without any input what so ever from the rest of the writing team. My guess is that since they missed the last xmas deadline and they were already way over budget, they just came up with this crap to get the game to release. This game would have been better if they kept developing it for a fall 2012 release.I've heard apologists from various game publications complain about Mass Effect fans' sense of entitlement. I'll tell you why Mass Effect fans should feel entitled. Not only have they spent 100's of hours through all 3 games, but they have also spent approximately $100 for each of the past 2 games + DLC. That's about $200 for the past two Mass Effects and DLC + $70 for the third Mass Effect and DLC. This is why people feel both entitled and angry.Nickel and Dime'ing: I don't feel that anyone should have been charged for day one DLC when it's pretty apparently that it was originally slated to have been part of the game. (Just charge more upfront at the very least.) I also don't feel that customers should be charged for a DLC to fix the ending. That being said, it'll probably be like Mass Effect 2 where eventually there will be $50 or more worth of new DLC (excluding the weapon and item packs). It's not our fault someone decided to lose focus on the single player campaign for a so so multiplayer component. That being said, as in previous installments, Mass Effect 3 is only a complete game when you buy all the DLC.Bugs: Some missions are buggy and they can't be completed. However, the game is relatively bug free compared to Fallout New Vegas or even Fallout 3. Mass Effect 3 is very playable. It is still annoying not being able to complete some missions though.Replay-ability: The ending kills replay-ability. It makes people ask 'what's the point?'[Misc]Multiplayer is decent, but I don't think it's as good as the Gears of War series. They should have spent more money and time on the single player experience. I strongly feel this is the real reason that the single player game suffered, including its storyline. The multiplayer component should not have been included with the main game. It should have been sold and shipped separately. The writers were probably forced to work around this issue, hence the crappy ending. EA rushed Mass Effect 3 team. You would think they would learn after Dragon Age 2. Of course I know why they put in multiplayer. They wanted to discourage both used game sales as well as pirating.[Conclusion]If you can wait, I would wait until this game drops to $40 and bug fixes and story fixing DLC is released. Ideally, I'd just wait until all the DLC is released and the game drops to $30 (You'll still be spending close to $80 at that point but you won't be frustrated).Since Bioware the company and studio are both defunct, and the name just represents a sticker (or using EA's speak, a label) that any EA studio can tack onto their games, this is probably the last game with the Bioware sticker that I'll be buying. I'm just glad that they didn't completely 'Dragon Age 2'd (or more accurately 'EA'd) the Mass Effect series... yet. I don't feel that any of this stuff would be happening if Bioware's founders didn't sell out to EA or another big publisher like Ubisoft or Activision. I don't blame them though, the money was probably pretty good. I just hope once the gold handcuffs are off that the Bioware founders and other former Bioware members jump ship and form a new studio that doesn't have to cater to public quarterly earnings pressures.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

We've gone through three defective units. Quality control is sorely lacking.On Black Friday 2013, we stood in the cold, late night, and waited for our turn to pick out a new console. We picked up a Xbox One along with a few games and extras. Since we were so tired when we got home, we waited until the next day to set everything up. We set it up, and everything seemed to work fine. The updates and other installs took ages, but they finally finished, and it was time to dive into a game.We played Dead Rising 3 for a few hours and then it was time for bed. We put the Xbox One into standby mode. The next afternoon, it was time for more gaming. But to our surprise, we pushed the power button and nothing happened. The Xbox just stared blankly back at us. No lights on the console or the power supply. We did some research and tried some of the ideas. We tried to unplug and plug back in. Nothing. We noticed that when we plugged it in, the power supply light would come on orange, then flicker white, and then go off completely. We plugged the power supply in without being attached to the Xbox One, and the light would stay orange, but then when we plugged it into the Xbox One, the light would flicker white and then go out again. There was very little insight into this issue. All research pointed toward the power supply. Even a quick chat with Microsoft noted the same.Rather than go through any return process with Microsoft, we packed it up and headed to the store the next day. This made sense because it was definitely within the return period. The guys at the store checked things out and got the same results, apologized, and offered an exchange.We agreed to the exchange and headed home with a nice, shiny, new system. We immediately plugged it in knowing that updates take a while. Well, another surprise... no video. No video would show on the screen at all. No green loading screen with the pretty Xbox logo. Nothing. We tried the \"unplug, wait, and plug back in\" tricks. Tried different cables. Tried a different TV. Tried a different power outlet. Nothing! The Xbox One powered up, but no video. After self-troubleshooting, we didn't even think of calling Microsoft, we just packed it up and headed back to the store.Again, the guys there checked out the unit, got the same symptoms, and found no resolution. Again, they apologized and offered an exchange (although they didn't have any more at the moment). At that point, we figured that it just wasn't meant to be. We'd spent our money in good faith and received nothing but headaches. So we instead asked for a refund. We were given a hard time since the store didn't normally accept opened hardware for refund, but after some begging, they made it happen. However, we only got partial refund for the game and a controller that had been opened, so we were out a bit of the money. We were more upset about the wasted time and emotions.We agreed to hold off a few months in hopes that Microsoft could work out the kinks. Then came the Titanfall Bundle. We wanted it, and we were willing to test the waters again. We purchased the Titanfall Bundle, took it home, and unboxed it. We were extra careful - even more so than usual - with everything. We powered it up with our fingers crossed, and it worked! We were off to a good start. The updates trickled down, and Titanfall downloaded.Then... Titanfall started. And our happiness turned to sadness - again! The fans spun up, and the console sounded like it was chopping up peanuts. It sounded like an RC plane propeller. Nothing went near the Xbox One between the time everything was installing and Titanfall loaded. We looked inside the console grooves with a flashlight, and everything looked in order, but visibility is limited. The fan grew more and more angry, so we powered down and tried to bring it back up. The same fan noise presented itself.That was it. We were done. Xbox One lost us - whether they care or not.Collectively, we've owned almost every game system there is. We like to try the latest and greatest. And we don't mind jumping in and trying them upon release. With that said, we've never been through such headaches repeatedly with a product. Fool me once... Fool me twice... Well, three times makes us the fool.We do think the Xbox One has potential, and the game line up is tempting, but the hardware quality assurance is way too flawed at this point. A few folks we hear from say they have no issues. Well, we've had three with showstopper issues. 2 that made the system useless, and 1 that scared the dogs and woke us from REM sleep.While we would like to tell a different story here, we can't. We can't tell you how great the system looks, feels, and behaves. We can't tell you how great the GUI looks. We can't tell you how amazing the games are. We can't tell you how comfortable the controllers are. We can just tell you to stay away from the Xbox One. Avoid it.

So obviosly I had High expectations for this game, and for the most part it delivered.It seems that Vietnam has replced WWII as the premeir war setting for a video game, and I think Battlefield Vietnam was the game that started it. The gameplay hasnt really changed except for the helicopters, which is you cant fly with the mouse, is impossible to pilot.

For one, the maps can be large, verry large, and if you are playing online, people dont give rides often. Also the weapons are kinda unbalanced(which is changed in a lator patch). But most of all, its a *System Hog*. Basically, if you dont have the cutting edge comp, you cant run it with the graphics on high. I have them on medium.Overall, if you liked BF42, you will like BFV.

{"product_name":"B00000K2R4","description":"The Dreamcast system is, in a word, awesome. Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Gil","summary":"Blown away!","reviewText":"I recently acquired a Dreamcast, and what a system! I can't believe SEGA pulled the plug on this marvel. I at one time doubted the capabilities of this system until I gave it a try myself. The graphics, while not important to me, rival those of GC or PS2. I almost broke down and purchased one of the \"big 3\", but decided to save my money and go with the DC. I'm not breaking my neck to get an XBOX or Cube, not while I'm having fun with this system.As for games, you have tons to choose from, and no one is left out. Jet Grind Radio, Shemue, Crazy Taxi, Quake III, and I can go on and on. Most games are in the (...) range, so you can get a nice selection of games for what you would pay for one XBOX or Ps2. The controller, while it is big, is easy to use.So if you don't have the money to drop on a \"next-gen\" system, get yourself a Dreamcast while they are still available.You don't have to be left out of the gaming party due to low funds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004UG9B","description":"The World Is Not Enoughis the highly anticipated sequel to the Nintendo 64's hugely popular first-person shooter,Golden Eye 007. Playing as James Bond, you'll accomplish mission objectives while using yourLicence to Killany bad guy in your sites. Crouch, jump, swim, climb, and run through each mission. There are three difficulty settings, each one making the bad guys tougher while adding mission objectives. And, playing to Bond's particularly glamorous skills, there is a forced-scrolling skiing-and-shooting level. Get important game info from the good guys you meet, including Q and M.Just like its predecessor,The World Is Not Enoughhas a multiplayer mode that's sure to be popular. The game has at least five multiplayer arenas for two-on-two, two-on-one, and three-on-one teams. Choose any character from the single-player mode, designate players controlled with artificial intelligence, and customize the match's settings: starting arsenal, weapons available for pickup, health power-ups, and match duration.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Surprisingly more than enough","reviewText":"This is of course the video game adaptation of the third James Bond movie featuring Pierce Brosnan. It's also a kind of sequel to the N64 classic GoldenEye, though it's developed by Eurocom rather than Rareware.I'm not sure how well this game sold, but it's a surprisingly above-average effort considering the expectations it had to live up to. It borrows heavily from the control scheme established by GoldenEye while throwing in a few new modifications (ability to jump, new gadgets, etc). The graphics are pretty solid, including some nice scripted animations of bad guys jumping in through windows and other effects. A lot of care was put into the movie license with solid voice acting (including John Cleese as R) and detailed recreations of key movie scenes and sets, a rarity in older games. Also like GoldenEye, you can unlock secrets such as new multiplayer characters by completing missions within a certain time limit.The problem is that while The World is Not Enough is a strong effort on its own, it still pales to GoldenEye and also Perfect Dark, which was Rare's other masterpiece shooter for the N64. Enemy AI is pretty weak, and its robotic nature occasionally pulls you out of the cinematic experience. The decent amount of multiplayer options simply doesn't match the massive bucketload that Perfect Dark offered, and again the AI bots are lacking. Finally, the biggest annoyance is that the game needs the controller pak for save files. Other games need the controller pak too, but saving to the cartridge is always easier.If you collect all things James Bond, The World is Not Enough is a solid title to grab (and is much stronger than the completely different PSX version). If you're looking for a good N64 shooter to fill out your collection with, this is also highly recommended, though you may want to try Perfect Dark first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2005"}

Multiplayer feels like GTA.in some of the chapters the game would freeze and I would have to reset the game.  this has never happened to me with other games.  sometimes I would see the characters talking but no sound.  In one scene enemies were escaping on a boat so I shootdodged in to the water to kill the enemies which I thought was cool.  I tried again and 2 more times and the game froze.  This Game is not enjoyable on hard.  you will not be able to use shootdodge  and you will have to really use cover and blind fire a lot which you will still get hit with enemy fire.

Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

In fact, in many ways, the gameplay is worse, IMO:1. The \"team\" AI was poor in ME1. They mostly just got in your way and got themselves killed. Despite claims that their AI was improved, I couldn't tell it. They still take your cover spot, get between you and the target you are firing at (then tell you: \"Quit shooting at me, Shepherd.\"), expose themselves and get killed, stand around watching while you get swamped by husks (at times), and basically just get in the way. When you enter a small, closed room or the dead-end of a hall, they follow you in (which is stupid) and then you have to crowd past them to get out. Just a bloody nuisance!You can tell them to move to certain positions, but when action begins, they tend to come back to you and get in your way and attract enemy fire. But the most annoying thing is that during a battle, they keep YELLING LOUDLY the same couple of things over and over and over and over. I wore out the mute button.2. A lot of griping went on about the long elevator rides in ME1. We were told this was fixed in ME2, but all they have done is replace the scenes of the inside of elevators with animated graphics which are equally long and boring.The real problem is how long it takes for ME to load new scenes, or worse yet -- to reload the same scene which should already be loaded. It seems to me that much more time is spent loading scenes in ME than in any other game I've played.3. LOCK-UPS -- ME2 locked up on me at least 4-5 times, causing me to have to go back and replay a bunch of battles.4. The inventory system got worse!  There were gripes about ME1's inventory system, but they were mostly related to the work involved in deleting stuff you picked up and needed to unload to make room for more. Instead of fixing that problem, they changed to a system which, to me, was confusing and 10x the amount of work involved in the long, boring scanning of planets to get minerals to use for upgrading. The game says that upgrades are made automatically, and it appears you always get the most powerful weapons available, so I never did understand the need for (nor use) the ammo lockers for changing weapons. Are you supposed to want to downgrade? And some armor upgrades apparently must be made in Shepherd's quarters.Instead of having a limited number of upgrades to ration among your team, the upgrades are either automatically given to everyone or can only be used by a specific person, doing away with some of the strategy of ME1.4. Planet scanning!!!!  People complained about the Mako in ME1, so it was removed from ME2, but driving around the planets in ME1 was MUCH more entertaining than scanning planets in ME1. Yet another ME2 thing that makes no sense: no matter how tiny or huge a planet is, the relative scanning area is the same, so it takes just as long to scan a tiny planet as a huge one.5. In ME2, when you complete a mission, sometimes just by picking up an item, a cut scene plays and you end up back in the ship. If there was any loot around you wanted to pick up -- tough luck. An exception is if you have another mission on the same planet, it will ask if you want to stay, but usually you get no choice.Likewise, in ME1, you could walk on and off the Normandy, so if you wanted to go on board for a minute to do something, you could. In ME2, if you go back to the Normandy, it's via a cut scene with the Normandy leaving orbit.6. The battles all blurred together. It seemed like you're always hiding behind something and popping up to shoot. It didn't matter a lot what kind of enemy you were fighting. The exception is the Husks who swarm you, but this doesn't happen often. Just before ME2 arrived, I was replaying Dead Space and its battles are MUCH more fun. In fact, the whole game is more fun.7. The much-touted cover system was no big deal. In fact, if you have to jump on/over a crate or ledge while you are walking, you must first stop and crouch behind it!! Just stupid!8. The running mode also is goofy. You cannot change directions while running, and it doesn't seem like you are moving that much faster anyway. The worst running mode of any game I've seen.9. As in ME1, this is a very slow-paced game. Lots of talking, reading, walking around (and, of course, planet scanning). Some people may prefer that. I don't.10. Loot gathering is a big yawn. You mostly get Medi-Gel, cash, and some ammo. You find relatively few weapons and not much else of interest. No strategy is involved regarding whether or not to pick up a weapon.11. The way the sniper rifle works is one of my biggest gripes. It should work that whatever you are looking at when you bring the scope up to your eye is what you see in the scope, but most often you can't tell what the heck you are looking at because it just jumps off somewhere else. And while you are desperately trying to get your bearings, you are getting shot to pieces. Stupid!!Pro's:1. The story line is at least as good as any shooter.2. The Save system is the best of any game I've played. It auto-saves fairly often, and manual saves happen almost instantly, unlike the long, long load times, so you can save often.3. The galaxy map is MUCH improved. The star system and planet names include the names of active missions so you know where to go. There are a lot more star systems to explore.It's not a terrible game, but it is nowhere near being among the best. It was interesting, but just didn't feel like a lot of fun.Anyone debating whether or not to buy ME might want to check out Bioshock 2 first and wait for the price of ME2 to drop way down.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2010"}

Gameplay, ehh","reviewText":"I want to preface this review by stating that the only other Elder Scrolls game that I have played was \"Oblivion\", and unfortunately I didn't put that much effort into that game and beat it quite quickly....I was very excited about getting this game because of the hype that surrounded it.  Now to start, I will mention that I am a 26 year old male, and have a full time job, live with my gf, and have a new puppy. I am very weary about getting any type of role playing game because I know that I wont have all the time to put into the game, and I didn't want to get a bad experience because of that.  Growing up, I was a HUGE RPG fan with an extreme dedication to the Final Fantasy Series.  As time passed and I got older, Final Fantasy started to change its gameplay, and with my evolving life I just couldn't devote the time.I then came across the Demon Souls game for the PS3 ... amazing ... i was hooked..... then the more recent RPG I got was Dark Souls ... again ... hooked!  I figured \"this is it, I am back to loving RPG's\".  I ended up buying this game hoping that I would be on the same stride I have been with these newer RPGs.  The game started off great!  I loved the customizability, the graphics, the voice acting ... everything was perfect and pulling me into the story!After a few days though, I started to get bored.  There are a TON of side quests to do ... almost never ending.  Although most people would love this, it isn't something that captures my attention much ... it almost gets a bit stressing when you take care of all the side quests, then talk to the random NPC's and 10 more quests pop up.  Again, many people will LOVE that ... unfortunately at my age and my current lifestyle it really doesn't give me the sense of accomplishment in a game.As mentioned previously, I am coming from games like Demon/Dark Souls, so I am used to the \"grind it out/level up as much as you can\" type of difficult RPG's.  At first this game started out that way.  There were a few main quests that I just could not beat until I did some grinding and getting my skill set up.  This was working out all in my favor...exactly what I wanted.  But then, the game started to taper off a bit.  I started to reach levels where the bosses became easy, and the quests took little to no time at all to complete.I understand that a lot of people love this game because of how it has evolved as part of the Elder Scrolls series.  People will also love it due to the number of quests, the character customization, and the tons of stuff that you can do each day in the game.  Unfortunately, for me, it just didn't satisfy my needs.  Dont get me wrong, if you are looking for a full 'sandbox' type RPG then this is the game for you!  But if you want a big challenge and a sense of accomplishment, there are better choices.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2012"}

Morales","summary":"Fantastic Peripheral brought down by Issues with Move Hardware and Gaming Software","reviewText":"First off, if you are planning on getting yourself a Playstation Move and plan on a shooting peripheral, the PS Sharpshooter is without a doubt the BEST of the bunch. Since the market isn't exactly flooded with many perhipherals it doesn't make choosing this as your best so difficult. Not only that, but this Sharpshooter is very competitively priced with others, so you won't be paying too much more for what is definitely the best out there. Unfortunately, as you see I have a four star review and not five star, it isn't for bad reason. The amazing features on this gun are never taken full advantage of (at least not at the time of this review) and the PS Move's calibration inconsistencies can be hindersome as well as a lack of rich number of games that take full advantage of this gun's amazing features.The first thing that will stand out to you is the general look of the gun. It is large enough to make you feel like a real tactical expert upon first notice. Everything from the sleekness of the Move holster cover to the rear arm extender, this thing constatntly shows off right on its own. Players will love the ease and perfect fitting for both their PS Move motion controller as well as the very comfortable placement of the navigation controller. This thing is definitely very comfortable to hold, and lots of fun to just look at and toy around with.Since this is not just a simple piece of plastic that the controllers just sandwich right into, a la the Nintendo Wii's steering wheel (which may as well just be a bagel with a controller shape cut out), the Sharpshooter employs not just a trigger, but also the triangle and square buttons on BOTH sides, making any game that requires these buttons very easy to get to. The PS Move motion controller (thing with the glowing orb) plugs directly into the sharpshooter through its USB port when you place the controller into the holster. It even has a hole so the wristband can be put so you don't have to untie it. The plastic clamshell is easy to remove given the loosening latches (another easy feature) and the the clamshell pops right back in, in a dark transparency where you'll know the controller is on because you'll see the right indicator light. The glowing orb at the end sticks out because it is what the PS Eye camera requires. The ONLY stipulation I have with the clamshell (and it's small) is that even when pushing the loose latch foward to release the clamshell, the clamshell doesn't automatically pop out, but you have to give it a slight tug. This only scared me because the plastic notches in the clamshell don't seem entirely strong, thus I am afraid of them snapping if I pull the clamshell out too quickly. Just remember to pull the clamshell out slowly to protect the plastic notches which snap it back in. Next there is the very comfy sitting area for the navigation controller. Games like Resistence 3 and Killzone 3 will require both PS Move controllers as you will need the analog on the navigation contoller to walk around. Since this thing is so well constructed, having one hand on the trigger and one hand on the analog stick feels like second nature. Plus you have access to all buttons. Since the sharpshooter itself has the triangle and square buttons above the trigger, you can your use trigger hand to get to them if necessary. This I've used on several occasions and it was a genius idea on Sony's part to put them there. Then of course there is the shot burst toggle switch above the trigger itself. No game has employed this feature just yet, but if they do it makes for a very realistic setting adhereing to what a real gun would have. The toggle can be switched to either single, double, or triple shot bursts. Very cute feature and I'm hoping a game will come out to actually take full advantage of it. Lastly there is the back arm extender which is easily pulled back and forth into place. This is used so as to keep the gun comfortably rested on your upper arm. Again, very nice feature so you don't have to carry all the weight of the gun with the two hands you're using to play the actual game at the time. One gripe I do have with this though (and I might as well state it here) is that with both controllers hooked up, the sharpshooter has a tendency to become somewhat heavy, and after playing a game for about a half hour, you will feel the need to take a break, as I personally had felt some back pain. I relieved this a bit by playing while sitting down, but the aiming calibration feel changes a bit if the controller is moved from a standing position to a sitting position. So I would choose your playing position first (I recommend a solid chair with a straight backrest as opposed to a very soft couch), then calibrate the gun as necessary before the game, and play.I also have to mention that the removal of the motion controller (the thing that actually plugs in) is a bit hairy. The ONE feature I believe is missing from this peripheral is the option to have a release latch for the controller USB port itself, because in the instruction manual the thing literally tells you to physically PULL OUT the controller by the orb portion itself. Not wanting to actually RUIN my motion controller (as the orb part feels kinda soft), I did this slowly and carefully and it came out. So in dealing with the motion controller itself, just treat its installation and release as easy as possible and be sure to READ the instruction manual... I would recommend pushing the orb up for release and not actually PULLING on it. No need breaking any pieces of plastic for no reason. Still, these little quirks are relatively small and don't hinder the overall greatness of what the peripheral tries very hard to do. I just with the motion controller and games could be in good compliance as to actually USE this peripheral to its best degree.So THAT is what hinders this gun, the motion controller's functionality with the PS3 Eye itself, as well as the software game selection. The most popular uses for this gun will be in either Socom 4, Killzone 3 or Resistence 3. All three games calibrate the same way, but calibration for these games is never 100% accurate. You will find that during calibration you will need to \"shoot\" the top left and lower right corners of your screen. Even with you best aim you will find that the target is never aligned perfectly with the orb itself, but has a tendency to lean to the right by like 2 or 3 inches (this is estimated by me standing approximately 8 feet from my tv screen, and I own a 55\" screen in which I play on, so it only makes this problem that much more noticeable. I've even heard stories of people's on-screen targets constantly drifting to the right even though the Move controller stays perfectly in place! Without letting this turn into a review of the Move controller itself, let's just say that using this gun to play Killzone or any of the other titles I mentioned may look and feel cool, but just doesn't play as cool or as solid as is worth the money you will spend on this peripheral. It's sad really because I really do LOVE this thing, such a great feel and look, it's a shame that I would rather play these 3 titles using a standard controllers rather than the Sharpshooter itself. This is mostly due to both the weight of the shooter with both controllers in tact, as well as the sensitivity of the Move's target function on the screen.So that only leaves me to desire to play On-rail game shooters, like The Shoot, House of the Dead 3 and Time Crisis. These titles aren't first-person shooters but rail shooters, meaning you don't control the character's movements (hence you won't need the navigation controller that has the analog control stick), but instead the game does it for you in that tradition arcade style. If you buy the Sharpshooter, I would suggest getting on-rail style shooters instead of these FPS's as it feels more natural as well as feeling like you're using the sharpshooter for what it was designed for rather than a slightly more annoying controller option. The big flaw here is that there don't exist very many games (actually at the moment it's just kinda these 3 I mentioned) that use this on-rail style.As of now I am still waiting for a game (at least one) that takes FULL advantage of ALL of the Sharpshooter's features, from the navigation stick, motion controller, auto-burst toggle, and triangle and square buttons. Otherwise this is a GREAT peripheral I would recommend above all others. So really, the only thing holding more people from buying this peripheral are the lack of things the peripheral can be used for, not really the peripheral itself.So to sum up, here is a quick list of PROS and CONS:PROS:-Great pricing-Fantastic features-Superior grip and ergonomic comfortable design-Great looks-Convenient layout and overall functionalityCONS:-Sensitive feeling clamshell cover for motion controller-No release latch to make motion controller release easier-A bit weighty when both controllers are attached-Lack of useful games, NO games using ALL Sharpshooter features-PS Move calibration quirks","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Turok is back, for better or worse","reviewText":"Remember Turok: Dinosaur Hunter?  One of the original launch titles way back when for the Nintendo 64, Turok enjoyed a solid series of FPS' over the next few years, and then just vanished (mainly thanks to then publisher Acclaim going under).  Well, Turok is back in action and in familiar settings, as he takes on baddies, mutants, and of course, dinosaurs.  The game gets off to a great start as you are fully engulfed in Turok's dangerous environments, but sadly it doesn't take too long to see just what all Turok has to offer.  The redundant enemies, areas, and an overall feeling of the linear are fully on display with Turok, which offers little in the way of surprises after you first put some time into the game.  Graphically speaking, Turok gets the job done, but you'll play far better looking FPS' on the XBox 360, and the texture glitches don't help the cause here either.  Flaws aside, Turok has a fair share of good points as well: the game's musical score is fantastic, there is a very nice assortment of weapons and are implemented quite well, the dinos look and sound good, and co-op and multiplayer options are solid.  All in all, you'll certainly play better FPS', but for what it's worth, Turok is a fun, albeit flawed, shooter that is better than the sum of its parts.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2008"}

Landscapes as various as those presented in the three parts of Liberty were suddenly replaced by a dull, flat topography that was as fun to drive through as the average racing game (i.e. not very fun). Rockstar's fault? Not really - Miami is as flat and boring as the game made it out to be. Well, all that changes in San Andreas.Shortly after you begin the game, you will see the grandeur of the game - Los Santos alone is 6 times the size of all of Liberty City. The beautiful and varied landscape that made GTA3 such an excellent game is back in SA - only ten times better. Begin a drive in the ghetto, moving through country, desert, beach, freeways - just about anything else you can imagine. Drive, bicycle, fly (in a staggering number of vehicles, including a jetpack), and ride just about anything you want - including trains. GTA: San Andreas is basically another world on a disc - without all the unpleasant consequences characteristic of one leading a criminal life.Contributing to the overall realism of the game are such nice additions as lack of in-game loading (except when one enters and leaves buildings), more realistic flames, and water effects. The game's character can also swim, parachute, gain/lose weight, work out to build muscle and stamina, change his appearance by choosing clothing, hairstyles and tattoos, and keep a number of girlfriends (most of whom will annoy you at the worst times). The cars in the game can also be modified in a number of different ways - from changing colors and patterns, to adding nitrous oxide, hydraulics, etc...Perhaps the two most fun features of SA are the addition of freeways, with the occasional pileups (very fun to watch), and addition of gangs, who do a nice job of taking care of anyone not \"being nice\" to you - including the annoying cops.Simply put, San Andreas took everything that was fun in GTA3 and VC, added a horde of improvements and new features, then increased them tenfold. There are tons of characters and references from/to the previous Grand Theft Auto games - like Kent Paul, Catalina, and Fido/Claude. The amount of groundwork laid with regard to the storyline of Grand Theft Auto 3 (which chronologically comes after SA) is simply excellent.So is San Andreas perfect? Well, yes and no.As a very big fan of the GTA radio stations, I find the media content in SA incomparable to either of the two games that preceded it. Of the 10 or so radio stations, I find myself listening to only 3 or 4. The talk radio station WCRT is also a bit of a letdown, as though the content is dynamic (it changes 3-4 times during the game), it doesn't come close to KCHAT or VCTR, in terms of playback length. San Andreas also happens to be the most bug-ridden GTA game yet. The bugs vary from things like mild annoyances - like the character running ten laps around a motorbike, in an attempt to get back on it (something that almost never happened in Vice City), to glitches that make continuing the game very difficult - if not impossible - like people being spawned inside freeway ramps during vigilante missions, or the infamous gym glitch, where it becomes impossible to work out. Yes, the number of glitches in this game alone is staggering, which is the only side-effect in this game. Even thus, San Andreas is STILL the best game on the PS2, and the only reason I own one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

However, there were a few specific problems, unfortunately, with the system that inconvenienced some.  For one it did not have any protective cover and seemed to scratch really easily, and the screen was very dark.  One such example is when playing Castlevania: CoTM; I literally had to hold the console right under the light bulb in order to view the game.  However, the GBA SP has taken everything to a new level with its remarkably sleek design, nice cover, and built in light system.  The last feature alone is more than enough to shell out the price of 100 dollars for the system.The size of the system is just perfect and its light and compact design allow it to fit just about anywhere.  The system layout is still the same as before, with the start and select buttons being in the center, triggers on the shoulders, and the traditional A-B layout being on the right.  The control pad is very responsive and simple, so you do not have to hold it down or push hard to get the actions to commence.  Now the only real complaint that I had with this new design is that it is very difficult to remove the batteries.  Instead of a simple snap off design, it is instead replaced by a small screw that you have to undo in order to remove said battery.  However, this whole thing can be ignored because of the AC adapter charge that the system comes with.  Which basically means you never have to replace batteries, all you have to do is leave the charge on for about an hour, and it will be good as new.  Speaking of batteries, the life of it is very good and once charged, it does not have to be charged again for several hours.All in all, with its wide variety of colors, impressive game selection, nice design, and light weight, the Game Boy Advance SP is worth every penny.  Just remember to take a little screw-driver with you when you go on long trips, unless you have an adapter console available in your car.  Happy Gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2004"}

I've always loved the Mario franchise, sans the Mario Sports series, but more than that, I've always thought that Peach deserved her own game, and for it to come to one of my favorite game platforms since the Super Nintendo is a bonus treat!Super Princess Peach follows the oft-abducted Princess and her Parasol \"Perry\" on the mysterious Vibe Island. Bowser has stolen the Vibe Scepter, and with it, not only captured Mario, Luigi, and the Toads, but also has sent both the Mushroom Kingdom and Vibe Island into chaos.Through the game, you'll battle with traditional Mario-style game play, i.e. jumping on baddies, smashing blocks and the like, but you'll also harness the Princesses' powerful emotions; Rage, Joy, Sadness, Calm, and...er...Doc... via the Touch Screen. Most often, you'll find yourself using them to solve in-game puzzles that will lead you to a captured Toad, but in later levels, you can use them to explore large hidden areas and save yourself from death.If you get sick of playing through story mode, Super Princess Peach also features a few stylus-based mini-games akin to Super Mario 64 DS. There's a set of puzzles, the pieces of which are hidden mostly in-level, and a few Toad harassment games (is it wrong to purposely lead them into a wall of fire?). There is also a 'Concert Room' where you can replay any of the music or sound bites from the game. Again, some are hidden in-level, but most can be purchased at the store, and unless you are attempting to avoid coins, you'll have plenty to waste.Overall, Super Princess Peach proves itself to be not only a great addition to the DS' already formidable game library, but a great 2D platformer as well.Even though the game is a little on the easy side, the overall experience isn't hindered much and there are bonus 'harder' missions for when you are done with the game. And guys, don't shy away from this one because the word 'Princess' is in the title.After all, it's not made by Disney and if you ever played Super Mario Strikers then you know that Peach can be a major.... well, suffice it to say that if you own a DS and a Y chromosome, don't let pride make you miss this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2007"}

Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"Great ATV racing with a whole lot of depth...","reviewText":"I was actually surprised by PURE. Recent racing games haven't been my cup of tea over the last few years because it seems as if every developer adds a bunch of unnecessary layers (endless tweaking, passing tests to get to the meat of the game, etc.) that makes jumping in and really enjoying the game as it's meant to be enjoyed a practice in tedium from the get-go. That's NOT the case with PURE. Sure, there's plenty to tweak your ATV with, but by-in-large, PURE is an old-school ARCADE racer through and through, and that's most definitely a good thing.First of all, the game is endlessly pretty. The animations are great, the textures are as detailed as you'd like, the character models, lighting, etc., but you don't play a game just for the eye-candy. The game is simple and straight-forward arcade racing, but there is some technique to it. While PURE is like any other racing game out there in that the first to the finish line wins, the only way to really win is to take advantage of turbo boosts, and the only way to attain those is to perform TRICKS & STUNTS. While a lot of off-road/motorcycle/EXTREME racing games allow you to do tricks for bonuses, in PURE, it's basically a necessity. If you don't do them, you don't get boosts, and without those, you won't win. In doing this, PURE basically manages to make what's usually a gimmick in the genre vital to the gameplay. As you progress, you get flashier tricks, which in turn give you bigger turbo boosts. This might actually make the game sound a little intimidating, but PURE gives you plenty of tutorials, practice runs and control schemes to make sure that you'll find something that works for you.Another great aspect of PURE are the tracks. With over 30 tracks in the game, with tons of variety in their topography and features (jungles, deserts, mountain paths, you name it). These are huge tracks with tons of jumps, obstacles and alternate paths and shortcuts to take (and you'll want to find everyone).Overall, Disney Interactive did a much better job with PURE than I ever dreamed they would. It's fun from the start, drives fast to the end and offers enough in the way of variety and technique to challenge and entertain just about any gamer. If you like games like SSX, WaveRace, HydroThunder or Excitetruck, add PURE to you library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Nothing as it seems","reviewText":"With the looming release of the blockbuster in the making next installment of the Lord of the Rings film series, it was inevitable that the license would be delved into video games.  The recent wave of LOTR licensed games have ranged from great (LOTR: The Two Towers for PS2) to godawful (LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring for GameBoy Advance), and here we have The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring for the PS2.  Contrary to what you might think, this game has more to do with Tolkien's first installment of the books than it has to do with the film.  You can control Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf at different parts in the game; each of which has similar regular abilities and some special exclusive ones as well.  Graphicly speaking the game is half decent, as is the sound, but the control is so frustrating and the camera angles are outrageously bad.  Half the time you'll get killed just because the camera angle wouldn't let you see the enemies right.  Not to mention that once you strip away the Lord of the Rings license you'll find that the game is really a simple hack & slasher with a hot license attached to it, and nothing more.  All in all, even hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings will find something to be disappointed about with this.

Each upgrade should have several levels of enhancement, i.e. players should be able to keep upgrading to a higher level for each attribute, for example, armor strength can be increased by 20%, 50%, and so on.

This game has it's own \"feel\" to it, and at times reminded me a lot of SOCOM Confrontation or SOCOM 4, especially the features where you can revive your fallen teammates. However, the mechanics on this are not very good. For example, during the heat of battle when you need to revive your teammates you are more likely to \"hit x\" (on the PS3) and pick up some supplies rather than revive your teammate. This is especially problematic during the boss battles and instead of being able to revive your teammate you pick up a flash grenade that you didn't want anyway and then get killed while trying to revive a teammate. And the AI always seems to get themselves killed and never bother to pick up herbs or heal themselves even when the supplies are close by. There were a few missions that I just left them dead and finished it on my own. It isn't that the game play is difficult so much as it is bad mechanics that cause you to die and make the game more frustrating than fun. By the time I got to the 5th campaign I just didn't care anymore and shut the game off and am returning it.The graphics are sub-par in my opinion for a PS3 game, which doesn't surprise me since Slant Six was involved with the production of this game more so than Capcom I'm sure. Also when I played with HUNK in the mercenaries game for RE4 he was bad-ace at melee and kills, but in the online play for this game he sucks and is easily defeated. Same with Vector. The game showed promise at times, I especially like the camoflogue for HUNK and Vector, and playing Versus online had its moments but ultimately left me feeling disappointed. And for a full retail of $60 the single campaign is surprisingly short. If Capcom wanted to do something like this to tie us over to RE6 it should have been a $30 retail price since this game offers online play and not much else.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

The Vita uses a new interface like today's smartphones (except the innovative Windows Phone's Metro interface) whereby you scroll through pages of icons to choose what you want to launch. The quick start guide is helpful, but if you need more info you'll have to use an ugly online guide just like the ones for the PS3 and PSP! Why can't Sony use PDF? And why can't they use an industry-standard memory storage format? The OLED screen is not as impressive as some reviews claim; it's okay, on par with the Super LCD screen on my HTC Windows Phone, but I think Super LCD is still a bit better as its image rendering is easier on the eyes. The Vita is big and bulky but surprisingly not heavy and actually feels good in the hands! Still, it's too bulky to look good.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Comes up short","reviewText":"You'd figure that a violent first person shooter developed by the same folks who brought us the Burnout games would be nothing short of spectacular.  Well, you'd be wrong.  Don't get me wrong, Black is a solid game, but it comes up short of what it could be.  Taking cues from Hollywood action movies, Black puts you in the shoes of a black ops soldier with some very big guns as you trek through enemy territory.  The game itself looks sweet, even for a PS2 game, and the sound effects and music are wonderfully done as well.  All great so far right?  Well, here's what ultimately kills Black from cashing in on all it's potential.  First off, the game is incredibly short, and quickly gets very tedious; even for a first person shooter.  Depending on which difficulty you select, the game is either really easy or way too hard to play, and offers quite a steep learning curve in later levels.  Black delivers on the visual and audio goods in spades, but it's the overall gameplay effects that bring the game down, but it's the fact that EA and Criterion didn't feel the need to inject any online capability into Black at all.  Yes this is a first person shooter, and it doesn't offer any online multiplayer options, go figure.  Besides all the negativity, Black still offers some solid and quick paced first person shooter action, which is something that the PS2 never really did very well.  It's worth a look, but be prepared to get bored with it quickly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2006"}

At that point I was left with a feeling of &#34; this can't be the end , I have only been playing for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours &#34;. But it was the end and it left me a little dissapointed. The good thing about this game is that it doesn't end with the campaign , there is always multiplayer.The multiplayer is the redeming factor for this game , because there is countless hours of fun to be had here , not to mention the DLC ( downloadable content ) that is comming for this game to further enhance your multiplayer experience. The multiplayer is always more fun with a few friends online with you , but even playing alone you can find much enjoyment here.The graphics in this game are just excellent , and I'm not only talking about the campaign. Usually the campaign in games look way better than the multiplayer , but somehow Dice ( the developers of the Battlefield series ) pulled off an amazing looking campaign and multiplayer.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Space Horrors","reviewText":"If you say that out loud, you can see why they went with Dead Space 2.  Improved over the original, this is a white knuckled adventure that will give you the creeps, and a few scares.Story: 9/10 (Spoiler Free)Dead Space 2 begins three years after the end of the original Dead Space with Issac Clarke locked in an asylum undergoing psychological treatment for his full blown schizophrenia by a government psychiatrist... and his day just goes downhill from there.  The story of Dead Space 2 is well rendered, well acted, fast paced, suspenseful blend of action blockbuster and sci-fi horror.There are a few main characters in the story and all of them are very well written.  A few of the lines of dialogue are a bit awkward, but that's the only thing bad about the story.  It's definitely better than the stuff that Hollywood has been churning out recently.  (Smurfs in New York, M. Night's Airbender, Battle: Los Angeles)What is most impressive is that Dead Space 2 doesn't break its own fiction.  All of the game mechanics, weapons, items, upgrades, combat... make sense in their world.Graphics: 9/10The art direction is great and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy.  The space station and other levels look fantastic and their designs are interesting.  The creatures are frightening and the characters look and animate great.  The environments, characters, effects, and direction all contribute to create a believable experience.Gameplay: 8/10Dead Space 2 is a 15 Chapter Survival Horror game that takes place on a space station infected by Necromorphs.  The game is linear, but doesn't feel like artificially connected maps.  The levels blend together to make a continuously flowing story.  Save points are numerous as are stores where you can upgrade your weapons.  As you adventure through the game, you find money, ammo, schematics for new weapons and armor, and Power Nodes, which upgrade your weapons and armor.In order to kill a Necromorph, you must sever its limbs and the weapons in Dead Space 2 are designed to do just that.  The surgical Plasma Cutter is back, with the pulse rifle, the line gun, the javelin thrower, the ripper, a long range rifle, the mine launcher, and some new energy weapons.  All of them are upgradeable via weapon slots that resemble skill trees.  By placing a Power Node in the tree, your weapon gets the upgrade.Issac is also equipped with telekinesis so he can hurl objects at enemies and stasis, which slows down enemies for a brief period of time.Because this is a survival horror game, health and ammo are a bit scarce.  All of the weapons are fun to shoot and the enemies pose different kinds of threats.  The strength of the Dead Space series is the enemy vs. weapon match ups.  These enemies pose a challenge and the weapons are specifically designed to take them down.There is no HUD.  Instead, the environment gives you all of the information that you need.  Issac's suit tells you how much health he has.  His guns show how much ammo is left.  The doors have holograms that tell you if they can be opened or unlocked...I know that this is a survival horror game and not a full blown action game, but the combat does feel a bit clunky at times.  Here's why...Who killed me?The camera is in 3rd person and pulled in very close to Issac.  Because of this, it is very difficult to see enemies coming from the sides or enemies on the floor.  Also, killing enemies leaves a corpse behind, and when you leave a pile of corpses, a crawling enemy can attack you before you see it.  The game is very dark, mostly illuminated by Issac's flashlight.  But there are dark enemies that spit acid from a very long distance.  They are incredibly difficult to see and the acid damages your health and slows you down.I'm too slow!Issac turns really slowly.  So slowly, that if you are attacked from the front and 90 degrees to the right at the same time, it is almost impossible to not get grabbed by an enemy, even if you use stasis.  As you take damage, Issac's run speed also slows down.Insta-killedThere are a few areas in the game with traps or interactive cutscenes that kill you if you make a mistake.  This feels dramatic, but it also feels unforgiving.Where'd my Health go?You can quick use a health pack by pushing the B button.  But you use B when you use telekinesis or exit interactive objects in the world.  If you aren't careful, you can accidentally use up all of your health packs.  If you are low on cash, you may not be able to finish the game and you may have to load a previous save.  This has happened to 3 of my friends.  You cannot turn the quick use off.  It would have been better if you had the option to use a health pack in your weapon selection (Press UP on the D-pad).  You also use your strongest Health Packs first, even if you are already at full health.Aside from these (semi-serious) issues, the game is still fun and suspenseful.Levels  9/10The level designs are great.  There is exploration, puzzles, combat, anti-gravity areas, areas without oxygen, traps, etc...  There is a pretty big variety and the levels contribute to a very believable world.Multiplayer: 9/10The Multiplayer is quite good!  It's like an improved version of Left 4 Dead, where teams of 4 Humans take on teams of 4 Necros.  The humans have objectives in the maps and the Necros try to thwart them.  As you play, you gain XP, which allows you to unlock new costumes and weapons.  Humans carry 2 weapons, stasis, and a health pack.  The Necro team continuously spawns and attacks.  There is a cool-down timer based on the enemy that you want to use.  If you want a simple melee grunt, you can spawn in 4 seconds.  If you want a very deadly spitter, it will take you 7 seconds.  After you choose your Necro, you can choose a spawn point on the map and you can see the location of the objectives, allies, and enemies.  Each side takes a turn trying to complete the objectives.Sound: 10/10The music ranges from eerie to exciting.  The sound effects are great at highlighting the action or creating tension and suspense.  It's all very well done.Replay Value: 9/10Play through it once as a survival horror game in 10 hours, then play through it again with your weapon upgrades as an action game in about 5-6 hours.  Then there's the multiplayer.  You will get your money's worth here.There are 5 different difficulty levels, too.Maturity: MatureThe story is a psychological horror / scary creature feature.  It's packed with language and gore.  If your 10 year old played this, expect him to sleep in your bed until he is 15.Overall: 9/10Dead Space 2 improves on the original and adds a fun multiplayer game.  Action, horror, and sci-fi fans will enjoy this game.  The multiplayer is fun, but it's not going to pull you away from Halo or Call of Duty.Buy this game if you love horror and will play through it more than once.Buy this game if you liked Left 4 Dead 2 and want more of that.Rent it if you want to blow through the campaign.  You'll need 8-12 hours depending on the difficulty.Avoid it if you don't like gore.Avoid it if you want a full on epic action game like Halo or Call of Duty.  The controls may feel a bit sluggish and the suspenseful pacing of the game may be a bit slow.If you liked this game, you'll enjoy the Silent Hill series as well as the Left 4 Dead series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}

Then a couple of chapters later, the line gun is gone!  Now I'm left with two basic, not upgraded weapons, and I'm in an area where I'm fighting a \"boss\" - with weak pea-shooters. All these guns do is tick off the necromorph.  Plus all my ammo was for the other weapons.  No money, fully stocked up on ammo for a weapon that's evaporated from my inventory.  So I have a choice - start over or trash the game.If you manage to play from save station to save station without dying, you won't glitch. If you never use a restore point, you won't glitch - usually. I played three times from start to finish. It glitched twice.As of 9-6-2011 the glitch is still there. Search for it - it's an ongoing problem with thousands of complaints.  Yet Visceral Games won't fix it.It's too bad. This is a great game - but honestly, bringing the equivalent of a rock to a nuclear bomb fight won't work.  A level 13 boss when all you have is a plasma cutter with zero ammo, and a force gun with 4 rounds?  Yea - I have over 60 rounds for the line gun and over 80 for the Javelin (hoping the weapons would magically reappear.) But they are gone, never to be seen again....unless I purchase them again AND go through all the power nodes again. Pathetic.So save often and watch your weapons!  Apart from *that* the game is a blast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

I've always been more of a Playstation one fanatic, but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played.  If you think that Final Fantasy is good, then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk.  There's only a couple of games on the nintendo N64 console that of which I liked, and that was Gauntlet Legends, Super Mario, and Donkey Kong.  But this game beats them all by a longshot.Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five?  The reason is because of the...problems listed below.1.  This game is HARD. I don't mean hard as in \"Challenging\" I'm talkin' about the whole you-possibly-will-never-ever-complete-the-game-without-a-strategy-guide hard.  The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.2.  There are a couple of glitches in the game. Example: I dare you to cut a sign with your sword.  Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time.  The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float.  That's just one of the glitches.3.  A little confusing, as far as the story goes.  It's better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.4.  Replay value isn't very high.  Once you complete it, that's it.  It's so hard that I wouldn't ever want to go through the same frustration again, as to the fact that it was very difficult, even if you do know what you're doing.Okay, those were the bads.  Here are the goods.1.  The graphics are outstanding.  Wow.  The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth, only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.2.  Once you beat the game, you feel satisfied with yourself.  Sure, this game is a little short, but it will still take you a long time to beat it, no matter how experienced you are with gaming.3. The plot is good and twists a lot.  I know that I said it was kind of confusing, and it kind of is, but it's still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot.It's sort of a mystery.4.  Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences.  It's true.  Like I said above, the graphics are wonderful.  And plus, exploring a small portion of Termina, which you do through out the game, is an experience that you don't wanna miss.5.  The bad guys are challenging, but not so challenging that you'll be ripping your hair out.  Once you beat them, you feel satisfied.6.  Highly addictive gameplay and plus you won't stop until you beat the game.But there's one major, and I mean MAJOR problem with this game.  This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life.  Remember your family?  You won't when you get this game, since you'l be wanting to play this game even more.

Heart of the Swarm offers better play-ability overall. It's nice that the gathering units automatically start without your command. The multiplayer is always my favorite part of these games. The campaign is good, it just isn't something I would play over and over again. I wish that there would have been significant graphical changes considering how long it took this game to release. That's not to say that the graphics are bad, just not greatly improved from Wings of Liberty. I have also noticed that this game occasionally crashes while navigating through the leviathan (The ship you travel in). I have an extremely powerful PC that plays Crysis 3 fully maxed with 50-60 fps. So I am sure that either its a driver issue with Nvidia's graphics cards or a bug that Blizzard will address in the near future. People should also know that before they buy this game, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WINGS OF LIBERTY FIRST. You cannot play Heart of the Swarm without Wings of Liberty since it is an expansion.

It is definitely a next generation game.  I first purchased COD Ghosts, and though it was marginally better than the 360 version, it didn't have that wow effect. DR3 has that WOW effect. There are hundreds of zombies on the screen at any given time, and there is no slow down in the frame rate what so ever.  Weapon combinations can now be built on the fly (before a bench was needed), and you can even build some really cool zombie-slaying vehicles too.  I have about 12 hours in, and I have to say that I look forward to playing this game everyday.  I just passed my first boss battle, and the game does a real good job of giving you the ability to explore the world.If you have played any of the past DRs, you will know about the very limiting time system which forced you to finish tasks very quickly.  DR3 gives you the option to change game modes, so that explorers, such as myself, have plenty of time searching for trophies, and cool weapons, and side plots.There are civilians scattered around throughout the game, and you can choose to save them or not. If you do save them, you can use them later as a companion to help you along your travels. One great thing is that you can share with your AI companion. So for instance you can give them a sawed-off shotgun to use, and even give them a rack of ribs when their health gets low.Another feature of the game, is that people can join into your game and help you defeat the zombies.  So if you build a vehicle with a turret for example they can jump in the turret and mow down zombies. I ended up turning this function off, as I wanted my first play-through to be done on my own, without anyone rushing me to go to the next tasks. Weapons are also everywhere, so trying to conserve ammo, and your best weapons is a waste of time because there is plenty to go around. The point of the game is to kill as many zombies as you can. You get rewarded experience (pp), and you can spend points to upgrade your character (health, # of items to carry etc.).In order to upgrade weapons and vehicles you have to find blueprints that are scattered around the map. They are usually easy to find, as they are located on the maps that you use, and they glow a bright blue.  Weapons can be combined anywhere, while vehicles must be built in a garage. There are also safe zones that need to be cleared out, and these will have change of outfit lockers, and weapons lockers that are stocked with weapons that you have found along the way. So if you found an LMG in the word, LMG machine guns will be available for you to take from the locker. You can usually stock up with a ton of these weapons from the lockers in safe zones.Another cool feature comes in the form of the Xbox Smart-glass feature. Using and iPad, iPhone, or other Tablet, you can enhance the story of the game. You can receive phone calls from a mysterious survivor who has access to all the cameras around the city. It allows you to also see the map, and find locations of certain weapons. It's a really nice feature, and definitely adds a sense of gameplay.Another feature is the kinect commands. It allows you point survivors in the direction you want them to go, and even taunt Zombies.  I saw another reviewer that said he &#34;sneezed&#34; and the zombies heard him. I have yet to experience this, and the game actually wants you to say &#34;Hey over here&#34; to get their attention.Overall, this game is a true next-gen game with some really cool features.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"A different flavor, but still tasty.","reviewText":"Dragon Age, an RPG player's gorefest. The first DA created a massive world full of things you wanted to know about, interact with, and kill. The enemies were, i'll admit mildly generic, but they fit the theme of a swarming enemy using numbers to win battles as opposed to skill, so it was completely forgivable. The main issue DA has though is it drags, much like many RPG's the battle system is very easy to use, and account commands for. However, as all RPG's it simulates an actual battle about as well as chess does. The problem is in RPG's you get time to think, time to plan. In actual battles, you get none of that. Dragon Age I showed us that battles can be hectic and still be RPG-like, but its still very structurally slow, and often as long as you have a good enough healer, what you do doesn't matter. In addition, attacks which were rolled for would land even though they couldn't. The battle animation for Peon's Plight takes about a second, and the ogre it was hitting as far away from me by the time it landed, and well, he died. I was happy, but, it was weird.Dragon Age II looks to improve the battle, while retaining the massive RPG elements that made the first one successful such as character building, stat based improvement of abilities, and an epic story that's immersive. But does the game actually live up to the hype behind it?The Good:A lot of Dragon Age 2's strengths are its weaknesses as well, don't be alarmed to see the exact same happy note as a negative note.The battle system:- The last battle system in dragon age more or less returns, the wheel is still here for the 360 and PS3 versions and it functions the same way. You still use the right trigger to toggle the 6 settable spells and can access the wheel using LT for more or abilities etc. Targets however have been changed up, you can no longer use abilities in battle unless they are in range, this can get odd when you go to use mighty blow and won't because you're a few too many degrees off the target, but it does keep you from wasting valuable mana or stamina, which is a plus. There were a lot of occasions when I'd use an ability in DA 1 and missed because the enemy wasn't quite in the arc of the attack I wanted to use, leaving me in cooldown and more vulnerable than i would have liked. The biggest change though is battle speed. During battle Hawke moves quickly, or very quickly depending on class. The rogue is a speed demon to make an understatement. Whats interesting I've found though, is that depending on your class is how you can fight effectively, mages and archers are good for support, mage nukes are good for crowds and warriors are generally good for crowds while still retaining sanity. The rogue seems best played as a one thing at a time type attacker. His speed will let him get away from most players but by micro managing his attacks to focus on one enemy at a time rather than gung-ho fighting, the rogue becomes much less of a crazy attacker.= The thing though is that attacking is button mashed by A or X depending on console. Now there is nothing explicitly wrong with this, but it does get monotonous, still, often later in the game your mash will be less frequent as your move pool will keep you in your special techs more than simply mashing A.Character Development:- Characters in this game are MUCH more easily customized. Remember how Morrigan's shapeshifter tree blew? No problem now. Every character is capable of being customized to fit your needs. Want the knight you get early on to be a tank? set her up to do so, you can even change her equipment to suit the type of warrior you need her to be, easy stuff, and much better than the last game. In addition, levels seem to come faster in this game, you get levels much quicker in this title in the beginning.The system to level up has been changed, not in actual premise, but in looks. Each class has a set of abilities, all viewable from the start and all possible of moving around in. However just like the last game, there are prerequisites to each ability in the trees, and there are level ones as well. Look them all over and do some planning on the character's first level up to get acquainted, try to figure out your play style, and plan accordingly.- Dog is now a pet spell. Believe me, this is a good thing.- As far as actual Hawke goes, Hawke's character is defined by the conversational choices you make, say something firm and your character's alignment to a more violent or serious character type increases. This effects things they say in battle and more. A sarcastic character will say different things in the beginning of and during a battle then a noble one will.- Just like the last game, your conversational antics will shape your friends views of you, do things they like, you guys become friends, do things they don't and well, you can imagine. The games calls it rival, but i don't know if the member will simply leave like in origins if rivalry peaks.- Lastly Your party members are not without voice in conversation, they can participate in conversation given the chance, and some of the time, they will be happy you asked them for advice. In DA 1 this was possible, but, well i won't spoil much, but you literally give them the torch and say \"do what you will\" on occasion, and they do, sometimes outright solving a problem rather than providing what they think.Menu's:- Overall the game's menu system is more streamlined, its much prettier and the level up method borrowed straight from Mass effect is welcome, any party members needing to level will be in here. Its a circle menu like Mass effect for everything else. If you're not familiar, when you pause, you use LS and A/X to select your choice, the menus are pretty easy to navigate this way.-Your inventory is still the same, a list of items in regards to the items slot you're using is displayed and you can use X/Square to compare a new item with an equipped one and then choose with A/X or leave it set with B/Circle. L1/R1/LB/RB lets you cycle through characters on any submenu. Its easy to use once you get used to it.- The biggest change however is the abilities, all abilities are set up in navigable trees, each tree can be individually selected and modified upon level up with points. All trees like DA 1 can be utilized cross subclass just like the first one. However on occasion it can be difficult to precisely select an ability that you wish to upgrade due to the controller input due to bad placing, when with a mouse it would be easy. Still, the abilities are much more easily understood at a glance. Diamonds are abilities, small icons are upgrades, and circles are Passive abilities. All in all though, the menu system used by MA works well, and I can't complain that its borrowed.Graphics and animations- DA 1 looks much more stiff than this game does, the faces in DA2 are more emotional, and the movements are much less action-figure like, they flow much more humanly (if not superhuman sometimes) and as a whole look more peoplelike.-Speaking in game (lipsync) has gotten better as well, but it was quite good before, still it IS nice even that has improved. The loading screens are varied and pretty and overall the graphical quality has improved as well. Environments do look better.- Armor types have improved as well, expect more armor skins and types in this one as well as weapon graphics.- Elves, Darkspawn and Qunari all have updated facial and bodily features as well, each race now looks much more distinct than they did in DA.- Character customization is much more extensive than in DA1, worth noting that there are about 20 or more hairstyles for both genders plus more of others.The story:- This game had me at the beginning, the voice acting is very very well done, and no character I've come across yet seems to have a bad voice actor. The story itself is the same brand as DA1 however, and having not completed the title, i'll have a hard time completely stating its a rehash, but then again RPG's don't typically offer up drastically different stories from one another in principle (become powerful beat boss, repeat) Bioware as always however, has a unique talent for making characters mke impressions, you'll have favorites and some things these characters go through or do will excite, appall, disgust, or even sadden you, and i couldn't ask for a more immersive experience there.Dragon age 2 is not without fault however.The battle system:- Mashing A/X is a chore, especially with the rogue, continually mashing A gets to be annoying, and might make you frustrated. But again, it might happen less the more abilities you get.- I still don't get why there isn't a RT activated 3 way replacement menu (3 spell replacement menu on cycle) so that you could have 9 total spells mapped to XYB by pressing RT once to switch to the next set of spells and using LT in conjnuction if you needed to change in a pinch. Still press RT once to change to next subset, and twice to get back. I use more than 6 spells/abilities, and it would have helped, but the Circle menu gets the job done.- The main issue you might see though is the speed at which battles happen, frail characters can be overwhelmed and killed quickly, Hawke can become uncontrollable, and the battle system irritating until you really get a feel for it. But what bothers me is a lot of that 'RPG feel' is lost in the button mash, and essentially the game kind of turns into a hack n' slash dungeon crawler on the surface, but it does get harder and make you micro manage more as time goes on.You either like this decision at core or not, and its game breaking depending on who you are, it may feel dumbed down, but in its defense, combat in DA1 was rather bland in execution, not the animations themselves though.Talking:- This is hit and miss with me, sometimes i want to take a particular route and the option to say whatever is there, but the actual statement isn't what i anticipated. This frustrates me, sometimes I pick a violent sounding response to have it come out as a cold response, or a matter-of-factly response rather than \"i want to slam your face into a wall with a nailbat nine times.\" Its nitpicking but still.Map:- The only other real issue I have is the game's map. I liked the last games map, and this one just gets a bit, i don't want to say confusing, but its more complicated than needbe, and that said, its a bunch of arrows and boxes with Day Night and Mountain options. Still, i think i liked reading my quests, the way they they are set up in the this menu is kind of a to do list, and its a bit irritating, because you now have your quests on your map, but no info about them. Maybe i just haven't gotten used to it.Overall, i think DA2 catches a lot of flak for pushing the game to seem more mainstream, just like Mass Effect did with 2, but honestly, the battle systems being more refined and more actiony typically add to immersion and cause more thinking on the fly. Still the tasks can be mundane this way causing massive horde killing like a action platformer, which occasionally happens. But Bioware games focus a lot on the equipment and stats, its more subtle, but it was very evident in ME and DA. DA2 gives me the ability to run away to heal much easier and to lure darkspawn into traps easier or funnel them. DA1 not so much as you can get hit by attacks based on attack chance rather than location.DA2 is worth a look if you like RPG's or action games. Try the demo on PSN or Xbox live, it will give you a pretty good insight of what to expect, but, the game is much harder than the demo lets it on to be.I'd like to give it a 4.5, but 4 will have to do. Its good, but that's not perfect.**************UPDATE***********************************************************************I have now beaten this game, and have decided to update my review. The rating still stays at 4 stars. The 3rd act is phenomenal in presentation. I was in awe, as all of the things reached a climax and what happens, simply happens. I expected something, but not what happened, and what DID happen was awesome, you'll have to play it.But i do have some new things to review.Dungeons: I am dead serious, about 95% of your quests return you to the same dungeon, a part of the same dungeon, or the same layout for a house or something similar. Every mansion is the same, every undercity is the same, every cave is the same, on one instance is it colored different, but its inexcusable for the lack of creativity in a game like this, even if they were lame or small, the identical dungeons are awful.Even worse, this is coming from the company that baffled me with the amazing dungeons constructed for Origins and Awakening, and you do see that in the well, about 3 dungeons you visit over the course of about 100 sidequests. I have to admit, i was disappointed.Updating the Button mashing, i hate it, i hate it, i hate it. Even as a warrior, it was monotonous, and though extremely useful at times, a button press once could have been used to lock on and auto attack an enemy until dead and tilt stick and attack to choose another target, I did NOT like spamming A, and it does not get better the more you play, you spam A like crazy with the occasional stop to drive your abilites and its usually a split second or a full second before you're back to button mashing. Not to mention, the animations, there are about 5 major looping standard attack animations, and being in control of them somehow made me notice it more. I felt more like Kratos than a general most of the time, i wasn't shouting orders i was an unstoppable monster of death. It didn't work for me, it was like God of War with RPG elements.Weapons and armor: Ok, you cannot customize your friend's gear, you can't wear other class equipment, and often cannot use certain equipment due to stat allocation (magic for warrior) making 66% of the items you pick up or wish to buy in shops completely useless. I question why Bioware did not put a filter in the equipment obtainable. What i mean is, instead of having to accumulate a treasure trove of awesome mage wear as a warrior, why not simply only allow Warrior exclusive items such as plate or chainmail. Weapons, i Can understand since your allies can use them, but armor is exclusively for selling and aside from selling it for pretty much nothing, there is absolutely no hope it will be used or anything other than selling. So why include it? you already have a junk folder in your inventory, so why include yet more junk we can't use right there in the equipment?I don't like the warrior 2 hander, he wings it around like a wiffle bat, it's ridiculous, the weapon has absolutely no illusion of weight at all, and it angers me, Origins showed the power of big weapons but though you hit like atlas, you barely moved, your attacks were slow, but worth it.Spawn, I'm unsure what it is, but this game likes its waves. However units warp in, come out of nowhere, or jump from an obscene height to the ground. Its so unrealistic, and so action platformer.Dragon age 2 is a RPG driven Beat Em Up like God of War or Splatterhouse, it's sad, but its true. It plays well and it has a good story, and as a standalone title, its very very good. However, as a Dragon Age sequel, its a failure. It lacks the inspiration the first game had, its down to earth nature, and its grand world, but retains Bioware's amazing storytelling.Standalone (and my review score: ****Dragon Age sequel: **","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

So you had to button mash 50000000000x a battle.  Some people say this has been patched, but I'll never know because they already fully betrayed my belief in Bioware games.  I won't be buying Dragon Age: Inquisition unless Bioware sends me the $35 I ended up losing by buying this terrible, awful, heartbreaking game that was nothing like it's predecessor which was a classic Bioware RPG (in the style of their D&D earlier RPGs).  The old RPG style was great, this one which is more like God of War (the shallowness) or Dynasty Warriors (the button mashing) = horrible.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Clark Beyer","summary":"It is an overall improvement","reviewText":"Overall, I like Metroid: Zero Mission better than the original Metroid.Here are the improvements of one game to the next:1--The use of power bombs2--The ability to recharge and save your game, as well as using your map.3--The screw attack4--The high-jump ability5--an extended story6--An optional boss that gives you charge beam7--Another boss not included in the original.8--Enhanced graphics, music, and sound.I found that these changes greatly enhanced gameplay.  However, the game is just far tyoo short.  I beat it in 4 hours and 15 minutes on the hardest difficulty.  Sure, they extended the game...but they didn't extend it enough in my opinion.The original Metroid was a bit more challenging, but I like this one better because it took the original Metroid and improved on it.  It gave the game a better feel by enhancing graphics, sound, and music.  It increased Samus' arsenal by giving her all those extra abilities.  It even included an optional boss that pops out from time to time.  You earn the charge beam from it.There is also a new boss that you must fight later on that was not in the original Metroid.  In fact there are two other extra bosses.  And many new enemies as well.But there is one thing I do not like about this game.  In the original Metroid, you beat the game after killing the Mother Brain.  In this game, after you kill it, you get sent to an excavation site, but you CANNOT revisit the earlier parts of the game!  This was a let-down to me, mainly because I like to explore a lot in games so I can collect stuff.  That having been said, I recommend this: in one file, get to the Mother Brain and save.  Now copy that file, but in the second copied file, beat the Mother Brain and then the whole game.  Explore and collect stuff in the first file, and beat the game in the second file.I shall conclude my review with this statement: overall, I think Metroid Zero Mission is better because of all the useful improvements and the extension to the game.  However, it would have been nice to explore more, and if it was more challenging.  Regardless, this game is still fun, and you should buy it, but not for the replay value.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2006"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Gary McCray","summary":"Very solid FPS and a great bargain for quality of game.","reviewText":"By now, Nazis and Soviets have been passe for a long time, but this alternate history Russian Island story is more interesting than you might think.Sort of Half Life and Portal combined with Gears of War and Fallout 3 on a Russian island.It based on the element E99 and its extraordinary capabilities.And you are the American soldier sent in to figure it all out, when, of course everything goes wrong.Weapons and upgrades are very well handled although I would have liked a little more upgrading towards the front of the game rather than becoming virtually indestructible towards the end.I used no cheats so may well not have found all of the upgrade stuff although I learned a long time ago to look in EVERY possible side room or path before following the assigned one.The TMD is a nifty tool, you will like it, learn all it's tricks and use its distance grab feature to get things you aren't near or can't get to.Would have preferred infinite saves to the periodic ones you get and would have definitely liked it better if they always told you when they were saving, rather than just occasionally. But that's a small complaint generally they save often enough and appropriately enough so you don't have to do too much over.If you generally like FPS like Halo, Half Life or Fallout you'll enjoy this game and for 8 bucks you can hardly go wrong.Ending was a little weak, but all complaints are minor, for the price it really is a 5 star game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2012"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Okay but not best in class","reviewText":"BRIEFLYWhile it's unlikely it will ever win any awards on 'looks', the G110 is a good 'typing' keyboard that features solid macro capabilities. The G110 comes short from being 'best in class' but it can be a keeper if, let's say, Santa dropped it under the Christmas tree for someone who really, really wanted a keyboard that did macros and came with a few nice extras.THE KEYBOARD- Packaging, contents -Only good things here. The body, and the wrist rest are packed securely and they are easy to extract and assemble. A special enclosure hosts the CD along with a folded-paper style 'manual' that also includes the warranty statement.- Build, look and feel -While of a sufficiently solid build, there is a feeling of 'cheap plastic' probably because the 'black' is more like a very dark grey and the design is dated, giving the impression of unnecessary bulkiness. However, the keys are placed where expected and typing is good - I am a touch typist so I can tell a good keyboard from a not-so-good one and this happens to be a 'good' keyboard. First I thought that the keys traveling a little too deep when hit would interfere with my typing but this is not the case at all. I can type very fast on the G110 and my typing is as accurate if not more so than on my other gaming keyboard - the beautifulSideWinder X6.Further ergonomic enhancements include the keyboard's ability to rise on its little legs if needed and the detachable hand rest.The keyboard connects to the computer via a reasonably long USB cable that can not be detached. I would have preferred if it connected via a 'standard' USB wire so that a problem with the cable would not make the keyboard unusable but, in fairness, most keyboards are built this way.- Warranty -Logitech provides the usual 1 year limited warranty where Logitech, at its own discretion, will replace or fix your item with a new or refurbished one. And you may have to pay for shipping if the local laws allow for it, and so on. Make sure to save your proof of purchase.GAMING FEATURES- Hardware enhancements -The USB port (not for powered devices) could be viewed as a gaming enhancement. I would have liked to see more than one USB port but even one is a welcome enhancement.The keyboard also comes with headphones and mic jacks, allowing you to plug a non-USB headset directly into the keyboard. Very well placed (above the number keypad) volume scroll, a speaker mute buttons and play/pause, stop, skip buttons are also present.Specifically for gaming activities, there are 12 'G' macro keys on the left side. the M1/M2/M3 and MR buttons above allow the gamer quickly record and assign macros and to switch between 3 macro banks for a total number of 36 macros per profile (software will allow you to specify an infinite number of profiles - see below).Keys backlighting will let the user select one of 4 colors for each of the 3 macro banks and on specific profiles. You can pick a 'custom' color, if so desired but, since all colors are shades in-between red and blue, whatever you pick is going to look more or less like one of the 4 defaults red, blue, purple and cyan. All keys get the same backlight color, except for the M1/M2/M3 wich are always yellow and the MR which is always red when active. Except for the red backlight, the other colors are a little dim and there is no brightness control, only an on/off button.A switch allows for disabling the Windows/Context Menu keys.- Macro capabilities -Once installed, the Key Profiler software will allow for a great deal of flexibility when it comes to customizing each of the 'G' macro keys.On each G key one can:* assign keystrokes* assign a macro by either creating one or picking a previously saved macro* disable the key* invoke the Macro Manager to record a new macro or do some limited editing on an existing macro* assign a specific function such as mail, calculator or media player to the key* assign a shortcut by either browsing or typing it and with the ability of specifying a working directory* assign a text block (simulate typing) with the ability to enter a specific delay time between characters (in milliseconds)* assign a script - this one I could not make it work yet but it seems that Lua is the only supported language.The defaults for the M1 macros are the actual F keys (unless reassigned, F5 will refresh, F1 will bring up help and so on).Outside the Key Profiler, it's possible to quickly assign a macro to a key by pressing the MR key, the specific G key to assign the macro to, typing the required keystrokes and then pressing the MR key again to end the process. It can be all done in a few seconds. If needed, the macro can be later edited with the Macro Manager. Optionally, it's possible to record not only the keystrokes but also the time delays between keystrokes.Besides the Default Configuration, new profiles can be created, imported and so on and each profile can have its own 36 macro key assignments as described above.EVALUATIONI am pleased to state that the keyboard turned out to be better than my initial expectations - looks can and often are deceiving. I was first bothered by the fact that the keys seem to travel more than I thought I was comfortable with but, surprisingly, I could touch-type on it almost immediately without my fingers getting tired. I will not keep the G110 as my own keyboard - the one I use to write long reviews, dozens of emails and create or edit complex documents - because one of my kids really, really wants it and, since he is more of a keyboard gamer than I am, this speaks good for its gaming capabilities.I liked:- the way the keys feel when touch-typing- good placement of certain extra controls such as the volume scroll- the ability to create simple macros on the fly- responsiveness of the macro keys- USB, mic, headphone portsI didn't like:- the bulky design, cheap looks- dim backlight keys, lack of a brightness control, poor color choices- inability to assign backlight colors to the macro keys that are different from those of 'regular' keys- inability to assign macros to the rarely used numeric keypad- the macro editor being only 'basic'While the G110's macro capabilities may appear impressive, just about everything that can be done with it can be also done with many other models, and some can be had for significantly less. Because I find that the G110 'does the job' but it does not stand out apart from the crowd, 3 stars (means \"It's Okay\") would be the fair rating.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2009"}

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

Its not that hard, but its a lot more fun and manageable on easy.The story is good but lacking. It needed to be fleshed out more (there are only 5 or so cutscenes in the entire game). It does a good job of making you feel important and that you are actually making a difference in the game's world (civilians recognize and admire you), but it doesn't really attach you to the characters (no real humor nor romance)Since its Mars, most of your surroundings are brown, but not all. One region is snow capped while another has green vegetation. If you can immerse yourself fully into the world, then the drab brown of Mars will not bother you as much.Your allies can be very annoying at times. They have a habit of crowding around you when you're in a vehicle, but they are useful enough in a firefight.The weapons are fun. Other than the usual pistol, assault rifle and shotgun, you get a very powerful hammer, bombs, mines, an electric gun, a rail gun that sees and shoots through solid wall, a nano rifle that shoots nanobots that disintegrate pretty much anything with a few shots, grenade and rocket launcher and a couple others.The replay is pretty high and the cheats are great. You can unlock unlimited ammo, double your running speed (allowing to to run almost as fast as any of the vehicles), faster re-charge for the jet pack and more.Currently this game is selling for $20 and it is most definitely worth the price (actually its worth $35 in my book).

My complaints are about the games presentation. It has crappy graphics, it looks just like the gamecube version if not slightly worse. All of the dialog is in text form like its 1999. And the whole idea of the wii remote controlling the sword is bs. your motions have nothing to do with links sword. basically you just wiggle your remote left and right as fast as you can and link will do some random slashing until the enemy is dead. So ya your probibly better off getting the gamecube version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2011"}

In short, you are an undercover cop infiltrating the Triads. This means that every single mission you complete has you earning XP towards your Triad and Cop XP levels. While the amount of Triad XP you earn for a mission starts at 0 and you earn it by fighting traid members or completing objectives, the cop XP you earn starts maxed and you lose points for every criminal act outside of mission objectives. So say you are in a car chase, hit a railing? -5 Cop points, Property Damage. Stole a car? -5 Pts. Theft. You have to work pretty hard to keep your Cop XP as you can even lose them for being \"Clumsy\".My problem with the \"Cop XP\" has been that to earn it you pretty much need to do play the game in a very dull way. The game allows you to take a motorcycle blasting through guard rails and drifting around on the sidewalks - if you're willing to earn to Cop XP at all that is. Unfortunately getting Cop and Triad XP is important as without it you are not able to unlock certain perks and abilities that make the game easier as the difficulty ramps up.The difficulty is a roller coaster. While most missions are trivial, many that involve melee are incredibly tedious and frustrating. The combat is well done, and it's actually very enjoyable most of the time. The frustration sets in when you find yourself having to wade through wave after wave after wave of gangsters that you need to beat up all without getting a chance to fully heal up. It doesn't help that the enemies will come at you with knives and meat cleavers which prevent many of your moves from working on them. Oh and if you pick up a knife, you only get a few stabs that it's good for before it's back to punches and kicks. This results in many missions being very tedious unless you had the foresight to eat/drink/tea/massage in game before a mission - that kind of pre mission prep is tedious as well.Melee is at least 80% of combat in this game, guns show up very rarely and shortly. You generally do not get to keep whatever weapons you got in a mission, in the few cases where you are able to hang on to a gun, getting more ammo does not appear to be an option without killing cops for it. It seems odd to me that I as an undercover cop/big time gangster walk around unarmed 99% of the time and have to resort to chasing and punching every single thug that I run into.Speaking of running; Free style running is fun - but like the kung fu, when every mission seems to boil down to a foot chase followed by a fist fight or a fist fight followed by a foot chase or a mishmash of both it's only a matter of hours before you will find yourself screaming \"Can't I just shoot the guy already?!\" as you are given yet another \"chase\" objective.The main quest is well done and enjoyable, the plot is good for a game and lots of extra detail is pushed your way on your phone through the reports you get. Unfortunately it does feel like a good chunk of plot missions is missing from the middle of the game. It's hard to explain where that is without spoilers, but it's pretty jarring - a guy comes to demand a bigger cut and a warning when you say no - next thing you know, you step out of your office into a massive all-out war. It's pretty obvious that something must have happened in between those two events, but it's all handled as one mission and makes little sense. Overall though, the main quest is enjoyable and well done with minimal filler such as the movie star entertainment missions.Side quests, well they leave much to be desired and are extremely repetitive. It's almost ground hog dayish the way you go to bed, wake up, and find out that hey you got to go smash up another race car, and yet another \"hey my car is broken\" scene turns into you getting mugged and having to go chase a thug.Racing - I know many people commented that racing is good in Sleeping Dogs - I disagree. The cars handle oddly with fantastic grip but horrid turning radius, have poor acceleration and feel slow going up the slightest hill. The cars are divided into 4 classes and only the top 3 classes have races. There is no way to customize the cars, so the most expensive Class B car is the best car for a Class B race and so on. You can only race the cars you buy, and when you do buy them, no performance information is given at all. It's unfortunate that you cannot buy any of the race cars with cool paint schemes or steal and store them. I'd welcome a pink slip racing system.Buying cars by the way is somewhat grindy with many cars costing over 500k and missions paying out at most 12k and side quests as little as 2k. You end up having to depend on stealing armored vans, extortions or stealing cars. Stealing cars would be great if you could just snatch up high end cars but you randomly get told what to steal, if you're lucky you're stealing a 80K+ luxury car, if not, it's a 20K subcompact.Finally, I have to say that I hated the radio stations. I realize what they tried to do by putting in tons of in game ads for in game products and it does make the radio stations feel realistic when you switch from one station playing an ad for a candy bar to one playing an ad for a motorcycle to yet another playing an ad for a Kung Fu academy. Yeah it's realistic, real radio stations have lots of ads and that's why I don't listen to real radio stations - it's not really a great idea to reproduce that in a game.PC: The high quality texture pack is a must and will make the game look great. The controls are OK but some defaults are less than ideal such as Q for jumping from bike to car, while using WASD to steer the bike.) The aiming with the mouse does make headshots trivial and as such all the gun encounters are extremely easy. Overall it's a pretty good port.In conclusion, the game is fairly long (26h for me to finish), has some novel ideas and a unique setting, but it's hard for me to recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2012"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"An enjoyable action-based RPG which has aged well","reviewText":"A band of adventurers arrive at Easthaven, a town in the Icewind Dale region of Faerun, far to the north of most civilised lands on the far side of the Spine of the World. The town's mayor asks the adventurers to travel to Kuldahar, a village of druids in the foothills of the mountains, where they have reported strange goings-on. The adventurers agree, but are cut off in the foothills by an avalanche. Proceeding to Kuldahar on foot through an area inhabited by hostile creatures, the adventurers learn of a threat to all of Faerun that is developing in the mountains and the caverns under them, and they must defeat this threat before it's too late.Originally released in 2000, Icewind Dale was the third of the Dungeons and Dragons games using the Infinity Engine, developed by BioWare and Black Isle (now Obsidian). These three games were effectively an attempt to corner three distinct types of fantasy: Planescape: Torment was the 'arty', literary and philosophical game, essentially a video game equivalent to Gene Wolfe, whilst Baldur's Gate was the more traditional large-scale, long, broad-based and well-characterised epic, following in the trail of Tolkien. Icewind Dale, on the other hand, was the much more combat-oriented, sword and sorcery adventure, much more of a romp than the other two. This led it to getting somewhat mixed reviews at the time, though viewed in isolation from its forebears, its positive aspects become much more apparent.Starting off, Icewind Dale has you creating all six characters in the party, giving them names and deciding on their races and character classes. This is unlike Baldur's Gate, where you only created the leading character and then picked from a range of pre-existing companions, and also unlike Planescape: Torment, where you had a pre-generated character (though you could change his stats). This is the biggest change from the other games, since your party is totally user-generated there is little to none of the party interplay seen elsewhere. There is no possibility of romances or rivalries erupting between party-members, which removes some of the flavour and unpredictability of the earlier games, but also makes Icewind Dale a lot more old-school and traditional, which is not entirely a bad thing.Once you've created your party, it's RPG business as usual. You can explore the opening town, solve a few puzzles (usually through item quests or combat, though you can resolve a few quests through dialogue alone) and so on before you're given the main quest. You have to fight your way through the mountains to Kuldahar (a town built in and around a colossal tree), which becomes your base of operations as you range out on various missions for the denizens of the town. These involve a lot of dungeon explorations and assaults on temples and castles held by various enemies, so a combat-focused party is a must, though the prevalence of traps and sorcerous opponents means you want to bring a thief and at least a couple of magic-users along as well.The game is well-written, but compared to the other Infinity Engine games straightforward (indeed, somewhat refreshingly so at times). There's a few nice twists but generally what you see is what you get, and what you get is a metric ton of combat. You fight dozens of different types of enemies, from orcs to powerful enemy wizards, and amass vast quantities of loot. You also level up at a rate of knots compared to other D&D-based; games. Generally speaking, if more than ten minutes go by without a ferocious combat sequence, something's gone wrong somewhere.Luckily, Icewind Dale uses a later iteration of the Infinity Engine, with stronger graphics (including the heaven-sent ability to change the graphics resolution to something bearable on a modern PC), a friendlier interface and more options for character classes and combat (not to mention being able to carry lots more loot). In fact, if you ignore the simple fact that the game is 2D and sprite-based (there are 3D options for spell effects, but these tend to be hit and miss with modern graphics cards), it's aged very well indeed. The hand-painted environments are gorgeous, the sound and music is of a very high quality and the combat is fast and furious (though, as usual, you can hit space to pause the game at any time to issue fresh orders). The pace is only let down by the traditional D&D; problem of having to rest every couple of fights to replenish spells, or having to quick-travel back to Kuldahar to unload the frankly ludicrous amounts of loot you amass on your quests at regular intervals. The game also ties in nicely (and unexpectedly) with the Icewind Dale trilogy of novels by R.A. Salvatore, despite taking place almost a century earlier (and fifteen years before Drizzt Do'Urden arrives in the area). This tie-in is very logical and satisfying, compared to the more obvious (and cheesy) cameos in the Baldur's Gate series.The minuses are, for the most part, the obvious side-effects of the positives. Almost every situation in the game is solved by you hacking your way through it (though there are a few more original and interesting puzzles along the way), and overall the game lacks subtlety. The writing and moody black-and-white cut scenes are great, but given you spend a lot of time in combat-focused dungeons, some time can go by between plot-related events happening, which occasionally threatens to reduce the game to a hard grind. And, as great as the graphics are, the harsh snow backdrops and the very large creatures show up some issues with the engine, leading to some pixellation. The combat focus of the game also means it's pretty unforgiving and total party kills are not uncommon. As with all Infinity Engine games, but moreso here, you need to have a finger hovering over the quicksave button at almost all times and remember to save between combats, before resting, after resting, before tackling a complex trap (especially the ones which can backfire and blow up your entire party if you fail a roll) and at least every five minutes regardless of anything else.That said, the game's not quite a brainless hack 'em up. The story, which it kicks in every now and then, is intriguing and the writing, when it does appear, is generally pretty good (as you'd expect from some of the same team behind Planescape: Torment). These elements give the game a bit more depth than its reputation suggests. In fact, if the game does suffer in departments, it's usually through comparisons to its contemporaries. Taken on its own merits and in isolation, a rewarding and impressive CRPG emerges.Icewind Dale (****) is a fun, furious and enjoyable roleplaying game which has aged excellently, and is let down only in comparison to more story and roleplaying-focused RPGs. For those looking into a great dungeon-exploring or more action-based RPG, Icewind Dale more than satisfies.Due to the game's age, there are a variety of ways of getting it. The Good Old Games edition may be preferable since it has been optimised to run on Windows 7 and Vista with no problems, and also includes the free expansion Trials of the Luremaster (which needs to be downloaded separately for the other editions). You can also get it as part of a triple-pack with the paid-for expansion, Heart of Winter, and Icewind Dale II (UK, USA) or as a boxed copy with just the expansion (UK, USA).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2011"}

I had almost cancelled my order with Amazon, but they had already charged my card when i found out they had run out of the bundles, even though i preordered on the 20th of october. thats what a preorder is isnt it? to have atleast enough for the preorders? well, i also had found out that the game promised on the other page was not going to be included; i argued with customer service multiple times and overall they compensated me $25. the thing that surprised me however, was that after i had recieved my order yesterday, they still sent me an email for $59.99 off of resistance 3, so completely free. so, i got the bundle and the game, and $25 extra, all for when i was only supposed to be getting the bundle. Amazon usually is very good, i get virtually every electronic item i buy, from amazon, and i had never had this problem, so when this happened i was pissed. then yesterday they send me the email for R3 for free? i felt like everything would be forgotten soon, and in fact i just preordered the PSVita Bundle from amazon, hoping they actually ship it on time and keep their promise of (possible) preorder bonuses.Now onto the bundle itself:It comes with:the Playstation 3D display (not a tv, no cable tuner or remote), Base and Base connector included1 pair of 3D simulview glasses, with 6\" usb charger1 HDMI Cable, capable of full 1080p, 3D, and Ethernet.1 Copy of Motorstorm Apocalypse (only game i know of at this point with simulview capabilities)various manuals and instructions.the tv itself is amazing quality. in fact, i am making this review on it right now. it has 2 HDMI connectors for pc, ps3, xbox, blue ray, etc. 1 component, for i am assuming, like i do, record gameplay, major game capture devices like the Roxio game capture card and the hauppage HDPVR use component cables. being that the display is made for gamers would mean they would realize this. using HDMI is quite stunning. in 2D, everything is crisp and clear, bright and vivid; one of the better displays out there. there is a little bit of smudging it appears, or in another review, dust. it is only visible with a all white screen or from not looking head on. i am assuming it is something to do with 3D, which is great, but the i havent explored it enough to fully give a reliable review on that part, but once i start playing uncharted 3 and assassins creed revelations in 3D i am sure to be blown away. the component is as good as i expected, but not better or worse. there is quite a bit of ghosting, due to the fact i can only record in 1080i with my Roxio, which is a capture card, not an hdpvr, but its pretty good none the less. link to unboxing/gameplay/setup: [...]the 3D glasses themselves are, i am sorry to say, made of low grade plastic, and seem like it would be easy to break them. not bad though considering the price, and they are the only glasses on the market that support simulview right now. work well enough though. the usb cord included to charge the glasses are TINY. literally 6\", not quite enough. not a big problem though, any micro usb charger will do i believe.HDMI cable is a good quality, sony cord. delivers 1080p+ and 3D obviously, and Ethernet. Nothing much to say...I was not able to test the simulview with motorstorm, having this purchase totally tanked me; i am broke, so therefore i was not able to get an extra pair of glasses, sorry.the manuals i found, except for the 3D glasses one, are completely unneeded. setup was the easiest technical setup ever, slap the base together, put the display on it, merely another snap, plug the power in, plug something in eg. ps3, and you are ready to go, 3d even.all in all, i think this bundle was a worthwhile and useful purchase, maybe not $500 worth, but definately quality; it will last awhile, and will continue to be one of the better looking pictures for 2D and 3D. i can tell you i will entirely enjoy it, now and for a long, long time. forgetting the trouble with amazon, and this was a solid purchase. if you are willing to pay $500, definately a must buy, but buy it at gamestop while uncharted 3 is included at no extra cost; Resistance 3 was just a preorder bonus.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"A Monumental Achievement for the PS3","reviewText":"Pros:+Absolutely gorgeous game+Strong voice acting and production values+Lots of gameplay+Well Presented Story+Likable characters+Very well written script+Excellent MultiplayerCons:-A Couple of Trial and Error Moments.  There are just moments in the game where it's too easy to die because you just don't know what to doThis review is pretty lengthy...In 2007, just a year after the release of the Playstation 3, a little game called Uncharted: Drake's Fortune dropped down.  It was by far one of the best games on the PS3.  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a masterpiece.  Unfortunately the adventure wasn't very long.  Uncharted 2 is much better than the game which precedes it by keeping intact what worked, but keeping the action coming swiftly and even improving on areas the first game didn't do so well in.Uncharted 2 begins in the midst of the action.  Nathan Drake returns and the moment Uncharted 2 starts off he's already in a heap of trouble.  He's been unconscious, and when he comes too he realizes that not only is he covered in a lot of blood, but that he's also on a train car that's perched on the edge of a mountain.  He just barely escapes before the train goes teetering over.  But how did he get there, exactly?  And what's going on?  This is what you're about to find out.  The game begins with you on the train but you'll quickly play through everything which lead him to his current situation.  Throughout the story you'll find yourself meeting a lot of interesting characters.  There's Harry Flynn and an old flame of Nate's named Chloe Frazer.  Together these three are interested in the secrets of Marco Polo's missing fleet.  But their only lead is an old oil lamp that supposedly holds the secrets.  So Nate, Flynn and Chloe opt to break into a museum and claim it for themselves.  Of course, it isn't that simple, and someone else is also after the treasure.  His name is Lazarevic--a war criminal that can be really nasty.I guess we might as well get this out of the way.  Uncharted 2 is absolutely gorgeous looking.  It is by far the prettiest game I've ever seen.  The environments are absorbing and incredible to behold.  Not only is the scenery breathtaking but the actions of the characters are fluid and all of the little details really stand out.  There are few games where I stop and just marvel at how extraordinary they look, but Uncharted 2 is one of them.  The first game was expertly designed as it is, but the second manages to outdo it.  It's one of the few games on the console that showcases just what the PS3 can really do.  The game knows it looks good and directs your attention to all the details.  Despite it being stunning visually, you won't find yourself getting lost much.  There's plenty to explore, but for the most part, Uncharted 2 is rather linear.  There's always a set path ahead of you and rarely anything off the beaten path.  That might be a downer for some, but the adventure in and of itself is still worth it.Looking good doesn't matter if the gameplay isn't great to back it up, however.  Uncharted 2 plays very similarly to the first one, and that's not so bad.  You'll pick up guns and get into gun fights, of course.  And some of them are pretty challenging.  The game utilizes a cover system where you'll duck behind cover, pop up and shoot.  You don't have to do this, but the game has its way of urging.  You can only take so much damage before you die.  Hiding behind objects is important.  Some of it will be destroyed easily, but most of what you hide behind makes for good cover.  If you don't want to shoot most of your enemies you can perform melee combos.  This works much more smoothly and fluently in Uncharted 2 than it does in the first one.  It's much more fluid and precise, though melee combat can still feel like button mashing at times, but at least it isn't useless.  There's also an emphasis on stealth in some areas, and thus stealth kills are also a lot easier to pull off.  Certain aspects have also been improved.  In the first game, for example, throwing grenades used the tilting controls which felt gimmicky.  Throwing grenades is much easier.  When walking across certain ledges you also won't have to do a balancing act using the controller either.  This makes using grenades in the middle of combat much more useful than before.  Though if you adjusted to the first one really well, you can enable those motion controls for grenades.Another aspect that Uncharted is big on is some of it's platforming elements.  As Nate, you'll be hanging from ledges and scaling walls and the like.  You'll also be jumping from certain platforms to the next.  This isn't as dangerous as you might think.  For the most part you'd have to really try to miss a jump.  The game doesn't guide you per se, it's just to say that timing isn't the most important thing.  In fact, in most cases missing a jump comes from jumping too soon rather than too late... or neglecting to take in your surroundings.  But it's pretty simple to get the hang of.There are also puzzle elements to the game.  Most of the puzzles aren't really challenging in the slightest, but you might find your wits tested.  If you ever actually do get stuck on a puzzle or can't seem to figure out where to go, the game has a built in hint system to help your.  The game is willing to point you in the right direction when it needs to but it won't always hold your hand.  For example it might tell you what you need to do but not necessarily how to do it.  A hint will only present itself if you seem really stuck, and if you want you can turn the option off altogether.The pacing of the game is much better than the first.  The action and adventure hardly slows down, but most of all the twists and turns in the story don't feel so awkward.  There's a neat balance of gunplay, puzzle solving and transitioning from one part of the game to another.  The story also isn't bogged down in too many cutscenes, but they do their job.  You CAN skip the cutscenes, though, which is a big plus.  On the other hand, you might not want to.  The cutscenes are some of Uncharted 2's strong points.Presentation in your story is everything and Uncharted 2 does this well.  The script is very well written with some crafty dialog.  Some of which will make you laugh.  Even during moments of gameplay Nate and whoever he's with might start up a conversation, throwing a couple of jokes out there that you might laugh at.  Uncharted 2 isn't a comedic genius of a game, but it hardly tries to be more clever than it actually is.  And through these moments you get to learn about the characters and those you're meeting along the way.  As with the rest of game, the cutscenes are gorgeous and fluent.  The voice acting is among some of the best you'll hear in the video game industry.  And not just that, but the music is also spot on and sets the tone rather nicely.Uncharted 2 has multiplayer.  You can play a standard deathmatch, a team deathmatch, matches where you'll claim territory and capture the flag.  All this is worthwhile because the multiplayer is just so damn addictive.  You don't have to be a pro to get up and go on it either.  All you need is knowledge of the game.  It's amazing just how fun the multiplayer can really be.  There's also a bit of co-op multiplayer where you can play through missions with two other allies and a horde mode as well.  For such a simple game, the multiplayer gives you a lot of things to do, and it's refreshingly addictive.There's not much which really holds Uncharted 2 down.  One thing that might start to grate on some nerves might be that some of the gunfights can be hectic, but the other big part of that just might get on some nerves is that there are certain parts throughout the game that can feel like trial and error at times.  You might have to die before you realize what it is you're actually supposed to do.  Most times upon finding out you might slap yourself and think it's so obvious.  Some of these moments will come from being impatient, others will come because the game throws you into the action immediately after a cutscene where the goal may not actually be to kill what's there but actually to run or something like that.  You just might die in Uncharted 2 several times because at some moments you just don't know what to do.  It's hardly frustrating, but it does mean you might find yourself dying or failing certain parts of the game needlessly.On the other hand, it's nice as to just what Uncharted 2 does add to the experience.  Most of it is more action.  The first game was very much just you running from one gun fight to the next.  Uncharted 2 throws in some interesting bits such as a moment where you have to help an injured ally escape a tough situation while you're constantly being targeted.  Other moments include breaking into a museum and sneaking by the guards without getting caught and much more.  There's just a lot more variety to the gameplay than what you got in the first game.  As a result some moments of Uncharted 2 are just all out thrilling.  There's still the idea of progressing from one gun fight to the next, but it's nice to know there are other things being thrown at you this time around.Uncharted 2 is impressive.  It is easily one of the best games on the PS3.  Those who enjoyed the first one just might like Uncharted 2 better because it improves upon its prequel in various ways and ups the ante.  If you enjoyed Nathan Drake's first adventure... there's not reason not to give his second a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

It's Super Mario Bros. as we all know and love it.  To compare it to earlier titles, think of this as a hybrid of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  Unfortunately, this reviewer feels that this game somehow misses the mark.The good:It has the same great level design as you've come to expect.  The levels get pretty challenging later on, which adds some extra oomph.  It has the same charming minigames you've seen in SMB3, such as the card-matching game, and some of the minigames from the DS version of New Super Mario Bros.  The graphics are pleasant and colorful and the music is nice too.  Yoshi returns in 2D gameplay, which was a huge plus for me and is something I felt was missing from post-SMW Mario titles.  Multiplayer provides some great chaos, and is an exceptionally fun part of the experience.The bad:The levels are way too short.  To me, they just seem to end abruptly and too soon, and not in a good way.  I felt as though I missed the fun of the game because before I knew it I was fighting the end bosses.  Multiplayer actually starts getting in the way during the later, more difficult levels.  The save system is antiquated as all heck.  Nowadays, a game like this should let you save anytime.  Instead, you can only save after beating a castle.  Considering that you might want to go back and get star coins or Toads that you may have missed, it's tedious to have to do a level over again just to save.  I hope you don't have to end your game abruptly!  There is a quick-save option, but I somehow don't trust it.  That's just me though.  Finally, the game feels rather short and somewhat lacking in content, considering that this is on Nintendo's flagship console.  It lacks the vast scope that Super Mario World had, and that was something I was expecting.  The DS version feels superior, as it's a perfect idea for a handheld game.  However, on a full console, this same concept feels like a port even though it's an all-new game.  Supporting this observation is that fact that this game is only 300 MB large, which is a tiny fraction of what can fit on a Wii disc.  There could've been SO much more content.  The lack of any online support is strikingly disturbing.  Yes, I know this is Mario, but as I said, it's on an internet-enabled next-gen console and has multiplayer as one of its main draws.  In this day and age, it needs to go online.  Overall, it just seems like this game was a mere afterthought in Nintendo's planning.Is it a good game?  Yes.  Is it worth buying?  Of course.  I just wish it had more scope, more secrets, more levels like Super Mario World.  To me, that's the best 2D Mario game ever made.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0009UC6AI","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Creepy, but not in the cheesy horror flick way","reviewText":"Fatal Frame is a highly overlooked series that has done a great job in the survival horror genre.  It used eerie effects that just don't seem to work in you average everyday horror game.  You have a camera, you are attacked by ghosts and you never know if you're truly alone.This game reminds me of another game I have played and that is Silent Hill 4: the Room.  Why is that?  Because you play as Rei, who is having terrible nightmares.  Whenever you fall asleep you go to the Manor of Sleep where tragic accidents occured.  After exploring a bit, or leaving the manor, you wake up and enter the real world which is your house.  The connection here is that Konami did a similar thing in SH4 by having your character enter his appartment after he entered a portal.Not that this is a bad thing or anything, it just kind of takes away that feeling of despair that the Lost Village (FF2:CB) or the Himuro Mansion (FF) had on you.  The other unique thing in this game is the ability to play as three characters.  They are Rei Kurosawa, a woman who has lost her fiancee in an accident, Miku Hanisaki, the protaginist of the first game who still has remorse for what happened to her brother, and the newbie Kei Amakura, who is having trouble with his niece, Mio (FF2:CB) who went into a state of illness after her twin sister disappeared.Each of these character's has a unique ability, Rei can stun enemies with the Flash of the camera obscura.  Kei can hide from vengeful spirits by ducking and can move things that the woman can't (ex: dressers).  And my favorite, Miku's ability to slow down time, which can be used to execute Fatal Frames easier or to run away from a ghost before it attacks you.The storyline in this game is not as creepy as the other games, but it still is cliff hanging.  The game will keep you guessing till the end, which it always does.I'd reccommend this to all audiences especially if you like suspense and horror.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2005"}

That is why i like to play 3 player because there is only one cpu and he is usually average. This game really never gets frustrating but it can make u mad.

Even in daylight, it manages to keep you on your toes. The limited amount of health and hordes of zombies ensure that you have to be ready at any moment.-The game is VERY realistic. You have to stop thinking in terms of \"Im playing a videogame\" and start thinking in terms of \"this is happening, what do I do?\" For instance, to get inside a gas station you might have to climb a ladder and break in through a window at the top. If you dont think \"This is a window, it will break, I need to try hitting it\" then you wont get in.-The graphics are good and the controls are decent after you learn them. The game always runs smoothly.-Online play is great, its fun to kill zombies with friends and this is one of the best games for that!-Lots of things to do. Driving over zombies never get old. An endless world to explore, very open ended.-RPG elements with leveling is always a welcome addition to the survival horror world.-Questing can be funNow for the bad:-Theres not alot of guns or enemy variety. Its almost blasphemous to have a melee focused zombie game. I know this is my opinion, but it is what it is.-The weapons have limited durability. I knew this before getting the game, but decided to try it out anyway. In my humble opinion, this just doesnt work the best. I admit im a huge fan of looting. And the fact that I get an awesome weapon and it just wears down and breaks so rapidly.... its very unrewarding....-Some quests Ive tried have been broken, especially during multiplayer. They wont let you complete the quest as it should be. To be fair, ive restated the PS3 and the quests have worked just fine.-Quests can get redundant... fast....-Although main quests show you where to go, its often still hard to figure out what their expecting of you. For instance \"Search both gas stations and get 2 boxes of juice\".  After you do that and go back, the quest isnt completed. You have to take the juice and set it in a designated area that the map doesnt lead you to, that you have no way of knowing thats where the fracking juice goes!In conclusion dead island is a decent game. I believe the questing is the weakest point of the game and it really takes alot of the fun away. Also, if they made weapons more durable and finding better weapons more rewarding, it would help. But multiplayer is a blast and it will terrify you till the very end.*Update*Since the first patch, questing seems more user friendly. However, autosave has not worked right and I have lost progress. Also, I havent been able to join games correctly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

I've been playing all types of shooters, such as, Resistance 2, Killzone 2, Modern Warfare 2, Bioshock 1&2, Borderlands, and Bad Company 2. The reason I didn't pick up MAG on release date is because I heard alot of bad press about it, so I waited when the price was just right.As for the game, the game was not good whatsoever, I felt the controls were too tight, the graphics were terrible (Resistance 2 has better graphics), every gun felt the same, and why did Zipper (game developer) included friendly fire. My first hour of gameplay I died 5x by teammates (i was killed on purpose). Furthermore, you have to pick one faction in the game (sver, raven or valor). However, if you want to play with multiple factions at one time you'll need to pay 99 cents a month (outrageous). I felt this game is an embarrassment in the first-person-shooter genre and Sony's library of video games.Having said that, if you want to try out a great shooter I would recommend Bad Company 2. The controls are perfect, weapons are great, the designs of the maps are incredible, and there are many vehicles you can choose from. I had my reservations about BC2, but once I started to experience the overall quality of the game I couldn't stop playing. What I like about Bad Company 2, it sets apart from the other shooter games I experienced, such as the destructive environments and the vehicle usage. The destructive environments is a nice touch, because when you want to shoot a member from the opposing team and he's hiding behind a tree, house or a brick wall you can throw a grenade, rocket launcher, or any other explosive to expose him to your teammates or take him out yourself. As for the vehicles, there are 15 different types of vehicles in total to choose from and it feels great when you can hop into one and drive it around. For example, you can drive a M3A3 Bradley tank or fly AN-64 Apache helicopter to take out the opposing team members. Therefore, I would recommend to pick BC2 over MAG.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness.

There is not much you can do with this game unless you have X Box Live.  The single player missions are pretty boring and you will get tired of them within the first 15 minutes or so.  I don't have X Box Live, so I can not comment on the game play online.Pros:  None that I could see.  There are better first person  shooters out there.Cons:  Lack of game play offline.

I still have not beat it and I bought it as soon as it came out lol.  I like to play games slow plus I was in a coma for 2 months and recovered over the next year.  Anyway this is an amazing game.  What you must do is build cities up to 100%.  You collect the materials from battles or from just going out and buying them.  Then you use them to build your towns anyway you want.  You can add anything, even if it is not needed.  You will get a good feeling when you see your town at 100%.  Then you can go into the future and walk through the town and see how it has grown or you can go into the past and see it.  The graphics are great and have for a long time been my favorite RPG graphics.  The controls are perfect.  You can swing your wrench with no trouble at all.  Also speaking of your weapon you can upgrade it.  It will tell you when you have enough stats to upgrade the weapon.  Another cool thing is you have a camera.  You can take pictures of stuff and save the pics.  Sometimes the puictures will give you an idea to build something.  Be it a weapon or even a fish tank to keep you fish in.  Yes there are fish and you have to feed them and bread the.  It is very fun to get a hook and bait and go fishing in the little lakes and rivers in the game.  The last thing I will tell you about is the ridepod.  This is something that you ride around in.  You can build it up over time and make it look totally diffrent.  Also you can add new weapons and make it either fly or ride on weels.  What it all comes down to is Dark Cloud 2 is an amazing amazing game.  I never ehar that much about it which is crazy because it deserves all tyhe attention.  Give it a try won't ya?  If you played Dark Cloud and hated it do not worry this is alot diffrent but still the same.  If that makes any sense.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPN","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Like Rogue Squadron on cheats","reviewText":"With Episode III of the Star Wars saga hitting theaters next year, Lucasfilm licensing is taking the time to flesh out the battles of the Clone Wars through various forms of media - this video game is one of them. You start out at the battle of Geonosis from Episode II and work your way through the war campaign by campaign.If you've ever played any of the games in the Rogue Squadron series (and by extension Battle for Naboo and Starfighter) you'll know what to expect. However, whereas those games required a more thoughtful and tactical approach to each mission, Clone Wars puts the emphasis on all-out carnage. Mission objectives are really vague excuses for you to blast and blow up the hoardes of enemies the game tosses at you. There are missile and health refills aplenty, and the convoys you occasionally have to protect are in nowhere near the danger the ones in Rogue Squadron faced. I wouldn't say the game is easy, but it's not nerve-wracking either. It's like a cheat version of Rogue Squadron where you get to blow stuff up and go crazy without worrying too much about the consequences, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.The graphics are okay. Emphasis was placed on getting as many bad guys onscreen with a respectable framerate instead of making everything look pretty, and it was a smart decision. You'll be too busy staying alive to care that the visuals aren't as advanced as other titles. Sound and story, which LucasArts usually excels at, are disappointing here. The in-game sounds are great, but the cutscenes are compressed. The story itself isn't that great either, with bland voice-acting. I'd rather fight seperate, non-related missions than have them all link together with a convoluted story.In the end, Clone Wars is a decent game to pick up and play for a few rounds of mayhem. It's not a standout game by any means, but it's a recommended purchase for Star Wars fans and anyone wanting mindless excitement.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2004"}

It's a first person game where you can choose to play one of the four characters: The soldier, the hunter, the siren, and brick. It's controls are easy to master and the game is very complicated which makes this game worth hours of your time which I love. It took me a whole MONTH to complete it the first time around(although I was about 11 so It was probably harder for me). Now for a few negative comments. Like I said, I love this game, but it would glitch on one thing. Once I beat the game and played it over as a higher level I got to a mission that I couldn't turn in. I had to fix this vending machine called a \"med vendor\" and then buy a shield from it. I bought the shield and did everything it said, but it wouldn't let me turn the mission in.

Over time, you'll do battle on the front lines of both sides as this shift reveals high-stakes arms threats and a terrifying glimpse of the future.HAWX: The Elite, High Altitude Warfare eXperimental SquadronYou'll begin the game as former U.S. Air Force Pilot David Crinshaw, assigned to provide air support for the well-known Ghost Recon team. You and your fellow HAWX pilots are some of the most highly-trained specialists in the world. Based out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, you're tasked with everything from testing secret and experimental aircraft weapon systems to carrying out combat and recon missions, training other top pilots, and attempting to capture enemy technologies.With the rise of the PMCs, your unique skills in higher demand than ever before. And with 49 playable planes available in game, plus additional planes available to some pilots through pre-order bonuses or VIP memberships, there's no shortage of sleek, fast, deadly aircraft at your disposal as you put your skills to use.An Iconic, Enhanced Reality System to Help You Deliver ResultsWhen you're in the midst of a firefight, E.R.S. in-game technology can help anyone survive, if you know how to take advantage of it. Featuring incoming missile detection, an anti-crash system, damage assessment, a tactical map, and weapons trajectory control, E.R.S. even allows you to issue orders to your squadron and other units, much like the iconic Cross-Com system in other Tom Clancy games. When you're getting started, you can ease into the rigors of flight and gain confidence by using a special assistance mode that offers support through the E.R.S. This mode can be switched off at any time, deactivating safety features and allowing you to perform advanced maneuvers.Cutting-Edge Realism and Innovative Multi-Player ModesWhether you're in a classic F15 Fighting Falcon or a new-generation Gripen, the controls and flight graphics are designed to keep you on your toes.

Realism or arcade.  Which one to be?Flight sims are more at home on a PC, where you can assign a million different functions to the keyboard.  On a console, you've got a lot less buttons.  The developers decided to balance the entire spectrum of realism vs arcade flight sim aspects and wedge it all onto a console.With that in mind, we have HAWX.  The controls are not perfect, but I feel they are a good balance for a flight sim that is decidedly more arcade that \"real.\"  The control layout is as intuitive as you can get.  Throttle and weapon selections are spot on for a flight sim.  It is the gameplay package that surrounds the controls that many will love or hate.  I mean you only have so many buttons, how much control can you really have?HAWX main hook is its assistance modes.  You can turn them on and off by double tapping L2 or R2.  Most of your time will be spent with assistance on.  In this mode you are in a third person view of your plane.  You can maneuver and engage in general combat fairly well.It is the assistance off mode that will separate the fighter jocks from the boys (i.e. the rest of us). Trigger this mode and the camera pulls way back.  With this mode, your point of view is oriented relative to the target you are locked on to, but your controls are not.  This will disorient some gamers.  But, this is where the magic happens.  You can make your aircraft perform some truly amazing acrobatic feats, like somersaulting over a missile or instantly reversing course to get the drop on your enemies.Combat is very enjoyable.  It is exciting and fast paced.  Your wingmen earn their keep.  If you order them to attack a target, then they will almost certainly take it out.The only thing that is truly \"broken\" is the sense of speed.  I never felt like I was truly zipping along at Mach 2 in an F-14.  It is made even more frustrating by the fact that your wingmen seem to be able to  fly much faster than you can.  This is a shame considering all the times I was racing from one furball to the next.The missions are good, but the lack of secondary objectives will bore some gamers.  The story unfolds during combat.  It just does not feel \"fleshed out.\"  If anyone remembers all the storytelling done during gameplay in the old TIE Fighter game for the PC, then you know what I mean.The graphics are incredible.  There are times I almost forgot I was playing a game and not watching a movie.At the end of the day, HAWX is a very worthwhile game.  Flight sims are a very much underrated genre on consoles.  Most gamers overlook them for FPS and racing games.  Fortunately, HAWX does not disappoint.UPDATE:I have tooled around in multiplayer mode.  For the most part, it works well.  There is some occasional lag during an online death match.  This is frustrating when you have an opponent in your sights only to have him jump to a different position.  The game assumes you will play multiplayer when it comes to experience points.  Your ability to earn XP in the campaign is basically over when you finish it.  Players will need to turn to multiplayer to obtain higher ranks to unlock new aircraft and weapon configurations.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSO0","description":"The Simshas much in common withTony Hawk's Pro Skater: There's a great emphasis trial and error, it encourages personalized solutions to problems, and overall success comes down to both balance and timing. Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom.

It keeps me up all night and destroys my life! There should be laws against games being this FUN! Ok, I've been playing 'The Sims' on PC for a few years now so I pretty much knew what I was doing as soon as I started my PS2. I did expect a bit more from it. First of all there is the Sim's skins. You can make them look more individual by changing the shape of their faces but you can't change their body weight very much. The fattest a person can get still looks like a super model. And you can't make them look really old either besides giving them grey or bald heads. Also, I was hoping for more clothes. The game itself is almost identical to the PC version. The only difference is graphics and control. The Sims talk and move exactly the same as in the PC version too. You also have less options of what to do with your Sim than on the PC. 'Hot Date' and other expansion packs have not been included on this game. So it's basically the first installation of the PC game. There is the mission mode and 2 player but I think most people play the classic way. With all the Sims has for PS2 and all it is lacking of the PC versions it is still an extremely addicting game.Graphics: 4.0  It's 100 times better than the PC version but also 100 times worse than the great PS2 games out there.Sound: 4.0  Most of the sounds have been directly copied from the PC to the PS2. I was hoping for something a bit different.Control: 4.5  The PS2 controller works great for this game but it's still a lot easier using a mouse.Fun Factor: 5.0  If you start playing you wont stop.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2003"}

NBA2K11 has set a standard that the EA Sports division as a whole needs to take note of. But then the 2K sports series always seems to have been doing this for awhile now and the only thing that is saving EA Sports right now is its lock on the NCAA and NFL licenses.From the moment the game starts, you know you are in for a treat as the `new gimmick' of Jordan's addition is clearly apparent. But for those of us that have been gaming for awhile aren't looking at this as a gimmick. I know for myself, the opening game from the 1991 Finals brought back memories of the first of the EA Sports games for the Genesis Bulls vs Lakers but now it's come back full circle. High res graphics, player models and and great commentary (even a YOUNG Phil Jackson!) makes me almost cry! Remembering that all those years ago, the closest we got to playing this game were sprites and numbers makes this game a dream come true!So, let me stop waxing nostalgic and talk about everything else. While the opening game is great, for those that could care less about this are going to be frustrated that they can't immediately go through to the menu. To me, that is one minor negative but once you do get through that one thing that I did like was that 2K cleaned up the mess of an interface from last year and made the menus this year a lot easier to navigate through. As always, customize as you see fit.Some may complain that this game is another roster update but I know for myself, I played 2K6 and 2K7, skipped 8 and 9 but I got last year's game and was amazed with the Living NBA feature which has made it back and the NBA Today feature.  One thing that I have always loved about this series that EA Sports needs to take notes on, is that the 2K Sports series doesn't always try to throw a gimmick every year with a `new controller feature' or something so totally lame that it breaks the game instead of enhancing it (YES EA GAMEFLOW IS BULLHOEY!!). To its core, NBA2K11 is essentially the same game that you have played for years following the philosophy of `if it ain't broke don't fix it\" but the beauty of this is 2K spent more time tinkering with improving the AI and player animations and it shows. The control scheme is essentially the same but the ball animations and player reactions to the controls have improved much since last year. Playing around with NBA 2K11 shows that given time, it almost becomes a living breathing thing that, if you didn't know any better, you were watching an actual game rather than a video game.Now as much as I like Jordan, one small distraction is that the game is littered with almost any and everything Jordan throughout the game but considering what it takes to get him to endorse anything and because of those endorsements, products will sell, I can let it slide.One thing that is fun however are the Jordan challenges and if that is this year's `gimmick' which  came along with getting Jordan to endorse this game, it's a great one and I spent a lot of time trying to play through these challenges so I can unlock Jordan. I haven't done it yet but I have unlocked a few of the sneakers!I won't repeat too much of what the previous reviewers have said but getting back to the presentation as always it's slick even in between quarters, watching a pseudo commercial about upcoming matches tends to be fun, the  time show is a bit more improved this time around as I liked how the commentating crew talks about other games being played in the league now I am wondering if I started playing the Association, if there will also be game highlights. The commentary and crowd reaction is as kinetic as ever and people always tend to get on the commentators repeating things but I mean come on, we know it's going to happen, but the commentating on here is better than what you get in some EA games. It's still cool to hear them talk about your player's performance from a few nights ago and instead of making up some imaginary number, that stat was indeed true.As far as other extras, I tinkered around with the black court games and with that came some of the usual suspects of 21, 3pt Shootout and more.  Definitely always worth looking at when you aren't in the mood for a full out 5 on 5 confrontation.But there is one negative and that is the Move controller. I think any game that gets Move support needs to have a calibration/tutorial session built in before they just toss you to the wolves. It took me about 15 minutes to properly set my Move stick and I wasn't all that crazy about trying to play this with my dualshock. I also have the new Nav stick and could not figure out how to get it to work with the Move controller so if anyone has pointers on getting it to work, please let me know but the Move right now as it is, feels more like an afterthought than well thought out.Otherwise, if you are a basketball fan or sat out of the 2K phase, then this is the time to get it. As I said, EA needs to take notes and it's no surprise that their franchise has been put on hold. 2K takes your expectations and surpasses them by making a sports game that easy to get into and hard to put down once you start to play. If you are a Jordan fan and want to relive some of his past glory, then this is as close as you are going to get short of a holodeck and once you unlock him you get to use him against today's youth so forget trying to recreate him in Create a Player, YOU HAVE HIM.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

Nuke Town, Summit, and Firing Range. Campers delight levels. Match making can take really long. Some games I got connected really fast. Some games I sat in the lobby for a good ten minutes and had to back out and try again. This started happening a lot and I would end up playing combat training instead.
