To avoid his preordained death, he'll travel to the infernal core of mankind's worst fears.","reviewerName":"T. Sparks","summary":"Much different approach","reviewText":"I was pleasantly suprised by Ubisoft's other Prince of Persia offering--the Sands of Time--when I picked it up on clearance several months ago.  The game had an undeniable charm, and, while the level structure needed some work, it was a great game.The Warrior Within, however, takes a drastically different approach, both graphically and story-wise.  Gone are the magnificent towers and palaces that filled Sands of Time, replaced instead with dank, gritty dungeons and fortresses.  The game is much more dark, reflected in the voice acting, the music, and the overall story.  I, for one, don't mind this change as much, but I know that it's a sticking point with some other gamers.Graphics--I was actually slightly disappointed by the character models when I first started the game--they seemed a little bit too stiff for my liking.  Perhaps it's because the FMV sequences are truely excellent.  However, I became used to the graphical style quickly.  4/5 stars.Gameplay--the game really shines here, as it's possible to pull off insane combos.  I was worried that I would be relegated to simply mashing buttons, but I picked up on the \"free-form fighting\" system relatively quickly, and before I knew it, I was swinging around posts, bounding over enemies, propelling myself off of walls, and chopping off heads with the best of them.  5/5.Sound--this is where Warrior Within suffers.  The soundtrack is bearable in most locations, although industrial music is a very weird partnering for a game set in ancient Persia.  I happen to like industrial music, but I can see how this would irritate some.  Voice acting is OK, but the Prince has a new voice actor this time around.  Some of the lines--particularly where the Prince curses--seem forced.  3/5.Story--the story is interesting, although Ubisoft seems to have gone off the deep end.  Sands of Time offered a very satisfying story that wrapped up neatly.  But with Warrior Within . . . BOOM, just like that the Prince is running for his life.  The story isn't bad, it's just that it doesn't jive with the previous game like I think it should.  4/5.Well worth the $50 I spent on it, I'm hoping that Ubisoft continues the Prince of Persia series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2004"}

Sparks","summary":"Castlevania's Back!","reviewText":"The reason for my title is fairly simple; &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot; successfully pulled the Castlevania series out of a dry spell that gave us the mediocre &quot;Legends&quot; and N64 offerings.The premise of the game pretty much remains unchanged, with some new characters thrown into the mold; basically, Dracula's Dark consort, Camilla, decides to kick things off a little early this century by resurrecting Dracula in the year 1830.  Surprisingly, you're not a Belmont in this game; you play as a character named Nathan Graves.  As Nathan, you'll explore Dracula's huge castle and collect DSS cards; these cards, when combined with each other, lead to an absolutly incredible number of special attacks.  Nathan will also learn special moves from defeating boss enemies, such as the slide kick, the high jump, and the ability to break through stone blocks.&quot;Circle of the Moon&quot; is the hardest Castlevania game since &quot;Bloodlines;&quot; with health-restore items few and far between and, with a suspicious lack of any merchants, Nathan is going to have his work cut out for him.One other gripe about the game; it's incredibly dark.

With the Playstation version of this fighting game, for each character you beat the game with, it will play a movie and you will earn a new playable fighter, however, it is not like this in the Gameboy Advance version. When you beat the game, the credits roll and that is it, you do not get any specialized ending nor an extra playable fighter. Also, Heihachi is the leader of the game, and not Ogre like in Tekken 3 (Heihachi may also be unlocked if you beat the game with all 9 fighters). This is a true 3D fighting game, unlike Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games, with Tekken Advance the camera will zoom in and out of the battle as you fight, also the fighter can move to a different angle to avoid attacks. The buttons are very simple, having only a kick button (A), a punch button (B) and a \"close attack\" button (R). With Tekken the \"close attack\" would usually grapple your opponent and do a devastating move, with Tekken Advance it performs a specific combo, like a few punches or kicks. Another great thing about this game are the modes of play, such as arcade, verses battle (for two players), time attack, survival, practice, and even an incredible tag battle mode, where you select 3 fighters, then the computer will pit you against 3 random opponents. You can even tag out by pressing select to your different partners! The game even keeps track of the energy. All this being said, the game has great graphics, sound a unique 3D feel, but not enough players or diversity to hold your interest more than a few months.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"M \"Delicious Strawberry\"","summary":"Wonderful console","reviewText":"The Nintendo 64 was a pretty awesome console even though it hadn't quite mastered 3-D graphics yet (people had blocky heads and hands, etc etc) but there were some truly incredible titles for this platform, such as Goldeneye, MarioKart 64, and Waverace 64.

{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"As the announcer says if you win a match with 2 rounds with perfect health, GREATEST!","reviewText":"The Nintendo 3DS is very much still in its infancy but just within its first 3 months in the US market, the platform has already hosted a few high profile fighting game appearances. Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition, BlazBlue: Continuum Shift 2 3D, and this one, Dead or Alive Dimensions. Both BlazBlue & DoA make their Nintendo debuts. With the power of the 3DS system and its unique ability to display stereoscopic 3D glasses free, 3rd party developers are approaching Nintendo's newest portable with open arms and giving the system the type of games that have never been seen on a Nintendo portable. I personally find it to be a golden age as I'm finally getting to play more \"hardcore\" games on a console with Nintendo's franchises side by side.For its first foray on to a Nintendo console, Dead or Alive Dimensions takes the series' trademark frantically fast and frenetic fighting gameplay on to the palm of your hands with a title that serves as your passport to DoA's world. Dimensions is not a sequel but rather an encyclopedic entry that explores the stories and events of the first four DoA games. A total of 26 combatants are playable in this installment making it the largest cast in the series' history. For the first time, all boss characters from 1-4 are playable. Though its obvious that a few concessions had to be made especially with regards to Nicole from part 4 as she is Halo inspired, Dimensions is still your guide pass to the DoA universe.Dimensions did some things a little different to its impressive roster of single player modes. For example, Arcade Mode is really more of a time attack mode where you pick a course with a predetermined set of opponents on a race to beat the best time. There is no story mode for every character, instead, you get a mode called Chronicle which is the game's main single player campaign. Chronicle tells the stories of the four Dead or Alive Tournaments through various cut scenes, dialogue sequences, and cinematics. As crazy as the characters and their situations are, the story is told rather poorly and comically which will lead to more questions than answers. The voice acting is pretty cheesy but some of the action sequences are pretty awesome (love the scene where Hayate kills a bunch of DOATEC soldiers, lots of blood and gore hehe). If anything, Chronicle is perfect for DoA newbies as it also explains the gameplay mechanics from performing basic combos, executing the franchises' famous counter system, and using environments to your advantage.Translating the gameplay from console to portable is spot on here. The controls are easy to learn, you have four main buttons, one for punch, kick, guard, and throw. Combinations of buttons are very rare here, just more on manipulating your body in tandem with the four main buttons. Though DoA is not as fleshed out as say Tekken or Virtua Fighter, DoA's real hook is on how you can master the counter system. The vast majority of moves a fighter has in this game can be countered in a display of lighting quick reflexes. Holding the guard button in sequence with a directional pad is all it takes to perform the counter. The trick to it however is guessing whether the landing hit is a high, low, or medium. The hardest CPU levels have a high frequency of guessing your moves in turn with the CPU performing a devastating counter and performing the more challenging combo moves. Another feature of the DoA franchises are its great stage designs. You won't find any bland plain stages a la Tekken/Soul Calibur here. The highlight as always are the multi-tiered stages where you can push off enemies from higher ground to a ravine below. Environmental traps such as electric walls and a special stage taken from Metroid Other M has the menacing Ridley shooting fireballs at the combatants and will do serious damage to any fighter who happens to fall out of the ring.With 26 playable characters, you'll find many favorite characters to use in DoA Dimensions. Characters specializing in ninjutsu are more of your ninja type characters such as Kasumi, Ayane, Ryu, and Hayate, quick and agile they strike at a more rapid rate. Gen Fu, Leifang, Eliot, and Jann Lee are more of your traditional Chinese martial arts fighters, not as fast as the ninjutsu characters but have more concentrated strikes. For expert grapplers, Tina, Bass, and La Mariposa are experts at grappling combos which are very strong attacks. As noted you can play all the boss characters so you can finally pull off some of their most frightening moves. Each character has an insane amount of moves to perform. Just like in Super Street Fighter IV 3D, you can use the touch pad of the 3DS to use a move. Though its not as useful as SSFIV's, you'll probably use the touch pad trying to frantically activate a counter move instead.The graphics in Dimensions are quite stunning. The 3D effect adds a deep sense of immersion but the framerate runs at half speed as opposed to switching the 3D off. Some claim 30 frames is pretty unplayable, I leave the 3D effect on as I bought the 3DS for its cool 3D features. The stages are mostly taken from DoA 3&4 and have been translated quite well. There is still quite a lot of sex appeal here with the lady characters but the jiggly breasts from previous titles have been toned down a bit, so sorry, if you were expecting jello boobs in 3D, they're more realistic here. Character models retain their look quite well with a daily dose of free DLC content for costumes. I've had this game since day one and every day I get a new costume to use. Load times are non-existent. I haven't played much online but the game is pretty laggy online. You will need another copy of the game to play with 2 3DS systems offline.Dead or Alive Dimensions is my favorite game on the 3DS so far (Ocarina of Time 3D a very close second). This is a game full of content even if you're content on playing the game solo 99% of the time. With the fun, fast, gameplay, rich graphics, daily free DLC, this shall remain my favorite fighting game on the system. It will be for you as well, I guarantee.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Alex","summary":"A little repetitive, but fun overall","reviewText":"This is a great game to play when you don't feel like thinking too hard and just want to stay busy.

The big con to this game (that I was really looking forward to playing) is the fixed world camera with a tiny little tilt to the left or right that springs back the moment you release the key. Zooming in or out takes you somewhat closer to the fights but you cannot choose your action viewpoint meaning that TBFME is a very limited RTS ( I knew it was limited but didn't realize how much)... so much so, that it is nothing more than draw a big box around whatever group is present on the screen and right click on the enemy and then watch the battle... but watch what? Amazing 2D fight sequences?... and I think you might just get my point here... -> The film is the better 2D fight sequences.I am sorry but the fact that you could not rotate the camera just blew me away. It felt like playing R-Type Final or some other 2D platform shoot `em up. The extreme (and I mean extreme) lack of critical thinking in this game just makes it a very glorious looking bad game. It is not even a game when compared to any modern RTS. The best way of describing it is like a gawk-fest where you can literally sit back and just let the game run itself. I would not have minded that if I could actually choose an angle to gawk at the battles.The best way of describing my disappointment is to imagine if the producers of this thing just recorded a demo of the whole game on DVD for you to watch.Anyhow, all this depends on how much time you invest in games. If you are a fan of the movie, and do not play games, then maybe this will satisfy you. If you have any experience with RTS gaming and a pimpin' fast computer you have a right to know that you can not rotate or tilt the world. If I knew that then maybe this item would have got a far better rating.I would love to have recommended it but sadly, I am a gamer and felt badly letdown by the lack of world controls. Something as simple as a 360 rotate with a 90-degree tilt would have made it five stars (even with the simplest of RTS controls).

So 13 hours multiplied by 20% (actual nondriving gamplay) equals less than 3 hours.I enjoyed the story so I watched all the cut scenes all the way through.  They are very cinematic and the voice actors do an excellent job.  The music is fantastic, there are probably 80-100 singles from the 1940's and 1950's in the game and the incidental music is likewise excellent.  |The graphics are just about perfect in terms of creating mood and atmosphere (i played the game on a pc).  The apartments and streets and cars and fashions etc all look authentic.I would advise against getting the $3 expansion packs for the extra cars and clothes as they do not fit in with the style at all and kind of wreck the atmosphere.  I mean dressing the character as 1970's elvis or 1980's urban cowboy while driving a goofy looking car just doesn't work.  The expansion packs should have matched the fantastic art design of the rest of the game.  I'd be very surprised if the expansion art people were the same as those that designed the actual  game.All in all, it was a pretty enjoyable game although pretty skimpy on the actual gameplay.PS there are also lots of hidden things to find like artwork, playboy centerfolds, wanted posters, etc.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"New approach helps and hurts","reviewText":"Dragon Age 2... does this really need an introduction? Bioware's fantasy Mass Effect counterpart makes a good appearance, though changing up portions definitely hasn't improved it on all fronts.Writing is still top notch, but that isn't really a laurel anymore. Water's wet, the sun rises in the east, and Bioware does fantastic writing. The deus ex machina of Flemeth's appearance is a tad dated, but they have to get you into the story some way. I do wish you had more options for background. Not necessarily multi-race like the initial game, but at least given you more of a background to start from rather than just when you're fleeing through the field.Voices for characters is also something Bioware has raised the bar too high for themselves on, but they still manage to reach it.Delivering dialogue is more in depth but a tad bizarre. In addition to the some times misleading 4-5 word summary is now a misleading emoiticon giving the basic flavor of the dialogue option. While the dialogue all works, I periodically find myself picking options that read like they'd be the opposite of their emoticon and vice versa.Combat is... odd. The speed has been amped up from the prior game, though the layout is definitely different. Controls are identical, but the power scheme and necessary skills now make is feasible to play without a dedicated tank, buffer, and healer, though that's dependant very heavily on luck. You can easily get caught over a barrel because enemies approach silently, with nary a shouted warning from your compatriots at times. Multiple waves wink into existence mere feet from your location, though sometimes they clamber over walls, so it's at least a valid reinforcement ploy. So while the system is much more clearly laid out, the counterweight from how insanely fast it suddenly is makes this annoying to keep up with, as you seem to get ambushed at every encounter since you'll be on the other side of the field when a clutch of darkspawn leap from the ether around your mage or archer and you're occupied with the ogre who wants your spine to use as a kazoo.Characters themselves are a bit less unique, though quite a few are definitely entertaining. I miss Shale, but the Dalish elf and the Teviniter tattooed warrior are acceptable replacements. The romantic options are warped, as it's ridiculously easy to start some of the relationships and extremely difficult for others, and I'm rather annoyed that one of the relationship options that virtually shoved in your face is the homosexual one. The aspect itself is not bothersome, but its so abrupt and unexpected that it's pretty well apparent Bioware inserted it like that to create controversy and boost sales.Graphics are vastly improved. Distant vistas look much crisper, character faces are improved though could've had more detail, and the blood spatter has been cut back so that you don't look like you get drenched in gore during every fight.Character development is also greatly improved. Abilities are much better broken down and meticulously explained, so there's very little confusion for your track assuming you know what you want to play. Stats and ability increases are also much more clear, as every stat point immediately shows what your new abilities will give you, though it does make it stink somewhat of MMO-ness. Inventory has similarly been cut down, with you really only needing to worry about yourself for total equipping, and your compatriots with a much more generalized equipment interface. Regard has also been modified to more of a rivalry, which makes sense considering you have to fight with these people. Having them hate you would mean they might find something better to do with their time than fight off a dragon by your side.Overall, this is what was promised, but they injected too much hack-n-slash. Tactics are still present, but you don't have nearly the range of options as in the prior game. You basically have to plow in and beat until something gives unless you see them coming a long way off.Please comment if you don't find this review useful.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2011"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale. The game also offers an online interface known as GeoNet that allows players to communicate with others via blogs, forums, quest logs and voice chat functionality, as well as post snapshots from their journeys using the Crystal Camera in-game tool.Key Game FeaturesWhite Knight Transformation- During single player combat players can transform into the giant White Knight, gaining the ability to challenge large enemies as well as troops of soldiers throughout the adventure.The Customizable Avatar Character- Using a wide array of sliders and customization options, players are able to create a unique character that can join the adventure in single player mode as well as online.Combo Battle System- Engage in an accessible, active turn-based battle system that caters to players of all levels allowing both default attack settings and a system for for maximum damage.JRPG (Japanese RPG) Action for PS3- Experience true JRPG action on PS3 that incorporates a variety of online gameplay elements.Beautiful Environments- Players traverse through 13 stages, as well as visit up to six towns/villages to visit and purchase items at shops or interact with NPCs.

Yes!","reviewText":"while a great many people have reviewed this and gave it rather luke warm reviews I find it to be a gem.it's nothing new nor groundbreaking nor will you find those amazing graphics shown in all the E3 trailers.pushing all that aside, it's fun and you can play with up to FOUR friends ONLINE! that's a big draw for me since Most RPGs don't have ANY online at all. the graphics are about the norm for a JRPG (japanese Role Playing Game) as is the dialogue (also the lip movements are very much like the old Kung Fu films lol)again though it's a blast. it has an MMO feel all the way through the game. the townsfolk go about their buisness having various conversations and also like dragon age (though not nearly as deep nor Mature since it's a Teen Title) many long dialogue sequences that help the rather cliche story to move forward. it feels open world but gently guides you (in linear fashion) towards your next destination. battle consists of setting party A.I. which is surprisingly Excellent! they heal you and themselves right when necessary, fight well and act as a true team without you having to micromanage every little detail of each character(Like DAO)some of the monsters are HUGE in true MMO style and have various weak points and weaknesses (such as weak to fire and exposed knees)make big monsters FUN to fight! it's rare you'll die your companions are so well tuned. loads of loot collecting and crafting.then the georama system from dark cloud returns but this time it's online so your friends can come visit your town and resupply depending how you built your village.if you build geared towards weapon crafting you'll have Great weapons for sale but little in the way of potions food etc.if you go armor it becomes little weapons food etc. so you either must find a balance or the flavor you like most.the game is not perfect but it's darn good.I'd recommend it to any FF fans or to JRPG lovers cause there's loads to do here with a whopping FIFTY Online multiplayer Questsand more coming in the way of DLC. this game will keep you occupied for weeks. and it's worth it since a \"certain Trophy\" Unlocks a White Knight Home armor Costume! also a white knight HUGE statue!is it worth it? you decide.my biggest gripe is Your character (thankfully your not the cliche' main character just the Mute Sidekick) really has no bearing on anything in the story and my other gripe is no White Knight transformations in the Online Multiplayer since your using YOUR avatar Not Leonard the main Character from the single player (Hence no transformations) which makes it feel even more like an MMO playing Online.Graphics: good but not great. 4 starsSound: great in some scenes mundain in battle 4 starsGameplay: loads of combos, spells, weapons armor and loot, and FULL avatar customization I really want to go 5 stars here but I can't. 4 Stars due to many of the gameplay elements being recycles elements from other games and not being new and innovative.Fun: 5 stars! the game's a blast, easy to get into and a great game for casual and Hardcore RPG fans.

{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Therabbitssing \"on the rock that spews lava..\"","summary":"Worth the wait, lives up to the hype...","reviewText":"Yes, it lives up to the hype.  Anticipated by many as it was created by Monolith who did the superb Xenogears on the Playstation, Xenosaga is the spiritual prequel.  Although Xenogears was supposed to be part 5 in a series, and Saga is Episode One, the creators swear they are not related, and started anew.  We'll see if this pans out many years from now if they actually complete all of the games.  Regardless whether they are related in story or not, Saga takes all the good elements from Gears and then some.A pure Sci-Fi RPG, there is no mention of magic or fantasy.  All the \"spells\" can and are explained scientifically.  This is of course a rarity in an RPG and is just one factor that separates it from the sea of others.  The other being the battle system, which borrows heavily from Xenogears and is a welcome addition.  The others are the fantastic story and music.  The story is deep, and perhaps reaches deeper than Xenogears did.  Controversial as well, I'm surprised this was released in the US with a \"T\" rating as some elements may offend some people with the religious references as Xenogears did.  There is some bloodshed in the cut scenes as well, further making me wonder about the rating.  Nothing horrible or too gory, but in this age, I'd almost expected the ESRB to rate it an \"M\".  Speaking of the cut scenes, there are a lot of them.  Let me emphasize a LOT of them.  And they are long. Really long.  Some span only minutes, but at times the story advances for over 45 minutes. 15-30 minute cut scenes are the norm here.  However, as you progress through the game the amount of playing and watching is more properly balanced.The characters in this game are fantastic.  You will be drawn in to their world. You will come to care about them.  I haven't seen another RPG that has done character development as well as this game has. Of particular note is KOS MOS, a battle android which is probably one of the coolest RPG characters ever.  With amazing attacks and a cold \"robot\" personality to boot, she is head and shoulders above all the other RPG characters out there.Like Xenogears, you also pilot mechs though they are less important in this game, and are more a background theme than being the focus.Music was done by Yasunori Mitsuda and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and it definitely shows.  While much of the game is just ambient sounds, whenever the music does take over it brings with it the magic of what a truly well composed and performed orchestrated soundtrack can do for a game.  The graphics are well done, and animated very smoothly and the effects during battles are very pretty.  Being a little older than some recent RPG's (Was released over a year ago in Japan and the translation took forever) the graphics seem slightly dated but they are still beautiful.And now the bad news: For me this game possesses only one flaw in that the English dubbing of it is only average, sounding like a dubbed anime.  Many characters are over acting and it pains me to see this in such a quality RPG.  It doesn't help that during the cut scenes the dialogue is subtitled right along with the actors speaking the same language...which would be fine if they sounded better, but since they don't it's annoying to read it before they say it, and hear them say it with forced emotion or non at all.  It is a minor flaw in a near flawless RPG.  The other concern is the editing.  There is one cut scene that was altered and it only involves the placement of a hand.  Nothing to worry about.For me, I lost interest in RPG's awhile back, with the Final Fantasy series having lost some of the magic that the old ones had.  Phantasy Star and Lunar had that old magic that I remember which is absent from the RPG's I play today.  Xenosaga has that magic (ironic since there is no \"magic\" in the game itself) and I recommend it to anyone who loves RPG's.  If you can find the soundtrack and art book, I heartily recommend that you pick those up as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0006ZJPSC","description":"After the incredible success and acclaim ofStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, BioWare knew they had some serious shoes to fill. The wait is finally over! From BioWare and the Microsoft Game Studios comes the ambitious and head-turning role playing game, Jade Empire.The game's designers have crafted an entirely new and unique world inspired by ancient Chinese myths and legends. In the primeval, arcane setting of the Jade Empire, you'll train under your master's watchful gaze and learn the mystical and magical powers of ancient martial arts. You'll travel widely -- from the rugged mountains of the Land of Howling Spirits to the luxuriant gardens of the Imperial City--as you make your way on your quest. Powerful human and supernatural foes will stand in your way, but with practice you'll learn to overcome your most powerful enemies. And as you venture forth through Jade Empire, you'll be challenged with questions that will ultimately lead you to discover the darkest secrets of the world.The game begins when a series of sinister events disrupt the peaceful harmony of an isolated martial arts school. You'll be forced to confront a slew of shady characters, evil warlocks, demonic beasts, and other atrocious villains that protect the Jade Empire's deepest secrets.Jade Empire offers you the chance to become a martial arts master. You'll assume the identity of one of six different characters and begin developing your skills. Each character has a unique appearance, voice, and fighting style. As you progress in the game, you'll decide whether to adopt the ways of good or evil, and your choices will affect your reputation.Jade Empire matches the frenetic pace and fury of Hong Kong cinema. As you progress in the game, you'll upgrade your combat ability and learn new, specially tailored moves for your character. Only by mastering your moves and defeating the most powerful enemies will you earn your place as a master in the world of Jade Empire.","reviewerName":"W. Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"A Great RPG Adventure.Some Hints Added.","reviewText":"Jade Empire is a third person RPG has an immersive storyline and lots of interesting sidequests .If you take the time to read all the diologue  from as many charachters as you can find and also do as many or all the sidequests ,its about a 15-20 hour game. I finished the game in about 4 days. But you could easily stretch out the game into 3 weeks or more. There's about 5 different types of fighting styles that your player can use and upgrade that are grouped into different catagories. There's Martial Style which is a unarmed fighting.There's Weapon style with swords ,axes,spears,etc. There's Magic syle.There's Support style ,example, slow enemy or paralize. And finally there's Transformation style.  Also Most Ghosts or Spirit enemies are immune to swords,spears,axes or weapon styles.Demons are immune to support styles and some martial styles. You realy have to experiment to see which enemies are immune to particular styles. The fighting system is very easy ,its free form you can lock on and switch targets by pressing left or right trigger ,or free target by pressing both triggers at same time. You can perform whats called harmonic combos by starting with certain styles & ending with another style.The charachters target ring will turn yellow when you have started one. Although its possible never having to use a harmonic combo .I beat the game never doing one.I loved the White Demon Martial style its good for taking out ghosts spirits,I wasnt a big fan of Legendary strike  it didnt seem as strong for some reason and I had it maxed out.There's tons of choices to make as far as fighting styles go in this game.You get to upgrade your fighter as you progress in the game. The choices you make you will either choose Open Palm (good) or Closed Fist (evil). To get Closed fist points you do have make evil type choices.Sometimes they will try to trick you into thinking that it isnt evil or a bad choice.The dam for example by destroying the dam controls you continue the towns suffering and make it a continued haven for drunk sailors and harlots,thats what the merchant wants ,he sells wine. But by fixing the dam you heal a town thats already been suffering for awhile already,by renewing there shipping abilities and access to food(fish).But first do all sidequests and xtras before fixing or breaking the dam, you'll greatly need to.You have alot of different power up abilities,that you can  obtain by reading scrolls or searching containers for them,or buy the upgrades from different merchants,or you get certain fighting styles by either doing open palmed(good) or closed fist(evil) choice from certain teachers. Its not too hard of a game with the right fighting styles you can be deadly.The fighting system is pretty smooth free form ,you can sidestep,jump over the enemy hit em in the back , & block most attacks,pretty much free form do anything thers's no real restrictions.After defeating certain demons you then can Transform into there image &  there fighting style and kill your enemies. The Jade Golem or Red Minister are very powerful  transformation styles ,but you dont get either until later in the game,definatly save some upgrade points for one of those  styles.The graphics are pretty good in this game nice details and they get better as you go.I think there are three different endings ,I saw 2 of them just remember to save before the important decisions & battles.Before you start the game you can choose what character you wanna be either Strong Style,Magic Style,Fast Style, or Balanced style. You gain followers as you progress in the game that can either fight with you or be a support where they wont fight ,but they will replenish your Health,Chi,& Focus while you are in battle. You can have only one charachter with at a time,but you can switch them out at any time.Some negatives about this game are the load times while doing  quests,especialy in the Imperial City there are lots of load screens when you go to different parts of the city it can get a little annoying.Also when you talk to anybody the talking animation isnt that great or interesting ,like other reviewers stated I also found myself quickly reading the text & not looking at the 'talking heads'. But for the most part definatly one of the better RPG'S out.If you like KOTOR part 1 , Morrowind or Fable.Definatly try this game out. Here's some good strong powerful style choices for an Open palmed(good) player.  Martial style: (White Dragon)  Weapon style: (Crimson Tears)  Magic style: (Stone Immortal stronger with open palm player)  Transformation style: (Red Minister almost unbeatable or Jade Golem very very powerful and looks great)  Support Style: (Paralyzing Palm or Spirit Thief).These are just some of my favs styles,some people will be better or worse with different styles because there gameplay style might be different than mine.  To get the Crimson Tears  (advanced dual sabers) Talk to KHANA  in the Imperial City Arena ,after you talk to everybody in the arena,you must tell her of the plans they want (you) to poison her,but tell her you will not poison her and you will fight her Honorably in the Imperial Arena,she then will train you in the advanced version of the dual sabers called Crimson Tears after you defeat her in the Imperial Arena Bronze Division.Its a deadly dual sword that is very powerful maxed out. Also save as many weapon upgrades as you can because you get a limited amount you can only max about 4 total. Concentrate on upgrading White Demon & Crimson Tears, & Either Red Minister or Jade Golem . Those will help in the tougher boss battles.The Support styles arent even needed ,there helpful but not neccessary. To defeat the Emperor switch to a different style then he's using.Example if he's using a weapon ,say a sword,then you switch to unarmed (Martial style).etc. Because he's immune to whatever style he is equipped with and he will quickly change his attack to match your style, he will then be immune,so you change your style attack again. Good Luck.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2005"}

The game can be played in 1, 2, 3 or 4 players, and if you're playing your game alone and somebody comes in and wants to join, you can simply do it pausing the game and adding the control to the second, third or fouth player immediately and if that friend or family member has to go or simpley doesn't want to play anymore, you can pause the game and simply turn off the control to the player.The game is long enough to keep you busy and fun enough to keep you playing.I give this game four stars 'cause the second game has better graphics and you can use both good characters and evil character 'cause the plot makes good and evil get together to confront a common enemy.If you like super hero games, don't doubt it, this is it and you can find it very cheap for it is an old game; and if you like the X-Men, well, what are you waiting for?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2007"}

And I really enjoyed it... while it lasted.Let me explain. This game will not take long if you're used to RPGs. If you just blow through the main story and don't do any side quests you are looking a maybe a long weekend of play. The main story isn't even that deep - you basically know all there is to know within the first few hours. This is a big disappointment, because since you know who the final boss is going to be right from the get-go, and you know enough of his past to be intrigued, you are ready for an engaging story... but then they never build on that excellent foundation. Even the final \"battle\" - if you can call it that - leaves something to be desired, as the whole \"fight\" consists of pressing and holding the A button.As disappointed as I am with the game's length and plot, Fable II did fix a lot of the issues I had with the original. Combat has now been mapped to three buttons - one for melee, one for ranged, and one for spells - which makes combat more intuitive as you don't have to keep switching weapons between attacks (e.g. you can chain melee-melee-ranged-melee-area of effect spell-melee-directed spell-melee just by pressing X-X-Y-B-X-B-X).There are fewer spells, but the spell selector is now much easier to use. You pre-select spells for up to five levels, each level increasing in power, and you hold the B button until you charge the level you want to cast. Each spell also has two modes - area of effect and directed, and they do just what they say. So the \"Fireball\" and \"Enflame\" spells from Fable I are now under \"Inferno\" here; charge up and release for a radial attack similar to Enflame, or charge up, target an enemy and release for a Fireball equivalent.There is also a lot more to do outside of the main story here - between jobs, numerous side quests and other oddities you will find yourself spending an amount of time on Fable II roughly the same as if you had gone through the main story of Fable I. When the main story ends, the play continues - some quests aren't even available until the story ends, so there's more to do after you save the world. The downloadable content - currently there is a \"Knothole Island\" expansion and a \"See the Future\" expansion - are also very good and worth the points to buy them, as each tacks on at least a few hours of gameplay.They also fixed the cumbersome \"rent\" system by automatically dropping gold into your account every five minutes (even if you are not playing; if you find you're low on cash just play another game for a day or two and when you go back to Fable II you get a nice windfall); this has a downside of making gold incredibly easy to get, even early in the game.And finally, the dog. If you love exploring the map to search for hidden items, you will hate his guts. But if you're like me and don't mind being led to treasure chests and dig spots that are near where you are, you will love him. The dog is especially useful for the dig spots, as they are truly hidden and rarely hinted at as they were in Fable I (like being in the center of a ring of flowers). I won't spoil any endings, but if you want to dig up as much treasure as you can you might want to forgo the plot once you level your pooch's treasure hunting skills up, because, just like in Fable 1, you have a choice to make at the end of the plot that will greatly influence the rest of your game.Fable II retains all the humor and fun of its predecessor, but suffers a serious lack of quality plot-driven gameplay. If you liked the original, it's a good buy, as you will get roughly the same amount of aggregate play time. If, however, you're not one for doing sidequests or sticking around after the credits roll, make this a rental first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"ice grizzly \"Grrrrrr\"","summary":"Prince and Elka visual duo","reviewText":"The new entry in Prince of Persia is actually not related to the old POP/PS2 games. Our new Prince is just a ordinary man who accepts the responsibility of cleansing the world. This is a entirely new story and the gameplay is totally new. The main character has four moves mapped to the face buttons.. as simple as that. The same action button does different thing at different times based on your situation. It makes it for a smooth gameplay. No complicated button combos for movement and no frustrating deaths. I have to applaud the developers for producing a very satisfying game play with simple mechanics.Artstyle is so refreshing, it is this generations OKAMI. Character animations are the best we have ever seen in video games. As the game progresses prince can pull off some amazing tricks like roof crawl, it is a pure visual feast. There is a lot of variety in play mechanics. There are even some flying quests, carrying Elka in your back. First you travel through infested dark world where the game play is totally linear. Once you beat the final boss the level gets freed from corruption, it becomes cheerfully colorful. Then it becomes like mario star collection. More skillfull you are more you can collect. The second try of the levels are lot more difficult than the first runup to kill the big boss. Which makes it a win-win for every one. Skilled players can go all out in collection to get skills faster and earn trophies. Where in normal players can finish the game without throwing the controller to the wall. What ever the situation you are in Elka will save you. You miss judge a jump she is there, you screw up in combat and want a break she will help you. Combat is near perfect this time around.. no mindless button mashing. Every boss battle is different from other. Some require Elka, some require use of environment etc. etc. I personally like the new combat compared to the old POP games. If are patient and chain the combos you can beat them in 2 or 3 rounds. Especially when you start to chain areal combos it gives chills. Visual combat animations for combos are amazing. It is not as extravagant as DMC4, but very well done.The main character prince comes with all the necessary skill from the start of the game. There are some good chain combos for combat to learn. On the other hand Elka gets new power-ups and becomes better as you collect more goodies. She is be best female companion video games ever had. She is always helpful and nice. Without her Prince can't do much, but very unassuming and humble. I liked her more than the main character. The story is her quest to free the world from corruption and prince is more like a mule carrying her around the world. I know it sounds bizarre, the story is amazingly tied well.I have played the game couple of times, it plays silky smooth. No frame rate issues or hangs. Even though it is built on AC engine, the game is more true to the orignal POP than AC. Dont pass on this one, at least give it a rent. Even if you have never played previous POP or AC this one is a must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2008"}

It is the combination of the two of my favorite controllers ever created, the Nintendo Gamecube controller and the Playstation Dualshock controller. That doesn't mean it brings the best of both worlds however, but for the most part it is a resounding success.Pros:- Symmetrical dual analog sticks allow the D-Pad to be on the side it needs to be for navigating menus and playing retro games- Four shoulder buttons- Grip improves on the Gamecube controller's already ergonomic shape. Extremely comfortable.- Wire is on the top, not the bottom like the original Classic Controller- Analog sticks are spaced farther apart than on the original Classic ControllerCons:- Drains the Wii Remote's batteries while still inconveniencing you with wires- No triggers (Gamecube controller's triggers are still my favorite triggers to this day)- Analog sticks have 8-directional base like the Gamecube controller, annoying for 3rd person RPGs.- No rumble- The top R and L buttons are difficult not comfortable to press, like the Gamecube or Xbox 360 controllers- I really liked the Gamecube controller's four face buttons desgin. It's a shame they opted for the more traditional diamond layout but it makes sense for the retro games that the original Classic Controller was designed for.Overall this is definitely one of the most comfortable controllers I've ever had. I really hope that with the Wii U they rerelease this controller with Bluetooth, rechargable batteries, rumble, triggers, and circular analog sticks.

Bakehorn","summary":"GRAW is a hell of a shot","reviewText":"Every once in a while, a video game comes along and redefines a genre, defines the capabilities of a console, or both. Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is one of those games that accomplishes both feats. Ubisoft's next-gen centerpiece turned out to be quite a game in almost every way imaginable. From the intense duck-and-cover, squad-based gameplay to the beautiful environments and the amazing online multiplayer, GRAW has it all.The single-player campaign's story puts you into the helmet of Captain Scott Mitchell, a member of the Ghost Recon team working for the United States government. It's 2013, and Mitchell and his crew are armed with equipment that could accurately and precisely take out a small army in moments. Their goal is to secure the United States and Mexican presidents from Mexican rebels who attack during a trade deal that would make peace with three separate countries. From there, it's up to the wits and military smarts of the gamer and his or her crew to stay alive, suppress the enemy, and protect the VIPs.Each of the game's 11 long, engaging missions will test your wits as a Ghost. Mitchell and his crew are already armed with the proper equipment and it's the optimization of the surroundings that will keep your squad alive. Fortunately, thanks to an extremely intuitive squad command system and heads-up display (HUD), ordering your squad to move out is as simple as pressing up on the directional pad while pointing at a location. You can even change their approach from Recon to Assault for sneaking or aggressively going into a battle guns-blazing.That isn't to say that Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is ever a run-and-gun game. Instead, its pace is as slow as a slug but as intense as any game you've ever played before. Imagine Call of Duty 2 on its Veteran setting; that's how intense this game can be. Even a situation, one as early as the third level, is extremely intense. I was almost too afraid to poke my head around a corner and take a pot shot at an attacking rebel and his back-up, an armored APC complete with a machine gunner. Unfortunately for my on-screen Ghost, my brash tactic of rolling out from cover and trying to take out the gunner resulted in the Game Over screen and a look of disappointment on my face while my Ghost lay dead on the ground.The gameplay is extremely tight thanks to a set of perfect controls. While at first the scheme felt awkward, after a few minutes of getting used to it, I was ready to load terrorists with lead and direct my team with relative ease. Even when back-up arrives, usually in the form of Cypher spy cameras or Bradley tanks, controlling everything on the screen is easy. When the going gets really tough, the player can use the optimized HUD to mark enemy locations, find different routes, and locate mission objectives. The HUD even offers a mini-screen located at the top-left of your television screen that allows you to view the game through the eyes of a comrade or your support units. Overall, I'd say that GRAW is the first game I've ever played where the HUD was sometimes the most helpful part of the game. Because of this, and the general tight feeling of the gameplay, I feel that GRAW is one of the best action titles around.My only complaint with the gameplay is the \"unsnapping\" from a wall; it is sometimes too difficult to do in dangerous situations. Rather than simply pulling away from the wall at any given moment, I found myself having to wait for Mitchell to complete whatever he was doing before he'd \"unsnap\" from the wall. Generally, I only panicked when a terrorist ran around the corner and faced me with his gun raised while I was reloading. This situation, 100% of the time, brought up that damn Game Over screen again and again.I've honestly never played a game that felt so tactical and felt so realistic. Thanks in part to the visuals, which I'll mention in a moment, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter has the best level design I've seen from a shooter in years. The open feeling of the different urban areas is a fresh breath of life after linear games like The Outfit have been spinning in my Xbox 360. If I approached a firefight from one angle and found myself dying every time, I could usually pull back and approach the situation from another angle-and simply making use of my tools, like the HUD and tactical map, did I find the perfect route. Using my support units, like the Cyphers and Bradleys, I could spy on the enemy and pinpoint their location and then watch as they're obliterated. Then I could clean up any mess left over with my trusty MR-C rifle.The visuals in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter are quite simply the best thing I've ever seen from a video game. I've never played a game that looked this advanced-from the environments to the HUD, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is truly the first next-generation video game. The city feels real. As I'm creeping along the alleyways of a run-down Mexican suburb, I can almost smell the mud and dirt that I sneak on. I can almost taste the gunpowder in the air after a firefight. I feel like I could reach into the television screen and take a shot with Mitchell's rifle, then high-five him after a bullet plows through a terrorist's skull from 200 yards away. Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter simply has to be seen to be believed, so I'll leave that experience for you to discover!As good as Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter looks, it also sounds amazing. As you sneak along, picking off terrorists, you'll hear distant firefights and nearby yells from other terrorists. If you're unseen and without a Cypher spy camera, you can always rely on your ears to know when a cluster of terrorists is waiting around the corner.Multiplayer, both on Xbox Live and local Xbox 360 matches, is absolutely fantastic. With Elimination (deathmatch), Last Man Standing, and Territories (same as Halo 2's mode), Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter has some of the most fundamental yet entertaining modes of play. The maps are also fantastic. \"Nowhere\", a ghost town with hills, rocks, a junkyard, and a deadly, wide-open main street, is my favorite. Each of the maps offer strategic locations and tactical possibilities for each of the game's character classes, like Riflemen, Marksmen, and Grenadiers. The weapon selection is also much larger than it is in the single-player mode, and the controls are optimized for faster gameplay. On Xbox Live, gamers are given a rank-based off of real-life military ranks-for their performance. Similarly to Halo 2's level system, better players have higher ranks. Earning a new rank in GRAW is much more gratifying, though, as it requires a lot more time and skill than it does in Halo 2. While the gameplay experiences are entirely different, with Halo 2 being more frantic and action-packed and less tactical, I predict Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter's online community will be huge, just like the legendary Xbox title.Not everything in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is perfect. I was particularly annoyed with the on-rails helicopter sequences, the unsnapping from walls and the sometimes-spotty AI of my comrades. Still, the game is dangerously close to that label, and the three complaints I just mentioned are pretty easy to deal with in exchange for the best visuals and the next big Xbox Live title. Ubisoft should be proud; they've created one of the very few Xbox 360 must-have titles. Action fans will absolutely love this game, and next to Call of Duty 2 and Dead or Alive 4, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is a game that should be in your Xbox 360 inventory.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A Satisfying Trip Through Hell...","reviewText":"I passed on this game at launch due to $ constraints and just an overall dis-interest in the genre of game at the time.  Picking up the Divine Edition finally let me see what this game had to offer and while I was impressed with the game overall, there were some minor annoyances that did put a small damper on gameplay.  However, at its current price, Dante's Inferno: Divine Edition is well worth the price of admission, and would make a good addition to a game collection.GAMEPLAYWhen it comes to a game like Dante's Inferno the first thing that comes to mind is, GOD OF WAR(GoW)!  And this is true, the game screams God of War clone.  However we're talking about a game franchise that prides itself in story and gameplay with a delightful mix of puzzle elements thrown in.  When done properly (like in the GoW franchise) it makes for a really amazing experience.  This is something Dante's Inferno does right.  It captures the core elements of the game it is closely based on and gives it a completely unique style and flair.  With that said... you can expect lots of button mashing , dodging, countering and quick time events... puzzles, epic boss encounters and a large variety of mobs.The basic gameplay boils down to Dante descending into the bowels of hell.  Using his newly acquired Scythe to steal souls (used for upgrades) and his trusty cross you will punish/absolve or just flat out butcher everyone in your path.  Combos are very much dumbed down in DI(dante's inferno).  There is no move list to speak of, and no variety of weapons.  You get your scythe, your cross and eventually unlock magic as you go.  That's it.  How you mix the 3 is up to your play-style.  Souls that you acquire are used like currency to provide upgrades for Dante.  As you absolve/punish enemies via quick time even kills, or shades found throughout Hell, you will level up either the Holy or Un-Holy tree.  This will unlock additional moves, upgrades and magics as well as enhancing existing abilities.Throw in some platforming, puzzle elements, Relics to enhance abilities, and some pretty nice boss encounters into the mix and out comes a game has a very nice feel to it.  There is always something going on, be it combat or atmosphere.  Overall the gameplay can be a lot of fun, and has that GoW feel to it.  It is hard not to compare it to GoW because it really is almost identical to it except for the Holy/Unholy system and relics.  Both these features actually give the game a unique feel to it since the direction to take will influence your play style.GRAPHICSThe graphics felt a little lacking in some areas but strong in others.  There were some parts where the game looked amazing, and other parts where it looked pretty horrible.  Prime example is on your way to the final 3 rings of hell the game does a zoom out with narration, similar to what GoW3 did with showing you sheer scale.  Difference here is DI looked pretty horrible when it tried to do this, losing all sense of HD quality.  The graphics aren't nearly as polished as they should be, but they don't impact the game either.  Some areas come across rather impressive where others end up feeling like they just slapped the textures together and moved on.  Combat however looks fluid, and your abilities look crisp and fluid.  You can tell the real polishing came to ensure gameplay would look great, which is the most important aspect of all.** Putting graphics aside, the artwork is what really makes this game stick out.  It captures a beautiful, and unique vision of hell; right out of Dante's Inferno (the book) which this game is based on of course.  There is nudity and some pretty disturbing stuff... no way is this a game for kids. God of War could squeak by but Dante's Inferno could leave them with nightmares.SOUND/STORYThe storyline for the game is hit or miss in my book.  It was interesting but also wasn't really my cup of tea.  Fans of the book would surely appreciate it though.  You play as Dante, attempting to recover his beloved wife, Beatrice, from the bowels of hell, and having to face his past and sins.  The story unfolds as you descend each ring of hell culminating in giving you the full picture of what happen.  Voice acting was pretty good, in fact right on par with some A+ titles.  There was clear effort put into the dialogue and voice acting, and it shows beautifully. Game sound effects are strong with impacts having some definite weight behind them.REPLAY/LENGTHDI is around the same time you'd get out of a GoW title.  It clocks in around 6 - 9 hours depending on difficulty and your ability at solving puzzles.  Once you've beaten the game, a second playthrough is certainly a possibility for fans of the story, or gameplay.  The game is easy to sit down and pick up again, plus contains RESURRECTION mode in which you can start the game with all your abilities intact (like a game+  mode).  Also upon completion of the game you unlock a new difficulty level, and the Gates of Hell arena... a 50 area straight grind to the end where you are timed.  Survive all 50 areas and still have time on the clock and you will be given a score.  Overall there is plenty of replay here if you enjoyed the game and it comes in a variety of forms which is nice.* CONS / NEGATIVES *No game is perfect and Dante's Inferno proves it.  While the game is a lot of fun, it has clear moments where the lack of polish shows. While combat controls were fluid, platforming controls were sub-par.  This is mainly due to bad camera angles that don't give you a sense of height or proper angle.  You could slip off a ledge and grab it. Press up and X to jump back up and instead you let go and drop.  There are some areas where this is a constant problem, where the game has no idea what you are doing.  There are plenty of puzzles in the game but it also gets a little redundant.  Still the puzzles were pretty unique at times and a lot of fun to figure out on my own.  Also when talking with the Poet... I have no idea why they split the dialogue segment into 2-4 parts. You hit R1 to talk to him and you get a quick 10-15 sec segment.  It ends... then.. PRESS R1 again and you ask a question and he'll answer.  Repeat until the ghost goes away.  What is the point of this?  Just hit R1 once and lets hear a normal conversation instead of chopping it up into bits.The real eyesore with the CONS however is the quick time events.  They are present but handled horrendously.  The quick time cues are only located at the top-center of the screen, and sometimes the button isn't even visible to press. You get a GREY circle with a \"light pink\" square.  The pink is barely visible!!  The prompts also can be incredibly random.  You'll just be moving along then.. OMG PRESS SQUARE!? but you had your thumb on the L-analog stick to move forward and the game takes that as input.. FAIL.. restart at checkpoint. Only two spots in the game this really happens, but still it is frustrating to die because of a bad game mechanic.OVERALL 80% (8.0 / B-)Despite having some pretty annoying flaws, that doesn't make Dante's Inferno a bad game.  It is a lot of fun, and has a lot going on.  There are plenty of collectibles, the ability to modify your character and a really nice  unholy/holy upgrade system.  There is a very good balance of puzzles and gameplay here with a good enough story to keep you pressing onward.  I enjoyed the game and if I had paid full price ($60) I would of been satisfied with my purchase.  A good game that for the most part, took what made God of War work and gave it a little spin of its own...  If you are into those action/adventure platform/puzzle games then you'll feel right at home with Dante's Inferno","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"Doom 3:  Not what the hype says, but still pretty good","reviewText":"I picked this game up a few years after it was released, and I waited and bought it used for the X-box for less than 20USD.  I further waited until I had an X-box 360 before I started to play it!  I figured Doom 3's engine wouldn't be handled very well by the original X-box, so I waited till I picked up a 360, judging by some reviews, this was probably a pretty smart move.Now I've been playing the original Doom games for a while, and for them to finally release another Doom game years after those... well I was expecting something pretty huge.  The story-line, and yes, this one does have a bit more of a story-line, is a little weak.  Though I did like how they had tidbits of the mystery of the gates in there, and playing up the occult aspect was a very smart move.  They maintained the same premise of the other games where the goal is to escape wherever it is you're in.  I guess Doom II was a little different in the sense that your main objective was to kill everything, but you still had to get out of there!  It is a fairly tiring concept, but it's been a very long time since Doom II, so it wasn't too tedious on this one.For those people saying that there is NO story-line, they are pretty much wrong.  You have to listen to all the PDA's you collect and interact with the rest of the environment as well to get into it.  You can certainly ignore all these items and play a very boring shooting game pretty quicly, but I prefer looking around and exploring games.  I played through the game pretty thoroughly and listend to all of these.  I thought the PDA thing was an excellent addition to the game, to help move a story into it.  I thought that kind of interface was sort of influenced by Marathon's original system, but hey, I wasn't expecting anything original.  I'm not entirely sure how well Doom 3 played into the sequence of where Doom II left off.  It looks like this Doom I remade, because the events feel like it's just at the beginning.  In Doom II the Earth was overrun, so it's not like the gateways on Mars' moons were a secret!  That's really the main complaint I have about the story, I can't figure out where it belongs sequentially.As far as game play is concerned; it's pretty good for 20 bucks.  I don't know if I would've paid full price for this in retrospect, but it was definitely worth what I paid.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is definitely way too dark.  That doesn't make the game ominious or scary, it makes it annoying!  The flash light function is probably worst part of this game design... and pretty much why I gave it a four.  It's as if in the future we suddenly lost the technology on how to attach a light on a gun or a helmet.  Maybe in this technological downfall they also lost the technology to manufacture Dukt Tape, further decreasing the ability to attach a light on the muzzle of a gun!*Other than the flash light situation that really made me angry... this game was pretty fun.  It's not Half Life 2 or Halo by any measure, but it occupied my time and I didn't feel it was excruciating to get through. I'm not sure how much replay value it really has in the end, but I think it's worht going through once.  For those who complained about the repetitiveness of Doom probably haven't played the other games very much.  Doom is a fairly repetitive game... that's what it is, if you don't like that, don't get this game.  You have similar goals to get to different areas in order to finally get all the way out!  It's like going through a giant maze, which is how these games have always been designed.  I thought it was a pretty good game overall, not five star, but it was definitely enjoyable enough.*TECHNOLOGICAL DOWNFALL:  Agent Ben M. met with me about the sequence of events that led to this heinous problem of Flash Lights.  It turns out; in the year 2008 the Doom II story-line actually happened.  As a result the Bush administration was elected to an unprecedented (as far as future history is concerned) third term.  During this time, Bush sought a seer, and she foretold of a future plagued by a lack of Flash Lights.  So, Bush in his desire for supreme greed, he bought up all the Flash Light making companies and he ordered the shut down of all Duct Tape manufacturing.  This would forever make the peoples dependent on the U.S. government.  After many years without these items, humans soon forgot the technology.  The patent for Duct Tape was lost as the U.S. administration changed over the decades.  Agent M. was one of the few people to see the archives kept on this development and he relayed this secret story to me via [...].  In the end, we are now doomed to carry guns that cannot have Flash Lights attached to them.  The Bush legacy is now the richest and most powerful in the universe; the Duct Tape & Flash Lights are the key... as the sacred seer relayed.  Agent M is rumored to have seen this seer, and it is possible she is immortal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0010EF0UK","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Patapon - the good and the bad","reviewText":"First of all, this is a must play. It seems as more and more developers weigh into the gaming industry, ironically, it becomes more and more rare for one of them to bring something new to the table. Sony, as per usual, comes out of left field with this gem.Part rythm, part puzzle, part rpg, Patapon mashes together bits and pieces of several genres. It's a shallow dash of each, but it's there, and it works. The design is simplistic and flat, but it's beautiful. Nothing seems out of place in this world. If you've read other reviews you probably know the premice of the game. You build an army of little cyclopian soldiers of various jobs and abilities and march them through their enemies to the promised land. You create your armies from the ground up by combining various materials you get from mini games and missions. The creation screen will place the default ingredients (two for each type of patapon.) but you can replace these with higher quality items you've found to make more powerful Rarepons. You'll also get better equipment to outfit your armies in while on your missions. Patapons are controlled by using an 8 beat rythm using a combination of the Cirle, Triangle, Square, and X buttons. You play four beats, the patapons sing their reply for four beats and so on. The catch is there's a tempo you have to follow, your button presses must match with the beat flashing around the border of the screen. Keep up well enough and/or hit a high enough combo and they'll enter fever mode. Fever greatly increases the Patapons attributes. Miss a beat though and you're back to normal Patapons until you can pick it up again via combos. It can be difficult at first but you'll find yourself intuitively stringing the various command beats together and watching your patapons follow your directions flawlessly. The beats are simple but very catchy, you'll find yourself randomly Pata-pata-pata-poning in your head. It has a nice system of combining various materials to make various kinds and shapes of patapons. The story is simple but you find yourself really caring about leading these little eyeballs to their promise land. Lastly it's truly a rewarding site when your little army enters Fever mode and volleys barrages of spears and arrows at your enemy and your warriors crush through the front lines toppling towers and buildings alike. All while singing in unision your praises.This isn't a perfect game though. There's hardly any tutorial, I'm not sure if they just wanted to invoke a trial and error element to the game or if they were just too lazy to flesh out all the mechanics. For instance, say you pick up a really quality piece of meat and some rare metal (required to make the warrior type patapons) and you want to use them to make a Rarepon. That's all well and good if you don't have a full regiment of warrior Patepons. If you do though, it will simply tell you that you can't make any more of that type. Now there are bosses that will eat your Patapons rendering them irrevivable, but trying to strategically get a boss to eat the right Patapon and ONLY the right Patapons would be an exercise in catastrophe, and a large chunk of wasted time. I had to skim through a walkthrough on the internet to find out how to delete unwanted Patapons so I could create better ones. You have to go to the item equip screen, to get there you have to select a mission to go on first. Then you have to press Triangle over the correct regiment, highlight the patapon you don't want. Now you'd think that there would be an option to \"Retire\" the Patapon or even \"Kill\" Patapon... No, the button you have to press is Select, conveniently labeled \"Quit\". Silly me, not realizing that Quit meant get rid of highlighted Patapon. Instead I assumed that Quit meant Quit the game, or Quit the item selection phase... Another issue is the items that enemies drop. Most of it is completely useless after you've started making Rarepons as you don't use the generic meats, wood, and stones anymore. Rarely do any gear or weapons drop. When they do, they're only there for a short amount of time before they dissappear, and not into your inventory, they're gone for good. So say a nice weapon drops, but when you killed the enemy he bounced back puting him behind the rest of his soldiers. You better hope that they fall back or you kill them all quick otherwise you can just wave goodbye. If a boss drops an item behind him when he dies and the mission says complete before you walk over it, you lose it as well. You can watch your happy little eyeballs parade by shiny loot and heaps of cash without any one of them picking it up. The mini games are fun but the items you receive from them can become outdated very fast if your bolstering your ranks with Rarepons rendering said games pointless. On top of that, while they're fun the first couple times,each game is the same thing every time. It's a \"song\" that you have to mimic or play along with and it's the same song with the same beat and you just do the same thing every time. I can literaly listen to the mini games at this point and complete them without looking at the screen. There's also alot of repetition. You need to go back and do the same farming runs through the same stages several time to gather materials (you'll rarely get the ones you need) and money to make troops. Most farming missions yield around 200-250 Ka-ching! (money) and each of the 2nd best Rarepons cost 1k to 1.5k to make. That's 200-250 Ka-ching! if no monsters block you from being able to pick up the coin dropped by their dead counterparts. The last thing isn't really the games fault, it can just be frustrating. This game requires alot of concentration and if the TV's on or your significant other or a friend is trying to talk to you or the phone rings you'll find yourself getting off beat and losing Fever ALOT. Yeah, there's no pause either. Once you start a mission you need to finish it, quit, or die to stop it. Even when I'm alone I generally play with headphones as the PSP speakers don't carry the drum beat all that well all the time, plus it cuts down on the distractions. Personally I have a nice pair of Skullcandy Hesh that I use. They have great sound, they're comfortable, and they block out alot of the outside noise even if you don't have them cranked.In closing, this is a game that you don't want to miss out on. It's at a bargain bin price right now, and you don't find anything this original very often. Yes, it has it's issues but what game doesn't? The good far outweighs the bad.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2008"}

The Kinect arrived while I was at work and my 13 year was dying to try it out.  I told him to hook it up if he could and get playing.  Needless to say, he got it hooked up and had the entire family recognized, signed in, except for me, by the time I got home.  We all vary in size from about 4'5\" to 6'2\" and the Kinect had no problems recognizing all of us.  I will say we are using the new Xbox 360 and not the old version.  He did say the instructions to install on the older model seemed a little daunting, so he was happy we had the new one.I've got say, after playing this, I don't really think the Wii has much of a chance of surviving anymore beyond Mario.  And I own a Wii, their hi-tech controllers (super sensitive kind) and many of their games.  Once you go play Kinect, you wont go back.  I know I wont.The game it comes with has many varieties and was a blast for the whole family.  One would step off screen, and another would slide in a two player game, the Kinect would seamlessly recognize the person, update the avatar and away they went.  The games also give you a surprisingly good workout...really!  Jump, kick, punch, move and shift all in the same game without worrying about a controller strapped to your hand.We never had any issues with this device not recognizing us or anything we were doing.  There has been some talk about lag, but I have to say, I didn't notice it.  You are so into the games you are playing, if there is lag, I think your brain compensates and you just keep on going.  Our large dog walked in front of us (thus the Kinect) and it never affected a single stride in the games.  I'm looking forward to trying out the video chat feature with either a Kinect owner or someone on Windows Messenger Live.The part we enjoyed the most are the photos this thing takes of you playing the games!  It has perfect timing when you make a jump or silly move to collect tokens...absolutely amazing!  Then we can all laugh at each other once the game is over and it shows them to you.Now that I own this piece of hardware, I really think my Wii is obsolete and will be selling it shortly.The world of gaming has changed forever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

This game has awesome fighting moves,beautiful women and gorgeous graphics,and a terrific storyline that ties into the Ninja Gaiden games. When I started getting good with this game I was beating storymode with at least two people per day out of seventeen characters.(some of which you have to unlock along the way.)For each character you beat storymode with,they come with an ending video. Some of these ending videos are excellent and some are really wierd. Also after you beat storymode each character gets a new costume and a new character to which Halo fans might enjoy playing,and the character is the only one who speaks English while the others characters speak Japanese. This game is an excellent purchase and is definitely worth trying to beat. This game's so fun to me that I would rather stay home from school and try to beat time attack mode since I beat storymode and in turn unlock a fourth costume. Parents take note,some of the content in this game isn't kid-appropriate because of some of the ending videos,and the content descriptor of blood,violence,sexual themes,and partial nudity. However,parents should be more afraid of Rumble Roses XX because it also has a mature rating, but this one's for mild language,partial nudity,sexual themes,and violence. Trust me for the warning because I own that game along with the one I'm reviewing.One reason it's not for kids is because of the opening video which many parents would consider horrifying for their kids. Number two,their outfits,sure the girls from the Dead or Alive fighting and volleyball series may wear sleazy outfits,but the game I'm warning parents of goes all out. From this Dead or Alive 4 would be more appropriate for kids. One simple word of advice,rent games first before letting your kids play them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2007"}

Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires.

Sure, some parts of this game is a little frustrating, and sure, the camera angles are a bit awkward, but you get used to it and get the hang of it. It's a lot like RP games, where the first time you play it, it is incredibly hard, but once you beat it, you'll play it hundreds of times.  I must have beat this game atleast thirty times.

There is a lot of improvements to the game, most importantly the save system. Your now allowed up to 3 saves so you won't have to worry about mistakes. If you haven't played the first, you have a set time to complete all missions and before what ever you did couldn't be changed so you had to be careful with what was one save. The other things are more zombies. There is a lot more! They added a combo system which is like the ability to make weapons like in Fallout 3. There will be certain stations that you can go to in order to make weapons. To make weapons you have to level up or find special cards throughout the game. These weapons allow you to gain experience quicker so you can level up your attributes faster.I won't give away much of the story but your a guy who plays in a game that involves killing zombies in Los Vegas. An outbreak happens and you have to go save your daughter and you end up frame. Your whole mission is to find out why and to try to get out of there. When you do this (like the first) you go do side missions of saving people and come across psychos that are tough enemies that often hold people hostage. It helps boost your experience much faster. Anything in the environment is useful to kill zombies. If you see it than likely you can use it. You all can mix up drinks to boost abilities like move faster and such.I have enjoyed this game a whole lot and recommend it highly. It is very fun, has an interesting story, and the controls work a bit better than the last title. This game surprises me. It is much better than I expected.

That's a bold statement, but it's a deserved one given the shear scope and overall quality of this game.  Blizzard outdid themselves with this one, in more ways than one.  They upped the visuals.  They upped the story.  They also limited your multiplayer options (in more ways than one).  To be clear, I'm not a big MP guy in the first place, so I'm not going to shed too many tears.  But there were so many options in the original Starcraft that this new incarnation feels a bit gimped.I love single player campaigns.  This is where SC2 outdoes its predecessor.  The missions themselves don't really do a lot to drive the story, but the cutscenes are very well done.  The exposition does a lot to flesh out the story.  Voice acting is great.  The graphics look very good, but I wouldn't say they are jaw dropping.  The level of control is just what you'd expect from an RTS.  I love the units, the upgrades, pretty much everything.The main flaws with this game affect multiplayer.  There is no more LAN support (not that I ever participated in any LAN parties).  Also, it's region locked, so you can't play against your buddies across the pond.  It's also possible that Blizzard could block you from playing the game if your ISP changes your IP address after installing the game (how often does that really happen?  But it's still a potentially fatal flaw for this game if it's true).  Why Blizzard chose to implement these changes and limitations I'll never know (perhaps Activision swayed them, ya think?).  Regardless of these flaws, getting into MP matches is easy.  The match making system works pretty well, but if you're a noob be prepared to get annihilated a lot in the beginning.Starcraft 2 was worth the wait.  It really is a fun game with an interesting story.  It's beautiful to look at and easy to learn.  Like everyone else, I'm eager to get my hands on the next two installments (whenever that will be).  If you're big into MP you might steer clear of this game and stick with the original Starcraft.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Great Multimedia device!","reviewText":"Ever since Sony introduced the original PlayStation to an unsuspecting public back in 1995, there have been rumours aplenty about the electronics giant producing a handheld version. It might have taken a decade, but the rumours are now made flesh in the form of the PlayStation Portable - PSP to its friends.FeaturesAs with the iPod, the design of the PSP is one of its most appealing attributes. It's weighty but well-balanced in your hands with two sets of controls left and right of the screen, aping the PlayStation's joypad. It can play games, movies (purchased on discs or any MPEG-4 file), music (MP3 or ATRAC) and display photographs, and even comes with a built-in Wi-Fi connection.When it comes to games, the PSP certainly holds its own against the Nintendo DS with a raft of great titles including portable versions of Ridge Racer and Metal Gear Acid. But our favourite two launch titles are WipeOut Pure, which is an updated version of the classic sci-fi racer; and sleeper-hit-in-waiting Everybody's Golf, a game that is so addictive we think you'll be playing it for months.PerformanceThe most outstanding thing about the PSP is its display, a 4.3-inch widescreen LCD that is bright and clear. In low-light conditions, the backlit screen is superb. However, like most portable games consoles, the screen is almost useless outdoors. The console's stereo speakers are decidedly underwhelming but the supplied headphones make up for it. The battery lasts just five hours on a two-hour charge. But you can forgive it everything when you turn it on and start playing the games.Ease of useIt's as easy to use as opening the box and switching it on. Whether you're playing games or movies from disc, or playing music or viewing photos from MemorySticks, it couldn't be more simple.Value for moneyAt 179/250$ for a portable machine it is expensive, though we'd argue that it's worth every penny.VerdictLike the iPod, this has the potential to be the next 'must-have' piece of kit. However, if you are on a tight budget you might want to wait for the price to drop and some more games titles to be released before splashing the cash.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2005"}

One thing I have to say is, the DS has some real competition here. I used to think the PSP was over priced junk, but I've realized its not at all. The gameplay is very close, the features above and beyond, and the price virtually the same.OK, so I really like my new PSP I got for Christmas. I connected to my wireless right away, letting me browse the web and listen to some pretty nice Internet Radio stations. I have two games so far: Wipeout Pure and Gretzky NHL. Wipeout is pretty good, but I'd still rather go with Mario Kart. Gretzky NHL is a mediocre hockey game, but its fun on a handheld and something the DS could never pull off, graphically and techniquelly.I plan on getting some quality titles eventually, but for now I'm happy. Get a big memory card. I've got tons of fun demos, vids, RSS feeds, and themes loaded on to mine. Oh, and it's essential to save games.But every good thing has it's flaws. First of all, due to the DS's huge popularity, many more titles are made for the DS than PSP, leading to more quality titles deserved on the DS. The battery life and durability isn't up to par against the DS either. Something costing an exta 40 bucks had better be worth it.But even after that, it has some great titles the DS can't do, plays just like a PS2, and is a great multimedia device. The DS is great, but the PSP can do that and so much more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2008"}

Invariably, all ships will always look pretty much the same with only miniscule details that are different.Ships:  Cruisers are way too slow and turn like a train off its tracks.  Escorts seem to be the best option for this game, as about 70% of the missions I've done have all been space missions, and it's important to have a good ship.  I haven't played my Science vessel at all.Missions:  This game would be better if the missions didn't seem like they were the repeated over and over, with different planet models and asteroid changes.Crafting:  I've never been a fan of crafting, so it doesn't really hurt my feelings that there isn't an extensive crafting system.....MMO?:  It's an MMO, trust me... There are instanced missions that are solo (or don't auto-join you to groups), there are instanced missions that have open grouping, and there are instanced missions that make it seem more like an MMO (tons of people working together towards a common goal).  It's refreshing to see an MMO that doesn't require you to play amongst other players all the time, because a lot of MMO players are (expletive deleted).Leveling:  You have to gain 10 sub ranks in your current rank, plus spend a certain amount of training points to be promoted to the next rank.  IE, you need to be a Lieutenent 10 and spend 6700 skill points to get to Lt Commander 1, which would be the same as Lieutenant 11 if you hadn't gotten promoted to Lt Commander.Pros:  Playing in the Star Trek Universe as a captain of your own ship.  Away team missions with bots (your bridge officers).  You can block and report game currency sellers at the same time.  Free ship when you get to each Rank.Cons:  Server seems to go down just about every day, for at least 2 hours each time. Every space fight is a Kobiashi Maru, where you'll be outnumbered by 2-8 Ships.  No matter how many Tactical officers with the taunt skill you have, your character will automatically be ganged up on if you use AOE attacks.  Personal shields get drained in two to three shots, and you can get one shot by named encounters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2010"}

Ultimately the success of a system is determined by the size of the user base.  It is the amount of software sales that drive the true profits of a system.  My question is if Sony has committed a fatal error by assuming a base of 20 million plus people will spend 600.00 for a console.  While the die hards will not have a problem, what about the fence sitters? I believe that question has been answered by simply going to your local Target.  While there are no Wiis to be found, most Targets, Best Buys etc have several PS3s just sitting around.  The fact that a system is so readily available so shortly after launch means that there is no longer the great demand and this is due to the price.  Since the price includes a Blu Ray player and the PS3 games require Blu Ray discs, Sony has painted itself into a corner.  It is already losing money and cannot create a non-blu ray version that will allow for a cut to 300 bucks.  So, it appears that the decision to use the PS3 as a sort of trojan horse for Blu Ray may have doomed the PS3. I fear there wil not be the tens of millions willing to spend the big bucks when a simliar lower price system is already available.  Had the PS3 not inlcuded Blu Ray and debuted at the same price as the XBOX 360, it would have been a huge success.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2007"}

{"product_name":"B005TH6BD4","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Yakuza: Dead End","reviewText":"\"Yakuza\" is one of the most wonderful series to come out of Japan. It has several lovable characters, and some of the most tight fighting mechanics in any game on the market. Not only that, but it has a breathtakingly accurate depiction of several real-world locations in Japan. Sega was certainly in the right to bring over the third and fourth entries in the stellar series, and I sincerely hope we get to see more in the years to come. But just like some of the lesser \"Pokemon\" spin-offs, there are some things that should probably just stay in Japan. \"Yakuza: Dead Souls\", an unfortunately mediocre zombie game masquerading as \"Yakuza\" fan service, is one of those sad cases.In a side-story that takes place after the events of \"Yakuza 4\" (limiting its appeal right off the bat), series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is forced out of the beachside orphanage he runs due to his stepdaughter of sorts Haruka being kidnapped by a shady businessman-type villain. Concurrently, secondary protagonist Shun Akiyama is desperately seeking medicine for an illness afflicted his lovable and rotund assistant, Hana. Other playable characters include the unhinged Goro Majima and the legendary gangster Ryuji Goda. These are all characters that fans, like myself, know and love, but an average gamer hoping to pick this up and have a good time will be left out in the cold. Many in-jokes and references are dropped with little to no explanation, and without any context, none of the character dynamics will make any sense. Keep in mind this is a review strictly for people who have never touched these games before.Oddly, the same thing applies to the gameplay. Players of the older games will understand instantly what the developers were trying to do, by blending the series' traditional exploration, side-missions and mini-games with zombie-shooting action. But anybody else who picks it up won't understand why there are humorous asides and quirky things to do outside of progressing the plot. Those being lead to believe this is a spin-off with different gameplay will surprised that this is a \"Yakuza\" entry with zombies and guns, nothing more, nothing less. For some, this sounds thrilling. For others, it won't make a lick of sense.The crippling flaw here, though, isn't the confusing approach to the gameplay. It's the fact that the shooting mechanics are absolutely awful, a lazy mash of brawling mechanics and sub-par shooting. Players who don't want to use accurate aim will quickly realize that the character will run around in circles like an idiot, firing randomly. If that player were to use the aiming mechanic, they'd discover that the game does all the work for them by locking onto every enemy, oftentimes guaranteeing easy headshots. But if they were to want to work for those headshots with the fine aiming, they couldn't, because the fine aiming is one of the worst mechanics I've suffered through in a game. It automatically allocates control to the left analog stick, and doesn't lock in place like most games, so if you're walking backwards and start using fine aim, the camera jerks around 180 degrees and leaves you vulnerable to attack.What's really annoying here is that the brawling mechanics, the one thing \"Yakuza\" should be good at, are essentially broken. Sure, you can pick up a lot of objects and use them as weapons, but why would you? Your character is just going to get stuck in a combo and not able to get out of it, meaning that if the object you're swinging misses its intended target, you're going to be left vulnerable to getting flanked. Plus, the control scheme allocates brawling to the R1 button, and it feels incredibly odd to start a session of beating things up with a trigger.So, your combat \"options\" are essentially running down corridors and letting the aiming mechanic do all the work for you. Sometimes, it's so cripplingly simplistic that you'll be aiming straight ahead on a staircase, pull the trigger of your gun, and hit a target that is several feet below you vertically. That's right, folks, bullets travel vertically when you shoot straight in this game. Take this into consideration when you think about the fact that within the first 2-4 hours, you'll have taken out an upwards of 800-1000 zombies, and that this is a game that, at its very shortest, is reported to have 10-12 hours worth of gameplay, side-missions excluded. This means that, at a minimum, you could be fighting through 4000+ zombies with mechanics that aren't conducive to doing any aiming on your own. Is this really how you want to spend your life?The graphics don't make a compelling case for the product, either. Usually, I'm pretty impressed by what this developer has to offer, but this time around I can only say \"eh.\" Sure, the depiction of Japan in ruins is certainly cool and all, but the edges on everything are jagged, and the environments are incredibly limited. Not only that, but be prepared for some lag when there are a lot of zombies on an outside street. It doesn't help that when you're not outdoors, the dev team decided to lift templates from every zombie shooter ever. Brace yourself for some gray and brown sewers, followed by some grey and brown hallways, all tied together with some grey and brown basements. Seeing these worn level designs rendered with graphics that are already unremarkable makes for an experience that is none too pleasing on the eyes. Oh, and the zombies look pretty lame too.What's really disappointing is how exceptional the acting is. It's a bummer because the incredible Japanese vocal cast is obviously trying their best to deliver compelling performances, and they succeed in doing so. The dialogue is sharp and funny, and the acting is some seriously great stuff. Not only that, but the soundtrack isn't half-bad either, albeit a little filled with generic techno and rock. So why is this disappointing? Because the rest of the game doesn't hold up at all. The actors and the composers have to hold together the gaping, bleeding wound the rest of the game is, and all they've got is some old duct tape.While I've played worse games than \"Yakuza: Dead Souls\", this is no defense for something that is, at the end of the day, a really mediocre game. Many reviews on Amazon seem to be based solely on the reviewers' love of the franchise, and frankly, I don't think that's fair. Given that this is something Sega is now selling in a double-pack with the far superior \"Binary Domain\", it's obvious they think it can marketed to an average shooter fan or zombie lover. This is simply not the case. As a fan of the \"Yakuza\" franchise, I feel that this game is a really terrible thing to foist upon somebody expecting a zombie TPS, and could only be enjoyed by people who were really invested in the franchise.As a piece of fan service, \"Yakuza: Dead Souls\" is good for some brainless slaughter while laughing with (and at) characters you've grown to know and love. But as a game for everybody else, it's a graphically inferior product with shoddy mechanics and challenge based on poor design as opposed to genuine difficulty. Overly simplistic and as brain-dead as one of the zombies in the game, Sega's latest entry into the franchise is a bit like decaffeinated coffee: a weaker derivative with too many differences from the source material to truly recommend purchasing.Plot: 7Gameplay: 4Graphics: 5Sound: 7Overall: 5.75","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"The Bar Has Been Raised","reviewText":"Drake's Fortune is not only the best title yet released for the PS3, it is also one of the finest games ever created, for any platform.  Production, production, production... quite simply the production values for Drake's Fortune are through the roof.  From start to finish, developer Naughty Dog took zero shortcuts, and delivered exactly what gamers deserve to receive.  The graphics, voice acting, game-play, interface, pacing, and reward system are all top notch, and they come together to form a sum that is a masterpiece of modern video gaming.  (Naughty Dog has come a long way since the original Crash Bandicoot on PS1!)Perhaps the most impressive accomplishment of Drake's Fortune is the pacing.  Over the course of the adventure, I was never once bored, and I attribute that to the brilliant manner in which the story is delivered- not only through magnificent cut-scenes (featuring some of the finest face modeling, motion capture, and voice acting ever witnessed), but also because the game-play never gets stale.  One level you're fighting for your life on a ship that is besieged by pirates, the next you're exploring a lush jungle, then onto a high-speed jeep chase with gunfire galore, followed by wave-runners, booby traps, duck and cover battles, submarines... you get the idea.  You won't become bored, because Drake's Fortune won't give you a chance to.  Even the delivery of the puzzles is brilliant- they are just challenging enough to provide a quick change in game-play, but they never slow down the pacing of the story.And without revealing any spoilers, I will add that at one point in the game, I experienced the most authentic \"survival horror\" type game-play I have ever endured- even more so than in Resident Evil 4 or Condemned: Criminal Origins.  I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat (gripping the controller far too tightly), and the muscles in my arms and shoulders were seizing up.  Only when I gasped for air, did I realize that I had been holding my breath in fearful anticipation (wait until you see these lighting effects and character animations in action).  Now that's convincing game-play!At eight to ten hours, Drake's Fortune is of perfect length to maintain the excellent pacing.  Every minute spent in this world is enjoyable, and never are the production values reduced.  It is somewhat akin to an Indiana Jones movie, but far more rewarding.  Instead of passively watching a character go through the motions, you become the character, and actively direct the adventure.  Becoming Drake for a few hours, and joining the lovable Sully and Ellie (your main companions), is so much fun, this is one experience that most gamers will want to revisit, multiple times, even after they have completed it.At sixty dollars a pop, games are not particularly cheap, but I can assure you that Drake's Fortune is worth every penny, and plenty more.  Naughty Dog (along with a handful of other studios- Kojima Productions, Insomniac, for example), has taken the challenge and the responsibility to deliver product of the highest quality into the hands of gamers.  Fans of the industry are those who also support the industry, and when they pay out their hard-earned money, they deserve to receive a game that is as enjoyable and highly polished as Drake's Fortune.Game developers, be advised: The bar has been raised.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2008"}

Sam Fisher is geared up to infiltrate high-security strongholds, seize critical intelligence, destroy threatening data, and neutralize the enemy--all without leaving a trace.","reviewerName":"Michigoon \"tech geek\"","summary":"Technologically masterful, technically overrated.","reviewText":"Splinter Cell is one of those games I wish I could finish. The graphics are so beautiful that my friends and I have spent hours just playing the lighting engine, the way curtains flow, the way you can interact with objects... that much is masterful. The gameplay, however, can often be the opposite. There are a lot of reviews, and a lot of ground to cover, so I'm only going to address some key points here. My first draft of this review was also way too long. Trust me, this is the bare bones details of my review.My beef starts with Sam's weaponry. Sam's standard pistol is the most useless pistol I have ever encountered in a game, especially because it's this game. In most conditions, the pistol is so wildly inaccurate that by the time you've moved into killing range you might as well just make the effort to go for hand-to-hand combat. Other times, for no apparent reason, you can take down a dozen guards with as many shots. However, the game tends toward the former most of the time. This is critically saddening because it ruins so many moments. For example, the game's lighting engine means shooting out a lamp will darken the room. To get the jump on some enemies, shoot out the light and when they come to investigate you'll have the upper hand (night/thermo vision... engage). But have fun trying to shoot that light. Your wildly inaccurate pistol and quirky game physics mean it might take you anywhere from one shot to a dozen and agonizing moments of aligning your crosshair until you manage to take out the lamp. My personal record is wasting just under 2 clips before a ceiling light FINALLY blew out. Keep in mind, it only takes one hit to shatter any glass in the game. His other &quot;tools&quot; would require some spoilers to cover and are thus omitted. Mostly, the other weapons and gadgets are excellent.Adding to that, the game revolves around a Metal Gear Solid style alert system which ranges from brilliant to unforgivable. Sometimes, saving yourself from game over is a matter of being quick and making sure guards don't make it to alarms if they notice you. Other times, it's walking around a corner only to not notice the camera setting in the dark until you hear a blaring alarm and &quot;Game Over&quot;. Restart, be more careful, lean around the corner to spy on the action... oops, you caught the camera when it was looking in your direction. Game over. Retry, sneak up, whip out your pistol, lean around the corner, camera's facing away... okay now shoot. Miss. Again. Again. Three more. The rest of the clip. Oh joy, Game Over again.And therein lies the big problem for me- having to restart so much. At times, you'll breeze through whole sections of levels with smooth spy precision as though it was second nature. But unless you're very lucky, 90% of your gameplay time will be retrying the same hallway over and over and over because of any number of problems. The game relies on a &quot;checkpoint&quot; system where you only get to save when you accomplish certain goals. This means, unfortunately, you may spend ten minutes stealthily clearing one section only to open the wrong door at the wrong time and get Game Over before your save. Sorry, Charlie, do it all over again.When you're &quot;in the groove&quot; with this game, it's sheer heaven. The technology is fascinating, the story is enveloping, and using your array of moves and tools is a blast. However, even for a gamer as patient as I am, you're going to need serious dedication to finish this game. As it stands, this game was utterly unplayable for me past the first few levels- one of which took on the order of a full day filled with cursing and various ill-natured gestures toward my television to complete. And in the end, I will only ever touch this game to play around with the gorgeous graphics and gizmos.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2004"}

J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"The End of the World Times Five","reviewText":"Lately, I've been really disappointed with the PS2's RPG offerings. Final Fantasy XII was the logical evolution of the graphics over gameplay mentality, a game that basically played itself. Valkyrie Profile 2 had some neat ideas but completely dropped the ball with its unbalanced difficulty and messy battle system. Almost six months after the console has become obsolete along comes Odin Sphere, the RPG swan song I've been waiting for.The story of Odin Sphere tells the tale of a war between the Odin and his Aesir against the Vanir, the fairy people, to control a device known as the cauldron. It follows the journey of five different characters over the course of roughly the same time period as the events that herald the end of the world come to pass. Their paths all converge at the end when they take part in one last, futile battle against the beasts of the apocalypse. Even if the individual stories of the characters do lean a bit towards the melodramatic, they are excellent, interesting, and develop the characters well. All five stories fit together nicely like pieces of a puzzle.Its story alone is enough to cover quite a few worts that gameplay has as far as I'm concerned. For one thing, Odin Sphere is a throw-back to older games in difficulty as well as its visual design. Odin Sphere is a 2D side-strolling action game primarily with RPG elements thrown in. Watching it is like a seeing a gorgeous painting come to life. It is almost mind-blowingly difficult at times. At first, the difficulty level almost had me hating this game. Odin Sphere has a terrible learning curve that has to be overcome to find the gameing goodness within. For one thing, the player must learn that mindlessly attacking will get you killed quickly. Secondly, you must learn that given the limited space in your inventory, items are meant to be used, not stockpiled. Dropped items are plentiful so you can easily find or make another one. Thirdly, the character must use the food cultivation system to gain levels and healing items. The food you grow at first doesn't heal you up very much and you are open to enemy attack should you need to consume it in the heat of battle which makes it nearly useless. A bit later on you'll gain a healing potion alchemy mix which you can synthesize at any time and at last the game becomes bearable. Also I don't think it helps that the starting character, Gwendolyn, tends to get stuck in long combo animations that leave her open to attack. I found it to be a ton of fun after I learned the ropes because, rather than being a mindless hack and slash you can just plow through, Odin Sphere requires some smart thinking and quick reflexes. I also don't think that it helps Odin Sphere's case at the beginning that the first character's story arc takes place the latest in the time line and feels like it has large gaps in it, which are actually covered in other characters' scenarios.In the end, Odin Sphere is a wonderful game, but its only going to appeal to a select audience. If you love RPGs and hard action games, your ship has come in because this blends the best of both into one package. If not, its probably only going to make you frustrated.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2007"}

Primarily for the Skype functionality, a microphone is onboard along with a reduced glare 4.3&#34; screen. Its a given that fingerprints will still be a continued issue for the PSP line. Thankfully, the age old problem of ghosting has yet to appear on my new PSP 3000.One of the sweeter features now is an upgraded (AV) video output support. Owners can now operate their systems with regular (NON HD) TV. I suggest buyers pick up a good composite or component cable. With the usual collection of great games, improved graphics is a major plus.As with all previous models, control buttons layout are very much like the classic Play Station. One area of concern is that load times for the UMD (Universal Media Disc) seemed to drag a bit.

It seems games are really getting away from co-op lately and my husband and I prefer to play games together. The co-op on this game is fantastic. It makes the game a little easier to complete and a little more fun.What makes this game better, to me, than other franchises is that not only is it a great game, but it has a great story line. You really know who the characters are, you become attached to them, it's more like a playable movie than a video game.This was also the first game I used the multiplayer feature on and I was pleasantly surprised! Horde mode was my absolute favorite, great to play with strangers or other friends online... even locally with one or two other people. As for the rest of the multiplayer, I like that it matches you based on your level rather than a random assignment.

The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks.

{"product_name":"B0050SZBP6","description":"","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"OMG... not another daily... NOOOO!","reviewText":"I wasn't too excited about MOP after playing the beta.  Finally downloaded it after I uninstalled GW2 after a few weeks and have now leveled up two of my toons to 90 and have one in 469 item level gear.  I have played this game for years and years, and quit several times due to boredom and whatever else.  Here is a rundown of what I think of the game and rating for each category I think important:Panderia!  4 of 5 stars.  As far as wow goes, its the best looking set of zones they have made.  As far as everyone else, its kinda bleh.  The cartoony graphics are fine, they are what they have been for the last eight years.  I was kind of dissapointed with the re-use of so many mob models they have been using for so many years, but they have added quite a bit of new stuff.  The areas are all very nicely done, and large.  Lots to explore, very oriental in feeling, and the quest hubs - while overall nothing very exciting (kill 10 of these and then 10 more of those!) are varied enough to not get overly tedious before you hit 90.  They also added pandas as a race to play which look fine, but not something I get too excited about.Player dynamics.  3 of 5 stars.  I play a mage/warrior/hunter as my three main toons, though I have several other 85s.  The talent system was changed dramatically from cata with the replacing of the trees with the new tier system.  Overall they have done a fairly decent job with the talents and there are a few trees that its fun to try different abilities for different fights.  Overall though, its primarily the same talent in three different formats.  DPS talents all do primarily the same dps - they just look different when used.  Also many core talents that used to be specific to a spec on a class are now in the tier.  So many specs seemed to have lost a bit - yet they have gained a little as well since oftentimes you can now use abilities that used to be restricted to another spec.  My fire mage can now use ice shield and my assassination rogue can use shadowstep.  It mixes it up a bit, which is a nice change.  Leveling however, IMO went down the toilet.  I have tried leveling a monk... and I just loose interest.  Since you cannot make any decisions except once every 15 levels, it doesnt really seem like you accomplish much when you gain a level or two.  Often the lower level tiers on the new talent system have talents that don't really impact your character much so it can be very underwhelming.  I find though, with my mage which is best geared main atm, that I stick with the same abilities 95% of the time.  Its also fundamentally the same abilities that I use from cata and before.  While there have been a few tweaks, the character just seems... tired.  I think its just because I have been playing the game for so many years and the overall wow combat system to me is showing some years.  Same set of buttons.. same rotation... over and over and over...  So three stars.Max Level dynamics.  1 of 5 stars.  Wow... why one star???  The new LFR is fine, the bosses look great and are different and so far a few weeks in still fun to do.  The world bosses are ok, a nice change and fun as well.  The thing blizz added that for me is almost a game breaker is how you progress your toon.  In this game, you get gear at level 90 to progress.  You can go do your weekly LFR - maybe an hour or two and your done.  You can do your world boss or two, and another hour.  You can also gain rep with factions and buy valor gear.  This is where for me the game goes down the big toilet bowl of crappy game design.  One huge complaint with cataclysim was there was no incentive to get out in the world.  Everyone sat in the cities and spamed nonsense in trade chat and qued for runs.  Fine, it was bad and they tried to fix it.  Get players out in the world!  WOOO!  Except... to get that valor gear you have to grind dailies to get enough rep with that faction to be able to purchase them.  Revered with this faction for your shoulders.  Honored with these guys for you epic crafting pattern.  Honored with this faction before you can start doing dailies with that other faction to get your legs at revered.  The bummer of it all is that there is no other game mechanic to gain rep other than doing dailies.  If dailies aren't your thing... then your screwed.  You can gain a bit of rep out in the zones by doing the zone quests, but they will not get you enought to get the great gear at the higher levels.  They took out the reputation tabbards and your stuck with... dailies.  Now I enjoyed the heck out of tol borad like alot of other people.  I also liked some of the daily hubs they had with sunwell and a few others.  But I didn't feel like I was falling behind with my guild if I didn't do them for a day or week.  With these... hey, you want to dps on the normal raid runs??  Why don't you have your revered gear yet?  Well... you just lost your spot.  So each night after work, log in, and several hours of the exact same quests you have done for each night for weeks... and tonight I just shut off the game and said to heck with it.  I am so sick of the game already and its only been a few weeks.  I have only partially geared one toon and I cannot take anymore of this grindy daily nonsense.  Its the worst I have seen it in eight years and I don't know now if I will start up again after my annual wears out in DEC.  I cannot imagine at this time even leveling up another of my 85s because at the end of that decently done leveling process is that horrid rep grind nonsense.  If blizz would have given people the OPTION of gaining rep through tabbards and heroic dungeon runs like in cata, this wouldn't be so bad.So in the end you have a fairly decent leveling process to get to 90 and after a few weeks your stuck doing a few hours of LFR / world bosses hoping you get a purple so you don't have to grind rep with some faction for hours until your ready to throw your comp out the window.  Cataclysim had many issues and overall was kind of dissapointing.  This one was ok at first, and is quickly loosing its appeal.  So two stars for me - they added some decent stuff, but overall MOP is very repetitive, grindy, and underwhelming.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound","description":"","reviewerName":"Merryjuice \"Bukkake Boy\"","summary":"Awesome Headset, Love It For All Games","reviewText":"I bought this headset at Best Buy last month to replace my wireless stereo headphones from Creative.  Set up on Windows 7 64-bit was easy. You can auto-mux all your sounds to the headphone, or if you have multiple speakers, mux your ventrilio to your outside source, game to your headphones, etc.  G930 software is a bit basic, leaving you to decide how to advance calibrate presets for games.  The voice morphing software was a nice novelty to mess around with, but ultimately unecessary bloat.  I would have preferred better EQ presets.I tried these headphones on World of Warcraft, Call of Duty Black Ops, and Battlefield Bad Company 2 for PC.  Easily the best sound out of the three is Battlefield.  The game had several different settings to try out, War Tapes being my favorite as it adds reverberation algorythm and extra bass for explosions.  You could actually hear the rustling of people's clothing while walking around in cut scenes.  Pretty amazing to hear the care their sound engineers put into the game.However, the reason why most people using gaming headphones are to hear the sound indicators.  For example, there are distinct sounds to hear in shooters like footsteps, or spell abilities being used like in Warcraft.  After fooling with the sound settings in the G930 software, I found bass/ sub capabilities were only apparent in the side (stereo) speakers.  When isolating the front and back portions of the surround sound, they were very tin-can sounding; even with the subwoofer option turned up.  It was apparent emphasis was placed on the stereo portion of gameplay, with little regard for establishing a good center-channel speaker.  When playing shooters, it was hard to distinguish front and back sounds, such as a person walking behind me versus the front.  There is also a slight sound delay from control inputs to actual sound production.  It wasn't enough to be noticable, but running sound through different sources indicated a slight delay in the headphones. After taking the black foam covering the speakers off, it was painfully obvious many of the issues with sound distinction came from the placement of the speakers inside of the headphone.  It appears some of the channels are simulated surround sound, not actual.  It goes to show, headphones are still no substitute to having a good traditional 5.1 surround set up.Still though the sound isolation, ease of use, wireless characteristics, and bass quality far outweight the G930 drawbacks.  The headphones come with a stereo-surround switch to adjust to stereo programs such as Ventrilio, Winamp and Youtube videos on-the-fly.  The volume knob is conveniently located next to the stereo-surround switch button, making adjustments a snap.  I still haven't found a use for the G-keys, though it is a nice novelty for those who need them.Provided you have a good sound card, you can source your PS3 / XBOX 360 sound through your computer (via optical in/out), letting you use these headphones for the systems. It can be a real money saver for those who are worried these can only be used via PC.  I've enjoyed these headphones thoroughly for casual gaming, and recommend these for anyone needing a better edge with game sound indicators without the standard 5.1 setup.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2011"}

Anyway I'll have a short review for each of the games but if you have never played Jak and Daxter stop reading and buy it now.Jak and Daxter-9/10 My first ps2 game also one of my favorite games of all time unlike the other Jak games this one is more like Super Mario 64 but betterJak 2-10/10 Same as the first one this is one of my favorite games ever made and I know a lot of people like the 3rd better I actually preferred this one but this game is pretty much more platforming game and gran theft auto combined to make one epic gameJak 3-8.5/10 this is a good end to the trilogy but I have only played this one a few times before and its they only jak game in this collection I haven't beat on ps2 which will change with this collection","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2012"}

HUGE fan. It's defined a generation for military FPS on console gaming and certainly without question raised and set the bar for online multiplayer mayhem. When COD4 MW1 came out two years ago it was a defining moment for console gaming and multiplayer action. Infinity Ward had set the bar very very high and made what to this day is still the great multiplayer FPS on any console IMO. So where does that leave us in 2009?Lets start with the single player portion of the game. Picking up where the first MW left off the single player campaign is chock full of action and gets the blood pumping but the story is very thin, not to mention VERY short. 5 hours. Wow. Now granted most of us did not pick this up for the single player portion of the game but come on Infinity Ward, 5 hours?So lets get to why most of us bought this game, multiplayer. Let me say right off the bat so far having played 6 of the maps on multi I am not that impressed. I am not sure what happened here but to me it feels like there was not much thought that went into this game as what went into MW1. The maps feel generic and run of the mill as if it's more a paint by numbers then something that shined the way it did in MW1. And this is not me being nostalgic either it's just simple folks the maps lack a certain amount of depth and zeal that made the first MW so intense. Sure we are treated to a lot more perks but that does not take away the amount of meh when it comes to the layout. That being said the game is still fun but I for one hope that we get some very decent map downloads to compensate for the lack luster offerings given to us upon release. Honestly I have had more fun with the last COD offering in WAW and Zombie Nazis then I have had so far with MW2.The game also seems to have suffered in areas of a drop in graphical detail compared to MW1. Again not sure what happened here. There are some parts of the game that look amazing and others that look pretty generic and sort of like seen that before type of style.No question the game will be a massive seller and certainly there are going to be those who disagree with my review but this is just my personal opinion and should not keep you from getting the game. If you are unsure I'd say give it a rental first (especially if you only want it for the single player)and judge for yourself.One more comment. I got the Prestige Edition and the goggles are very nice but the best part of that package is getting to play the original COD on the 360. They did a great job porting the game and it looks amazing for a game of that age in HD. Not to mention the multi player IMO is more fun then MW2. But again I am someone who has followed the series since the get go.The bottom line is MW2 is a good game not a great game and is better then most average shooters but is not the worst of the lot, that legacy still goes to COD3 which should not even be included as a mention in the history of COD. Just remember this my opinion and it's not right or wrong it's just my personal impression of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J998","description":"","reviewerName":"All Powerful Wizard Of Oz","summary":"The greatest Mortal Kombat game ever made, period. If you are an old school MK fan, GET OVER HERE!","reviewText":"I have played every single Mortal Kombat game since it's grand entrance into the arcades many moons ago. MK1 came into the world swinging and took everyone's breath away because it was something no one had seen before. It changed gaming as we know it. You would not have any of the blood or violence you currently have in some of the shooters out there had it not been for MK1 because it opened a Pandora's box, a wonderful beautiful bloody gory box of fight!MKII & MKIII became main staples in my home console arsenal with many weekends and evenings spent with close friends playing into the wee hours of the morning until we could barely keep our eyes open and passed out due to shear exhaustion. Those \"tournaments\" are legendary amongst some of my closet friends. MK brought us bros together in a way that no other game could. For my generation MK was our COD moment on the consoles except there was no online play so we actually all had to hang out to play among friends. Imagine that!Then Mortal Kombat died a slow painful death starting with the disaster MK4. Boon & Tobias (Noob Saibot for you noobs who don't know) I have always praised for creating something that was able to transform video games and especially the fighting genre, decided it would be a novel to go 3D since that was all the rage back when MK4 debuted. Games like Tekken were starting to make a mark in the arcades and home console movement changed forever with the N64. Made marketing sense to Midway and the creators to venture into that territory to keep up with the times. The problem was that Mortal Kombat was no longer Mortal Kombat. It lost something along the way and with every new incarnation a little bit of it's soul disappeared until it was no longer relevant and a shell of it's former self. I will say that MK vs DC has some cool stuff and certainly the story mode for that game was a precursor in how the new MK9 story mode would flow, still it did not feel like Mortal Kombat.2011, Mortal Kombat 9 arrives with a vengeance. GET OVER HERE!! Mortal Kombat 9 brings back the original vibe that the first 3 games had. First off all praise the makers they finally wised up and went back to the 2D glory that made the first 3 so much better then their 3D red headed step child. Everything about MK9 screams classic MK. From the character designs, combos, fatalities, backgrounds and yes the story mode. This IS Mortal Kombat. The long nights have again become a part of a ritual of taunts and long battles of winning moments and crushing blows of defeat as the taunts roll off the tongue from friend to friend. That old feeling once again returns.Pretty much this. If you grew up with Mortal Kombat and you were a fan of MKI, MKII, MKIII then you must get this game if you still have a fire in your heart to play video games and miss that old vibe of how Mortal Kombat used to make you feel. It's like they took everything that made those games so awesome and improved them the right way using the modern day technology they have in their corner now. The only thing different of course is the characters are not video carbon copies of actors but that's OK because the art style works and feels right. You'll appreciate it.There is also so many new things added to this edition of MK that it will keep you busy for months and I strongly suggest picking up one of the Klassic Sticks from PDP if you can find one. They are limited to 6000 and not only is it great for playing this version but you get the arcade collection of the original 3 with it when you buy it and it's spot on. The stick is beautiful and it makes playing MK9 a much better experience IMO. Worth the investment. Still even so without it the game just rocks and you can still download the original collection :-)That's it folks. Nothing new to add that has not already been said. I just wanted to write a review for some old schoolers out there who may have been on the fence about this new installment due to the lack luster installments over years past. I am sure there will be some flaming in the comment section regarding the other versions of MK and again, I have played them all (except for the handhelds) and none of them IMO lived up the vibe of what made Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat. MK9 brings it all back to it's glory.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

I actually played through it TWICE.  I had fun, was blown away by the graphics, but after I returned the game I never thought of it again.Onimusha can be compared to Resident Evil because it basically that same game only set in medival Japan.  Anyone who has played the RE series will certainly feel some deja vu.  You play a samuri warrior who must rescue a princess from a castle over run by zombies.  The graphics are beautiful but are still the same static shots.  However, the player models and little touches of smoke and such really make everything blend in together and seem more alive.  Combat is simple yet strategic and very fun, although it gets old after the second run thru.  Still, I enjoyed myself better than shooting zombies.  There are a few puzzles in the game, but nothing too hard.  The story, though, is very very simple, and a bit of a letdown.  You can tell they cut parts of the game to release it on time.I consider Onimusha a part of the Resident Evil series because it is SO similiar to those games.

Again, as with Fallout 3 before everyone complained and they released a fix in one of the DLC packs, once you get to the end that's it.  If you want to play around and enjoy the big open world, you better do it before you face off the baddies at the final battle, otherwise you have to start over. Furthermore, the story really builds up to a pretty lackluster climax. I spent most of the game rushing through quests, eager to unleash an army of rocket-launcher-toting-murder-bots on the new Vegas strip, only to arrive at the finale and face the big boss man sans murder bots and watch the credits roll. I didn't even get to wear any of that sweet looking NCR ranger armor. To be fair, it did play a little series of seemingly unrelated still images (some person in a vault 101 jumpsuit?) with that \"war, war never changes\" guy narrating. I think that probably changes depending on which story arc you take, but I'll never know.  At the end of the day I just can't see starting over with a new character to find out.Other than that it seems like a big overpriced expansion for Fallout 3. It's decent length and worth owning if you want more Fallout 3, but do yourself a favor, wait for it the price to come down. Also... Steam.

After finally overcoming my fear, I was pleasantly surprised how much fun and entertaining the game is.  The tutorial was a big help and made everything easier to understand and grab the concept of the game.  What makes DJ Hero so different besides the hardware is the sound.  GH games are known for its guitar strums and rock and metal tunes. You will instantly realize that DJ Hero brings something brand new to the plate, satisfying the hunger for rhythm hungry gamers wanting more of a techno, hip-hip and R&B; flavor.  I can't say the game is easy, in my opinion it is very challenging (but I also have troubles rubbing my belly and patting my head at the same time).  Just like other Guitar Hero instruments you need to match the on screen cues and will you earn Euphoria (equileant to star power) and the music will play correctly as long as you hit all the notes.  Even if you mess things up you can continue play unlike or GH games that stop the song if you mess up.  There are a few \"trick\" surprises that allows you have a different effect on the sound of the song you are playing.  The tutorial explains it all thoroughly.Since this is so new on the market, I can't wait to see what Activision comes up with next for DJ Hero. Remember when the first original GH game came out and the guitar was so plain and all you pretty much did was follow the notes and try to beat your own score, this game is kinda the same concept.

By the middle of the game I began to suspect that the cases had really nothing to do with each other, and my fear of that came true when the end of the game came for me, which really angered me. There's no continuity to the story as a lot of loose ends never get tied up in the end. Not to mention I ended up hating the main character towards the end. Game play is just okay, and at times I felt it was a little clunky. The music is fantastic though, and the graphics really are amazing. So it was just a so-so game for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2011"}

It seemed to be taking a page out of the Uncharted series. But since I have been a huge Tomb Raider fan since the first game, I pre ordered. Now Im glad I did. OMG this game is awesome. Almost everything about the game is awesome. Especially the intense gun fights you will have against the baddies. For once the AI is actually smart. If you use a certain stratedgy, they will catch on. Rarely they do the same stratedy twice.One if the few problems the game has is most of the characters are bland and un interesting. Heck you dont really care what happens to them. Also with some of the puzzles, they can be tricky. Some I had to look up help to find the solution to them.One nice new addition is the open world feel. Yes its linear but you can go back forth to certain locations via a campfire...yes you read right. The fast transport is campires found in every location. The replay is also good because there are hidden trinquets hidden everywhere. There is also tombs, where you enter small and short tombs to gain ex.  to upgrade your weapons which is a nice little addition. I do wish there were more tombs and that they were longer.Overall excellent game. To me the best in the series.Pros:-The intense action-The open world feel-Smart AI-Replay value-Weapon upgrade system-Side tombsCons:-Sometimes its a little too hard to solve the puzzle-Needs More bigger tombs-Most of the characters are bland-Hunting isnt that good","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

If there was a 64 GB card (assuming it has the same or better $/GB), then I probably would have bought that.It holds data to be used with PS Vita.  It retains said data.  This size holds the most available currently.  It has the best $/GB ratio.  Even if it did not, the way the vita uses memory cards is not conducive to owning multiple cards, beyond one back up of the same size.The card is small (easy to lose).  It is more durable than a micro SDHC card (but that's because it is larger\\thicker plastic).The larger the card the more time you'll spend using\\generating your data, as you please, than spending frustrating time managing it and being without something you wanted, when you wanted it.  If you have Playstation Plus, own or plan on playing at least 8 PS vita full games digitally within two weeks or a month, or want to carry a lot of video and mp3s, then this is the card to get.  Really if you think you're ever going to need or want this much space, it is best to suck it up and just get this card, as the process of moving the data from multiple other cards to this one is painful and might involve losing some save data.  If you're just upgrading from one smaller card, then you'll have less issues, as you can just do a clean back up to ps3 or pc and then restore to this new larger card.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003IEBO9Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Well, the hardcore fighting game players will at least love it.","reviewText":"A running joke/insult for MvC3 is \"THIS is what took them 10 years?!\". Well, it's not like the game's been in development for that long, but I can kind of see why a lot of people are ending up disappointed with it. The lack of gameplay modes, the high price for downloadable characters, a lot of the characters here more or less being ones that no one really wanted, etc. Granted, I'm not in the same boat as those people, but Marvel vs Capcom 3 just doesn't deliver all the goods in my eyes, and I was hoping Capcom would've really given it their all considering how beloved the last game was, and how it's still frequently played in big tournaments like EVO. The bottom line is that if you're a hardcore fighting game fan, as in the kind of person who counts frames, knows the right links in combos, knows exactly how much damage x attack does to x character, and even the right spacing for moves, you're probably going to eat this up. Casual fighting game fans, stay away from this game if you have any plans of playing online.I'll start with the things I liked about MvC3. First up, I actually liked most of the cast here. In Marvel vs Capcom 2, you had a very diverse cast, with characters from popular and obscure games. The thing is, at least half of those characters rarely got used, because it was made very clear when you played with all of them, that characters like Amingo and Roll wouldn't last 10 seconds against a Magneto or Sentinel. But the cast was still there, and a lot of people were happy with who they had. In MvC3, it seems like Capcom took time in putting equal time into the characters, making things a lot more balanced than in the last game. And I really love how some less popular/known characters are here instead of the standard guys, like how we have Amaterasu from Okami and Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins. I had a lot of fun seeing each character's different moves and animations. The music is also MUCH better than MvC2's, as we no longer have rejected Charlie Brown tracks. Instead, every character has their own theme, and once a character is taken out, the new character who steps in has their theme playing. And for people who like getting trophies, there are a lot of pretty easy ones to get. I got nearly 40% after playing for just 2 hours. The endings for each character were also a great touch- your ending in arcade mode depends on who your main character is when you beat the final boss, and some of these things are pretty funny. 'a lot better than those in either version of Street Fighter IV.Now the not so good, which is the rest of the game/the important parts- the gameplay. If you've played Tatsunoko vs Capcom on the Wii, the controls here are very similar to that. So if you've only played Street Fighter IV over the last 2 years, this is going to be pretty different for you. You have light, medium and heavy attacks, a special launcher attack for air combos, and the other buttons are used for calling in your team mates for assists. It's not that hard to get the hang of, but here's the thing- Capcom included a Simple play mode, where square is all of your attacks, triangle is your special moves, x is still the launcher, and circle is your hyper combo attack. This is for very casual players who button mash, or don't want to spend time learning moves. This carries over to online mode, where you could face someone using these controls, and spams special moves over and over again, causing a ton of frustration. It'll get pretty annoying fast too, since the couple of times I've went online, at various times of the day, matchmaking was 50/50, and it'd take forever to get a match, even when there were tons of people available and I had a good connection. 'reminded me of the Guilty Gear X2 #Reload days...But the key problem for me is that I just plain got bored with how flashy everything was, though that might be because this just isn't my kind of game I guess. I love fighting games- 'started out with the first Street Fighter II on the SNES, moved on to the King of Fighters and Fatal Fury games, Samurai Shodown, Capcom vs SNK, Last Blade, Street Fighter III, Guilty Gear, etc. I think it's because I'm more keen on traditional 2D fighters that don't involve tagging in your partners every couple of seconds to win. But that's just me.However, the thing that ruins a lot of the fun for me is the X Factor. This is a special move you can use once per fight at any time. If you use it when all 3 of your characters are active, it gives you a small boost in power for a few seconds, and recovery on the red part of your bar is healed a little faster. If you use it when 2 members of your team are present, it gives you more power and faster healing. But if you use it with your final character, they can be a complete monster. Some characters that will completely obliterate entire teams while in X Factor mode are Hulk, Sentinel, Zero and Dante. If you're facing one of these guys with a fragile character like Phoenix, who already goes down in about 8 hits (to balance out her strong attacks), kiss your lil' lady goodbye after 2 hits. I'm really hoping a patch comes out that cuts down the boosts a bit sometime in the next couple of months, but it doesn't seem likely. And while I said the roster is pretty balanced, some characters are still a little overpowered, or too newbie friendly to the point where you can zone your opponents pretty easily with a few moves. But advanced players will know how to get around this of course.Visually, the game looks pretty good, though some character designs are downright weird looking. Chris in particular looks odd during his win pose, and the illustration of the Hulk has tons of people wondering what's wrong with his teeth. Everything has a comic book look to it, and a lot of the Capcom guys translated well to this style, even if they haven't been in a major console game for years. But gameplay is generally smooth and there's rarely any slowdown, online and offline.Like I said, there's a lot here for people who obsess over fighting games, but if you're interested in playing because of the characters or hype, you might just want to rent it for a day and see how it goes. Marvel vs Capcom 3 is vastly different from the likes of Super Street Fighter IV, a game I keep bringing up because up until now, it was -the- fighting game to play on consoles (BlazBlue being a close second, but not as well known). Casual fighting game players will be annihilated online, so if you do get this but don't plan on getting an arcade fight stick or being that serious, it'd be fun for parties or something with relatives who don't play many games. Just don't say I didn't warn you, especially when a single Sentinel wipes out your party while X Factor is active.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

Got the Prima guide with it, which has been worth the money so far (third day).I bought a Gamecube and later a PS2 and only recently bought an Xbox (I don't like MS) and I hate to say that the graphics, at least in this game, are out-freaking-standing.

The scenery in O:SW is PHENOMENAL, great late-afternoon sunset lighting with beautiful little touches like bits of fluff from weeds providing counterpoint to the action and firepower.

It's GREAT fun, very imaginative, and the mazes are terrific so far. The villians are as rotten as they ought to be and the Stranger is a brilliant idea. I'm really looking forward to getting through my day and firing up the Xbox to play some more, and I just don't play that many games (I'm an OLD fart).

I played Tomb Raider on the PS3 last year, and decided that playing this kind of game would be fantastic on the PS4.  I wasn't wrong.  I'm enjoying the game just as much, if not more so.  As far as the game itself goes, it's a highly-polished and exciting game that deserves all the praise it got.  Controlling Lara is effortless and the combat and platforming are both tight and solid.  The story is well-written and well-told.As for the Definitive Edition, we get a fresh, 1080p coat of paint along with some much-improved textures and more particle effects.  Lara herself is more detailed as well.  The picture looks phenomenal...very crisp and very clear.  The only drawback is that not all aspects of the environment were improved.  Other character models that aren't Lara still look last-gen, as do the water effects (and there is a lot of water in this game).The best improvement of all is the frame rate.  Playing through the game at 60 frames per second is giving me an entirely new experience.  While the frame rate dips every now and then, it's hardly noticeable as it always stays above 30.  This silky smooth frame rate makes the graphics look clear and distinct, and when combined with the higher detail overall it gives the game a really &#34;next gen&#34; feel.So why only four stars?  One word: greed.  There is no reason for Square-Enix to charge full price for this.  That said, if you've never played the game before, it's well worth full price.

Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

It is phenominal and is a fun shooter.  The concept, story lines and details are also great.

I find that certain areas where you are only armed with a crow bar are quite difficult.  Being a casual gamer I am not the best there is, truthfully it was hard enough that I had to utilize the unlimited ammo cheat to get through the game.  Yes there are plenty of cheats if you need... thank godIn the game there is a disaster in the Black Mesa Research facility in which mutant aliens are present.  At one point the aliens are your only enemy until the governemnt sends it forces to keep you quite.  Dont be fooled, the most difficult parts of the game include areas where you have to fight Marines and assassins, as they are fast, and have a far more advanced AI than the aliens do.The AI in this game is highly intelligent as Marines and assassins use tactics to hunt you down and kill you.  Aliens are not quite as intelligent and are much slower moving save for crabs which are a pain when you are only armed with a crowbar.Additionally, the weapons in this game are awesome! Throughout most of the game the Assault rifle was my best friend, as it is equipped with a grenade launcher in addition to its rapid fire.  Also, when you get to the sections of \"Questionable Ethics\", \"Surface Tension\" and \"Lambda Complex\" you get some truelu sick weapons incluiding a rapid fire laser gun, and rocket launcher and an alien \"hive arm\".

{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Catch 'em All... Again","reviewText":"I've always wondered why Nintendo didn't devote more resources to what is possibly their biggest cash cow. Sure they have the movies and dolls and television shows and peripheral games but the main series is only in its 5th generation after over twelve years and this is the first new generation of Pokemon in the past five years. So what is the reward for fans after such a lengthy wait? There are 156 brand new Pokemon which is cool on one hand but what bothered me was that there is no tie to previous generations. When generation 4 came out many of the new Pokemon were higher evolved forms of previous generation Pokemon and in a few cases lesser evolved forms. This is not the case with generation 5 as none of the new Pokemon share an evolutionary chain with previous generations. There is also no previous generation Pokemon to be caught during the main portion of the game. It's like Nintendo decided to wipe the slate clean. Maybe it's not such a bad idea since a twelve year old who bought the 4th generation game in 2006 would be starting to think about college at this point. Still, breaking the evolutionary links between prior generations was not a decision I liked.The biggest change is visuals. Castelia City, for instance is rendered in 3D (not 3DS type 3D) and it is pretty huge. There is a very impressive walk across a bridge with the massive skyline looming ahead. Visually it's pretty stunning but gameplay wise... well. The problem is a magnified problem from previous Pokemon games. There are lots of people to talk to but very few are worth talking to. In Castelia City there are possibly in excess of a hundred people to talk to and few have anything interesting to say so you find yourself wandering, talking, looking in trashcans fruitlessly and the immense size of Castelia City means it takes far longer. The walk across the bridge takes at least a minute or so and after the first WOW it just becomes tedious. Likewise to go from one end of Castelia City to the other takes a bit of time. This is always a problem when game makers decide to make extravagant hubs. It looks great for awhile and then it just becomes a time wasting annoyance.The new Pokemon have new looks (and many aren't so great looking) but under the hood they're basically the old water/fire/grass/etc Pokemon with most of the same old abilities. This is the other problem I've always had with the series; so many of the attacks are darn near useless. Let me use Timburr as an example. He/she has the old Focus Energy attack which improves your chances of getting a critical hit. Why would I waste an entire attack just to get a better chance at a critical unless I was expecting a really drawn out battle. Later he gets the attack Wake-up Slap which inflicts big damage on a sleeping foe but Timburr has no way to put a foe to sleep. Plus, it wakes the enemy up. There are very few useful combo attacks and the ones that exist tend to made difficult because Game Freaks often wont give a single Pokemon all the pieces to the combo. At level 37 Timburr gets Scary Face which reduces the enemies speed but again why waste an attack just to possibly be first in future attacks. Almost always the payoff just isn't worth the effort.The main point I'd like to make is despite the glitzy new 3D towns and more isometric view it's very much the same Pokemon game as before. The interfaces have changed somewhat but not so that I would say that they've improved. The entire series essentially hinges on one premise and that's that collecting is a lot of fun. As long as Nintendo doesn't forget that the money will likely continue to roll.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2011"}

Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"Fun for Everyone","reviewText":"After years of being a success on the PS2 Buzz Quiz makes it's way over to the PS3.  With significant improvements over it's predecessors that help make this game great.  Buzz Quiz TV is one of those games that really doesn't have a niche audience.  From young to old and to casual all the way to hardcore this game can keep just about anyone entertained.  The game has much of it's core ingredients from the PS2 versions.  Although the PS3 version add's that much more.First let me start off with the most important feature.  The game buzzers that are all wireless.  Before you think blue tooth they are actually usb wireless.  So make sure you have an open usb spot for this game.  The wireless controllers are light and have great range.  They are easy to turn on and get a game started.  You get four buzzers with the game.One of the best features now is the ability to play others online.  Getting online and getting a game going is seamless and quick.  You won't always find games with three other opponents but you will find competitions against at least one other person.  This makes the game much more competitive.  Also with online you can use the PSeye to take silly pics of you teasing your opponents.  In addition to this you can now create quizzes that can be played in any game with the feature added.  Some of the quizzes online are excellent.  The rating system helps remove poorly made quizzes and bring the highest quality ones to the top.When you play the game you quickly realize how large a selection of questions they have.  No matter how good you think you are at quizzes this game will stumble all.  If you play multiplayer at home it's easy to assume no lead is safe.  With the side contests it helps keep the game very competitive.  It also keeps this game very hilarious.Overall I would say Buzz Quiz T.V. is one of the best family games available.  From the thousands of questions available and the hilarious games that keep the game fun.  Along with the ability to download new question packs that are made available on the PSN.  If you own a PS3 and want a little more variety to your game playing this is a great start.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00008KTNW","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Much better than I expected.","reviewText":"When I first heard this game was coming out, I didn't pay much attention to it. I thought it would be an OK game considering the plethera of mediocre and flat out bad XBOX games that have been coming out recently. Boy was I ever wrong!!Eventhough I have been a fan of the ninja gaiden series since the old NES days, I wasn't planning to buy this game. However I just been fortunate enough to have my cousin lend me his copy.The first thing you will notice in this game are the breathtaking graphics, each level was done with amazing detail and it seems so lifelike, no glitches or grainy graphics. Even the features on characters in the game have been done with amazing detail!The sound in this game is way above average, the music always fits the level and the sound effects are very believable.The gameplay is 2nd only to the graphics, your character can do nearly everything and performing his moves are nearly effortless. Anothing thing to add is that the characters moves are so fluid there is really no way you can do anything wrong. You will not be laboring trying to do a move because they are so easy to do.The two things I did not like about this game are: awkard camera angles, high degree of difficulty.Camera angles:Because Ninja Gaiden is a 3D game, you have to deal with a different camera point of view. While the camera angles are not bad in themselves, your enemies are in a lot of cases as fast as you are and you will be spending a lot of time switching the angle to see what enemies you are fighting! It is very frustrating getting attacked by someone you can't see.Difficulty:After defeating the first boss, I got an early taste of how hard this game is And it doesnt get any easier after the first level. There are a lot of cheap enemies for example, there is the spider ninja clan that constantly throw exploding shruikens that stick to you and blow up, once they stick to you, then you can't get them off. You can block them, but when you block you can't attack and as soon as you attack they through one at you. To top it all off they are faster than you and surround you so you can't just stand there and block because you will just get attacked from behind. It is very frustrating not to mention cheesy.There are also a few jumping areas which is even more difficult because the camera angle is so awkward.The difficulty of this game is very frustrating, but thankfully you can always go back and save your progress after you get past a difficult part so you don't have to do it again. I really like the fact that you can save whenever you want. (providing you find a save statue) The difficulty of this game hurt my rating on it.As hard has this game is, so far it hasn't been so frustratngly difficult that I just don't want to play it anymore (ie. PGR). Yes, the game is hard, but its is also very fun and addictive. Whenever I play this game I end up playing for 3 and 4 hours at a time. I finally completed the game in a few weeks and was rewarded with a very nice ending. Would I play this game again? Definetely.In closing if you can get over the difficulty, then you will enjoy this game very much. A lot of time has been spent on this game and it really shows. Maybe other game developers should take note from this game instead of trying to rush games out when they are not completely polished.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}

It's basically a slightly glorified hack-and-slash button mashing game.Just because it's not incredible challenging doesn't mean that it's not a lot of fun. The entire Diablo line is the perfect example of a relatively simple game that one can add more complexity as needed. Many serious gamers would applaud how a game like this can hold their attention while casual gamers would appreciate how easy it is for them to jump right into the action.So if you're looking for a real RPG, go get World of Warcraft but if you want to lower that intensity, this is might fill your D&D; fix.

There's plenty of unique planets to visit but the stories told on each planet arent that interesting.  And the game's over-all story can be done pretty quickly.  And then there's that ending which most folks didnt like (I agree with them). Too many of the combat abilities are just like ME2's: When fighting, I might as well have been playing ME2.Honestly this game is going right back into the re-sale pile: I couldnt care less what the DLC will be --  free or not free.Definitely an unfortunate conclusion to the trilogy.

{"product_name":"B00008Z0HX","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Interesting idea, lousy execution","reviewText":"This game gets off to a good start:  you wake up on a beach, everything looks animation-cel painted, and your feelings of disorientation are well done using some sort of camera-wobble/blur technique.  The idea here was also to add comic-book stylings:  certain game elements appear in break-away and pop-up panels seperate to the main action, and sound effects get their own animation (like the \"Bam!\" of a gun or the \"Tok!\" of footsteps).From here the problems are many.  The savegame system mimics consoles:  you must make it to the next checkpoint to save, and at least one level had *no* checkpoint throughout the entire first part.  The gameplay is inconsistent:  sometimes I can take down an opponent with one shotgun blast to the midsection, other times it takes a half-dozen head shots.  There are times when a sequence starts you off surrounded by bad guys, and you end up standing there facing them, both of you plugging away at each other--no chance to duck behind cover or take them out strategically.  Sometimes the comic-panel animations appear *under* my screen - I can see the edges of the animation poke up at the top.  Sometimes the game locks up my hefty system.  And every time I start the game, Disc 1 isn't good enough:  it asks me to \"please insert a XIII disc\" until I give it Disc 2, 3, or 4.I would pay [less] for this game just to try it multiplayer, but at [the price] I was very disappointed.

I originally played it on the PS2 when it was released, and I just played the HD upgrade that is available on PSN. And, best of all, it's FREE to those of you who purchased Full Frontal Assault! Not too shabby for a game that originally cost $50 upon release, with no HD graphics, mind you. Plus, this edition has trophy support, which is always fun to pursue in a Ratchet game.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Matthew Maples","summary":"-5 stars, horrible, think Halo 2 vs Halo 1","reviewText":"I played FEAR (the original one) several times, still do because it is a great game.

When it came out in 2002, a few of the major game reviewing outlets were giving the game high praise, as though so mesmerized by the visuals they were unable to see that the game itself stunk. I admit, as I played through it I was stunned by the technical aspects of the game. It had nice lighting, beautiful filters, great-looking cars, and spectacular effects when you smashed into things. The whole city of Hong Kong was alive with people, traffic (light or heavy) and buildings with flashing signs. Not many games, even today, can boast such visuals. The game had a unique visual style that lifted it above and beyond those simply concerned with realism. If I were to sit down and put this in my Xbox today, it would be to admire the nice visuals, not to enjoy the gameplay.Any enjoyment you get out of the gameplay revolves around the game's graphics. You crash into other cars and smile at the destruction. You fire the tank's cannon and watch as the cannon shell lights up its surroundings while hurtling towards its target, and then comes the visual bang when the explosion scatters cars and objects everywhere. Missions essentially boil down to destroying objects and/or cards, traveling at high speeds, and even some wacky ideas. The game is more action-adventure than racing game. After the first few missions, which are quite fun, you begin to realize it doesn't really matter that the game looks so great. Frustration begins to set in as you set out on missions to collect TNT or when you come across platforming section (yes, on a car) in order to take pictures of specific locations. Also, sadly, the missions are timed. What could easily make the game more enjoyable is a mode that allows you to drive around Hong Kong just to admire the game's massive city. Instead, the missions confine you to very small areas within the game.After eleven or twelve hours of gameplay time, you probably won't put this back in your Xbox. There are different difficulties to play through, but after you've beaten a mission on normal it's not all that difficult on hard. The game was later released for the PS2 and Gamecube, with double the missions, more cars to unlock, missile attachments, pedestrians to run over, and a huge degradation in graphics. Without the great visuals, no matter what else is added, the game is just not worth it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

If you think back, some of the grand RPG's of old, like FINAL FANTASY 6 (FF6) and CHRONO TRIGGER, had numerous characters, each with their own background, theme songs and ways of interacting with them.Unfortunately, MASS EFFECT 2 (ME2) has a cast of characters where every single one of them has a personal mid-life crisis just before \"gametime\" with the enemy, the Collectors. To me this was extremely laughable and unrealistic. I can understand one or two characters having personal issues, but the whole group?!Even worse, just about every character's \"loyalty\" mission plays out the same. Go to location X, fight through X amount of bad guys (cued by rooms filled with conveniently-placed boxes to hide behind) and meet person X who is predictably in the very last part of the level.If you remember the game FF6, then you will recall how many times your populous party had split up to get through certain dungeons. This same concept should have been all the way through ME2. Yes, in ME2 you do get to make some party-decisions towards the end, but you don't get to physically control those separate parties. Having split-parties would have encouraged teamwork and made sure that all the characters get some screen-time, not to mention hasten the arrival of the real mission at hand--the Collectors.MINI-GAMES:There are some good mini-games in ME2.There is also one sucky one.Planet Scanning.Whoever thought of this mini-game needs to be fired. Holding down the left trigger for 15 minutes and staring at a bunch of squiggly lines is NOT FUN!I'm confused how they thought to include a faster scanner, but didn't think to offer a BIGGER scanner so you can cover more area. Surely such an upgrade wouldn't be too arduous a task for such god-like programmers.If they had really given some thought to this mini-game they should have also made it so that certain minerals are found on certain types of terrain. For example, if Iridium was only found near water, then you would know to look for water-bearing planets. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind what planet contains what minerals.How is it that your scanner is THE SAME SIZE, regardless if you are scanning a small moon or a gas giant that is twenty-times larger?!I thought the character fetching and loyalty missions were tedious, but they are nowhere as tedious as spending hours scanning planets for minerals. The worst part is that you NEED to do this mini-game since you can only find minerals in trace-amounts on some missions.It is because of this mandatory mini-game that I have little or no desire to play this game through a second time. Once is enough for me.RELATIONSHIPS:In the last game, I had Jack Shepard and Ashley Williams \"interact\". In this game, you would think that the relationships would have the same depth that the dialogue-trees do.Not so.Instead, I had Jack dump Ashley for the much cuter Miranda Lawson. Now, if they really wanted to make this game more like a space opera, Ashley would have either 1) gone completely nutty and try to kill Jack or 2) ended up pregnant or something similarly shocking.But no, Ashley and Jack just part ways like it's no big thing.COMBAT:It's been mentioned before, but the combat is ridiculous when you can enter a room and know a fight is coming up merely by looking at the layout of the room. \"Let's see, cover to hide behind is all over, the enemy will appear from the far side of the screen and there are also a few spawn points on the sides.\"Yep, looks like I better get my Sniper Rifle ready!OVERALL:On the positive side, I do want to mention that what little story there is, is done well. There are even some successful attempts at humor--like when EDI talks to Joker.The characters, from the cute Miranda Lawson, to the EARTHWORM JIM-like Mordin, to Jack, the FIREFLY-like crazy chick, all are much more interesting then some of the previous characters.The music is still good and often reminded me of the BLADERUNNER soundtrack.The combat is fairly solid and one-shot kills with the Sniper Rifle are always a blast.Is ME2 the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK of video games? I'd have to say no, but with a little TLC and common sense, maybe we can honestly say that about MASS EFFECT 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Out of the box (just one look at the box should tell you this is not an average headset), in order to be able to use it on your XBoxOne you have to download a software update.I must say, I have owned other headsets and can tell you that this one is a great looking one. It is sturdy, noise isolating, and the cushions are made of memory foam, which makes them quite comfortable to wear. And it is also very easy to control with the headset adapter. Also keep in mind these are supposed to be wired to the controller, so if you are looking for wireless this may not be the set for you. Having also a PS4 I am kind of used to having a cable running to the controller so this was not a problem for me.But how does the XO7 sound? The sound was simply amazing, I have owned other headsets in the past (for both Xbox and PS3) so having prior sets as a point of reference, I thought the sound coming from these was good, quite good (considering it is stereo only, with surround effect). The one thing I loved the most is that the XO7 runs on your device's power. So, forget about having to charge the battery of both your controller and the headset, you can use this anytime (as long as the controller is charged, of course)I tested it with my iPod and iPhone and I was very happy to be able to simply plug and play, and again, the sound that this headset produces is great. The cable has an AUX extension, this makes the XO7 virtually usable on anything that has an AUX output, this in my opinion, adds a lot of value to the set.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2014"}

Kim","summary":"Really, DO NOT MISS OUT on this GEM","reviewText":"Ok, I have always considered this game as THE best game I have ever played and haven't posted a review but why now?  I recently have purchased and finished Metal Gear Solid 2.  I had such a high expectation for the sequel because the first one was such a GREAT game.When there were hypes and information of MGS, i wasn't interested in it at all because i'm a old schooler, just into 2D games.  However, when i had a chance to play a demo at Toy'R'Us, i knew i had to get this game for no matter what.  So i ended up getting it the day it came out and was so amazed at the masterpiece.Story line, game play, graphic, music, and fun factor.. all A-rated.  The graphic was the best from that time where everything's based with color green.  The amount of detail was almost insane to the point where you can literally see mice running around.  The appearance of night vision/thermo goggle gave a whole new look.  The music was there to really raise this game to another height because the strongest point of this game is its story line, presented through cut scenes.  When these emotional/shocking cut scenes are coupled with A-rated music, it really brings out the emotion and shock very effectively.  It really brought vibration function to a new standard and believe me, time to time it makes fun out of itself for being a game, which didn't kill the game but rather added more spice to the game.  Each character, whether pro/antagonist, there were strong character development though it might be a short cut scene.  However, it was more than GOOD enough, you could literally be sympathic with the characters.  Still, my favorite character Psycho Mantis,, oh man,, you just gotta play and see &quot;,,it feels nice,,&quot;The biggest difference between this game and the second one is that the first one knew when and where to put the cut scenes.  The first one was very controlled yet it was just right for the gamers to really appreciate the story flow, whereas in the second one, it's just wasted use of ineffective cut scenes here and there, not to mention ridiculous codec dialogues (which literally not only stop from continuing its legacy, but killed it).  Another biggest difference has to be the ending.  The ending for the first one was really, REALLY rewarding, i absolutely had this sense of 'fulfilled, completed, satisfied, reward'  You will know what i mean.  The second one, umm,,, no comment.Well, what can i say,,  i could find no flaws from this very game (well, there's no such thing as 'perfect' game, there were little bit of flaw with A.I., but trust me, it's really nothing when you are being overwhelmed by this game).  Like this editor from EGM said, this game is about experience.  Absolutely, it is.  I have played variety of games, import, domestic, and used to work as a game tester: when i have to pick one game for the best of the best, I PICK METAL GEAR SOLID WITHOUT ANY HEGITATION.PLEASE, DO ME A FAVOR AND DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS GEM.

After having finished the entire game in about six hours, I'm a little dissapointed. The graphics are incredible, it's obvious EA's advanced them well beyond where they were for even Frontline. But the A.I. is still not too bright except for perhaps the Guadalcanal invasion level. The rest of the levels the enemy just isn't too bright and you can mow them down easily.I did enjoy the different types of missions however. In this game rather than most of the missions set in towns like Frontine, they're set in towns (including one part in a hotel) but a few are also in the jungles of Pacific islands, which is a fun change, including one where you've got to go running through a wrecked train.However, the missions just seem too short. I was shocked at how fast I could complete every mission except perhaps two where I got lost and had to find the right way back again. The in level saves probably are the difference as to why every mission seems shorter, but I think they're a bonus because if you die you don't have to completely re-do a level if you've saved.PRO--1. Graphics are great2. Added gameplay including riding an elephant and also missions where you're in a PT boat at Pearl Harbor and using AA guns. As well as a tail gunner for an airplane in the final mission.3. In game saves lessen frustrationCON--1. A.I. still needs work, the enemy is still not too bright2. Missions are too short, the game could have been longer.I have read that this is part I of a two part series, with part II coming out sometime in 2004.

{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael G. Lustig","summary":"It's a nice change from pur FPS games like COD","reviewText":"I've only played a few open world games and I'm not a huge fan of most UBI Soft games.  Having said that, I played through the game twice: once on casual as quickly as I could and once on regular where I made an effort to do almost everything: missions, game hunts, crafting everything, collecting artifacts and letters and looting everybody and everything for cash.  The second time I played it took about 24 hours of gameplay but in the end I had every special weapon, every weapon attachment and even had money to burn on putting camo on all of my guns.Being an open world game kind of lets you decide what to do next.  Do you want to liberate a pirate outpost (which opens up that part of the map), do a side mission like a game hunt for money and XP, or do mission (which you can't leave until you complete)?  Or maybe you want to go hunting so you can craft a bigger wallet or russack.  This is what make this game different than FPS games like COD where you're usually following somebody through a carefully constructed path.I'm more of a stealthly player so my loadout is a Japanese Tanto, a silenced M700 sniper rifle, the AMR sniper rifle (because it shoots exploding rounds), the Bull Shotgun and a silenced m6 assault rifle.  Note: My loadout is similar on the first half of the map but my guns aren't as good.  Generally, my primary is the silenced M700 and my seconday is the silenced m6 which is usefull if anybody gets to close.  You just have to make sure not to trip the alarm otherwise a bunch of reenformcements show up and it's tim to swap the M700 for the shotgun and go loud.The nice thing is that there are severl ways to take on pirate outposts.  You can go in guns blazing but you better be ready to blaze out of there to heal just as quick.  You can try to sneak in and turn off the alarms and the stealth kill everybody. Or, my personal favorite: Take the high ground.At almost every outpost the is a hill overlooking it.  I find a nice spot up high within 200m, mark everybody with my camera, and can clear most camps with 7 or 8 headshots from the silenced M700 because you get more XP and it's the only way to killl the Heavy guards with one shot.  You can't just park in one spot and hope they don't find you.  No matter how stealthy you are it's not a bad idea to shoot and move - preferably to a place you previously checked out.On a side note: If you shoot the animal cages in pirate outpost -- particularly those with tigers -- you can just sit back and watch the fun because it releases the animal and it systematically eliminates the pirates.  Yes, you can take out an entire outpost with on shot into a cage.There are a couple of things I didn't like, such as constantly having to inject myself to heal or gain special abilities.  I also think that there should be a bank.Make sure not to do too many missions because once you're done there's not to much left to do except start over again.  All things considered, This was a fun game but it's not for somebody who's in a hurry.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"A lot of fun; but disappointedly short.","reviewText":"DISCLAIMER:  This review is based on the single player campaign only.A few months ago, I did something quite out of character for me, I actually pre ordered a game at my local GameStop after constant prodding and nagging from the cashier.  That game that I preordered was Gears of War 3.  I was told that with my preorder, I would have exclusive access to the Multiplayer Beta for a few weeks.  Well I played the multiplayer and came away a bit underwhelmed with the gameplay; I didn't really like the multiplayer on Gears of War 2, so that wasn't too much of a surprise for me.  I didn't even play it every week during the beta so I missed out on some weapon skins or whatever, but I couldn't care less, the main reason I decided to get this game was because of the fun single player campaign and I came away very impressed with the first two titles in the series and I expected nothing less in the final(?) installment.So as the release day, arrived, I decided to go pick it up since I had nothing better to do.  So I get the game home and play for an hour or so before going to bed and my initial reaction was it was just ok, but when I got home from work and played it again, this time I was very impressed with the fun gameplay, excellent sound and graphics and intriguing storyline.  Voice acting was done well and at many times it felt like a movie instead of a game.  Your fellow Cogs still are entertaining with their snarky dialogue during battle and when talking to each other, and you can definitely feel the comradery between them.  In addition to Dom, Carmine, Cole and Baird, and Dizzy, you also fight with new characters that haven't fought with you in the previous games; these characters are Jace as well as two female characters, Sam and Anya.  This is the same Anya that Marcus would be in contact with in the previous installments.  In battle, Sam and Anya hold their own and are a very nice addition to the squad.  Also new to the game are more opportunities to use machinery such as the Silverback which is similar to the APU's seen in Matrix Revolutions.  There is also a very fun level that takes place in a submarine underwater and you and your squad have to man the turrets as Dizzy guides the sub to your destination.  There are also a handful of new weapons in addition to the old favorites.In addition to the new weapons and characters, there is also a brand new breed of enemies you now have to contend with in addition to the Locust.  These new enemies were done very well and add to the excitement of this game.  Some are just emulsion infused locust while others are completely new and they do make for a enjoyable experience.I continued to play this game for about an hour a day and long (or should I say short) story short, I finished the game the following Sunday morning; in fact I would have been done Saturday afternoon, but I had to do something for my wife and I also wanted to catch up on some TV shows I had recorded.  While I really enjoyed the game, while it lasted, it was over WAY too quickly.  I would say this game is at max 8 hours and it's very conceivable it can be completed by the afternoon if you start playing in the morning.While I did enjoy playing the game, and had a blast doing so, I am very disappointed with the length. I remember the original Gears of War was much longer, and even Gears of War 2 while shorter than the original it was still longer than this.  It seems that game studios these days are spending more time on multiplayer, virtually treating Single player modes as an afterthought.  As a said before I wasn't ever too impressed with Gears on multiplayer and only bought these games for the single player experience.  Another thing that disappointed me is the lack of new character development, we only get a few scenes with Hoffman and players are basically left hanging with the conflict between Fenix and the new character, Griffin.  I was expecting him to show up later on in the game, but he never does.Now that I am done with the single player I will go back and play it again, and perhaps have a Gears of War marathon playing all three in order, and when I'm done with that, I MAY play multiplayer again, but I don't expect I will spend too much time with it.As far a purchasing goes, I would say don't bother unless you plan to play multiplayer after finishing the single player campaign or if you already have the first two gears and want to complete your collection.  If neither of these apply to you, then just get the game from Blockbuster (if they are still in your area), RedBox, or Gamefly and beat the game in a couple of days and save your money for a game whose single player warrants such a high price tag.  I don't regret my purchase, because I am a game collector almost as much as I am a player, but if this was the only game in the series, I would have been very disappointed due to the fact it was over so quickly.I'm giving five stars for fun factor because the single game is extremely fun to pay, but only 3 overall because the story was too short and seemed rushed.  It would have easily been rated higher if it were longer.Again, this review is for single player mode only, I have not and probably will not play multiplayer often enough to warrant a multiplayer review.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2011"}

Better late than never though, right?Sure, by now you're well familiar with the hype and know that it reviewed very well but if you're still on the fence about this one do not hesitate to make the purchase - especially now that this game can be found at bargain pricing (under 20 dollars).  If you have a HD Display (720p and up) as well as a decent surround sound system you are most certainly in for a treat.  Forget the screenshots and videos you may have seen - the game has to be experienced in motion to really experience how rich the quality of the visual/auditory design is.  At its core, \"Dead Space\" is a sci-fi survival horror game with tones reminiscent of such films as the \"Aliens\" series, \"Event Horizon\" and \"The Black Hole.\"  Gameplay wise there's plenty of homage to titles such as \"Bioshock\" and \"Resident Evil\" with its own unique twists on genre conventions.  Overall the experience is grim, dark, full of tension, and at the end of the day - extremely satisfying with solid design and controls and unique innovations to gameplay (the cookie crumb map tool, UI interface, etc).Playing the game on Normal difficulty took me about 15 hours to complete.  It can be finished in less time but I like to take my time exploring every nook and cranny.  Do keep in mind that this game is extremely gory, with plenty of disturbing imagery and sounds not to mention frightening throughout.  If you can handle such content then I can't recommend this title highly enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

The guys at Eidos Montreal nailed the game and pulled off one of the most anticipated games of all time. One of the best parts about Human Revolution is the engaging atmosphere and story to go along with it. You play as ex-SWAT turned security chief at Sarif Industries Adam Jensen. Sarif Industries is one of the leading corporations in human augmentation. Of course there's always rivals so the facility gets broken into one day and the top scientist gets stolen (among others) and is used for some secret project. The great thing about the story is that your led on constantly so you think the plot goes one way then quickly moves another way. When you start the game you will have no idea that the people involved are the main cause towards the end. The story is masterfully created and very entertaining.Of course what makes Deus Ex so famous are the multiple ways you can approach getting to a goal. Use stealth and not knock out anyone, use tranq darts, stun guns, or just up close melee. If you don't like that you can use silenced weapons and take everyone out, or just run through with a machine gun and blast everyone away. Of course it's not just how you kill people, but how you navigate the level. If you see a room full of 8 bad guys you can upgrade your augs to allow you to become invisible for a few seconds and dash across the room to the door you need. Don't have that aug? You can find a vent somewhere and crawl through most of the area, but wait there's a camera right where you need to be. Find the computer that controls cameras and hack into it and disable it. Or you can just blast your way through.There are tons of options for every part of the game, but the augs are what will get you through. You can access an elevator that can bypass three whole floors of bad guys but it's blocked by heavy crates. If you have the aug to move heavy objects your golden. If not find another way around as best as you can. The whole point is to choose a play style and augment yourself according so if you want stealth use stealth add-ons, ability to see through walls, invisibility, and keep a tranq gun or silenced pistol. I love how there are so many options to choose and each section just flows and doesn't require too much trial-and-error like most stealth action games.You will come across conversations where you need to persuade someone to give you information and this is done through clever dialog choices, but you can use an augmentation to see what personality type the person is and how to persuade them. If you are having a hard time you get a chance to release pheromones as a last-ditch effort to persuade, but you must know the personality type so watch that meter carefully. These choices can be simple or huge such as how to disable turrets during a boss fight, or even to make whole missions easier. However, choices during the game don't affect the endings so some people may feel this was all for nothing.While those are the main parts of gameplay you can upgrade weapons, buy and sell at black markets, and even by Praxis kits for upgrading at limb clinics. Be warned though because the game is very hard if you choose to gun everyone down. You will lose life quickly and just a few shots will kill you. There are even a few boss fights, but I found these extremely difficult and required a lot of saving during the fight. The game also has a decent length of about 15-20 hours so you will be busy for a while.I do have to mention that when the game came out there were horrible glitches and it performed terribly. I actually had to restart the game 1/4 through because of a glitch that prevented me from moving on to the next level. This is unacceptable, but by now 99% of the glitches have been fixed and the game performs smoothly now. The overall atmosphere is a lot like Blade Runner, but I felt it lacking with just people standing around in the linear levels. Sure you can run around, but the game is made up of hallways rather than an open world. The graphics look decent in DirectX 11, but they look abysmal in DirectX 9 so don't expect this game to look amazing. Characters have low resolution textures, as well as low poly models and the overall effects aren't very impressive.Overall Human Revolution is one of the best stealth action games to come out in a while, but most importantly, it re-creates the amazing choice based game play that the first game did so many years ago. If you can look past the dated visuals, linear level design, and difficult boss fights you will be pleased with lots of great game design as well as engrossing characters and an engaging story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"So addictive and so much fun","reviewText":"There are so many improvements here over the first game I don't even know where to start. I'd have to say right off the bat that my favorite feature about GW2 is the variety of races. I was always irritated that all the characters in GW were boring \"humans\" as I play fantasy games to see strange and beautiful things that don't exist in reality. The humans, charr, sylvari, norn and asura are all totally different and unique from one another. The choice of eight professions ensures that you'll want to come back and \"reroll\" alts of different races and professions to experience all their unique stories.I am a huge MMORPG fan and I've been playing games like WoW and EQ since their release, and at first I was put off by the fact that most of the world in GW2 is not persistent as it is with more typical MMORPGs. I felt disjointed every time I left a city and found myself completely alone in the wilderness. However, my opinion quickly changed when I realized that exploring was much more believable and much more exciting when it was just me and a teammate or two. You're not going to be having the battle of your life with a giant when a bunch of much higher level characters traipse by and one-shot your epic baddie. I now LOVE this feature about GW2. I know some gripe about how your level is adjusted to the area that you're in, but I think it keeps the game exciting and dangerous when you know that no matter what level you are, there is always potential danger around the corner.There is so much here to love, including a story that is centered around you, not you and you and you and you and you... You get my point. You don't feel like you're one of a million heroes in the game. You feel like you are THE hero, just as you would in a single player game. The difference between GW2 and a single player RPG is that you can choose to play with others at any time and it completely changes the type of game you're in.I have no complaints about GW2, other than I wish they'd hurry up with their expansion. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G6G4","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"A near-perfect game","reviewText":"First of all, the game in and of itself is very nearly perfect and extremely fun and satisfying. However, it has a feel as if it were created by a team that's new to games in general as there are several things missing that I think gamers have come to take for granted. I'll get to the good parts later, but for now I want to focus on the negative aspects since most of them don't really have much to do with the gameplay itself. They're just minor annoyances, which if there were fewer of them wouldn't be such a problem, but because there's so blasted many it seriously detracts from the game itself.One of the very first things you'll notice is that this is a game of menus. The only time that there's not a complicated highly-layered menu is during dialog, when you usually only have two or three options, with an occasional message delivery quest that throws in an additional response. Aside from that, just about everything in the game requires so many submenus that it's a pain in the butt to just return to the actual gameplay. This is especially annoying when talking to NPCs to buy, sell, upgrade, or store equipment because you have to navigate some horribly deep tree to get to the menu you want, then navigate back out to get to your character, then navigate to their inventory, then navigate to the right category of item, then navigate back out. When buying equipment and changing vocations, you get treated to a short cut where the NPC allows you to move straight to your equipment to change your items. However, for vocation changes this is a bit short-sighted, since you're not given access to your stored items as well and most of the time your new vocation won't be able to use any of the items you've left on your character.The second thing you'll notice about the game is that it's the game of shadows. When night falls, it falls hard. The configuration screen for setting the brightness tells you to make one of two icons barely visible. This works well for most daytime sequences, but nighttime and shaded areas are impossibly dark. It seriously makes me think that the developers of the game have never been outside before because they seem to think that the shaded area under a tree at high noon is as dark as an unlit sewer. Early in the game, you leave the first town and walk out into a road surrounded by trees. Your pawn will shout \"goblins!\", which you'll search for frantically because you can't actually see them in the pitch-black shadows under the surrounding trees. This is exacerbated later in the game when you have to pass through a canyon. Even in full daylight, it's really hard to see where the dozens of bandits are that are raining down arrows upon your party. I don't know about anybody else, but whenever I go outside at high noon, I can see pretty danged clearly into the shadows under trees or my deck or my neighbor's deck from across both of our yards. And pictures I've seen of canyons even in the late evening appear to be pretty well lit. They're not pitch black, like these developers seem to think. This gets really annoying as you have to constantly use a lantern, even in the middle of the day. Also, if you have a Real Television The Exists In This Universe, ANY source of glare in your game room makes shadowed areas of the game an absolute nightmare to play. And I do mean ANY source of glare. I've had to stuff towels under doors just to play through some of these areas because they are so idiotically dark. Bumping the brightness of the game helps a lot, but it makes everything hideous. It would have been nice if they could have struck a balance between dark and visible and had realistic requirements for when you need to use your lantern. In a cave makes sense, but outside on an overcast day? Is anybody THAT blind that they need a light source in the Middle Of The Day becuase it's CLOUDY outside? Really, people?When talking to quest givers, you tend to have exactly two options: \"hear them out\" or \"not now\", which is presented before the actual quest explanation. If you choose \"hear them out\", it annoyingly automatically accepts the quest before you actually get that explanation. This is just a nuisance, as it can quickly clog your quest journal when you're really trying to accomplish one task to get a specific item. Navigating the quest menu is already enough of a pain, filling it up quickly just makes it a pain. This can also lead to non-ideal situations wherein a quest giver will make you do something on the spot you weren't really prepared to do, like one who demands you break him out of jail which requires having skeleton keys on you that you may not have in your inventory at that exact time. He'll follow you around as you look for skeleton key or something to make one, until a guard notices that you're trying to break him out, and then things just get real annoying from there.This leads to loading saved games. You can only have one character at a time. I get that, given the constraints for having a persistent pawn that other people can use while you're offline. But, the game designers took a shortcut and removed your ability to load specific saves. The game has an \"autosave\" feature, but what it's saving is a mystery to me. You can't load that save from within the game. Your save menu has four options: \"save and continue\", \"save and return to title\", \"return to last checkpoint\" (NOT the game's last autosave, but some mysterious event that occurred some time in the recent to distant past... you can lose days of effort by selecting this POS option), or \"quit without saving\". Note that none of these options is \"load your last save\". You have to die to get that, which comes simply as \"retry\". This will take you back to your most recent save, or ocassionally the game's mysterious autosave. If you try to rely on that autosave, however, you can lose hours of effort because it is not at all reliable. This also means that if you mess up and need to reload, you have go back to the title screen. Which, for some bizarre reason, needs to reconfigure your saving device, check your saved game, check downloaded content TWICE, and then connect to Xbox before you're back in the game. This is quite possibly one of the most annoying things about the game because it's just another battle with the menu that takes forever. I don't know why it has to check your downloaded content TWICE before you can get back into the game.Which leads to another problem. \"Accessing Server\" will appear frequently throughout the game, and how long this operation takes is apparently random. Other people can use your pawn, and whenever you go to the inn your pawn will return will gifted items from other players as well as any knowledge they've learned about quests or monsters those other players have beaten with your pawn emlpoyed. Getting the items and feedback from the players is instantaneous, but then you have to sit through an \"accessing server\" progress bar that appears to have no function whatsoever other than to delay your return to the game. I seriously have no idea what it's accessing because you've already seen the list of items, knowledge, and rift crystals your pawn is bringing back. It's just a random delay that can take anywhere from 5 to 60 seconds during which you CANNOT do anything. This is either number one or two among the most annoying things about the game. If it's connected to the Live servers, why does it have to spend so much time figuring out something, and why is there no feedback as to what it's actually accessing there? I don't get it. I just don't.Speaking of pawns, they're a fantastic departure from the standard fare RPG sidekick. They're not the annoyingly saccharine and poorly-translated sidekicks from JRPGs, and they're not the droll, boring, machismo-laden sidekicks from western RPGs. They're other peoples' creations, to which you have continuous access throughout the game. You can hire up to two pawns that have been created and managed by other players at just about any given moment (they wander the streets and wilderness over a good third of the map, and there are Rift Stones in remote locations where you can enter the Rift to search for the exact type of pawn you want). It's novel and ingenious, but the pawns don't shut up. You can sit your own pawn down in a Chair of Learning (available at inns and rest spots) and tell them to talk less, but if the owners of the other pawns in your party haven't taken the time to do that they just babble at your constantly. \"We might find aught here\" or \"I've come to feel more comfortable with/when blah blah\" or any other inanity comes at you Every. Single. Time. your party hits a certain location or quest event. I'd understand your MAIN pawn doing this, but ALL THREE? It's really only useful for the main quests, and gets really obnoxious when traveling because you have to pass the same inane comment markers over and over and over.Which brings up traveling. The game is huge. Immensely huge. It dwarfs Final Fantasy XIII, which I don't get because that game came on 3 discs and took nearly 20GBs of harddrive to install vs. Dragon's Dogma's single disc at ~5GB. However, there are really only two towns with a few other encampment tpye areas with vendors. Everything else in the game is thrown as far to the winds as they can possibly go, and getting from point to point requires traversing some pretty harsh terrain. Over. And. Over. And. Over. And. Over. And there's never a straight line. You may be right next to your destination according to your map, but in reality you have to go down the road and find a place to jump up the hill or find where the road winds back around up the side of the mountain. And your quests will take you back and forth, from one of the map to the other, constantly. It's nice in the beginning because you get to see everything and experience a bunch of different types of monster battles. However, after a while you'll start to cringe at the mention of certain destinations because of the pain it takes to get there. After a while, you'll start to collect Ferry Stones which allow you to teleport straight to a Port Crystal, and you'll get ONE Port Crystal you can set and ONE in Gran Soren which is central to the map. Two or three of your own settable ones would have been ideal, so that you can easily get to all corners of the map. But no... you only get one. And Ferry Stones are rare finds and expensive purchases, so relying on that as a means of travel is really just out of the question. It's like the developers gave their players a big middle finger as if to say \"we spent so long designing this beautiful world, you're going to have to suffer through it repetitively just as long as we did.\"Also, the game introduces a new travel concept: travel by combat. Your pawns babble about how \"the roads are safer than the bush\", but that's a load of bull. The first road that takes you from Cassardis to Gran Soren goes through multiple bandit attack sites, several wolf packs, a canyon filled with harpies, and finally across a plain crawling with Goblins with an occasional random Griffin boss fight. Most roads are like this. You go from battle to battle with barely a respite as you try to get to your destination. And at night? The roads are pretty much paved with wolves, undead, or both. It's literally connect-the-dots hack-and-slash style to travel anywhere. Again, this is great in the beginning of the game when you're learning and need experience and loot. But after a while it Just. Gets. Old. You'll actually find yourself relishing the random boss ambushes just for the change of pace in the near-constant combat. This is really painful at night because, as previously stated, the game is pitch dark and monsters are EVERYWHERE. The only truly safe road in the game is the one that goes west from Gran Soren to Barta Crags, but only up to the river. After that, it's back to near-constant combat to the end of the map again.Also, the game guide is just as full of crap as the pawns. It states that you'll get less and less experience from monsters as you level up, but this is just not the case. Monsters appear to level up with you, with early game-monsters being considerably weaker than late-game. Nonetheless, it's rare for single-hit kills at any point in the game, and the experience you get from kills goes UP - even if only by one point - with each level you gain. Given the near-constant combat associated with simple travel and the fact that experience is really a diminishing return, you'll breeze through levels in a way I've never seen in a game before. Only your main character and main pawn gain levels as you travel, so you'll find that your secondary pawns have fallen behind a substantial number of levels just by going down the road and coming back. You'll have to constantly replace them, which is mostly good because you get to see new pawns and tactics, but it's also kind of annoying as it's yet another thing to manage.Item management is fun early in the game, but gets excessively tedious pretty well before you reach Gran Soren. There are a TON of items to be found, and they can be combined to make a TON of other items. However, the item combination menu is a pain to use. You don't have to learn recipes: each item has a list of possible ingredients it can be combined with, with unknown items that your characters haven't seen yet being filled in with question marks. But once you have them, the queston mark is replaced with the item. You still have to actually try the combination once to find out what it produces, but you don't have to go through your whole inventory and guess at what goes with what. BUT... there's no way to pick what you want to create and just create that. You have to remember or have the game guide to tell you what items can be used to make what items, then you have to find that item in your invetory and go through the combination process. This wouldn't be a problem if it was easier to tell items apart from their pictures, or if there weren't 3 dozen different items with the same image in your inventory, and especially if the game actually sorted your items intelligently. You have two sort options for non-weapon items: optimized or by weight. Optimized doesn't put all the herbs together, or all the tomes, or all the jewels. It really appears to be quite random. And \"by weight\" might as well be the same thing, becuase two herbs with the same invetory picture can have drastically different weights. So when you need to find something so that you can produce an item you need to upgrade your equipment, you have to search for it manually.Each of these problems is really a minor annoyance, but the fact that there are so many really keeps the game from being a perfect 5 in my book. So I'll just go right into what's great about it.First, the sheer size of the game is incredible. It's huge. Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge. You can spend weeks wandering the wilderness, exploring caves, and doing side quests before you even touch the main story.Combat is unique. With your ability to fine-tune your party to your own combat style with the bredth of options available from other players' pawns, there's really never a reason to wonder why your idiot NPC helper did that stupid thing. Your pawns will fight will the skills taught to them by their owners, and that makes them smarter than most AI support character in other games. Also, if you want to play a mage or ranger, you can hire a warrior to tank for you. If you want to play a warrior, you can hire a mage or sorceror to support your melee. The options are endless, and you're never really stuck with a limited sidekick. Also, you get to crawl on things. Boss battles against Big Baddies allow you to jump onto them, crawl around and get stabby in a truly intimate way that's just a lot of fun. Each boss offers a unique set of weaknesses, and you can exploit them in various ways. Every encounter will be different depending on the make-up of your party, unlike so many other RPGs where the concept of strategy flies out the window and is replaced with a singular tactic that you must repeat or fail. In other words, you are actually in control the entire game. Some bosses will be hard in the beginning of the game, but after a while even those whill start to fall with barely more effort than the zombie that just crawled out of the ground.Equipment doesn't get retired as easily. Most other RPGs throw a static list of forward-progression items at you, each of which is stronger than the last, or has a different element or whatever. In this game, every piece of equipment can be upgraded 3 times, with a 4th automatic upgrade to ALL your equipment if you meat a certain late-game requirement. You just need money and a number of some item to perform each upgrade. While this can seem daunting given the sheer number of items available through the game, it's still a neat way to keep balance in the equipment manifest because a cheap item upgraded to level 3 can be stronger - and lighter - than a brand-new unupgraded expensive item.The dialog. Between the mostly superb voice acting and the script that uses archaic sentence structure, the dialog in the game is a compellingly different look at RPGs. Most fantasy RPGs have anachronistic dialog that seems oddly out of place with the events going on, but this game's use of archaic words like \"aught\" in place of \"something\" really adds to the immersion aspect. And ALL of the characters speak like this, which unifies the in-game culture. It's just a neat little change of pace from standard fare games.All in all, Dragon's Dogma is a great game that's well worth the money. It has a long list of annoyances that are all truly minor issues, but the gameplay itself is extremely fun and the world is as detailed as it is beautiful. I'd say it's definitely worth the money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

Now you actually can see the characters in the game. They also added some side missions (I think they are side missions) where you have to command your squad to defend a particular area. Its different. But the game is pretty much like all the other CoD games.The zombie mode is garbage. I didn't really like the one from the first BLOPS. They added new locations and they added an \"easy mode\" where you can take a little bit more damage but even that is the same like the other COD games.The multiplayer, I haven't tried yet, but i'm sure that is pretty much the same. I don't play online on most multiplayer games but usually I will at least play Call of Duty online. Its really nothing to talk about new there. I heard that its a little easier to level up but since I have yet to actually play multi-player then I will have to wait before I can judge that part.Overall, this game is just like all the other CODs. If you bought Modern warfare 3 then this game is just more of the same. The graphics have improved a little bit but not much. The sounds effects seem to be the same also. I gave the game 3 stars because I like the campaign more than any other part of the game and its pretty fun but since its so much similar to the other games I can't give it more than 3 stars. Unless COD do something totally different with the next game I don't think I will buy another COD. I already have Modern Warefare 2 and 3 and they both play the same and this new Ops 2 is no different. I am happy I spent the $60 on this game however.

Nowadays, I enjoy contemporary FPS games if they are well executed in the single player campaign (I don't have time for multiplayer, so short campaigns are actually a bonus for me). As such, I generally get a huge kick out of the COD games... they're pure excitement, delivering a fantastic roller coaster ride. Unfortunately, Black Ops 2 doesn't live up to the standard I've come to expect from this series. For the first time when playing a COD game, I found myself bored, and had to force myself to finish the game over the course of a couple of weeks. To put this in perspective, I couldn't stop playing Modern Warfare 3, the previous COD installment. I finished the campaign in one sitting, and then I played through the whole thing again the following day. The campaign was ridiculously exciting! But for Black Ops 2, things just never come together... I did enjoy the well rendered cut scenes that wove a more detailed story than the series has seen in the past, but the excitement was not there, nor was the sense of urgency. Furthermore, there were a few moments that impressed visually, but nothing near the level of MW3's constant barrage of spectacle.

You get two games which are probably very good (or they wouldn&#65533;t have been around for this long) real cheap.  If you have not yet played the Fallout series, then get out there and get your hands on them quick, before you can no longer buy them at all.Fallout I is a futuristic &#65533;hack-and-slash&#65533; role-playing game.  It has a great turn-based combat system, based upon action points.  I enjoyed the combat in this game thoroughly.  It is a nice reprieve from the endless frustration that you get from lots of the other games out there.  I have had enough of real-time combat RPG&#65533;s.This is not to say that Fallout it easy.  Fallout is still a VERY challenging game.  You have a few huge quests, instead of a lot of small ones.  The entire map is open to you very early on, and there is little direction to direct you to what to explore first.  This makes the game very hard at first, since you can&#65533;t survive half of the areas at low levels.The game has a lot of nice features.  Most dialog only has text, but the major characters have animated conversations that are nicely voice-acted.  The richly animated faces of these characters is a nice surprise.  The aging graphics and sound of this game will not affect your enjoyment of it at all.  There are a lot of weapons to choose from and the gore effects are a real treat, if you like that stuff (your enemies melt, split in half, and explode when you hit them right).  It also has a lot of amusing dark humor that parodies 1950&#65533;s television and the nuclear war scares of that era.The cons?  The inventory system could have been better.  The inventory screen is small, so you have to scroll down the screen when you have a lot of items.  When you are loaded up with items, this takes a long time.  The skill and attribute system lacks balance.  The game is very combat-oriented, so non-combat skills aren&#65533;t very useful.Fallout II was a big disappointment.  I quit playing early on for a few reasons.  For one, the plot is lousy.  You are the &#65533;chosen one&#65533; charged with finding a religious artifact.  Blech.  The story was just too dumb to be enjoyable.  The game is filled with ghosts and weird little beasties, and other nonsense that wasn&#65533;t in Fallout I.  The science fiction genre is totally spoiled.  And, for some strange reason, Fallout II is filled to the brim with excess profanity.  This sequel adds nothing of value to the original.In summary, the Fallout I/II dual-jewel gives you one great, classic RPG, and one coaster.  It&#65533;s cheap, and it&#65533;s a great deal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2002"}

Additionally, Samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

After finding himself fleeing for dear life from an invasion force bent on finding a specific orbital frame (giant robot) and taking control of it to further their own sinister plans, he stumbles upon Jehuty; a state-of-the-art war machine with perks that everyone seems to be after. Stranger still, he finds his way inside this wondrous killing machine and begins piloting it, doing a fairly good job in the process and saving his own (with your help, of course) skin. This starts something that will, before its done, lead him down some strange pathways, hopefully saving the colonies he sees being destroyed all about him and humanity itself by getting this frame to Mars.There are some pros and some cons housed within the gameplay of Zone of the Enders; some adding a bit of playtime bliss to the experience and a few that are frustratingly redundant in their repetitive approaches.Pros: The thing I find myself most impressed with is the way the combat is initiated and with the 360 degrees of movement that you can use while engaging other frames. It differs from the simple up/down/left/right motions that many games use when they let you maneuver above ground level, and it comes in handy when surprising the increasing number of enemies you happen across. I also like the fact that there are additions provided off and on for Jehuty, giving you some weapons to play with while drudging through the monotony of killing/the boredom of some of the duller missions. You also have enemies that increase in \"level\" as you progress throughout the game, not really providing you with any challenges but at least providing you with varying amounts of resistance when you wade into them.Cons: One of the most annoying things about the game is that it's a bit vague when it comes to what it wants you to do on missions. Sometimes this will lead to wandering about for no reason, causing you to fight enemies you've fought before for no other reason than you being lost and making you see the same things over and over again. Still, if it weren't for that, the shortness of the game would be even more pronounced, letting you coast through it in a fraction of a night that it should take. Another problem I have with the mission status of the game is that you are constantly returning to areas you've cleared only moments before, basking in the same scenery you've seen multiple times to find things that weren't available to you when you first went through them. Despite the wonderful looking background effects and building that can be blown to cinders during battles (sometimes leading to human casualties), this repetitive action somewhat bogs the progressiveness of your adventure down. Lastly, there are those enemies that seem to come in flocks, dying almost as fast as they spar with you, leaving you wanting the bosses or the upgraded frames that you should fear but really can't bring yourself to.All of that said, I would still say that this game is fun for people who like their mechs highly operational and extremely mobile, as well as for fans of Z. O. E.  When all is said and done, it isn't that bad of a ride - considering the duration only lasts eight hours tops. For this reason, I gave it a high rating and also placed a warning with it, telling you to perhaps check it out before engaging in any sort of commitment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2003"}

The only thing I would say this game lacked was not enough heists I would have loved to experience more of them. This was a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the gta series it is way better than gta 4 which I hated.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000BI3SIC","description":"This classic adventure includes 18 towns and castles, dozens of magical spells, and hundreds of monsters, weapons, and items to help players on their quests. The game features the astounding music, challenging adventures, and interesting storyline that are the hallmarks of the Final Fantasy franchise. Additional game elements also have been added to enhance the Game Boy Advance version.Players can expect 30 to 40 hours of playing time as they journey on land, on sea, and in the air, and explore new towns, caves, and mountains in their attempt to recover stolen crystals. Twelve different characters with new abilities, spells, and items join and leave the party at different parts of the quest to keep the game fresh.","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Classic RPG now portable","reviewText":"There is always a tendency to rate reissued classics on a different scale from new games. If Final Fantasy IV were a brand new game it would likely garner average to below average scores but since it was considered great 15 years ago reviewers hold it to a lower standard. The world in FFIV is rather sparse and the game mechanics rather simplistic particularly when compared to a game like Golden Sun (which in all fairness did get better reviews). Players also need to be aware that the battles are random and very very frequent so be prepared for a lot of fighting.FFIV is a boilerplate RPG with a Middle Ages theme, experience points, leveling and increasingly powerful weapons and armor. The graphics are sub par by today's standards and for some strange reason the programmer decided to use the classic Japanese super deformed appearance for player controlled characters and regular dimensions for opposing humans. It's strange to see these squatty, dwarf like humanoids smacking around regular looking humans. The creature art is pretty good but the villages and surrounding world are rather unremarkable.A lot of people claim that the game lasts about 25 hours but it took me almost 40 and I'm a decent RPG player. There are a handful of side quests that can pad out the time and some secret creatures to hunt for in order to fill out your bestiary. In addition to the side quests there is a very large dungeon to be explored after the game is completed so a player could easily spend 50+ hours in the game. In my opinion side quests and secrets add a tremendous amount to an RPG and if I had one complaint about the latest Mario and Luigi game for the DS it would be the complete absence of anything outside of the linear quest. There's a reason that FFIV is considered a classic and it's great fun to be able to take one of the all time great RPG's with you on the go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2006"}

I remember thinking *meh* the last time I played one years ago.  I heard good things and read great reviews about this one so I figured I'd give it a try since it was so cheap.  Bad idea.  The combat isn't too bad, but the game is SUPER linear.  If you don't mind save points and a lot of cheesy cut-scene gameplay this game is for you.  I'm about half way through and I'm just tired of jumping through hoops.  I'll probably finish it just because.  I have an i5 processor, 8GB RAM, Radeon 6800.  It looks and runs great.  I think it crashed once, but it's pretty stable.**EDIT**  I almost forgot!  The developers thought it would be a good idea to make everything bounce when Lara runs.  I can't play for more than about 45 minutes without getting motion sickness.  This does NOT happen when I play most other first person shooters.I played Skyrim before this, which was fantastic, so that may have been part of the problem.  That game is SOOO much better.If you haven't played Crysis 1&2/Skyrim/Fallout 3 & New Vegas/Just Cause 2/GTA series/STALKER series/Mount and Blade: Warband/ I would highly recommend those instead.Arkham City was worth playing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Wonderfully Done Action RPG","reviewText":"I must say, I'm impressed!  I only have several hours into this game, but it has me hooked!  Though this game gets great reviews, it didn't seem to make much of a splash when it hit the shelves.  I pre-ordered it, and finally got the time to fire it up.  If I were to compare it to other games, it seems like it's closer to Fable or Nier, than it is to other RPG's like The Elder Scrolls or Final Fantasy.***Sound, Graphics and Technical Stuff***The graphics in this game remind me a bit of WoW - not so much as a direct copy - just in spirit!  You'll see lots of vivid colors and a slight cartooniness throughout the game.  The voice acting is top notch, though the lip syncing leaves a little to be desired (no real bearing on the over all quality, though!)  KoA: Reckoning also feels fairly polished.  The frame-rates are largely stable, and I haven't dealt with any crashes or glitches.Those interested in padding their trophy list will be happy - I think there are 100 or so available in KoA: Reckoning.  Many of which are awarded just for playing a game (and might be hidden.)***Game Play and RPG Elements***So far, the story has my attention, and I'm eager to see what happens next.  The side quests are numerous and for the most part, rather interesting.  Right off the bat in games like Skyrim, Oblivion or Fallout, I often feel overwhelmed.  This feeling frequently stays for the first several hours of play time.  Kingdom of Amalur, on the other hand, feels quite welcoming as soon as you start!  Things aren't nearly as forced as they are in say a Final Fantasy game, but not being as open as the more sandboxy titles is actually a welcome change of pace!Questing feels almost exactly like it did in WoW.  They even highlight quest-givers with yellow \"!\" and \"?\" when they have a quest to give or receive.  If you're not familiar with these, let me sum it up:  The world of Amalur, or whatever they call it, is filled with lazy and weak people that make you do their bidding.  The quests consist of target hunts, gathering of items/goods, acquiring goods (like make potion X or buy item Y, and bring it back,) and clear dungeon Z.  Rewards are given in experience points, and often money/items.I really like the way you can custom-build your character, and not feel pressure (you can redo your \"spec,\" if you wish!)  The crafting system is also nice - simple,  yet effective.  Combat is also nicely done here.  There is enough button-pushing to make you feel engaged the whole time, but not overly done, like they do in some other Action RPG's.  Leveling up is easy enough in this game.  As I mentioned before, quests grant experience, as does combat and finding various things (stones, hidden treasures, etc) while exploring and opening locked chests.The crafting system is simplified enough to not be confusing.  You can salvage your weapons and armor, which provides you with parts to make new things.  Relying on only salvaging, however, is a crap-shoot.  After salvaging countless weapons and armors, I still haven't found the right things to make a chest piece for my rogue.  Many shops will sell you components (often really high end ones, too) for a price.  Alchemy works in very much the same way it does in other big MMO's or sandbox RPG's - find herbs in the wild and combine for potion effects.Ultimately, I highly recommend this title!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002XL3BA","description":"Unleash the power of the Gods and embark on a merciless quest as Kratos, an ex-Spartan warrior driven to destroy Ares, the God of War. Armed with lethal double chainblades, Kratos must carve through mythology's darkest creatures - including Medusa, Cyclops, the Hydra and more, while solving intricate puzzles in breathtaking environments. Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"\"God of War\" Indeed","reviewText":"\"God of War,\" complete with its intense, action-packed gameplay, amazing visuals and production values, a fascinating anti-hero, and one of the best stories ever to grace a video game, is easily among the best titles you'll play this year on the Playstation 2 - if not ever. Indeed, if the Playstation 3 were to launch tomorrow, there would be no better send-off for its predecessor than this.The game takes ancient Greece and its mythologies for an ingenious spin, transforming \"Clash of the Titans\" into a bleak, Robert E. Howard gloomfest complete with unrelenting violence and a mood that is downright oppressive. This is certainly not the Greek mythology you learned about back in grade school, and your guide through this austere world of scheming gods and defiant mortals is none other than Kratos, a shameless killer who delights in gushing red blood and being where battle is thickest. He certainly has a chip on his shoulder, and it may or may not have to do with his absent wife and child, and the god of war himself - Ares. The basic concept is revenge, a mortal in opposition to a deity and all the monsters you can shake a sword at, but the plotline that drives \"God of War\" is far more interesting than that, and is gradually unraveled in splendid fashion. Suffice it to say that both the setting and Kratos, the player character, are as imaginative as they come. This one, like a great movie, sucks you in and, once it has you, doesn't let go.With such an interesting story and world already established, the developers of \"God of War\" could have churned out a half-baked action-adventure and still been a step ahead of many of their peers, but thankfully, not content to do this, they made \"God of War\" the absolute best game of its kind. It's an out and out ass-kicker, reminiscent of the recent \"Prince of Persia\" games (particularly \"Warrior Within\" and its Mature rating) and 2002's \"Rygar\" redux, but with action forefront and devious traps falling in behind. Comparisons aside, \"God of War\" is its own game through and through - a rewarding combination of reflex and gray matter, with an emphasis on the former.Kratos takes on all comers with a set of short swords, each one lashed to a binding chain and seared into his tormented flesh. That is, at least, during the early portion of the game prior to the introduction of the Blade of Artemis (essentially a gigantic scimitar), but these weapons will, almost undoubtedly, be the ones with which you become most familiar, and given the lack of variety it's great that they prove to be so much fun. In conjunction with some very capable magical powers bestowed upon Kratos by the gods as the game proceeds, these default weapons are more than sufficient, with the aforementioned secondary sword stepping in as a mere bonus. Admittedly, combat in the game initially feels like something that will wear thin, but thanks to the game's upgrade options, which allow you to beef up your spells and weapons by conquering your enemies, new combos and deadlier effects can be attained and unleashed, keeping things fresh.Unlike most action-adventures of this type, \"God of War\" seems all but immune to the usual monotonies of this genre, and not only because of the aforementioned combos, spells, and upgrades. The game's levels can take most of the blame, as they are very well-designed, complete with new challenges at virtually every turn. Aesthetically, each one is diverse, even down to its color scheme. And while some settings are clearly more polished than others, even at their worst these graphics rival anything available on the PS2. At their best, on the other hand, they're astounding, rising in artistry above virtually anything ever committed to a console. That all of this is done on the aging hardware of the Playstation 2 makes it that much more amazing.The characters come off nearly as good as the environments. Kratos looks suitably imposing and mean, and the spin on Greek monsters and myths takes a decidedly horrific turn with the motley collection of centaurs, minotaurs, and harpies that stand in his way. Boss encounters are few and far between in the game, but of the three that exist each is memorable, challenging, and beautiful to look at. The same pervading sense of quality pretty much shines throughout \"God of War.\"But of course nothing is perfect, and the same is true here. One level, set in Hades, goes above and beyond in terms of frustration, temporarily emphasizing platforming in a game that, before, had little to do with such antics. Likewise, some of the reflex-testing minigames required to take down the game's boss monsters, usually optionally associated with gory finishing moves on lesser beasts, can be difficult to pull off in time, and make for some needless aggravation. As an elective edge in combat they would have fared better, instead of being necessary to prevail. On the other hand, this concept is a novel one, and when it works it works beautifully - but it has its downsides, especially during the final confrontation with Ares.Some may find \"God of War\" to be too difficult, as it's certainly not a game that's easy to breeze through. I think, for the most part, however, that it strikes a fine balance. From beginning to end, \"God of War\" is truly epic in scope, like a big budget Hollywood adventure, complete with the finest production values available. The more you play, the harder it is to stop. This is action-adventure near its pinnacle, the game that was promised and finally delivered. \"God of War\" is a great game with a great main character in a great stylized setting. What more can be said of it?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBWAG","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Great arcade racing fun!","reviewText":"Excite Truck is a fast paced racing game that is fun for even those who are NOT hardcore racing game fans.  I don't enjoy racing much but find myself addicted to this title.  The many things you're able to do to influence your final score -- jump, runs through the trees, smashing into other trucks -- make this game very worthwhile and an awful lot of fun.Audience:  Again, this may not be for hardcore racing fans.  For nearly everyone else, though, the action is great.  The gamers and non-gamers alike in my family have enjoyed the versus mode racing.Graphics:  Great for the Wii.  No complaints here--the scenery is great and even looks pretty good when you're flying by at a zillion MPH.Gameplay: You win or lose a race based on the number of stars you collect in the course.  You get stars for winning, of course, but also for other things like running through trees and catching a lot of air on jumps.  The single player mode is a lot of fun, though I wish there was more to it than just \"get X amount of stars on every race.\"  That's not exactly something that will get me drawn into a single player mode.  Multiplayer is 2 players only but is quite a bit of fun, though the fact that there are no NPC racers is a drawback.Control:  Control is pretty easy once you get the hang of it, but tilting the Wiimote to steer is not something that comes intuitively for most people used to other consoles.  Still, the control is great and a racing wheel makes it even more fun.Challenge:  The challenge is there, but I'm not sure it's what I would like to see.  Instead of new objectives to complete you just do the same objectives you've already done and try to get a higher star count.Concerns:  A couple of things I think could be better on this game.  First would be a season or career type mode--anything to liven up the single player racing aside from just unlocking new trucks.  I also can't fathom why this isn't a 4 player game--that would have been a great feature rather than just leaving it a 2 person vs game.Overall this is a great game.  The courses are fun, the racing is a blast, and the multiplayer action, while not perfect, is enjoyable.  The single player mode may not have a lot of staying power but the multiplayer should.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2007"}

The glitches are unbelievable and well-documented, so I've taken another reviewer's advice and gone back to playing Battlefield 3 on the Xbox 360.  Until the online issues are resolved this is not worth owning.  I'm actually regretting my decision to buy an Xbox One, as I only wanted to play this and Forza 5 (also mediocre).  With that, the single player is probably the best for the Battlefield franchise.  Note that picking which Battlefield single-player is best is like trying to choose which bout of food poisoning in your life was your favorite.  It doesn't matter how it's done, the overall experience just sucks.  The set pieces/levels are impressive but the story is incredibly hokey and will get on your nerves.  A HUGE note if you're a parent thinking about getting this for kids.  One of the in-game characters, \"Irish,\" drops more f-bombs than I've ever heard in a video game.  It gets old almost immediately and there is no way to turn it off.  This is coming from someone who has been in the military for over 12 years.  To summarize, you're better off playing Battlefield 3 for Xbox 360 and YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CHILDREN.*EDIT* 1/16/14:  I can't believe how awful this still plays online.  I play with an very good internet connection and the lag is still unbelievable.  It sucks so much because the game looks like it could be so much fun, but I've never been more pissed off at a game than I get at this POS.  I'm really regretting my decision to buy an XBOX ONE, if you are smart you will wait.  The only thing awaiting early adopters is a broken, unplayable mess.  FML.*EDIT* 4/4/14:  I tried playing this game again.  It is UNBELIEVABLE that this game still plays as poorly as it does, nearly six months after release.  I can't remember the last time I was more frustrated with a game.  I want to like it so much, but it does everything it can to make you hate it.  The game plays like it has some crazy irregular heartbeat.  Every couple of seconds... Wub-Wump.....Wub-Wump....  Lag after lag after lag.  It is completely disorienting and will result in many frustrating deaths.  I run a 30MBps connection with a 27-31 ping and it plays like I'm running it on a 56K modem.  SKIP THIS GAME, even if you're a die-hard battlefield fan.  It isn't even worth capitalizing any more...*EDIT* 5/15/14:  I just finished the campaign for the second time.  It took five attempts since the game continuously deletes my saved game data without any apparent reason.  I get to the end, trying to unlock the achievements, and it won't give me credit.  The last time I played a game that was this sloppy and buggy was Willy Beamish for the Sega CD.  I seriously have to go back 20 years to think of a game that compares to the crapiness of this one.  It is beyond comprehension to me that these problems haven't been patched, yet here we are 6 months after release and this game is still total garbage.  What a waste of time.

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar.

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Justin Stewart","summary":"I didn't care for this game","reviewText":"I'm not going to write a long review, but if you're a fan of resident evil then buy this game.

Other N64 games such asZelda,Banjo-Kazooie, andDonkey Kong 64all owe  much of their inspiration to this gem of a game.

For the first time, Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own. After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest, they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public. The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from, early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 (a good game) or Super Mario 64. This game was the reason Nintendo's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.I'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64. It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach's castle. The storyline is pretty typical by now: King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her. The graphics are colorful, bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time. The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to. It's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again. So why did I give it 4.5 stars? The camera is not perfect but back then, getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program. It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners. It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game. I highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXEM8","description":"","reviewerName":"Steve Sterling","summary":"Army of Two The Third","reviewText":"Ok, I purchased this game through the Playstation Store as a Day 1 Digital Download, and read the reviews beforehand on amazon, just to get a feel for whether the full game was different from the demo I downloaded a couple of weeks ago.  From reading the reviews, I realized one thing - practically all the reviews for this product were either written by twelve-year olds that are good at this game, or geeky fourteen-year olds that are not.  So, to assist you, the possible purchaser of this title, I will attempt to make this review as informative and objective as possible, without giving away any spoilers.First off, I have played the two prequels to this game: Army of Two and AOT 40th Day.  They were decent action games, but more for a boring saturday night, not really a home-run action game like Battlefield: Bad Company or Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  While the third entry in the franchise is not up to that level yet, it is definitely headed in the right direction.  Gone is the unreal engine, here is the frostbite engine (that allowed destructible environments in the 2011 FPS Battlefield 3).  Also gone are the \"back-to-back\" tactics, as well as the ambidextrous shooting abilities of Salem and Rios of the past titles.  While the absence of the two aforementioned abilities is a downer of sorts, there are new tactics and features in Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel.From \"TWO\" vision, which is sorta like a battlefield version of Batman's bat-vision (see Arkham games) to the Overkill mode, which is comparable to the Rage mode from the last-gen game \"Scarface: The World is Yours\".  Basically, your operator is impervious to damage when this is activated, has unlimited ammo, and can literally blow his enemies apart.The graphics are pretty good, as is the sound, and the controls are pretty solid.  My biggest gripe with this title is that enemy combatants tend to take a good amount of damage before taking a dirt nap - in no way realistic, of course - but, this game is not meant to have a realistic level of accuracy (see the aforementioned Overkill mode).  Also, there are times when enemies can pop out of almost nowhere and be shooting you from behind in an area you just cleared.  Kinda frustrating. But aside from that, this game is a heck of a lot of fun - especially if you've got a battle buddy to play co-op with.You can customize your own masks and wear one of them in battle, switch out your outfit, masks, and even your current armament between every mission, and can utilize the co-op oriented battles to maximize carnage.  Also, it must be included that the level of customization regarding your weapons is nothing short of phenomenal - there are dozens of choices for each weapon.  Quite honestly, this is to console games what The Expendables is to action movies - a testosterone-fueled  battle royal that is there for no other reason that to entertain with blood, guts, and tons of guns.I paid $60 for this title, and I can say that, despite the minor hiccups mentioned before, I feel satisfied with my purchase and that I got my money's worth.  So, if you enjoy movies like The Expendables and games of the same sort, then this title is probably right up your alley.  However, if you're a COD or Battlefield fanboy, this will probably not be the title for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"Well Rounded game","reviewText":"First off I am going to say I have been anxiously waiting for the release of this game. I am a big COD4 fan. On the PS3, it sets the stage for all FPS games. Haze, is right up there. They both have their strengths. COD4 is an awesome game because it is very realistic with the missions, real weapons, & warfare. Haze's strength is that it is not as realistic, but more fun because of  the science fiction aspect of it. The weapons that you use actually have the cartridge gauge on them which makes the weapons appear futuristic. Really cool... The reload time is good & realistic just like COD4. The load time for the shotgun for example is realistic on both games. The explosions are very rich in detail in Haze as you can actually see a lot of fire & smoke, & even when you are in Nectar mode you can see the shockwaves from grenade blasts. For some reason this really impressed me.. I guess it's the detail. The graphics in COD4 are sharper than Haze. To be honest I will be surprised to see any game that has equal sharpness in the graphics like COD4. I'm not sure but it appears like COD4 has 1080 resolution, but I could be wrong. Haze's graphics appear a little, well lets say Hazy LOL. But it's done well & it looks like the developer's did it intentionally as I have seen games with graphics that are so sharp until the game looks fake. Haze is perfect.. The animations are great. There is a lot of detail in the backgrounds. In the first level the butterfly animations are an added plus for detail. Like I said Haze is fun in the fact that it isn't as realistic as COD4. The premise of the performance drug Nectar is great & is written in good with the storyline. I say this because the soldiers for Mantel are no more that drug seeking killing machines. It is written well because they are supposed to be the good guys but in fact they are cocky arrogant drug addicts. During the game even when not in battle you can hear the sound of nectar being pumped into members of your team. When in nectar mode your character has superhuman reflexes & perception & strength. COD4 can't mess with that. Also, you get to use vehicles. It is very similar to Resistance Fall of Man in that aspect because some levels you drove tanks & jeeps which made that game really fun. I haven't had the game but a day, but I can see myself wanting to play over & over again because it's just plain fun... Buy this title, you wont regret it..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2008"}

If you liked Fallout 3 (as I did) this is worth a run through, but I can see where some are disappointed with the similarities.  I will say that I got this for $20 on a trade in and because of the similarities between the two games I would not have paid any more for it.  But this review is on the game and not the price.The differences I've noticed so far are that you can earn perks through repeated action like in Oblivion.  For instance once you kill 50 insects you gain a bug smashing perk that gives you a little more damage toward them in the future.  The same goes for using unarmed weapons, guns, etc.  At least at a small level this gives a satisfaction of improving on a favorite technique outside of the general level up options and does provide a difference from Fallout 3.As far as glitches go I've put a good 20-30 hours into this and it's only frozen up on me once.  I'm not going to pretend to know what causes it to do this more on one system over another, but I have not had an issue with it at all.I'm trying out the new skill of Survival, which collects food, plants, etc and creates new concoctions at campfires located around the game.  Now instead of eating insect meat for a low amount of health and radiation (which you can still do), you can cook it and get more health and benefits out of it (for example a strength of +2 and increased health over an amount of time rather than all at once).  It's tedious because you have to carry tons of crap around with you but if you get a system down you can travel with only the cooked items and basically have a ton of health options available to you at any time.My biggest complaint with this game, and Fallout 3, is the placement of the crouch button.  A huge aspect of this game is running away from your enemies to find a better location to fight from.  Even as a sniper, as I played in Fallout 3, I had to run away from people constantly in buildings and such.  The L3 crouch button is constantly being activated when I'm running from things which makes me move half as fast and of course mucks things up.  In New Vegas I'm taking a completely unarmed approach, which includes special unarmed moves activated by the L3 button. It's insanely difficult to run from someone, try to attack them close range and activate a special attack without crouching while doing it. I really don't think this is a matter of skill, it's a matter of poor placement of the crouch button.  This definitely distracts, frustrates and takes away from the game play often.Bottom line:  Consider this a glorified extension of Fallout 3, if you're up for another run through of that game then you'll be in good shape.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}

It combines the action and gothic atmosphere of Castlevania with the crisp, detailed 3D graphics characteristic of Resident Evil. The gameplay may take some getting used to, but after a couple of hours into the game it becomes addictively fun. Using a variety of swords and firearms, you'll blast your way through hordes of twisted evil creatures and beautifully crafted environments. It only takes about 7-10 hours to beat the first time around, but since nothing in the game is tedious to acquire you'll want to play it over and over. The only obvious flaw with Devil May Cry is the camera angles. I found myself walking or jumping in one direction when the view suddenly changed and caused me to move in another direction. Some boss fights can be frustrating due to this, but ultimately it's a minor problem. I also would have liked the option to use the directional pad to move instead of the analog stick (I just don't like that thing). Even if the camera angles are a bit shakey, it doesn't keep Devil May Cry from being an excellent game. If action games are your genre, don't hesitate to pick up this new classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2002"}

The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player.

But I do have some complaints.  The story in the campaign makes no sense and is way too linear. The campaign was too short also.  I think it should have been at least 10-12 hours.  A step back from Battlefield Bad Company 2.  The melee is annoying in the campaign and forces you to press certain buttons instead of real time fighting.The co op is very fun and adds replay value to the game. The helicopter mission is a bit tough and annoying, but I enjoy all the other missions.The multi-player is very fun being able to use different vehicles a feature other shooters do not have.  I like the graphics and sound effects.  I adjusted my score because I really like the multi-player.  What bothers me is the PS3 can't handle the Frostebite 2 engine and the multi-player has screen tearing and frame rate issues.  The connection errors also bother me. It's time for a PS4.  I also appreciate Battlefield much more than MW3 because they really improved the graphics, but unfortunately the PS3 can't handle the graphics engine.  In my opinion Battlefield 3 is far superior to MW3 and I recommend people buying this game over MW3.  The graphics in multi-player are top notch with lots of great sound effects and explosions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

Obviously, something must be right because everyone loved Mega Man. It played very simple but it was still like no other NES game at it's time.It added more challenge, longer boards with new enemies and new items and the bosses were NO push overs. Mega Man II had it all and it became a platform for the series and for other Action/Adventure type games.In many ways, a lot of games out there still show derivitives of the Mega Man series and for good reason. It's one of the longest running and most successful series that was on Nintendo and then SNES and now the PS (hopefully someday on the PS2).This is a definate for any of you retro collectors. seriously, no retro collection is complete without Mega Man II.

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"Expected More, Got Less.","reviewText":"This is a very fun game until a major BUG freezes your PS3...Then you'll want to set it on fire! There should be no bugs in a game that's already been delayed by several months and I have a very low tolerance for this kind of stuff. I recommend you save your game every time you do something significant (waste an Alpha or big sister, help a little sister harvest ADAM, buy new plasmids or tonics, etc.) Above all, SAVE BEFORE you go to a Gatherer's Garden!This game is designed with unusually long periods between autosaves, which it does once you complete an \"area\" of Rapture. It is also designed so it can take hours to thoroughly cover one of these areas. Common sense should dictate that these are counterproductive, especially in a buggy game. For example, in Dionysus Park I was literally at the end of this level and had 485 ADAM after spending a few hours poking around every nook and cranny there. Convinced I had done and seen it all, I went to a Gatherer's Garden after receiving a \"special gift\" from the rescued little sisters. I purchased new plasmids, tonics, slots and had less than 100 ADAM left when I chose \"preview\" for one of the remaining plasmids available for purchase. Then I only heard the audio and my PS3 LOCKED UP! As you probably know, once this happens you're screwed.So after a reboot, pretty much everything I had done in Dionysus Park was LOST. It was weird because it looked like some things I had previously searched remained searched (trash cans, corpses)...But I had to rescue ALL of the little sisters again, protect them while harvesting ADAM again, defeat the big sister again. I was NOT happy. I chalked it up to a fluke occurrence. The following day I reluctantly went through Dionysus Park again and cleared maybe 75% of Fontaine Futuristics. Once again I went to a Gatherer's Garden after defeating a big sister. This time I purchased a plasmid upgrade, only heard the audio play and then my PS3 locked up again. Then I realized this is not a fluke. There is a MAJOR BUG hiding in the Gatherer's Garden portions of this game just waiting to knock you back to the beginning of each section. From this point on, I saved after every significant accomplishment and recommend you do the same.As for the game itself, it's a beautiful landscape as it should be since it's more or less the same as the original Bioshock with enhancements. Playing as a big daddy was hardly distinguishable from playing through the original against the big daddies, and that's unfortunate. Use the drill at all and it runs out of fuel in just a few seconds. Then you're back to shooting guns and plasmids at splicers, other big daddies and big sisters. You rescue little sisters and guard them while they collect ADAM. Go to the next area of Rapture and repeat. And that's really the failure of this game. It's probably the most repetitive game I've played in the past year. Areas of Rapture are strung together with completely linear strolls through the ocean that serve no other purpose than to get you from point A to point B. You scavenge around for items of use, listen to recordings and transmissions from other Rapture residents who guide you around and fight enemies around every corner...Just like the original.The game also suffers by forcing you to search for and purchase items to prepare for one-sided battles. Early in the game, big sisters will kill you over and over so you simply step out of the Vita Chamber and wait for them to come to you and kill you again while you throw everything you have at them and they suffer very limited damage. Nothing quite like a half-dozen respawns to finish off a single enemy. Then you end up with no useable ammo, no first aid kits, no Eve hypos...So you're forced to scavenge and purchase these items again to prepare for the next big battle. As an example, I repeatedly froze and hit a single big sister with anti-personnel rounds until gone, rocket spears until gone, phosphorous buck until gone and she kept killing me over and over regardless of what I did. Finally, she had a tiny bit of RED left on her damage meter and I froze her multiple times in a row and fired 10 solid slugs right into her belly before she killed me again. The ridiculousness of battles like this take away from the gaming experience...Finally, Bioshock 2 could be viewed as not much more than additional DLC for Bioshock...The games are that similar. Fans of the original will LOVE this, while those expecting more will be disappointed. There are technical improvements, to be sure, specifically in the area of plasmids, tonics, weapons and the simultaneous use of them...But with months of development delays, shouldn't we be treated to something more than just the same game with marginal improvements? For a $59.99 list price, I think so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Jane","summary":"So much to do!","reviewText":"Short answer...Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid action RPG with a few gimmicks that separate it from the games it's influenced by.  It's fun, huge, with a difficulty issue that is kind of big (way too easy) and a broken economy (I am way too rich).  The main plot is fun, but after completing a ridiculous amount of side quests (there are plenty) I find myself bored with them despite their fairly well mapped out plots.Long answer...Graphics:  I'm a firm believer in graphics being not as important as plot, and I'm a firm believer that photo and videorealism are beautiful, but unneccesary.  That said, playing on a good computer rig I find this game to be quite beautiful.  The colors are vivid, sparkles in the air, lots of different color effects.  Very nice.  You appreciate the beauty of the game's impressive fantasyscape when you exit a dank cave.  That said, about 60 hours in, I find the texture details are inconsistent.Setting and world:  Amalur is beautiful and bright.  There's a war going on in a distant frontier, and the background is good.  You have immortal natives who are unchanging, a few different races, lots of big cities, tiny towns, and even smaller settlement pockets.  Big fat evil to be discovered and all the reasons behind it.  There are .. about 5 HUGE areas, and unfortunately it seems that most of the side quests are kind of within the area.  I find little reason to go back to the original area, so far.  But I also haven't finished the game, so who knows.  I don't HAVE to have a calendar or a clock in games, but when I do I like there to be a significant difference in day and night.  I like sunsets and their color effects.  This game has a clock, and it has been dark at some times, but it doesn't seem consistent and you don't really care since the NPCs seem to sleep at random times.  Sometimes it's midday and these fools are taking a nap.Sound and Voice Acting:  The voice acting in this game works because there are enough voices that are similar, enough that are varied and enough light accents to mix with the hard accents.  It seems very realistic and I haven't directly thought, \"Same person who I talked to in the last town\".  The music is good, if a little too epic in some areas.  Nothing is one of those superb theme songs that you remember for years after, though.  Just mood music. ;)Choicemaking:  Uhhm, I guess?  There are a few choice, but it's mostly kill this person who is evil or let them run off... Persuade this evil person to go away instead of fighting you.  So far I haven't come across any choices that genuinely feel important to me.  I guess that cuts replay value down since you can play ANY class at any time that you want by visiting a \"fateweaver\".  So after this go through on the game, I have no reason to create another character.  Also, I don't feel like there was any real difference in choosing a race.  They mention it at times, but it doesn't mean anything.Combat And Character Development:  Yeah, it's smooth.  It's also easy.  I can't say there's any real skill involved to the combat, not even in the combos.  It is attractive and I like the ability to manage my new combat classes.  I like reallocating my points which I can do OFTEN because I have so much effing money I can change depending on whatever new weapon I found.  The skill tree is fine, if bland, looks like Venetica's skill tree.  Three classes, put your points in one or a combination of.  No point playing a battlemage if you can play a soldier one minute and a mage the other.Did I get all the primary categories?Okay.  Fun game, a few flaws.  Definitely a good way to spend the time in between Skyrim and Mass Effect 3.  I've been in Amalur quite a few hours and I like the variety and amount of quests but it's definitely not a perfect game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

I'm very pleased with its success, because it encourages developers to do something besides put us on a map and tell us to shoot everything in sight (not that I don' enjoy a good shooter).  But...it definitely has its share of issues, which is why I can't quite give it 5 stars (if I could, I would give 4.5).  It graphically does some of the best work ever seen on consoles, especially with detail in the faces of the characters and demonstrating emotion.  At the same time, however, some characters and environments lack the same detail, which for me was jarring at times for a game that at its best is very immersive.  I have no problem with a European developer creating a game based in Philadelphia, but just realize it does take away from the realism to hear some of the characters' accents slipping through.  And honestly, is the pronunciation of \"origami\" really that difficult?  The story itself is actually pretty good, but it does unravel a bit here and there.  My only other issue is, for a game that offers so much in terms of how some story elements can change based on the player's actions, the individual \"levels\" (or vignettes or whatever) are for the most part very linear and don't offer much in the way of open exploration by the player, and I think the game overall could have been much improved with a little more of this.  Even with these flaws, I greatly enjoyed Heavy Rain.  I often get immersed in a skillfully realized game world, but I think in seeing what the character goes through I have at best what I would call a sympathetic response.  When that character has an emotional moment I might feel sympathy but am not genuinely affected myself.  Heavy Rain is the first game to evoke a truly empathetic response from me, and that says a lot for its merits.  Some may call the gameplay boring, tedious, repetitive, etc., but I think it is an innovative, clever, and for me an enjoyable style.  It's possible this game is the ultimate \"love it or hate it\" kind of experience, but I am squarely in the latter camp and am interested in seeing what David Cage comes up with next!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2010"}

Make no mistake - Dark Souls 2 is a fantastic experience. It ranks in my top 5 on the PS3. However, Dark Souls easily ranks at #1, and this game doesn't live up to that. In that sense, it is a disappointment, but ignore the fanboy rancor here - this is one of the most fun titles on the system.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++In an era where the JRPG has utterly crashed and burned, it is amazing (and refreshing) to see FROM software continue to produce spectacular titles. Dark Souls 2 has a lot to live up to, and it doesn't always succeed. But, make no mistake, this is a great game.THE GOOD:- The online in this game is just fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. A lot of people complain about the Soul Memory stuff, and there is some merit to their arguments, but at no point have I ever found difficulty in playing online. Moreover, the variety of online play is just astounding. Join the bell keepers to be summoned to other worlds in an attempt to stop players from...well, ringing bells. Join the rat covenant to call players to your world, where you have set up traps and other devious devices to kill them, over and over again. Join the Sun Covenant to join others in jolly cooperation. Join the Brotherhood of Blood to invade games (either randomly or after summons). You can even be summoned by a boss to help defeat some poor slob (and let me tell you - beating a boss AND a human opponent is really, REALLY hard). Join the Blue Sentinels in order to be called to help people when THEY are invaded. the variety is fantastic. I have never much cared for online play on consoles. Dark Souls 2 begins to change my opinion.- Behold at the huge number of large, dangerous bosses. Don't believe the online hype: for a solo player, these bosses are no joke. I laugh at some of the ridiculous strategies I see online. They might as well just say, &#34;Zanmato!&#34;- Dark Souls 2 has exquisite control. I don't even understand some of the complaints here and elsewhere. So many things have been fixed from Dark Souls. Dodge rolling actually involves a modicum of skill now (you really need to dodge at the precise moment, or you're taking a lot of damage AND losing a lot of stamina). Spells actually fire off when you hit the button, as opposed to being stored somewhere in the game's memory, only to fire at the most inopportune time (&#60;ahem&#62; Dark Souls - I'm looking in your direction). A lot of people have complained about the camera. I have no idea why - the camera works better than any camera I've seen in a similar game. I can find angles easy when sniping (as can the enemies).- Dark Souls 2 is a beautiful game. All of the Souls games have had great art design, and Dark Souls 2 is no different. The horizon in Majula is just beautiful. The Rotten is just magnificently creepy. It's great stuff.- Finally, a SL1 game actually makes sense. In Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, the level 1 character was ridiculously overpowered (a sorcerer in Demon's Souls, and a Pyromancer in Dark Souls). While it was challenging, you had a lot of advantage starting at level 1. In Dark Souls 2, you are...nothing. You have...nothing. It's exactly how it should be. In fact, I would recommend playing a low-level game, because...THE BAD:- People have overstated the &#34;casualized&#34; angle here, but make no mistake: this game is much easier than either of its predecessors (although the numerous glitches to exploit in Demon's Souls might make it a shred easier if you know about them). First off, there's a bonfire around every corner. I mean, there are tons of bonfires. Moreover, you can teleport between any of them, at any time, with no item. In addition to your Estus Flask recovery, there are numerous items to return health (there are actually a bunch of them - I can count 9 off the top of my head). You can also recover spell casts with items. In addition, you can drive enemies to extinction. There are some cool enemy formations that are utterly ruined by this. For example, in the Shrine of Amana, there is an area with a ton of enemies that rust your armor. To pass them, you either need to expend resources, or take the hit to your armor's resilience. Or, that would be the idea, except you can just take 10 minutes and drive them to extinction.It just makes for poor game design. Any idiot can just keep killing the enemies over and over. In fact, for some areas, for most players it would be a time saver to drive enemies to extinction. If they didn't want people farming, why not just leave the enemies, but have them become &#34;soulless&#34; or something?Let's not forget that you can summon help. In addition to numerous in-game summons, you can summon up to three human phantoms to help on any boss. I can't imagine how someone would lose to a boss after summoning human help. Heck, with one ring, I was able to draw all enemies to me, protecting the host as he pelted them with killer spells. Maybe a casual mode would have been a better idea. As it stands, the entire game is watered down.That's about it. Make no mistake, you can make Dark Souls 2 hard if you want. But you have to do it. Most people will just overlevel and beat down with force, rather than finesse. But even with this problem, Dark Souls 2 is a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2014"}

You can play in teams, by yourself, forge, and a few more. The only thing that could have made Halo 3 better was to make it longer and have a different ending (as it resembles Halo's ending too much).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2008"}

You had to play that game all at one time however, so it wasn' t bad at all.Star Fox 64 was also on the top side of graphics in ITS day, but that wasn't what made it sell. It was fun, it was a great flying game, and there is not really a game out there that can stand up to a Star Fox flying game, though Star Fox games may be different.Star Fox Adventures, the first star fox for the gamecube, is basically a complete wreck of the series. The whole game is ON THE GROUND. Though this has never been seen in a Star Fox game, that's ALL THERE WAS in this game. No flying, no anything that made previous Star Fox games Star Fox games.The puzzles were slightly boring, and for all Star Fox veterans, there was no skill that they could bring back.If you want a Star Fox game for Gamecube, get Star Fox Assault. The ground levels are better and there is a great deal of flying (including that the whole last level, which consists of 4 stages, is all flying). Staf Fox Assault, great game.

For the longest time I couldn't get this game to run -- and couldn't get my money back.Unbelievably, it insists that you have a constant internet connection the entire time you're playing it . . . even on single-player mode.  If the connection is lost, THE GAME WILL STOP -- even if you're in mid-battle!  I couldn't effin' believe it!  This is a game only for those who have super-stable high-speed internet connections.But here was my real problem:  although I have a high-speed internet connection, it's through a proxy.  This is a common situation for people connecting in businesses, apartment complexes, government buildings, etc.INCREDIBLY, the game does not have proxy support!  Or, at least, not all of it does:  TIBERIAN TWILIGHT will take your proxy settings from your default browser to update and register the game, but once it starts, THAT PART -- at least as of my writing -- has not been coded to route through the proxy.  It's possible this will be fixed with a patch in the future, but in the meantime what this means is that before you can get to the menu, it'll say \"unexpectedly disconnected from the internet.\"  That's misleading:  what it really should say is that the part of the game that checks for the constant internet connection can only detect a direct connection.If you have this problem and are bent on playing this game, what you need to do is get a program (\"Proxifier\" is one example) that forces applications to recognize the proxy and connect through it.  Using this program, I was able to get TIBERIAN TWILIGHT as well as RED ALERT (another EA outing with a very similar problem) working.But I have to say:  those programmers at EA are a boatload of 'tards for not coding proxy support into their games!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

SWTFU II is like the classic sequel: it's more of the same, shinier, but not necessarily conveying more.The graphics look prettier, except that Starkiller's face model looks...off. In my opinion any way. The music is superb, the voice acting is just a continuation of the great voice acting in the first game.The control scheme has been re-tightened, but not reworked. It is simply a fluid continuation of the first game, and while the camera has been reworked to be less \"wonky\"  (a common complaint of the first game) and Starkiller runs...a bit slower...I was able to pick this right up and just hack stormtroopers with unparalleled gusto.The feel of the game, truth be told, is a direct continuation more than a sequel. It feels almost like an expansion pack. Starkiller himself is as powerful as you might have left him off, re-gaining his force powers at a rather fast rate, making him somewhat unbelievably overpowered. I do not know if someone who didn't play the first SWTFU would be able to pick this game up and play this game with reasonable ease, as the game compensates this overpowered-ness with frantic gameplay and impossible odds. As a result, the gameplay feels somewhat uneven, in my opinion: one level in particular, some weird gambling citadel in Malastare, felt superbly long, and what's more, repetitive. And then, it had two boss sequences, which felt like a bit much. It could be argued that the story flow was not set up in a way that follows standard \" level- boss, level-boss, level-boss\" schemes, but that it sets up the action in a more natural, fluid, story-telling way...but the problem with that argument is that the story telling feels very thin-spread when compared to the original SWTFU. The premise of the protagonist being a clone starts feeling a bit contrived after a bit. In essence, to me at least, it runs out of gas, and we're left with superb gameplay set in repetitive encounters.Sometimes a story will be so good that it will carry bad gameplay or bad level design, but that's not the case here. And the combination of great gameplay with great level design is a combination that has carried some of the more popular game franchises in the last few years. But in this case, incredible game play mechanics cannot compensate enough for a thinly spread storyline, provided for the sake of giving us an excuse to hack through endless hordes of incredibly stupid stormtroopers (given, there are other more devious enemies, and a lot of them are force resistant, but I have not gotten stumped in this game yet, save for a boss fight which was a bit uneven, in my opinion)I still have  more to see of this game, and it has been incredibly fun, so far. But, to be honest, I had just as much fun playing SWTFU, and I was served with what I considered a very well written and scripted Star Wars side story to the original trilogy. This time around, it just feels a bit lacking.Edit- As I kept playing on last night I encountered a series of bugs that at first were kind of funny, then they kind of detracted from the experience, and finally prevented me from going forward: When killing enemies, some of these would stick to the walls after being defeated, or would float away, at first. This was...comical. Then, at one point, I would come into a crowded room, and about half the stormtroopers were running into walls, walking on air, running through walls, dying and coming back to life ad nauseum, and some of them just floated out of reach, preventing me from clearing the room, which would have triggered the storyline to go forward, so I was stuck.I don't know what this trend is to rush a product, but I really hope Lucasarts hotfixes this soon. I kinda wish I could return this and get some other game, honestly.edit 2- after finishing the game, I had to adjust my rating from 3 stars to 2.  The game is, as everyone says, painfully short. One playthrough lasts about 4 hours. The ending, both endings, to me, are unsatisfying, to say the least. The final stages of the game are incredibly anticlimatic. I always thought that fighting Vader in the first game was an awesome way to go out, although the fight was tough as nails, but the final stages of this game fall incredibly flat. This game is just very disappointing.It fell short of every expectation I could have had for this game.  And it could be argued that Lucasarts has no obligation to meet my expectations, and the reverse could be said as well, that I am under no obligation to buy this game, but hey, I did. And I also traded it in before it was too late. At least I have Castlevania LoS.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

Improved features include: more characters, 3D backrounds, restored controls (the traditional 3 punch, 3 kick button controls are back thankfully), and 6 different &quot;grooves&quot;. The most significant changes in my opinion are the addition of the new characters and the good old 6 button control layout. I believe the 4 button scheme implemented in Capcom Vs. SNK 1 and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 seriously compromised the gameplay. So with the larger character roster and tweaked gameplay, what's not to like, right? Unfortunately, there are a couple of drawbacks. For some reason, Capcom has felt the need to leave the characters in their recent 2D fighting games in low resolution. I really don't see why they decided to do that, because even the animation intense Street Fighter 3 was done in high res. Also, some characters have been stretched and re-sized when they didn't need to be, and the fireballs are done with 3D graphics that do not match the 2D hand drawn characters. Even though the graphics and overall presentation are only satisfactory, I still recommend Capcom Vs. SNK 2.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Anyone who has read my bio will know that I am a fanatic about FPS titles, and have played the best to the worst of them all. I especially enjoy run and gun style FPS titles, and my entire love for these games were spawned back in 1994 when I sat down at a friend's house and played the original Doom by id Software. Years later, I have owned Doom, Doom II, and Final Doom on every platform ranging from SNES and Jaguar to 3DO, Playstation, and PC of course. Finally, the long awaited sequel is here ... Doom 3. Was it worth the wait? Well, a whole bunch of underwear changes later, I definitely would say yes.The story to Doom 3 follows along the footsteps of the original title, and you get to play as a marine who has been dispatched to Mars to relieve the current military crew on an interstellar laboratory. All is not well when you arrive however, and you are accosted by stories and bizarre ramblings from some of the employees about madness and the extreme desire to get out of there as soon as possible. Well, seems as though the UAC (who owns the facility) has found some alien technology, and they are messing around with the possibility of warpgates. Due to carelessness (or possibly intentional, play the game to find out more) a warpgate is opened into Hell itself, and soon the story takes a horrifying turn as you are left alone fighting for survival among some of the nastiest and scariest denizens that Oblivion can hurl in your direction. There are survivors that you will stay in contact with during the game, but overall you are left to fend for yourself. In standard id fashion, Doom 3 presents some great, action packed run and gun action. While there are things to figure out, and the environments have a dark, claustrophobic, maze like kind of atmosphere that makes you worried at times about getting lost, most of the puzzle element to the game revolves around \"get from A to B\" or \"Find so and so\". And of course, you will be finding access key cards to allow you into more high security sections of the facility. Control wise, Doom 3 stays in the \"easy to figure out\" mode with W,A,S, and D controlling primary movement, the scroll wheel to quickly switch weapons, and a key to reload, one to crouch, and one to jump just to name a couple. Let's talk for a moment about the monsters and weapons that you will encounter while playing, because I for one (being a Doom fanatic from way back in the nineties) was concerned about them trying to remake a classic. Fortunately all of the artillery that made the original great are back, like shotguns, plasma guns, the rocket launcher and the BFG 9000. There is also a neat new weapon, called the Soulcube, which will automatically kill off an enemy and provide health. As for the beasts of Hell, I was happy to see some of my old favorites like the Imp, Cacodemon, and Pinky Demon back once more ... but this time they have had a major graphics upgrade which will not only leave you impressed at the new movements and looks, but also in the fact that they are intimidating as heck now. One cool new feature that was added into this newest fun filled romp through Hell is a PDA that your character will carry with him along the way. This is handy if you forget your current mission objective, but it also is useful for playing video clips that you find as well as audio transmissions from some of the crew aboard the facility which not only give you more info from a personal perspective about the goings on in the UAC complex, but also will revel helpful things like combination to lockers where you can find things like armor and much needed ammo or weapons for your arsenal. Usually, I save comments on graphics until I get all of the gameplay stuff out of the way, but one thing that really helped out in the gameplay arena here WAS the graphics. The game looked absolutely awesome in my opinion, and this new engine that they are using pumped out graphics and looks smooth enough to scare the heck out of me when I came across an Imp, Zombie, or one of the many other monsters that there are to have to deal with along the way. The lighting itself was dark and eerie causing you to have to rely on a simple flashlight in many areas, which also added a little strategy into the mix rather than the old school style of just hopping into a room and unloading at whatever you saw. See, the creatures in this game are not only scary as hell (no pun intended), but they also aren't stupid. Monsters with distance weapons will take cover to avoid your fire, and many will actually sit in dark corners and wait for you to pay attention to something in front of you before attacking from behind. Yes, it forces you to play smarter. Yes, it's an awesome idea which makes you cautious and nervous about entering any area, and yes ... there are many instances where you may need to pause so you can go and change your undies or catch your breath before getting a heart attack. I literally kicked my pc over once accidentally when I jumped at a corpse that crashed out of the ceiling in front of me right after all of the power in the facility went out. One area that I have to say could have used a little work personally was in the multiplayer department. Before I go any further, please understand that I didn't dislike the multiplayer experience; I just felt it could have been a little more. Basically, every server I logged into was a deathmatch or last man standing game that we've all seen and played a hundred times before, and while it was cool to play it in the new Doom 3 engine with the upgraded lighting and effects features, this was a good opportunity to really go all out and offer some cool modes of play ... one of which could have been a co-op mode. The ambiance to the game both in sound and in lighting in Doom 3 was nothing short of fantastic. The game overall is very, very dark (regardless of how high you turn the brightness), and as I stated or hinted around before, you are armed many times with a simple flashlight trying to illuminate dark corners of a room before entering to try and ensure that you don't get jumped. The sounds to Doom 3 set an incredibly scary tone to the game from start to finish, and you will be assaulted by everything from static chatter on your headset with the sounds of your comrades screaming for help or dying to background noises that will set you hair on end trying to figure out whether it was human or something much, much worse. Overall, Doom 3 is a game that any Doom fan should go and get (if you haven't already), and don't worry ... even with my current system specs I was able to run it without hardly any problems or lagging (nothing worse than I've seen in other games, even with detail set to high), but stay off of Very High res mode if you don't have something equal to or better than a 128 graphics card. Well, id Software has shown why it was the creator of the single player FPS market as we know it once again, and while many of the elements here are things that we've seen and done throughout the years, the environment, lighting, animation, story, and sound will probably once again raise the bar in the world of FPS gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2004"}

It is not a very scary game but as a shooter action game it succeeds in being fun and challenging. They do a good job in mixing up enemy types, which keeps the action fresh. The enemy soldiers flank and lay cover fire and press you if you stay in cover too long. Most of the other enemy types just rush at you but sheer numbers make these enemies challenging.Story wise I have been entertained I did not play either the 1st or 2nd game so not sure if the story meshes with what was already laid out but on its own the story is above average for a FPS these days.I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics in this game. Seeing some vids online made the graphics look pretty bad. The graphics are not the best out there but the gameplay makes up for any lack of visuals and that's really what matters. The settings are fairly detailed and varied.  There are no epic set pieces but good settings and level design are present at every part of this game.The multiplayer in this game is awesome and there are some fresh modes with two small problems. I have played Soul King, F'N Run, and Contractions modes. I have not yet played Soul Survivor. Soul King is my favorite of these modes Basically 4 players start as specters and than the map populates with AI controlled bots as a specter you possess one of the bots and kill other bots once they die you collect the dead bots soul the other players do this too and to really win you have to kill the other players than they drop their collected souls. If you are the \"soul king\" the person with the most souls all the other players can see where you are on the map at all times. The game is fast frenetic fresh and very fun. F'N Run is fun as well a wall of death smoke is coming up behind you as you and a team of up to four players plow through enemy bots. It is awesome to turn around and see this smoke coming up fast behind you that will kill you but some maps require jumping over obstacles which is unfairly too hard and not always responsive. Contractions is basically a Fear 3 take on Nazi zombies from COD but you have to go out and get supplies between or at the end of rounds.Now for the problems with multiplayer, The lobby system and matchmaking leave a lot to be desired. You can host a match but unless you have a party of people set to go you can sit there for a while, before your game populates. You can join already hosted match but the host has to launch the game so sometimes you'll join a match and there will not be enough people for the host to launch the game and also sometimes it is a full lobby but the host has fallen asleep at the wheel and doesn't launch the game than you go back to square one. Also as I mentioned earlier Soul King is my fav mode so far but I have yet to have a full party complete a game. Usually 2 people quit by the end of round one, leaving me with one other person. Than if the host quits game ends. Needless to say the way this is set up I spend more time trying to get into a multiplayer game than actually playing the multiplayer.The multiplayer and graphics were good surprises after purchasing this game. Also the campaign co-op makes this game a package well worth a purchase. If you have a lot of friends who bought this game you wont have any of the issues I had with matchmaking but that is a small issue overall for me. A solid fun shooter with good co-op/multiplayer  and an above average story, definitely worth a purchase","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}

Granted, that's one gamer's opinion, but I have some very compelling reasons for thinking thus...THE BAD...- The commentary is ugly.  Collinsworth & Johnson make comments about plays that have nothing to do with the onfield action, or they comment on something that happened on a previous down; it's sloppy, at best.  Do yourself a favor and shut off the commentary immediately.- The audio presentation is lackluster.  The crowds grow oddly quiet--like dead silent--between plays and then suddenly cheer for things that don't seem to warrant ovations.  Other times, there's no sound at all on the field.  I'd like to hear more player chatter and stuff like that but there's little to be found.- Load times are sluggish, especially at the beginning of the game.  The initial installation bombards you with EA-approved messages, online agreements, and other nonsense that quickly gets under the skin.  I don't know what's loading in the background, but it shouldn't take that long!- During franchise mode, there isn't enough information available on rookies to make a proper decision.  This isn't a game-breaker, but it becomes frustrating when you have to cut down your roster during pre-season and you have very little information to go on.THE GOOD...- Franchise mode is richer and more detailed than any edition since Madden 08 with all the owner mode fixings.  There's still some stuff missing, but the goodies they added in this year are well worth it.  Having a big roster to cut down is a lot of fun (despite the lack of ratings, as mentioned above) and the return of player roles helps to shape individual players.  Hot and cold streaks combine with player traits to give you a sense of changing player attitudes, performance, and abilities during the year.  During the game, the dynamic performance changes and players can alter their style based on in-game events; for example, sacking Jay Cutler a few times makes him trigger happy and inaccurate (as it does for other QBs, too).  There are a few wrinkles in the system, but overall it makes Madden feel like a more fluid experience and less like a 3D spreadsheet.- There are a ton of options to change in Madden 12.  Before you complain about something, check around all the settings: chances are you'll find the option to change what you don't like about the game.  Everything from penalty frequency, player substitutions, game speed, time, injuries, and so on can be tweaked.  This is perhaps my favorite thing about Madden 12 and something I wish every game incorporated--the ability to change how the game works to suit individual taste.- Gameplay is finally worth smiling about!  For the first time, I'm willing to say that Madden is fun to play AND fairly realistic.  It's still a video game, of course, but the sense of player weight, momentum, and collision improvements have brought this game up a few levels.  I haven't seen any obvious suction blocking, warping, sliding, or superhuman feats of omniscient agility.  There are a few instances where it seems the CPU is cheating, but upon watching the replay I believe it was my fault and not the game trying to drive me nuts.  All the impacts look amazing and the new suite of animations adds a lot of variety and excitement to the game.  Defense is much smarter this year, and defenders will read and react accurately; gone are the days of consistently scorching the defense with gimmick plays or \"money\" plays.THE WRAP-UP...There has never been and will never be a \"perfect\" game.  Football is complex enough on the field, nevermind trying to simulate it.  Madden has always done an OKAY job of simulating football, and I don't think it'll get much beyond that until there's some competition.  This year, the on-field play and franchise management is very good, but the audio presentation, commentary, and scouting system is poor... so we're balanced at OKAY again!Seriously, this game has far fewer on-field glitches than other edition of Madden.  If it seems like the CPU is cheating, my suggestion is to take a step back and try to re-learn the game.  We've grown so used to playing against a wacky unbalanced AI that we resort to gaming the game... I'm not so sure we need with this Madden.  All the mistakes I made were legitimate football errors acquired from years of playing glitchy exploitable editions of Madden.Take a breath and put the training wheels back on--it's okay, I won't tell anyone.EDIT: I highly recommend bringing the game speed down to slow or very slow (I prefer the latter) and adjusting the difficulty sliders until you find the area where the game seems balanced to you.  We all have different playing styles and the game will play differently for each of us.  Take some time and adjust it to suit your tastes.  The speed and sliders are in there for a reason--use them!  It makes a difference, seriously.  All of the negative reviews on here that mention problems with too hard, too easy, or other ratings/gameplay issues should at least give it a shot (since you paid $60).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Citysmash","summary":"I like this reboot :)","reviewText":"I'm a huge fan of the 3rd person action adventure genre.  I've played all of the Tomb Raider and Uncharted games, and liked how this adventure turned out as well.  Was it better than Uncharted?  No, but it came pretty darn close!  The story is a little more simplified, trying to be a more visceral survival experience.  While Lara's character and history was broadened in this latest outing, it was too bad they couldn't find a way to tie in more things (events, character relationships, character likes/dislikes) from previous TR games into this prequel.  There's so much lore that the developers could have used to hint at why Lara is the way she is, I kind of see that as a big missed opportunity for this game from a story telling point of view.On a different note, I really liked the projectile combat in this game.  The auto-cover system works really well, switching between weapons and their mods is quick & easy, and the entire upgrade RPG element is a nice touch that I hope they use in the next game.  The only gripe I had about the combat system was the hand-to-hand combat system.  I found it to be a little too simplistic, as attacks/finishing moves often just came down to one button (triangle) presses even after all the upgrades were applied to that aspect of combat.Lastly, the graphics were spectacular and on-par with all of the greatest blockbuster games that have ever come out, but the sound (at least for me) was by far the most amazing aspect to this game!  Maybe because I played this game on a pair of Bose speakers, but the sound effects of the environment, character dialogue, gun/grenade blasts were outstanding.  The composer of the music in this game should also get an award of some kind for best soundtrack in a video game it was great all the way through the closing credits.Overall, this game was an incredibly satisfying experience, it may not be the longest game in the world, but it never left me feeling like it was too short either, it was just right, with plenty of big-budget production value moments to boot!4/5 stars :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2013"}

For a game that plays heavily on Light and Dark themes, there is a dynamic color palette. The set-pieces are very pretty. However, in the former stages of the game, there are a few too many ground crumbling, impending doom concrete sequences. Overall, the PS3 framerate was satisfactory.One of the biggest disappointments is the length. It couldn&#8217;t have been more than 8 hours for the core story. With such attention to detail to the environment every second of the story, it is easy to see why. The benefit of the duration is that there was never a dull moment and the game was well paced.I thought the dialogue was actually pretty decent. A little too &#8220;punkish&#8221;, but still felt very real given the characters situation.The combat surprised me the most.

The other issue I have is with the Graphics. We know they aren't High definition...but it seems some of the games the graphics are even worse than on the original Xbox back 6-7 years ago. Graphics aren't everything, but when you are paying $200 for a console and $40-$50 for a game, I expected soemthing a little better to look at than what the Wii delivers.  If you have an old fashioned, non-HD tv, you can get by with the Wii. However, if you have a big screen, High-Definition Television, the games might actually look bad and you would be much better off with an Xbox 360 or PS3 (we have all 3 consoles, my personal favorite is the Xbox 360, because it is high def, and there are a good choice of games for the kids on there, as well as older games for about $20).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Bioshock Review","reviewText":"BioShock is one of those games that definitely leaves you both wanting more and at the same time complete exhaustion. In this game you are an unexpecting passenger of an aircraft that crashes inot the middle of the ocean. Somehow you survive the crash and float to the top. You don't seem to spot any suriviors but there does seem to be some strange tower in the middle of the ocean. You swim to it thinking that at least you'll be able to wait rescue not having to tread water. You discover a door, upon entering you see signs for something called Rapture, you then find a deep water pod, having your curisoity taking the better of you you pull the lever, and into the sea you descend, into the city of Rapture, or what is ever left of it. You will talk to several people on your journey through this city, but you will also have to fend off the splicers, humans so torn up by genetic enhancements that they have lost their free will.Graphically this game is absolutely stunning the 1940's vibe is alive and well in the city of rapture, but there's this utter eeriness that just hangs over the whole place that will keep you on your toes. The different areas that you get to traverse look amazing, from the market, to the museum, and more you're definitely going to be left with a, \"hmm this was probably a really nice place, once upon a time\". The enemy designs were perfect. Now of course the most famous one, the Big Daddy and Little Sister combo, is so errie, and yet to awe-inspiring, but the other characters that you have to face all have just enough variety that you don't feel like you're just fighting wave upon wave of clones.The music in this game definitely has that 1940s vibe to it, its all very old school but seems to fit perfectly in this game, giving it that extra little boost to capture you in the game. The use of ambiant noises is another thing that solidifies this game, there's nothing quite like hearing a spider splicer mumble threats and then all of a sudden having them pop up right in front of you.The controls a pretty straight forward, you're going to learn how to best use them as you go, but believe me when I say that you're going to be using every button you've got to get through this game. My only issue was when it came to electrocuting something to hack it and accidentally hitting X before the prompt and wasting precious EVE when I didn't need to waste it. Other than that small little thing you're going to find that the buttons go well with this game.So as stated before you have descended into the city of Rapture, an underground city that was created for the freedom of science, and to be separate from the oppressive governments and religions. Now of course as things always seem to go, this started as a good thing but turned bad. People became corrupted with all the genetic changes that they were capable of doing, thanks in large part to the scientific community, not being hindered by laws. The trick though is that in order to better yourself you need something called ADAM, an ingredient found in the enemies called Little Sisters. Now of course in order to get to them you're going to have to go through th Big Daddy, a giant of a monster that soaks up plenty of damage, and will do anything in its power to save and protect the Little Sisters. When you first get down into Rapture all you want to do is find away to go home, where ever that might be, but as the game progresses you're going to find that there are plenty of obstacles and twists that will stand in your way. Now if you can get through them all you might just get to go home, or perhaps you'll lose the fight and Rapture will wait dormant for another challenger.This game is something that everyone needs to try. If you're in to first person shooters with a very unique setting, and story, then this is the game that you're going to want to get your hands on. I have to say that its not hard to see how this game got game of the year, and even though this review is out after the second one's been out for a while, with the passage of time, this game has not lost a step. This game gets a 9.2 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Involving, Epic & Amazing!","reviewText":"Dragon Age: Origins is the first RPG that I have played this generation.  Ever since picking up Dragon Warrior for the NES back when I was in junior high all those years ago, RPG's have been far and away my favorite genre of video game.  After spending 80+ hours with Dragon Age: Origins, and being completely immersed in its world from beginning to end, it is really stunning to sit and think about how far video games have come.First things first...a brief look at the exterior coating of Dragon Age wouldn't lead one to think that this game is anything extraordinary.  Given one brief glance, while certainly not unimpressive, there isn't a whole lot that will leave one's jaw on the ground.  The graphics, while more than adequate, are not particularly stunning.  The combat mechanics, while certainly more than competent, are nothing revolutionary.  And the story, while doing more than serving its purpose, isn't the most original out there.What makes this game one of the absolute best RPG's I've ever played is the how incredibly involving and immersive it is.  Bioware has constructed this game in a way that it is able to be played out in a seemingly endless variety of scenarios.  As a gamer, you are able to bring who YOU are as a person to the game, and the choices and actions you execute will result in consequences that you will have to live with.  This was shocking and amazing to me as a relative newcomer to this generation's games, and it truly made for an experience that pulled me in in a way that no other game ever has.  A couple of examples (don't worry, there are no spoilers here):  I had to decide which side of a political faction to support in one of the games longer quests.  Having gathered information that revealed very credible pros and cons for each side, I found myself having come to a complete standstill on who to support, and literally spent about 2 hours just wandering around in the game while I (myself, not my in-game character) tried to make a decision I felt was best.  This happens in real life, and here it was, happening in a video game!  In another separate quest, I found myself betraying a certain group and changing allegiance to the opposing side during a final, crucial battle because I felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do.  Unlike my decision in the earlier quest, this choice left me feeling very happy and truly satisfied that I made the decision I did, and the results were ultimately beneficial.These are the things that make Dragon Age: Origins such an amazing game.  It's not a game for everyone.  There aren't really any quick fixes here.  It's a game that you have to spend time with and allow yourself to exist in this world that is presented to you.  If you are willing and able to do that, you will find yourself in the midst of one of the most satisfying games you'll ever play.  With all the possible characters that you can create (each with a unique origin story that ripples in its own unique way throughout the entire main storyline), to all the decisions you can make, to all the different ways you can go about conquering the quests, intaracting with your party, and achieving your goals, Dragon Age: Origins is a true epic.  The experiences the game provides are unforgettable.  Its surely one of the best RPG's I've played in the 20 years since first picked up Dragon Warrior.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2010"}

Here's my review.Graphics: 8/10. There is a slight improvement over the first game. The enviroments look a wee bit better, the characters do too, but there is not much different here. The overall look and feel of the game sticks to how Star Wars Battlefront was, so anyone who played the first one will easily be able to play this one, too.Sound: 9/10. The sound is awesome with surround sound. Great Star Wars symphony beats during gameplay and at the menus, nice talking during gameplay by the characters such as \"Get the Wookiee!\" when your team is getting slaughtered by Wookiees to \"What do you think you're doing?\" When you \"intentionally\" or intentionally team kill. Great sound.Control: 8.5/10. The control for this game is really, really easy when you have auto aim on. When it is off, though, it can be very difficult unless you are an avid 1st person or 3rd person player. It gets the job done.Fun: 8/10. This game is better than the first in some ways, not in others. Strangely, you can't even prone in this game for whatever reason, which makes sniping hard to do unless you find a good spot in bushes or something. Of course, there are new levels, and space battles, but the space battles are fairly boring unless you have a friend to play with because they can take quite awhile ( I've played some 45 minute space battles. ) One big dissapointment about this game, though, was how there weren't more Star Wars Battlefront 1 maps in this game. There are maybe 5 at most, and it's kind of sad, because there were some really, really fun SWBF1 maps. SWBF2 has Hoth, Geonosis, Kashyyyk, (Which looks much different from the original game so it looks more like it did fromt he movie ), Endor, and Tatooine Mos Eisley. There is more, but I could only think of those. Another thing that this game features of course, is the new Jedi mode. You can play as a Jedi if you go on some sort of kill streak. This is fun, but really unfair to the other team because it is real mass murder. There is also a Career Stat Tracker, showing your kills, deaths, and awards. SWBF2 is an excellent Star Wars game, but doesn't do too much more than the original did. If you have the first, you may be skeptical about getting this one because it has a lot of the same stuff, but if you are a true fan, you will buy this one without a second thought.8.4/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004ML7WOK","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"It's Okay","reviewText":"This isn't necessarily a bad game, it definitely has some cool moments, but overall I just found the annoying/frustrating moments to really outweigh the good. I couldn't help but think about how beautiful the graphics were in the first game at the time (I mean I'll never forget that opening scene where you watch TV with your soon to be dead girlfriend), yet the Darkness 2 is a big step back even with it being released years later. The developer tried to go for a cell-shaded aesthetic, but it really ended up looking like last-gen graphics. The idea was fitting with the comic book background, but the game just isn't bright enough to really pull off that style, ultimately I just found it kind of dull.For the gameplay, there are a lot of moments when it shines where you really feel like a badass. There's nothing new or original, and the guns lack impact, but the darkness powers can be really cool and interesting to play around with. The biggest problems come along when the games tries to up the ante by putting the player up against special forces with various darkness powers. This would be fine, if not for how they alter the gameplay, with not just making it more difficult but also much more annoying. This comes in to major ways, one being characters that use spotlights against you, which takes away all of your powers and blind the character and the player with the brightness, making it hard to take out the guy with the light. The second incredibly annoying character has almost a teleportation ability, where it hops all around the battle field and has a lot of health. This would be fine, but then the enemy has a horribly stupid main power where it steals your gun and throws it randomly away. Not only is this frustrating when you may have a gun you really like and one you don't (or if your other gun is out of ammo), I absolutely hated searching around for my thrown gun after I killed the enemy. It's really a pointless ability that is only meant to frustrate the player.As for the story, it's really pretty simplistic. You're now the head of the gang, and they try to have some moments between missions where you can explore your mansion, but it's really underdeveloped and boring. There's also these moments between missions where the developer tries provide an alternate reality where the rest of the game is taking place in the character's crazed mind. I just found it a little annoying, boring, and really counter-intuitive while in a video game to possibly have everything you're doing not be real in the game, also it's already been done much better in other forms of media.In the end, you could probably do worse than this game, especially at the price it is now, however I don't think I'd recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}

Durs \"ddurs\"","summary":"Entertaining Shooter","reviewText":"I have played just about every shooter out there on the PC. This was my second XBOX 360 game (COD Black Ops was my first). This game was fun, very entertaining and unique. Its a FPS/RP and it takes a bit to get used to it. There are quite a few levels and missions so it will take a while to get through it -- but it is well worth it. It is very difficult to describe visually -- its a bit like a cartoon, but the graphics are still cool. There are infinite weapons to choose, but I recommend driving over the enemies with your vehicle -- my favorite part. You will find yourself constantly swapping out weapons, mods, etc to improve and test on enemies as well. I highly recommend this game. Its extremely entertaining, smart and unique -- a bit of a different shooter standing apart from the rest.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}

It's just the best-created hand-held controller for the human hand.  Batteries last really long in these controllers for me - I use rechargables and I highly recommend them for you as well.

{"product_name":"B0050SYUAS","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Still the best \"pure fitness\" game you can get for the Xbox Kinect","reviewText":"The original Your Shape: Fitness Evolved provided an excellent showcase of what the Kinect was capable of in regards to fitness and exercise. Its motion detection was revolutionary in terms of how well it detected how well you were performing exercises, and the mini-games it included were both tons of fun and moderately good exercise.I'm happy to say that Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012 does push the platform forward, in an evolutionary if not a revolutionary way. Still, it is by far the best \"pure workout\" game that you can get on the Kinect.When you start out the game,  you see a blue screen which adjusts the sensor and detects who you are. You're then brought to a home screen, where you see a stylized cartoon image of yourself. That's right, there's no need to create an avatar, because you ARE the avatar. This little change was a huge improvement over the first version, where you played as a brightly colored silhouette. It makes a world of difference, because now you can see your limbs and your body position much clearer than before and match them against the on-screen trainer.  More on that below.The home screen shows a number of different counters: medals won, badges won, and percent of content you've played through. On the right you can see the total number of calories you've burned playing the game. I do like the fact that there are clear milestones and targets to aim for, which will keep you coming back to the game. (One question a lot of people have is--did Ubisoft fix the annoying bug from the first version where it'd lose track of which sessions you've finished in a given routine. The happy answer is yes--now, no matter what order you do the exercises in the system will keep accurate track of which ones you've completed).At the main menu, you have a variety of choices which are color-coded into categories. The blue icons represent your tools. You can keep track of your overall progress, set objectives and take a fitness quiz so the system can recommend specific workouts for you, or go online to share your progress with the community. I do like that they made the fitness test optional in this version, so those who want to can just jump into the exercises.There are three remaining categories: Yellow icons represent \"Activities\", which are mini-games. Red icons represent \"Workouts\" which are traditional generic calisthenics and strength building exercises of the kind you might find at a gym. Finally, purple icons represent \"Classes\", which are essentially themed Workouts.Under the yellow \"Activities\", you have the following mini-games:1) Wallbreaker: This is essentially the same game as \"Virtual Smash\" in last year's version. In it, you have to punch across your body to hit blue blocks that appear next to your virtual character's body. The more blocks you punch accurately and quickly, the higher your multiplier will go up and the more a grid behind you will fill up--fill it up completely and it'll collapse. As you get to higher levels you'll have to kick blocks as well and avoid red blocks and giant anvils swinging at you. Even though this is basically a rehash of last year's version, it's still immensely fun, and the fact that you're controlling \"you\" and not just a silhouette of you adds a certain dimension to the game. I'd rate this one a 4 of 5 for workout intensity and a 5 of 5 for fun.2) Stack 'Em Up: This one is essentially the same game as the game from last year's version called...\"Stack 'Em Up\". This is the one where you're holding a plank and trying to catch and balance blocks that are falling from the sky. There are some new twists this year--to make your bar longer you have to raise a leg in the air. Also, the blocks come in different sizes, and they can even turn into ice or catch on fire (you need to kick a giant water drop to make it rain). Interestingly, I found the graphics of last year's version much clearer than this year's, especially when it tells you where to drop your blocks. This one gets a 3 of 5 for workout intensity and a 5 of 5 for fun.3) Run the World: Ah, finally something brand new. This is an activity where you \"run in place\". But there's a twist. You can choose either New York or London and basically \"run through\" the city from landmark to landmark. When I first heard about this one, I was excited--I thought it might be a virtual reality experience where you could literally run through actual streets (if this sounds outlandish, remember that the technology is already there with Google Maps and Bing Maps, not to mention driving games that have mapped out those cities' streets). But in reality, the experience was much less impressive than that. You basically just run in place on a blank white screen following a line of stylized \"yellow dots\" on the road. As you run, you do see buildings to your left and right, but they're just generic grey outlines. As you \"approach\" a famous landmark you'll see that building's distinctive outline, see a tiny photo of the building, and read some trivia about it. Note also that the distances you run are not literal--I'm quite familiar with downtown New York, and there's no way you can run from 40 Wall Street to the Woolworth Building to City Hall in 5 minutes. Still, I did like how the system was able to detect how fast I was \"running\" and how at least captured the feeling of running through a city. Overall, this activity definitely made what was otherwise a tedious activity pretty interesting. Workout intensity of this one was a 5 of 5, but for fun I give it a 3 of 5.4) Jump Rope: This is another new activity, and it's a winner. It's a twist on jump rope. You start out by holding your hand as if you're holding a jump rope, and an energetic beat will start playing. You'll see icons of two feet under you, and need to jump to the beat while matching the pattern of feet (either two close together, two far apart, or just the left or the right). Even on Easy mode I was wiped out after this one, but I found it immensely fun. 5 of 5 for workout intensity, 5 of 5 for fun.5) Stomp It: This game is very similar to \"Light Race\" from last year's version, where you stand in the middle of something similar to a \"Simon\" game and move your feet to correctly hit the colored panels under your feet. This year, they've improved it by matching the colored lights to a beat and give you a visual cue of which panel will light up next, so it's more like a step aerobics exercise (versus  last year's version where you were just randomly stomping). You still need a ton of room for this one, and if your Kinect doesn't have a clear view of your feet at all times it's not going to be fun for you at all. This one was a 4 of 5 for intensity, and a 4 of 5 for fun.\"Workouts\", represented by the red icons, are basically traditional calisthenics, cardio, and strength building types of activities that a trainer would do with you at a gym. The workouts are categorized by the part of the body or the exercise goal you want to focus on. They include the following (the number of exercise routines under each is in parentheses):1) Arms (12)2) Abs (13)3) Cardio (10)4) Toning (9)5) Back (12)6) Sports Preparation (8)7) Glutes (12)8) Health (3)9) Legs (12)They've got all the basic exercises covered pretty well. For example, when I selected the first workout under \"Arms\", the exercises were knee push-ups and slow mountain climbs. A typical exercise under \"Abs\" will have you doing all kinds of crunches, from basic crunches, to V knees to the chest, to up and down planks.As in the first version, to the left of the screen you'll observe your virtual trainer doing the exercise, using the proper technique. You'll see an image of yourself to the right of the trainer. I really liked how the cartoon trainer and the cartoony you looked very similar, both in terms of size and visual style.  As I said, new to this version is the ability to see your arms and legs clearly, so you can work on matching the trainer's body position and moves precisely. There are also visual cues that'll show you exactly where your head should be and where your feet should be. Finally, there's music so that you can time your reps to the beat perfectly (you'd be surprised at how many workout games just play random music and don't bother to match it to your reps).A woman's voice will talk your through all the exercises, calling out instructions and encouragement. Regarding the latter, I found that she tended to err a little on the \"overly encouraging\" side--even when I wasn't doing the exercises right, she'd be shouting out compliments and encouragement. Happily, the motion detection is definitely spot-on--after the workout you'll see precisely what percentage of the workout you nailed, and I found it to be remarkably accurate.\"Classes\", represented by the purple icons, are very similar to workouts. You go through a series of set exercises, you have a virtual cartoon trainer who will demonstrate the proper moves, and you'll control the cartoony \"you\" standing next to him or her as you try to match the moves. The difference is that while \"workouts\" were like generic exercises you might do at the gym, \"classes\" all follow a specific theme, such as a certain style of dance, a boxing training session, and even a military bootcamp. Here are the options and the number of routines in each:1) Africa Rhythms (12)2) Boot Camp (6)3) Hip Hop (12)4) Cardio Boxing (14)5) Destination: Bollywood (12)6) Yoga (4)7) Latin Dance (12)8) Zen Energy (8)I tried the boot camp one first. Sure enough, you and your virtual trainer (a gruff drill sergeant) are in the field of a military boot camp complete with a helicopter and occasional explosions happening around you. Even at the easy levels, you're taken through a grueling set of exercises, from running to \"Olympian squats\" to \"stun attacks\" to push ups. The trainer stays in character throughout, shouting instructions to you amid various random interjections (\"you're tired? I don't care!\", \"does it hurt? Good!\").I also tried the Bollywood one. Like the rest of the dance-themed classes, it had different levels with names like \"Learn it\", \"Rehearse It\", \"Speed It Up\", and \"Show it Off\". I tried the beginning level, and it brought me through some very authentic Bollywood dance steps with names like \"Bolly Arms\", \"Aarti Step\" and \"Blossom Step\". The moves were very authentic. I wouldn't say this part of the game is exactly Dance Central, but it's not bad either.Overall, I'd say this is a worthwhile purchase if you're serious about using your Xbox for fitness and exercise. Those who purchased last year's version (especially if you purchased a lot of the DLC) may find a lot of what's in this year's version redundant. But I'd say there are enough improvements to make it a worthwhile purchase. I loved the improved avatar, enjoyed the new activities they added, and appreciate the fact that they didn't skimp this year on the number of exercises you can do before resorting to purchasing more as downloadable content. From the title, I'm assuming Ubisoft intends to release one of these every year; here's hoping that they continue to innovate the series moving forward and don't get lazy and rest on past laurels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

Its a game that was released before it had to.. the server is not ready, the ps3 updates are not ready.. the game is simply risky. Promising things like a 128 player team against another 128 player team sounds amazing.. but thats just something that it ain't happening with MAG. Sure, you can try to play it (after hours of server problems), but you won't have that much fun as you thought you were.If you ask me, i think you should all wait until they fix the server, the bugs, everything.. cuz the way I see it, the guys who made the game decided to release it without knowing if the online capabilites were going to work (at least in a decent way).The gameplay mechanics are standard.. a simple copy-cat of any other war shooter (and certainly not better than MW2). The graphics are ok.. but don't expect Call of Duty 4.Should you buy this game? absolutely not.. its a disappointing experience with lots of promises and little commitment. If they can fix all that, we'll have a nice shooter in a couple of months.. if they don't do anything about the server and bugs, then you'll throw your copy away within 2 days of attempting to play.(the only reason i'm giving it 2 stars is beacause the game is actually quite promising.. and i know they were trying.. but its an epic fail on my book.

{"product_name":"B00002STFP","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Bigger, better, yet not complete...","reviewText":"Okay, so I'm six years too late in reviewing this game, but what the hey: I just recently picked it up really cheap, just to see what it was like since I'm a huge Mortal Kombat fan. Bottom line? It's better than I expected, but not by much.I've bought around 16 Nintendo 64 games, and not once have I complained about the cartridge format: until now. It served me well through GoldenEye, Perfect Dark, Banjo-Kazooie, Battle for Naboo, and even through Resident Evil 2. Yes the video sequences in that game were highly compressed, but seeing as how squeezing them all in was a miracle by itself, I have no complaints. It's too bad Williams didn't try any similiar compression techniques for MKT. The game feels woefully incomplete, especially when compared to the PSX version. A couple of characters were sacrificed, including Goro, Kintaro, the unmasked Sub-Zero, and classic costume changes for Kano, Raiden, Jax, and a few others. A lot of the classic backgrounds are also missing, noticibly from the original game and Mortal Kombat 2. And then there's the sound, or what tries to pass itself off as sound. While the N64 was capable of Dolby 5.1 Surround by the end of its life span, here it can barely crank out decent mono. Other reviews have said the sound seems canned, muffled, and my personal favourite: like your speakers are set up behind a cement wall. It's all true, every bit of it. If Williams had given the game better sound, I might have been tempted to ease off on it a little.The gameplay has been carried over from MK3, with a new aggressor meter at the bottom. Thankfully, for the characters that have made it, all their finishing moves are intact, and are still cool to watch. There are also various 2-on-2, 3-on-3, and tournament modes to mess around with. The game does get stale after awhile, but it happens to all fighting games. MKT is good for a few rounds of mayhem whenever you're bored.I don't regret purchasing MKT, but I wish Williams had taken more time and effort to polish the game, such as reshooting the actors (Brawka in particular feels cut and pasted directly from MKII), and finding a way to cram everything in. MK fans without a PSX should definitely get this. It's not completely satisfying, but it gets the job done.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2002"}

With that in mind, does Super Smash Brother Brawl live up to the legacy that Melee represents, or to the level that pre-launch material indicated? Short answer for both: reasonably so.Super Smash Brothers is a Nintendo crossover fighting game series featuring characters from almost every Nintendo franchise. Favorites like Mario, Link, Kirby and Samus duke it out in battles of up to four people on stages that are also taken from Nintendo series. Rather than direct combat, SSB focuses on the more cartoonish option of beating up an enemy and then launching them out of the stage with a powerful attack. Plenty of items and stage events keep the game an incredibly fun party experience.Brawl adds to the formula perfected in Melee by adding new characters, new items, and new stages, as well as some new features. There are a total of 26 characters; new additions to the cast include Pit from NES classic Kid Icarus, a Pokemon Trainer and three of his Pokemon, Pikmin's Captain Olimar, and the Mario series' villain/evil twin, Wario. Furthermore, two non-Nintendo characters are available, in a series first: Snake of Metal Gear fame and Sonic the Hedgehog both join the cast. In total, the cast additions include some pleasant surprises, but also some disappointing removals (characters like Roy and Mewtwo have been nixed, although they have been replaced with similar characters from newer installments of their respective series').There are a bevy of new items in the game. Foremost among these is the Smash Ball; when attacked enough, it grants the attacking character a \"Final Smash\" - a devastating attack that varies between different characters. For example, Mario shoots a screen-wide barrage of fireballs, Link catches one opponent in a Triforce symbol and slashes away at them, and Kirby cooks all his enemies in a giant pot. Unfortunately, some Final Smashes are copied or reused; for example, one hidden Zelda character copies Link's Final Smash exactly, and every character from Star Fox (three in all) use the Landmaster Tank as their Final Smash. However, some are definitely really neat and welcome changes to the gameplay - a sort of temporary bonus minigame for whoever manages to get the Smash Ball.Another new item is the Assist Trophy, which is similar to the Poke'ball item in that it summons an invincible helper to fight the enemies of whoever summoned them. For example, Samurai Goroh (from F-Zero) attacks enemies with a katana, as does Lyn from Fire Emblem (in a single swift cut). Kirby's friend Knuckle Joe delivers a barrage of blows and a mighty uppercut that KOs almost anything in its path. Little Mac from Punch-Out!! uses his speed and strength to deliver a startlingly fast jab. Jeff from Earthbound launches rockets at his enemies. Andross (in his Star Fox for the SNES incarnation) lurks in the background and shoots damaging 3d panels.  Not all of them have good effects, though; The Nintendog covers the screen, making seeing the battle almost impossible. Mr. Resetti from Animal Crossing goes on one of his famous rants, the text of which blocks the upper half of the battle completely. All of them contribute greatly to the chaos and hilarity of Smash Bros fighting.There are some new stages as well. The famous Bridge of Eldin from the Legend of Zelda serves as a long, flat stage occasionally broken by a bomb planted by a rampaging Moblin rider. The Frigate Orpheon from Metroid Prime occasionally flips upside down, causing the playing field to shift. Smashville is an Animal Crossing-themed level, and like its source will change depending on what time the level is played. Pictochat has the enemies fighting among the doodles and illustrations of the DS' built in chat program. Most of the new stages are good, but some of them (particularly Delfino Plaza from Super Mario Sunshine and Lylat Cruise from Star Fox Assault) are simply platforms on a moving background, and lack any real extra themes or effects. It's also possible to build your own stages with a variety of parts and backgrounds, which is a fairly intuitive process that can produce some insanely fun results.Besides multiplayer, the game has a new single player mode as well: \"Subspace Emissary\", a story told through cutscenes and action stages. The former are well directed but unvoiced / unworded, relying heavily on body language to get their message across. The story involves an evil plot to destroy the world of Smash Brothers perpetuated by the game's villanous characters (Bowser, Wario, and so on). The Smash Bros cast must team up - splintered at first, but then united - to combat this menace. The interactions between characters have some real gems - for example, Lucas from Mother 3 using the Pokemon Trainer as a sort of big brother role model, or Diddy Kong dragging Fox and Falco off to help him rescue Donkey Kong. The story is difficult to make out, however (though it's explained in detail on the Smash Bros. site), and the final boss is nothing short of eye-roll material (hint: he's a new original character, not an established Nintendo character). The story is mostly enjoyable for the little tidbits, and those are good and plentiful, so they make it worth it.The action stages are 2d side-scrolling classic platforming, with characters fighting against the mysterious and somewhat generic enemies unique to the game. The mechanics are similar to regular gameplay, but directed at a multitude of enemies rather than a small number of skilled opponents. Stages range from generic and boring to generic and frustrating - from \"random jungle\" to \"random ruins\" to \"random flying space-lab\". Other than the playable characters and some enemies from the Mario games, there's nothing \"Nintendo\" about the game mode - you feel like a Nintendo character playing in some other non-Smash Brothers game. So, in that way, this mode feels like it could've been done a lot better.Other bonus parts of the game include the return of trophies from Melee, new unlockable tracks for stages, and a variety of new event matches and sub-games. Furthermore - perhaps most importantly - the Wii allows SSBB to be played online, either with friends (added by inputting their unique code) or with strangers. This mode is pretty well coordinated, and there are no real complaints about it. The option also exists to spectate matches and bet on the winner, adding to the stylish, crowd-pleasing dynamic that the game entails.The gameplay as a whole is great, but it feels less sharp than Melee; some moves feel too slow, unresponsive, or just \"wrong\". The sense of controlled chaos that Melee evoked has been replaced by rampant and uncontrolled chaos, and a lot of the \"art\" of playing has gone out of it. The graphics are in general improved, with some good details on characters and stages, but for the most part everything's moving too fast to notice it. The sound is mostly improved - any poor changes in, say, the announcer's voice, or quality in general are offset by the sheer number of music tracks in the game.As a whole SSBB is a solid, fun, enjoyable game, with some minor bugs and annoyances. There's a lot added, but the jump from Super Smash Bros. to Melee feels stronger than the jump from Melee to Brawl. However, by itself it is a good game with a wide variety of characters and stages from every part of Nintendo's history.9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Buried Gold on the N64","reviewText":"Though Wolfenstein 3-D and the Doom franchise had come and gone long before its time, Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64 grabbed the First Person Shooter genre and ran with it for what seemed like miles and miles. Forget a touchdown, this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards, with three interceptions and a dozen field goals. Nothing on a home console was even close to its league. And even today, in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo, Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters, the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations.It's difficult to call any game \"perfect.\" No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes.Add to all that three difficulty levels, cheats that must be unlocked with speed, precision and overall know-how, hidden stages and hidden characters. Not only do you have a legendary FPS, you've also found nearly limitless replay value. Goldeneye is more than just a very good game, it's the stuff legends are made of. It's a game you'll want to play with your grandkids years from now.Hands down, the most attractive part about Bond's N64 debut, even today, is its controls. The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007's repertoire, as every button is in precisely the right place for its function. It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7, Bond's revolver of choice. The \"Z\" button is a perfect trigger, and if you've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire. Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand, as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle. No control system has ever felt so immersive, so right. After the first level, you hardly recognize the controller is there, it's already become such an extension of your own body. I can't sing any higher a praise than that.If you've seen the feature film of the same name, you'll notice some eerie similarities. Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption.Finally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such.In short, Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64, even today. There's a charm about it that can't be described, a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay. It's got the look and feel of a legend, and that's exactly the word I'd use to describe it. While there are certainly flaws, this is a game you'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years, when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2002"}

One that I could start playing right out of the box without reading a 100 page manual like many PC games in this genre.What did I find?  A highly addicting game in the form of Paper Mario.  I'll admit this is my 1st (yes, 1st) ever Mario game and so far I really enjoy it.  The most noticeable gimmick for this game is its unique take on teh graffics.  You see, Mario, his pals and his enemies all look like construction paper 2D figures and place them in a very rich and colored 3D environment.  You never get tired of viewing this game from this perspective, and in my travels around the mythical land in which the game takes place, there are many locals to visit.  I've heard the game is a 325MB cartridge, which I can believe after just viewing a portion of the game.The Interface is done nicely and many of the controls are self explanatory.  What the manual doesn't cover is easily explained on-screen in (for lack of a better term) some tutorials explaining new button features.  Some 'actions' are highly depended on your reflexes so certain moves may be hard for those with slow reflexes.  There is also a save feature throughout the game which helps the player as are many power-ups and hidden items of Mario lore.Okay, the story is a tad cliche.  Bowser is back and kidnapped Princess Peach along with the Star Rod.  Your job as Mario is to explore the land, level by level, thus opening new chapters in this unfolding story until you are strong enough to face Bowser.  However, this is my biggest beef with the game....the story is a little too in depth, too long and too cute.  When you first turn on teh gaem, you lieterally have to spend 15-20 minutes going through a back-story that sets up the game itself.  The cutscenes between chapters are nice too look at, but can get tedious in all this cute banter between NPC's.  I found myself just hitting the 'A' button to get past the contstant dialouge that serves no purpose other than drive the story on.  Oh, and when any character talks, get used to a constant 'chirping' noise from them.  Yes, all the characters have the same voice and it is just an annoying chirp.The puzzles so far are pretty easy, perhaps they will get harder further into the game....I hope so anyway.  But the turn based battles are strategy driven.  Yes, you need to know what moves and in what order you should perform them as to save stamina, Flower Points and Hit Points.  And again, reflexes help.  It is the difference here that you score extra damage against opponents, or defend succesfully.The stats screen is very informative.  Here is the heart of your character.  From here you can see all the badges Mario wears (badges are like special items that do different things...pay attention to them, for different combinations make for interesting side effects), his health, points to the next level, coins earned, star points earned, members in your party (yup, you'll meet characters who will join your party...and they have special abilities too that enhance what Mario does in battles), and more.There is a bit of good natured humor in the game too.  some refernces may be over the head of some children, but no harm done if they don't get the inside joke.All in all, a very fun game in the RPG genre without all the bllod and gore of it's PC counterparts.  A good starting point for younger kids, but adults alike.  I'm 30 years old, and my whole afternoon was sucked up by this last weekend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2001"}

In theory.In reality, the game was a mess. There were a thousand little problems that added up to one big one: The game was simply not fun to play. Typically, when this happens, the development team is well aware of it, but what are you supposed to do with a fundamentally flawed video game? Money has already been poured into it, probably a lot more than was intended, and it boils down to either canning the whole project and cutting your losses, or publishing a horrible game to little fanfare and hoping people buy it anyway. It's a lot like movies, actually, except with movies they never dispose of the bad ones.Incredibly, neither route was taken with Crimson Skies. The game was scrapped, but it was then rebuilt, from the ground up, with a radically different premise. The entire project was overhauled, an extra couple of years were tacked onto the development time, and the game that should not have been came out anyway.Thank God, because it's absolutely fantastic.Right off the bat, the game just drips with quality. Plane controls are spot-on, the voicework is great, the story (a self-described \"action movie plot\") is lighthearted and campy in an \"Army of Darkness\" kind of way, and the whole thing is just a blast.For a setting, the player is thrust into an alternate 1930's world, where the U.S. has become several different countries and roadways have been destroyed. The only way to get around the big land ocean is by air, and that's where we begin...I won't ruin the actual occurences of the plot, but there's enough PG-13ish humor to keep adults entertained (\"I hope you don't mind if I leave my socks on!\") without killing the mood of the game.When you get to the meat of the game, which is the flying, the new design standpoint comes across. Rather than approach a genuine flight model, the game goes in the opposite direction and completely ignores most basic laws of physics. While it's a little weird at first to be able to ignore gravity for the most part (you can't fly straight up for very long, but that's about it), it actually flavors the game with a familiar arcadey-space-sim feel. The dogfights will feel right at home to \"Privateer\" and \"Freelancer\" vets (sans the Newtonian drift physics) and \"Wing Commander\" fans will probably be howling with joy the moment they figure out how things are going to work in the game.This inattention to reality is what frees the game up, and it's my personal guess that this is what the game was missing the first time around. A game like this could have gone wrong in all sorts of directons, and the fact that it feels as carefree as it does is a testement to the tenacity of the Fasa development team.Finally, you have the single and the multiplayer; I recommend going through the single player mode on HARD to prepare for online combat. Not only is the single player a hoot, but it teaches a lot of the skills that will very quickly be put to the test in the online arena.So, for everyone who's been looking for the \"it\" game for Xbox Live, this is it. For everyone who ever liked space flight games, this is it. For everyone who's a fan of well-done action games, this is it. In fact, got an Xbox?This is it.UPDATE 11/25/03: Alright, after having spent several weeks taking to the multiplayer skies, I figured I should re-visit this review with a much more prominent assertion that not only is the multiplayer fantastic, it's the lifeblood of the game. The single player, while great fun and an excellent game in it's own right, doesn't give you a whole lot of reason to return to it once you're finished.The multiplayer, however, is a whole different ball of wax, and much like a PC game, it keeps the game fresh well beyond it's single-player lifespan.As of this writing, there's only a handful of maps and the game is missing some of the better features found in other games (like keeping track of your total kills, deaths, time online, plane useage, etc.) But, it all becomes moot once you get out there and the bullets start flying. It's a rush, and because of the beautiful controls, it's a quick process to get accustomed to it. The planes are balanced very well (I recommend the Doppleganger if you're a good shot) and even when you're outmatched, you're having a blast because the game sticks you right back in the action.If you were on the fence about this game, don't be. The scraps you'll get into are some of the most exciting and fun fights to ever go across a broadband connection, and the promise of downloads in the near future just sweetens the deal.In short, it's the best thing out there right now.My online tag is \"DeusJester\" and I'll see you over the skies of Chicago.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2003"}

He gave up after trying it once lol, but he's not really into video games. Rocksmith is pretty fun but nothing like Guitar Hero or Rock Band. You need an electric guitar to play along with the songs. The only downside is you're not going to learn how to read sheet music by playing this since they don't give real names for notes or chords. They show them as colors like red, green, blue, etc. It's also not as easy to play as it looks since you have to be able to move your fingers on the fly and know exactly where to place them. If you're not used to playing guitar you will be too slow and mess up often.I didn't like the music selection at all and I HATED the loading screens and tuning screens. There is a tuning screen before every song...was it really necessary? It's difficult to find exactly what you want to play or do, whether it's a certain song, tutorial, or practice session. They designed the game so it's basically streamlined in the order they want you to play it. You can't really skip ahead or backtrack easily without a decent menu.If they had more mainstream songs I would enjoy Rocksmith, but overall I would say this game is for the people who already know how to play some guitar or are really dedicated to learning.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"Christopher R","summary":"Who buys Battlefield for single player?","reviewText":"Battlefield 2:  Mission Complete was one of my favorite online multiplayer games when it came out for the Xbox 360.  The well designed maps, vehicles, and weapons kits made it a game that was more than your run of the mill run-around-like-an-idiot-deathmatch first person shooter.  Battlefield:  Bad Company takes that one step further.Kits:Each weapons kit suits a different style of play.  They all also play a vital role on each map.  With games like CoD4, the kits don't really serve as much of a function as the gameplay is still your standard deathmatch type.  (I tried the other gameplay, but the learning curve is steep.  In my experience, only \"l33t\" gamers venture outside of the team deathmatch servers.)  With the added feature of the destructibility of the BF: BC maps, the kit selection is even more important.  You can create your own paths to the gold crates and eliminate your enemy's opportunity for cover.Vehicles:This is one area that sets BF: BC apart from its competitors.  The addition of vehicles ads an element of strategy to the gameplay simply not present in CoD4.  There are many vehicle types in this game:  tanks, armored transport vehicles, artillery pieces, and helicopters.  Each provides a team, attack or defense, with a respectable force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.  Unless you know how to respond to each threat, your team will be overwhelmed.  Conversely, if you are operating one of these vehicles and do not know how to respond to enemy countermeasures, you will find yourself jumping into tanks simply to die before you make it to the enemy's base.Maps:For the most part, they are small.  They are small maps designed to create small, fast, urban warfare environments.  Even the maps that have a lot of space, combat is bottlenecked into villages where the crates are contained.  As an attacker or defender, the maps provide predictable locations for the majority of the combat.  The addition of destructible environments allows for some deviation and an element of the unpredictable.Negative aspects:The only negative that I've experienced are lag issues with the servers.  Twice I've had >450 scores with some time left in the game just to have the server lock up on me and force me to restart my PS3.  After those two occasions, though, I've been able to identify that I'm on a server with lag issues and log out for another one before having the system lock up on me.  If you're on one map and having lag issues, Ascension for example, just leave that game and select a game on Over and Out.  Usually it takes just one switch for me to find a server that is free of lag.Voice chat is a concern.  I've frequently found myself on teams filled with new players making juvenile mistakes.  All it would take to fix those mistakes is the ability to communicate with my teammates.  Sadly, I don't have a bluetooth headset and don't plan on buying one.  Even those with the headsets have complaints that they are unable to communicate.Overall:I'd say that this game is far better than the competitors currently found in the genre.  For the PS3 everything else is centered around typical deathmatch play.  Battlefield provides a more realistic first person shooter experience, and that in my opinion makes it more fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2008"}

Last but not least the Zombies is also a blast.  My friends and I love playing zombies together.  My only complaint is the plethora of immature douche bags the play on Live and ruin the online experience at times.  Usually a quick tap of the X button will eliminate them.

The game opens with Mason tied to a medical chair, surrounded with monitors with a non-descriptive disembodied voice asking him questions.  At the same time Mason keeps hearing and seeing a list of numbers.  It's unclear until about halfway through the game whether Mason has been captured and is being interrogated by an unknown enemy or if he is being questioned by a friendly force trying to extract life-saving data from him.  The game progresses through a series of flashbacks that show what Mason has been through and how he came to be in the chair he is in.  The flashbacks take the gamer from Cuba and the Bay of Pigs to Vietnam to a frozen wasteland near Russia and to beneath the ocean. The climax of the game leads up a climatic battle that loosely ties to actual history.The overall graphics in the game are spectacular.  There are many times that you look around and get the impression that you are playing a movie and not a video game.  At certain points in the game, the images are extremely lifelike.  The voice acting is strong and the music does an excellent job of accompanying what is happening during the story.I usually don't play multi-player levels, but BLACK OPS has a special multi-player/co-op mode where you can fight a zombie horde.  The \"Zombies\" mode is exciting and addictive.  I just wish there was an end point somewhere; the zombie hordes never stop invading.With that said, CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS is a disappointment.  The overall storyline is short and the \"reveal\" at the end is disappointing.  I mean, do we really need another Manchurian Candidate scenario?The way the game operates is frustrating, too.  BLACK OPS has been marketed as though it offers a more expansive and innovative gameplay, but that's just not the case.  You have to complete each objective a certain way, otherwise the game doesn't progress and you are killed.  The A.I. buddies that fight along your side don't do anything during actual combat and the blunt of the enemies attacks are always at your character.  If you try to hide and peak a shoulder or a toe out, you're dead in a few seconds.  There's no thinking outside of the box and if you try, you die.  During battle sequences, if you stay in one spot it doesn't matter how good of a shot you are or how many enemies you kill because they just keep coming and coming and coming.  The men at the Alamo had better odds than you do if you attempt to stay undercover and fight it out without advancing.Beyond that, I was also disappointed by how little you actually get to play in certain environments.  BLACK OPS was marketed as being a Cold War video game.  For example, despite the historical negative connotations of the actual historical war, the prospect of fighting in Vietnam as a secret covert agent is exciting.  You imagine all the possibilities of fighting and surviving in a jungle and think of a video-game version of Rambo. Instead, you are given a few sequences that have to be accomplished in a certain way and only about 25% of the game being spent fighting in Vietnam.  It's like playing a game in the American Civil War only to find out that for over half of the game you're neither going to be a Yank or Reb but will be playing a Native American in a completely different conflict between two warring tribes out in Montana.Overall, the graphics and voice acting are superb, but the storyline is weak and the gameplay is frustrating and non-innovative.  BLACK OPS looks fun from the outside, but when it sees the light of day, it's a disappointment.  The best thing about the game is the Zombie mode.  Kids will probably enjoy it, but those over 16 or anyone who is a more experienced gamer will probably be disappointed by it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Loving it, but a HUGE note of caution","reviewText":"Pokemon X and Y are a fantastic progression of the Pokemon series, and just like with 'Black' I & II and 'White' I & II, my daughter and I each chose one of the two games--this time around she's playing 'X' and I'm playing 'Y'.  It's amazing to see how much more we get in the terms of content, graphics, music, and of course general things to do.  However, before I say more I think you should be aware that there is a savegame bug in the out-of-the-box new product that could kill your savegame.  I'll post a link to an article about it in the comments, so update your game using your 3DS to get the fix before you get to Lumiose City!If you're new to Pokemon, the shortest way I could explain it is that you are a young person in a land where many different kinds of creatures exist in the wild called 'Pokemon'.  These creatures can be captured and cared for, and for many children this is a kind of rite of passage:  you learn how to capture and train Pokemon, travel the land on your own, and have adventures.  You use your Pokemon to have battles, against other trainers and against wild Pokemon.  If it sounds a bit cruel, keep in mind that this is a game for young people and as such Game Freak goes out of their way to make the story a positive lesson:  you have to take care of your Pokemon, they grow to like you, and no one ever dies--they just 'faint' and can be revived.  Some creatures can 'evolve' into different forms, and with X and Y we now get 'Mega-Evolution' that adds to our options and makes the possibilities even more diverse.If you're contemplating buying a Pok&eacute;mon game for a child in your family, there is educational value to be had here:  I'm amazed at the huge and creative variety of creatures, and my daughter has coached me on strategies:  type matching and analysis are important skills that require memorization, reasoning, and a bit of basic math.  You have to manage money to buy things and plan your inventory before taking a trip out of town.  And sometimes your character is asked questions to make them think.Pokemon X and Y are the latest entries in the series, and they take the new ground that was broken in Pokemon Black and Pokemon White (both of which had sequels, I & II) several steps further.  Perhaps the biggest change in X and Y is that you interact closely with your Pokemon:- play with them:  there are fun minigames that you play together- feed them:  you get \"Pokemon puffs\" that look like little pastries that you can hand-feed them using the stylus- interact with them:  petting them makes them happy, and when they're in a particularly good mood they'll play a game with you in which you get to make faces with them:  the 3DS camera will show your Pokemon your smiling, winking, or making a 'kissyface'.  Your Pokemon delight in your antics.- train them:  you can play other minigames that boost their stats, allowing you to really bump up their skills!  Have a Pokemon that's slow?  Do lots of Speed training and they'll get faster.  It's been huge amounts of fun watching my favorite Pokemon's stats raise and they really do perform better in battles.All of this revolves around a central story line, with good guys and bad guys, and the difference between X and Y seems to be that the storyline in 'Y' appears to go into a little bit darker territory than 'X', though both have the same overall story.  You are encouraged to use the wireless aspects of 3DS to trade, battle, and 'see' each other's Pokemon when you're with someone else who is playing X or Y.  You also get \"O-Powers\", which can be used to bump up stats as well.  And early on in the game you have a chance to choose one of the three first-gen 'Starter' Pokemon and add them to your party, which is a really nice nod to the earlier games.There is a lot more to X and Y in that your character can now change clothes and mix and match different outfits.  You can buy clothes in various boutiques throughout the land, and my daughter loves coming up with her own fashion ideas.  Your character can shoot 'promo videos' of themselves, though this bit is kind of weird and a bit lame, like the 'movies' that you could make in Pokemon Black and Pokemon White...not very clear how it works, not sure exactly what the purpose is.There are huge benefits this time around too:  most of the game is animated, and it all has a very nice cel-shaded look (think Sly Cooper or recent Zelda games).  Camera angles are fairly dynamic, especially during battles, when the camera pans around or does split-screen effects, etc.  Battle is a lot more animated, with more visual effects.  The music sounds really great, as if it's been orchestrated this time around.  The region you are in resembles a European village, complete with a lot of French-sounding names and places.  As a very long-time player of JRPGs, I really didn't mind the look of the prior games at all--but I really LOVE the new look & feel of Pokemon X & Y!  But the biggest boosts to the gameplay are:- Experience Share isn't specific to one Pokemon:  it's in your pocket and causes bonus XP to be shared with every member of your party- It used to be that if you captured a Pokemon, no experience was handed out for the battle:  now, you still get XP.- It also used to be that if a Pokemon fainted during a battle and wasn't revived before the battle was over, they didn't get XP.  They do now!  I even had a Pokemon faint and level up while fainted.  This was a pleasant surprise that makes level-grinding easier to do.If you're new to the Pokemon games and this is your first one, X and Y are a great place to begin--you'll be a bit spoiled!  If you're a fan of the original games, picture this as another step forward, with a whole new look.  I've really enjoyed the additions and changes, as most of them seem aimed at making the entire experience of a Pokemon game more enjoyable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2013"}
