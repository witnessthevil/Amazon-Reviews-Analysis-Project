{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Bart Motes","summary":"Pirates versus ninjas! Wait...","reviewText":"I've always been a skeptic of this series. I played the first game and was immediately put off by the ham-handed use of the &#34;ancestor's memory&#34; gimmick. (I also hated the sequences with Fred Savage in The Princess Bride when I was a kid, so I have a history.) It's a video game! We don't need to have a preposterous faux science explanation of why we are running around in ancient times stabbing people. Just say, hey, you're an assassin in ancient times who ran around stabbing people while hiding in the shadows. Got it? Ok, great, here's your controller. Ditto here. I'm prepared to pretend that I'm a pirate. I don't need to pretend I'm a dude in a simulation experiencing the memories of a pirate. It's all too meta. (Spoiler alert: I got over this and you probably will too.)I also found the stealth dynamics and controls to be a bit lunky in the first game after playing games like Splinter Cell and Batman Arkham Asylum/City where they are so well done.On the other hand, I LOVE pirates. I am a fan of college football coach Mike Leach, I have dabbled in Pastafarianism, and my xbox live gamer tag is a variation of Black Bart.So I was prepared to either love or hate this game. Verdict: I may not love it, but I like it a lot.The ancestor memory gimmick is less hamfisted and more useful in Assassin's Creed IV than in the early game I played and doesn't detract from enjoyment of the game. The controls are markedly improved. Sometimes when you are climbing it is annoying and I've mistakenly leaped to my death a few times, but overall, its smooth as butter.The voice acting is pretty good once you forgive the accents and the graphics are mostly really good. I've been playing games on Xbox One, but played this on 360 and while there is a bit of a drop off, it isn't jarring. The storyline is acceptable and even interesting from time to time, but nothing on the level of say Mass Effect or the Witcher. That said, set pieces are well done.Multiplayer I haven't really messed with, but I appreciated the tongue in cheek intro. More breaking of the fourth wall, please!Things sometimes get a little tedious or feel repetitive, but overall, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag turned this skeptic into a believer.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"DeadPlacebo","summary":"Optimistic About Future of Series","reviewText":"With every shooter and sports franchise having an annual release, it's a nice break to remember our third annual treat: a new Assassin's Creed game.  With each new AC game jumping forward in time, it seemed only fitting that after last year's Revolutionary War game that we would have maybe a Civil War AC game.  Ubisoft had other plans, however.  This game goes back to the beginning of the 1700s to a time where pirates ruled the Caribbean.  Some see this as arriving to the pirate bandwagon a little late...but I like that because the pirate thing was really big from 2005-2009.  Now that it's kind of faded a little, they can focus on making a great game without having to placate to any Disney fanboys.  And so Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was born.You start off the game as a slave who chases down an assassin, kills him, takes his gear and become an assassin yourself.  Along the way you get to explore parts of the Caribbean as historically accurate as they can be along with meeting real life pirates like Calico Jack (Jack Sparrow's inspiration) Blackbeard and a few others.  The game has a great balance between naval ship battles and exploration to on land classic AC style of jumping rooftop to rooftop and stabbing from behind.  The only part of this game that is stupid is when you're in \"reality\".  That part is almost a joke but fortunately it's not that much of the gameplay.The first thing I noticed when playing Black Flag were the graphics.  Being in the Caribbean, you can count on vibrate blues and AssCreed 3greens.  For being a 360 game (knowing the next gen will be way better) this impressed me.  It makes me all the more excited to play it on PS4.  Next, the fluidity of the combat is just as great as it was last year with a little more freedom in running rooftop to rooftop.  The storyline is also something that is fun.  Who doesn't love hijacking huge pirate ships and sailing into the deep blue sea?The online has improved drastically.  Before, it was just a free for all.  You would hunt a target while being hunted yourself.  This year you are on a team of either the hunters or hunted (switching at half time).  This allows you to work as a team to find your enemy and hide from them or kill them in some of the most creative and fun ways to date.  I played this for four hours straight with my friend and had a blast every second of the way.All in all, Ubisoft delivered another home run with this year's Assassin's Creed game.  My only hope is that we will get a Civil War or World War AC game in the future","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

Weak game.","reviewText":"This was a shock to me.  For one thing, this game was raved all across the internet.  For another thing, I'm familiar with the series (as far back as the first three NES games, to the SNES one, and Symphony of the Night), so I thought this would like those.  Well... the gameplay mechanics are here, it seems, but everything else...Lets figure this out piece by piece.  First, the graphics were okay.  Even though they're dark, and even though they're a bit lacking in animation (only THREE frame to show the main character running??!), the style was okay, and it added to the environments.The sound was nice, and the music was great, but everything here just seemed like it could be done much better (the music sounds a bit MIDI-ish, but the melodies are good).The controls... here's where everything really goes down hill.  I'm no stranger to the Castlevania control scheme, having playing the first four games.  However, for reasons I cannot fathom, this game has by far the worst control setup of all of them (which says alot, because I've replayed the first three games recently, and they haven't aged that well).  First, controling your character is much like controling a big wooden stick.  While the same could be said for the first four games in the series, this game takes it to far worse extremes, especially when considering the enemies move so much better (in other words, they're attacks seem more suited to a game that has you moving your character as franticly as a Mega Man X or Mega Man Zero game).  Also, the option to have the whip spin by itself became rather annoying.  Unlike Castlevania 4, which allowed you to move the whip around by holding the attack button down, this one only makes it spin on it's own, which is somehow amazingly counter-productive.  Some of the abilities are nice (high jump, wall jump, etc...), but they don't alieviate this problem much, and actually require over-utilization in some areas (trust me, you would never survive the final battle without high jump).Now the gameplay.  I've played other games that used the \"Metroid-vania\" style (free exploration, found in Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow, as far as the ones I've played).  Somehow, this one takes that system and just makes you lost.  Seriously, this castle was not as fun to explore as all of the others.  The boss battles (mostly refering to the last 4) were super cheap, requiring me to over-use the DSS system to the most extreme, which was a far cry from the more \"down to earth\" battles from Castlevania 4 and Aria of Sorrow.  Much as I enjoy difficulty, I can't stand not being able to have a clear shot at a target with my whip due to the enemy being over-sized or too quick to dodge.This is by far one of my most hated Castlevania games.  If you even think about buying this game (since a lot of other people liked it), I recommend you find a way to rent it first.  Otherwise, you may get yourself into a snag like I did.  Lucky for me, this was only $15 at K-Mart, which is about as low as GBA games get.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

Graphically, everything has been converted to HD very nicely.  I never felt like I was playing outdated games based on the visuals.I did, however, feel like the games were outdated in terms of content.  Dodge an enemy attack and awkwardly counter before he swings again.  In the first game Sly has to shimmy to get across wires despite being a raccoon!  The platforming in these games is consistently awkward and imprecise.  At one stretch they took to having you push the circle button to make Sly automatically land on the proper jump points.  The whole thing is just clumsy, repetitive, and light years behind Ratchet & Clank (even the PS2 games).  The non-platforming stages include cliches like having to win a race and manning a turret gun to cover your ally as he tries to retrieve a key you need to advance.  They felt as if I had played them before and were not fun at all.I got less than half way through Sly 1, tried to get into Sly 2, but have now given up.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Still Competed As Format Changed","reviewText":"After the startling success of Nintendo's NES and Super SNES video game systems, they had a tentative agreement with Sony to introduce a disc-based console to the public.  When the deal fell through, however, Sony decided to create the Playstation while Nintendo stuck with cartridges for one more go-round.  The \"battle\" proved to be roughly a draw if you can remember back to the actual period and not just remember the Playstation hype.Back then, the console wars were all about two things: graphics and games.  Unlike today, where the graphics are so good that gameplay is brought into greater scrutiny, it seemed as if every game provided some new advance (or backpedal) in those two crucial categories.  Here is how the N64 rates:Graphics: Clearly, the Playstation seems to have had the advantage in this category due to the larger memory space of a CD-Rom than a cartridge.  However, I would also challenge you to go back and play that original PS and tell me it doesn't look a little, well, goofy.  It was almost as if Sony had this great new technology but weren't really sure how to utilize yet, packing their games full of crazy motion, wild colors, and fast-paced action sequences.  The N64 took a different approach.  The graphics were a bit blocky, but not nearly as \"over-the-top\" as Sony's.  Games like Mario, Zelda, Goldeneye, and Perfect Dark didn't have the sharp clarity of characters, but they looked much more \"grounded\", or realistic.  It just comes down to what looked better to you.Games: This is where the N64 had a huge advantage over the Playstation.  Mario '64, Mario Kart, both Zelda games, Goldeneye, and a few other \"also mentions\" (DK, Perfect Dark, etc.) all had huge fan bases that Sony just could not satiate.  The console wars hadn't quite devolved into \"who has the best first-person shooter\" yet, so gamers were still interested in adventure and racing contests.  Whereas Nintendo had all those classics, Sony's \"hero\" was Crash Bandicoot.  Yep.Thus, although the N64 might take a lot of flak these days, I just wanted to set the record straight that, in its day, it was still a quality system that competed tooth-and-nail with the original Playstation due to its grounded graphics and franchise games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2010"}

Unfortunantly, I own an XBOX and the game by Vivendi is in my opinion, very bad...  So, when I found out that the fun version, by EA Sports was coming the XBOX, I was overjoyed.  Here's a sort of preview and some facts.  Well, here goes:1. This game will be released On January 1st on the XBOX and the Gamecube.  I can't wait, can u?2. This game has the story from both the first movie and the second.  First u play through the first movie, the Fellowship of the Ring, then u play through the 2nd movie, The Two Towers.  Both are fantastic movies, have a ton of action and fighting, and are both fun-filled and have a great story.3. The XBOX version will have updated graphics from the PS2 version.  The PS2 version was fantastic, this version is suppose to be even better!Basic depth on the game: A ring is found by a hobbit named Frodo Baggins.  It is a magical ring, and he later finds out, an evil ring.  So evil and so powerful, this ring could destroy the world if it falls into the wrong hands.  Evil in the world has heard of the ring, knows where it is, and is trying to get it, led by Sauron, the one who created the ring.  Now Frodo, with the help of 8 other powerful men, elves, and hobbits, must find a way to destroy it before it's too late.  So you will play through the first two movies, trying to destroy the ring of power using any force neccesary.You will battle your way through Orcs, Trolls, soldiers, black riders, magic, horrible beasts, and armies larger than you can imagine.  But at your hand, you have magic, sword, bow and arrow, and the will to do good.  You must destroy the ring of power, and save the world from ultimate destruction:In the game, you can play as 3 characters: 1. Legolas, an elf with an incredible bow and arrow, which you will use to fight your way through obstacles unimagineable.  2. Gimli: A small dwarf with an axe that can cut through any orc hide.  With a brave heart, stout persounality, and fighting skills that rival some of the greatest warriors ever to be found, Gimli is worthy of being called a good soldier.  The last character you can control is Aragorn (known as Strider), a powerful man with incredible fighting skills.  He has a sword and a bow and arrow at his disposal, and is perhaps the deadliest fighter of them all.  With these characters, you must stop evil in their tracks, and help Frod complete an un-imaganible task.  Destroying the ring of power, the one ring to rule them all.Final Comments: I was a bit dissapointed that you couldn't control Gandalf (with his magical powers as he is a wizard).  And perhaps even Frodo, as he is the main character in both the movie and the book.  But overall, the selection of characters was good, and should be enjoyable.I hope this helped, and once again, this is a preview.  I've played the Two Towers on the PS2 and loved it.  All this above is facts.  However, I do expect this game will be nearly exactly the same as the PS2 version (with enhanced graphics), and that a classic is soon headed to the XBOX.  That's my preview, and I hope it helped.Thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2002"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Koala1356","summary":"Just what I wanted for my Xbox 360!","reviewText":"I've been waiting a long time for a really good, immersive, character driven, fantasy-themed RPG for my Xbox, and finally the wait is over with the release of Dragon Age: Origins from Bioware.  While it's true, as other reviewers have pointed out, that the game is not as visually stunning as other games of today, what DA:O lacks visually it more than makes up for in the terms of story.  Because that's exactly what this is: a story, with you as the main protagonist.  This is a game for those who like to stop, read, and think before reacting.  If you are the sort who prefers to rush into battle, sword swinging without thought at the nearest head, then this is probably not your cup of tea.That said, be prepared for a decent share of reading.  In typical Bioware fashion, you are the hero of the game, and it's entirely up to you how you want to play it, driving the story events forward through conversations with other characters.  What's nice here is that every conversation with an NPC is actually SPOKEN.  On the other hand, you'll be reading your own dialog choices in your head, since your character never actually says a word aloud.The choices you make have a direct impact on 'your' story, and late in the game, it becomes increasingly difficult to choose between doing what's right, and doing what will bring the most glory and cash rewards.  Dialog also impacts the way your companions react to you, including whether they stay with you, or leave your party for good.  All in all, your choices throughout determine one of several game endings, as well as the many different and branching paths you will take to get there.  Replay value is high, if you want to experience everything, and with a typical time investment of some 50-60 hours from beginning to end, it will likely take you a very long time to discover everything this game has to offer.One of the best tips I can give anyone who is reading this and interested in buying this game is to take time out, and read the two prequel novels first, #1Dragon Age: The Stolen Throneand #2The Calling (Dragon Age)respectively. Both these books were written by David Gaider, the game's writer, and will provide you with valuable insights into how the war-torn kingdom of Ferelden was shaped by its past and present heroes.  Believe me when I say that reading these two novels before you play the game will introduce you into the world with an emotional attachment that you would not have otherwise, making some of the big, highlighted moments of the game even more shocking and/or grand.One niggly point concerning Xbox Live: If you download any online content--be that pre-order items, items gained from playing the web browser DA: Journeys game, or any other downloaded content--you will need to be, and stay, connected to Xbox Live.  I lost my internet connection one night, and I could not load a saved game containing downloaded content (in particular, a pair of boots and a ring my character had) because the game could not connect to Xbox Live to verify those items.Overall, if you like long, immersive, RPG adventures full of rich characters and dark fantasy lore, and can overlook the last-gen visuals, then this game is most definitely for you.  Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Rocco","summary":"FANTA-freakin-TASTIC!!!

KOTOR is well scripted, has great plot twists and gives you the possibility of roaming both sides of the power in the best way any Star Wars game ever did. Forget Jedi Knights, if you liked that game, you will LOVE this game.Furthermore, KOTOR is the best thing that happened to the Star Wars franchise since \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" In my humble opinion, this game would have been a great movie and is BY FAR a better movie than the last two we have seen at the theatre.Graphics: 10 out of 10.Yo-hoo, go along in this awesome graphics bonanza. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully recreated in many of its aspects. Cities are wonderful to visit and explore, character skins and movements are close to perfection. Jedi powers are rendered in the best way ever, giving you the uttermost feeling of wielding the force in all its forms and ways.Sound: 10 out of 10.Compelling soundtrack is well blended into your actions, passing from mellow to upbeat themes as the action gets more frenetic. Sound FX are incredibly well done.GamePlay: 10 out of 10.Behold, this is an RPG. So it's not a first person shooter or a beat'em up. Combat has been a sort of an issue for fans of the latest Star Wars games (such as Academy). The Bioware Combat system is however the BEST I have ever seen on an RPG. You get all possibilities of deciding your tactics, but there still is the action flavour to what is going on.Other Cool Things:1)You get a bunch of NPCs (non playing characters) who will tag along, All have their own background and powers. Furthermore, you can talk to them whenever you want, ask suggestions, info or opinions. Plus, they will be actively part of the story and sometimes you will see them chat or discuss with each other. VERY REALISTIC.2) Character creation is well done, decently customizable. Plus, the game uses the basic rules of Dungeons & Dragons for attributes and power building, so any old time RPG fan will get in gear quite easily.3) One of the NPCs that will follow you is a psicotic war version of C3PO. It curses and hates everything, plus he considers you a \"meatbag.\" It's the funniest thing ever.4) You get to travel around the galaxy in a retro style Millennium Falcon callled the Ebon Hawk. The ship is so well done you will think you're in a movie.I'd go on, but there are WAY TOO MANY COOL THINGS TO THIS GAME.Bottom line:Folk, this game is Fanta-freakin-tastic.

It is almost as good as the original. But there are some glaring issues that prevent it from being better thanGod of War.As you know this game is epic. Epic with a capital \"E\". The problem is this: you go from running around on mile high \"steeds of time\" to a swamp. Not an epic swamp, just a swamp. From plummeting through the air wrestling Icarus to running through a cave (note: Typhon's cave is an epic cave, but I'm referring to the boring later paths). Epic is good, but it is not consistent. The bland stuff is jarring and stands out from the rest of the game.The game's puzzles are bad. Not bad difficult - bad totally unnecessary. Most are easy, for example get a block to put on a lever. The problem is that you go from a fast paced battle with a dozen monsters to a move the block puzzle. It totally breaks the flow of the game. Also the puzzles in this game are far greater in number and worse in content than the first game.The new weapons are unimpressive. \"Athena's\" blades are great, but they do seem a bit similar to the blades of Chaos. I love rage of the titans but quite similar to rage of the gods. Euryale's head is fun, but, hmmm... a head that turns things to stone? C'mon. Just call them Chaos, the god's, and Medusa's respectively and stop pretending that they are even remotely new. The barbarian hammer is cool, but the other weapons are really not useful.Also much of the story is good, but there are some big plot holes. One that was especially confusing is someone does something dramatic to you in the beginning, you do the same to Zeus (several times), and once to someone else with vastly different results each time.Now this is a positive review, but just to boil down the only real negative: When the game goes it is great, but stopping points like puzzles detract from the game. The great visuals should have been consistent and the old weapons could have been left intact, but those are minor issues.Having said that, this is still a game that you need to play. Those issues are minor compared to the positives. Also most of the game's combat hasn't really changed from the first game, so it still has the great combos with gruesome finishing moves.There are many great things about this game and some are so perfect that I need to mention them. First when you start the game you would select new game and the difficulty and seamlessly go from the title screen to the first cut scene. NO LOADING! If you have seen that title screen you may recognize it as the ending scene from GOW. In other words continuing from the first game the story does not miss a step. In fact all of the cut scenes are of an extremely high quality and for the most part are long on story, but relatively short in length. Also I must give respect to the voice talent. Linda Hunt's voice is back to narrate and is everywhere in the game. Michael Clark Duncan was memorable as Atlas and Harry Hamlin as Perseus was inspired casting.There were a number of situations that were supported by the epic nature of the game. For example early in the game you can see those \"Steeds of Time\" from a huge distance. Those horses are your destination and when you finally reach them you can't help feeling tiny against these huge creatures. Or near the end when Clotho trash talks you from a huge distance, then later you run right around her quite hefty build. It puts a dramatic perspective for your travels.I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoyedGod of War., but ultimately if I had to choose one over the other the first one was a bit better. You should absolutely play this game, but play the first one before 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Libertarian!","summary":"A Very Worthy Sequel","reviewText":"The somewhat shocking sequel to one of the truly great titles out there launched earlier this year and we will see how well it lives up to its namesake.The first issue was that the original didn't leave an opening for a sequel. At all. It had a very definite conclusion. So, 2K Marin had an ugly problem in even trying to start this game in the first place. And they shoehorn it as well as they can, but it is still clunky. It is illogical for a character who was, apparently, every inch as important as Ryan to suddenly appear out of nowhere in a city that had basically failed...deep in the ocean...in the middle of nowhere. Him \"silencing\" her is absurd since he seemed spectacularly incapable of doing so previously. He couldn't silence Fontaine...but Lamb? Yeah, he shut her up. Sure.Dr Lamb also doesn't seem remotely real. Ryan, for his faults, came across as a true believer who failed. Lamb is just a stock villain who doesn't ring true. I get that she's the polar opposite of Ryan, but her motivation is just not really believable. But the games strength is in delving into the relationship between the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. You are Delta, one of the original Big Daddies. In the first title, they have a bizarre relationship, but here they flesh out the key question of WHY Big Daddies are so protective of these girls. The reason they give works so bravo to them.The game definitely hits the action button much harder than the original. The original used atmosphere to generate tension. Since Rapture is now familiar territory, this title used Lambs hold over the Splicers as the main impetus for the action. You won't sit there and dread the next Splicer you see since you will see lots of them...constantly. There aren't many new enemy types, but without a huge influx of people, there wouldn't be. The two main new enemies, Big Sisters and Brute Splicers, are worthy adversaries. Fortunately, combat is so much easier this time. Dual wielding guns and plasmids makes a big difference. Sadly, melee is a joke as your drill compares to the original wrench. For a Big Daddy, you aren't the beast you'd expect. You have the choice of harvesting or killing Little Sisters, but now, you not only have to kill their Big Daddy, you must protect them from large onslaughts of enemies as they drain ADAM from certain corpses. This allows defensive strategy to be used here and the arsenal of defensive weaponry you have is impressive. the plasmids level up really well now, but you will end up relying on some heavily. As cool as a powered up Insect Swarm was...I still used the ice plasmid constantly. And they fixed up the irritating research camera, making it a video camera, allowing you to fight an enemy while researching.I may seem awfully critical here, but this is an outstanding title. The game is terrific. Not as good as the original, but a game that cannot be ignored easily. The multiplayer is shockingly fun and they avoided an inane final Big Boss fight that killed the vibe of the game. They left no loose threads for a sequel, but I doubt that slows them down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

A cable then plugs into the PS3's USB port. This is the only way to get the save games from your PS2 into your PS3 so you can then use them with your PS2 games.Almost every PS3 owner I have spoken with owns a PS2 and many PS2 games. They intend to keep playing those PS2 games on the PS3. This is especially true with epic PS2 games like Final Fantasy XII. There's no reason to start again from scratch! The memory card adaptor is rather cheap, and saves you weeks if not months of play time.The act of moving save games is really very easy. Simply put your PS2 memory card into the small unit. On the PS3 console, select the card. It asks you to give a name to the \"storage area\" on your PS3's hard drive. For my 8 memory cards, I just named those storage areas CARD1 - CARD8, so that they matched up with the cards. Then you hit a button, and wait about 2 minutes while the files are moved.Once they're on your PS3's hard drive, you're all set! You can view the save games, delete the ones you don't want any more, and use them to play with.Definitely a must-have for a PS3 owner who has any PS2 memory cards lying around - or who has friends who might visit with PS2 games and cards. Sure, the PS3 games are great - but there are a TON of PS2 games out there that are a lot of fun, too. This little device lets you take advantage of all that time you've already invested in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Is It Worth It?","reviewText":"I am rarely the kind of gamer who thinks a franchise has to stick its roots.  Far from it, actually.  Look at how departing from the norm birthed such great titles like \"Metroid Prime\", \"Resident Evil 4\", and \"Metal Gear Solid 3\".  However, this 2008 entry in the \"Prince of Persia\" franchise has too many issues to make me give it a must-buy recommendation.My issues are not story-related whatsoever.  I accept that this Prince is more of an American anti-hero in the vein of Han Solo than Persian royalty.  I accept that the art style is completely different from the 3D PoP titles before.  I accept that the game utilizes a more open-ended system where players can explore the different levels in whichever order they like.  The story and characters are not the problem here.  In fact, the characters are what I love best about this game.  There are only a handful of players to keep track of, but the dialogue in this game is beautiful and insightful.  The Prince and the mysterious Elika are polar opposites in terms of personality, but their quest to prevent the evil Ahriman from being released allows for brief exchanges between our two protagonists.  The Prince is a man who is used to having whatever he wants, without a care in the world.  His prowess with a sword and athletic abilities before this adventure were merely ego-enhancers; now they are necessary to survive.  Elika is a woman who is deeply saddened by what the Corruption has done to her lands.  Her powers to restore the Fertile Grounds are a cursed responsibility.  As for the plot, it's a minimal affair, but it keeps things interesting.  The final hour was a very powerful experience for me.  If there is a Hall of Fame for videogame endings, this 2008 \"Prince of Persia\" deserves a place among the most daring.The graphics are very good, especially when you get to see the vibrant colors when The Prince and Elika revive a once-Corrupted land.  The cutscenes aren't the most cinematic, but they're presented well enough to keep your attention.  The in-game animations are very fluid.  To quote GameTrailers, \"Prince of Persia\" makes scaling a ceiling almost feel possible.  The Prince moves with such grace, just as he did in the 2003-2005 Trilogy.  The sword combat is interesting, because The Prince assumes a more cautious stance, making skirmishes feel a bit more calculated.  Elika is no slouch in combat or platforming either.  In fact, she's a powerful ally...perhaps too powerful.  But regardless of how you feel about \"Prince of Persia\", it's hard to deny how good it looks.The sound is top-notch as well.  I've read some mixed feedback regarding Nolan North's performance as The Prince, and I'm honestly saddened by that.  I suppose it's fair to say that because I played through the \"Uncharted\" and \"Assassin's Creed\" series, I enjoyed North's interpretation quite a bit.  If I had played this in 2008, a handful of The Prince's one-liners would've made me a cringe a bit.  But what's so hard to acheieve in videogames is chemistry between a man and a woman, and \"Prince of Persia\" gets it right.  The back-and-forth conversations feel authentic, and by the memorable finale, feel like they meant something in the end.  And the music is truly phenomenal.  I don't think there are a lot of tracks, but I don't care.  There're a couple of tunes I can listen to over and over again.  (YouTube search \"A Fight of Light and Darkness\" & \"Healing Ground\" for great examples)....Now...after all of these positive remarks......Imagine how much it saddens me to be honest with myself, and to be fair to you.  But the truth is that I don't think this is a good game, because the game gets repetitive.  Just about all of your abilities are available at the outset, with the newly-acquired powers all feeling very similar.  The sword combat and platforming don't change.  You face bosses multiple times, with each battle becoming increasingly tedious.  Also, you're asked to re-explore levels once you've beaten them so that you can collect Light Seeds (think collecting-heavy 3D platformers from the 90s).  One strange choice involves Elika saving The Prince from death.  Basically if you miss a jump or die in battle, Elika will bring you back to try again immediately.  I don't mind this too much because it lets get right back into the action.  However, as a story concept, it's baffling.  If Elika can pull off these amazing magical feats, why does she need The Prince to help?I don't mind games that have a good story with weaker gameplay aspects.  All of the \"Metal Gear Solid\" games have unique gameplay options, yet are only 20% compared to the cutscenes.  \"L.A. Noire\" and \"Heavy Rain\" took out the challenge of gaming so that players could finish their stories without too much hassle.  The \"Portal\" games, if you think about it, have very low replayability because of their puzzle nature.However, \"Prince of Persia\" doesn't find the right balance between its story and gameplay.  You, the player, are tasked with playing the same levels twice, facing the same bosses at least four times, with almost all of the tools given to you from the beginning...and yet it's impossible to fail.  And at the same time, if you can endure these poor decisions --- or (to be fair) if you actually enjoy this game --- you will be treated to an adventure starring two characters who have more depth than most heroes.I so badly want to like this \"Prince of Persia\".  When I began to realize its repetitive structure, I still had hope.  I wanted to hear more of Elika's memories of her home that has been destroyed.  I wanted to hear more of The Prince's quips and self-centered logic.  I wanted to see these two face the dark Ahriman, and eradicate him from the land.  And once again, the ending was a most wonderful payoff for me.  But over the course of 8 hours or so...\"Prince of Persia\" just doesn't really change.  The levels change, but your skills don't grow or evolve.  I actually fell asleep a couple times playing this game.Is It Worth It?Let me put it this way.  I bought a used copy from GameStop.  I plowed through it in 3 days.  I took a couple of wonderful memories with me.  Thanks to a gracious 7-day return policy, I can now move onto something else.  I suggest you do the same.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Bakehorn","summary":"Criminal Origins one of the best launch titles","reviewText":"Monolith Software flexed their thriller muscle with this year's hit PC shooter, F.E.A.R. That game featured disturbing scenes, incredibly intelligent A.I., and beautiful graphics that simply blew away the PC crowd. Their newest game, Condemned: Criminal Origins, looked to do the same thing to gamers on the new Xbox 360. After playing through Condemned, I'm starting to think that Monolith has this shooter-thriller genre mastered. Condemned is a hell of a good game, and an extremely thrilling one to boot.You're thrown into the role of an FBI Agent sent into seedy, addict-infested environments in order to investigate the murders of a serial killer. After the events that take place during the first level, which I won't ruin for you, your investigation turns into an all-out manhunt for the killer (or killers) as well as a battle to uncover the mysterious abilities and secrets you possess. The story is very intense, and sometimes when you'd least expect it, your character will have a flashback or he'll black out and a dream sequence will give you a clue of what's going on. The ending is very abrubt, unfortunately, but I would be absolutely thrilled to see a sequel, and the ending hints towards a possibility of that.The gameplay is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a game. Let's do some roleplaying. Completely unarmed, you walk into a dark room that is dripping with grime and muck, and there is trash and debris scattered all over the floor. As you slowly step around, you hear a crash. You look around, and your heartbeat steadily increases as your flashlight does a minimal job of helping you see the different nooks and crannies of the room. The only way forward is the door across the room, but it's heavily shadowed and deep down inside, you know there's something waiting nearby to kill you. To protect yourself, you rip a pipe from a wall and proceed forward, quickly glancing around and checking your rear for ambushes. Your character's breathing gets harder and naturally your senses react, as your heartbeat continues to raise and you continue forward. You approach the door, and you feel that sense of security and accomplishment--but WHACK, you flinch as you're clubbed by an enraged drug addict that is madly swinging a wooden plank at you, all the while loudly screaming obscenities. That increased heartbeat of yours turns into a pounding, and alongside flinching your reaction is to swing that pipe as quickly as possible. You've been hit, but you eventually overcome and finish off your attacker, who was a mere swing away from killing you. Taking a second to breathe, it hits you--you're safe for now, but you only went through a single room in the many levels of Condemned: Criminal Origins. You open the door and in front of you is a whole new room and a whole new experience.That's how Condemned plays out. There is never a dull moment in the levels, and even when there aren't enemies trying to beat the hell out of you, you are completely unaware of what might be in the same room you're investigating. During some of the down-time, you do detective work and try to uncover different pieces of evidence that propel the story. You're given access to different tools, like a laser gun that detects chemicals and a blacklight that highlights biological leftovers. Unfortunately, the investigating is pretty straightforward, and unlike the combat, it isn't possible to be very creative with it. Still, it progresses the story, and serves as a nice breather from swinging at and blocking enemies. There isn't much else that fluctuates the gameplay experience, but it never got old for me.The fighting in Condemned is best described as being \"in your face\". That's what made me flinch so much when I played it--it feels like the angry inhabitants of Condemned are breathing down your neck the entire time they're around. Fighting them feels very real due to this, and landing a solid blow to an enemy results in it recoiling, recovering, and counterattacking or running away from you. Once they're ready to attack again, you'll have to block and counterattack to stay alive. It's unwise to underestimate even an unarmed enemy, as the intelligent A.I. will tell the opponent to rip a board off of the nearest wall and continue attacking if they lose their weapon or it breaks. With all of this melee, some gamers might wonder where the guns went. Every once in a while, the game will treat you and you'll find a pistol or shotgun laying around. You'll never find ammo in the game, and with every gun, you get what you see. This changes up the experience a little and allows you to pick off your enemies from farther away, but once you've used up the ammo, it's back to clubbing enemies to death.I've said that the environments in Condemned are dark and seedy, but I don't think words can truly capture the feeling that the graphics convey. Just as you don't know when to expect an enemy in a room, you'll rarely come across a room that doesn't have something to explore. The darkness of the game doesn't tarnish how great the graphics look, as the shiny, glossy effect makes everything look wet and grimy and the weapon models are nothing short of perfect. The flickering of light in some of the rooms makes everything much scarier. The graphical achievement that Condemned does best is creating an ambience that will scare you even when there's nothing going on. Visually, the only downfall is that the character models in cutscenes look blocky and the lip sync is a little off in some scenes. As you might expect by now, the music and sound effects make the game a lot scarier than anything else. It's the lack of music that sets the mood, and the intensity of the sound effects make the action feel even closer to you. When you're hit by an enemy and your character reacts, he doesn't just make a grunt noise or a yelp in pain--his agony is as perfectly recreated as the actual beating noise that came from being hit by the enemy's weapon. At the same time, landing a clear blow on an enemy sounds as gruesome as can be, and it intensifies the combat even more. I didn't get a chance to play this game in 5.1 Dolby Digital, but I'd say it would be one of the more thrilling games to play in surround sound.In the end, the slow pacing might turn off gamers looking for a straightforward shooter. The game isn't very long, either. Including all of the deaths and retries that I had during the game, I finished the adventure in about eleven hours. There aren't any other gameplay modes, so once you've finished the single-player game, you've experienced everything Condemned has to offer. Does this make it a bad game? No. Is it still worth buying? I'd say so, especially if you're a fan of this type of game. If you like to breathe heavily and feel your heart pound, this is definitely the game for you. The story will captivate you and the ending will have you excited for more. The unique gameplay, thrilling story, and disturbing graphics make Monolith's Condemned: Criminal Origins worth playing, and as an Xbox 360 launch title, it's one of the top five in my book.(NOTE: I also have this review posted on GameFreaks365.com, where I write reviews on a regular basis.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2005"}

Fable 2 was way better, so my expectations were pretty high for the third installment.  A lot of changes were made which seemed to take away from the sense of freedom that was so evident in the first and second games.  Mainly it was the switch to the \"sanctuary\" interface.  To change weapons, spells, clothes, to look at your map, you have to \"travel\" to the sanctuary.  Sure it's only a button press away and you're there, but still it created a sense of disconnect that only served to pull me out of the experience.  Interacting with the NPC's in the world and using expressions has also in my opinion been over-simplified.  Even your dog seems to be just along for the ride this time, serving no purpose other than to find treasure or dig spots.  Although I havent finished the game yet, I'm not sure I'm willing to continue with it.  I've just reached the point in the game where your character is crowned King of Albion and now the pace of the game seems to have fallen on it's face.  But I did press on and got to another battle sequence - which after all the tedious treasury building decision making was a nice change of pace, up until the point I fell thru the game world into the floor and was unable to get out.  After that I just cut it off.  I might give it a few days and go back and try again.  But from reading other reviews there's more decision making to come, one of which sounds like it's been a real deal-breaker for other players.  Not sure I'm looking forward to that, because I already don't like this game that much - I don't want to put it back on the shelf hating it, because it did have a few good moments.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2011"}

Such a fan, that my favorite movies are the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider movies. Both of them. I will overlook many flaws just because it's Tomb Raider. But this game really could be better.Your worst enemy in the game is the camera. By far. It is not at all uncommon for the camera to be unable to show you where you need to go. If you're on a ledge and there is a ledge behind you where you need to go, there is a good chance you will not be able to position the camera to show you where you need to go. So your only option is to make a blind leap of faith and hope you're not jumping to your death.The other problem with the game is you often have no idea where you're going or what you're doing. You'll just keep going and hope to God you're going the right way. The sonar is practically no help. And this is sad because in Tomb Raiders Legend and Anniversary, the levels were so well laid out that you always know where to go and what to do but it's still a challenge. Here, you're just frustrated.Now with the good. The graphics and music are absolutely beautiful. Lara's animations are also beautiful. I love the wall climbing and I love being able to scale up and down walls with your grappling hook. It's all very realistic. The story is also great along with the voice acting.So, if you can overlook the flaws, it's worth the purchase. But if you're not a Tomb Raider fan already, I doubt this will make you one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2008"}

If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Brian Nallick \"METALMANMN\"","summary":"One of the best cult titles ever.","reviewText":"I remember when this game came out and it got rave reviews from just about every critic out there.I just don't understand why this game didn't do better than it did.Maybe because a lot of people out there aren't familiar with Lovecraft's \"Ancient Ones\".Tragic.I'd put this game at the top of my all time favorite list any day.Yeah, the graphics aren't too hot by today's standards but when a game comes along that is this unique and actually takes chances, it's a game worth playing.The good?Everything.The story is top notch.You get to play as a variety of character each with different skills, weapons.You get three different meters.Health, magic, and my favorite......the sanity meter.Each character has different levels of health, magic and sanity.When your sanity meter starts to get drained, LOOK OUT.Your character starts going all wonky till you kill enough enemies to regain sanity.The bad?Nothing really.The graphics are pretty ugly even for a cube game but that very minor quip aside...I've played this game countless times and I'll play it many more.It's replayability is almost endless as right in the beginning you have to choose between three different paths (Gods).Incredible game.Replayable, gutsy and innovative.Highest recommendations.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"Excellent series","reviewText":"Minor spoilers ahead. I would only recommend reading my review if you've already played through the series.I've been a Mass Effect fan since the beginning. I had my preorder of ME 1 secured well before it came out in 2007. I knew from the first time I'd heard about this game that I'd love it - a wide open sci-fi RPG where your decisions would have consequences in the sequels? Yes please.I'm not sure how many hours of my life were lost to the first game, although I would scoff at anyone who heralds ME1 as some golden, shining light of a bygone era of gaming. The game is nothing less than a masterpiece, but it pales in comparison to its successors, thanks in large part to the bugs that'd allow you to get stuck inside the scenery, the sheer number of \"collect a whole ton of this!\" sidequests, the lack of marking quests in the systems they're in, the ridiculous amount of traveling in elevators and, of course, the Mako. It's no exaggeration at least 50%, maybe 75% of the game is driving around in the Mako on remote planets in vast expanses of nothing. Sometimes it's a red nothing. Sometimes it's a blue nothing, or a brown nothing. Sometimes it's hilly nothing, or mountainous nothing, but you get the idea. It's boring, and I cheered to the high heavens when I learned that ME2 would not have this awful mechanic. Overall, it played well and was a lot of fun, but those sidequests were a weak link. Another serious flaw is the fact that if you replay the game as a Shepard you previously beat the game with, Bioware did not reset her (yes, I am fully aware that Shepard can be male, too, but there's no point in saying he/she or his/her every time I refer to the protagonist) stats. Whatever you picked, she had, period. Bioware reset everyone else's stats, but not Shepard's, despite the fact that she's the most important character in the story.Story's the main consideration, however, and in that the game excelled, especially when confronted with the second-to-last major decision. I sat for a bit, wondering which I should choose, as one involves sacrificing a large portion of an army to save the Council, or let them die. The game beats it into your head that a Spectre has to be willing to sacrifice for the greater good, but humanity is already feared by the many other species, so is allowing them to take over by killing the Council the way to allay those fears? The game doesn't give you answers to these questions, and you have no way of knowing the full extent of the consequences of your actions at the time. You only know what your choices are at that moment, and the fallout may not be felt until Mass Effect 2, or in some cases, the choices have little to no bearing in Mass Effect 2 at all but have a significant impact in Mass Effect 3 - an example of this would be the Rachni Queen. Sure, you get a VERY BRIEF discussion with a messenger who relays a thank you from the queen if you spared her in Mass 2, but that's it. Nothing else. The decision to spare or kill her in the first game has a larger impact in the third game, however.One last thing on the first game - I do remember playing through Virmire and hoping that there'd be a way to save both Ashley and Kaiden. The first time I'd played through my character was a Renegade jerk, so I figured that the reason I'd have to pick one or the other was because I'd burned so many bridges that I was paying for that now. Of course, that didn't turn out to be the case - even killing Wrex doesn't save both your other crew members. It'd have had a bigger impact if I ended up being the reason I had to save one or the other. In the end, I understand why Bioware made the choice they made with Virmire, but it was still disappointing for that reason.ME2 proved to be a major step forward for the series. Gone were the Mako, the endless hours of exploring barren, empty planets, the elevators, plus, this time you could actually reset Shepard's stats! They also got rid of the original Normandy, and it's sad to see it blow up, but this was the right decision, as its successor, the SR2, is by far a superior ship. After playing through ME2 and ME3, I can't really feel the same about walking through the SR1 again - I just like the SR2 that much. We also got a larger and much more diverse crew. Mordin was quite a treat, especially when talking to him and you ask about his past as a stage performer. While I was sad to not see most of the old crew on the new Normandy, it makes sense from a story telling perspective - Bioware was telling us a new story with ME2. The ending sequence was amazing - this time, your choices very much matter; having the wrong companion do a given task means that someone dies. It's not hard to figure out who to use, however - the game gives VERY STRONG hints about who is right for the task at hand. There was a generous helping of DLC, including the extremely well done Shadow Broker DLC, the good Project Overlord, the okay Kasumi and Zaeed quests, and weaker Hammerhead and Arrival DLC packs. Given the impacts they have on ME3, I do recommend getting them all, but for a DLC first go 'round, I'd recommend saving the Shadow Broker for last. (Just don't wait until after you've finished the main game to do that quest, since benefits for completing the SB are ongoing throughout the game.) The end boss was...odd, but easy to get over. I've seen some people complain about the last mission (seems like there's always SOMETHING to gripe about.) Basically they're upset that it's not only possible, but fairly easy to keep everyone alive. First off, that's not even a legitimate complaint, so be quiet. Second of all, if you want someone killed off, go right ahead - it's extremely easy, easier than getting them all out alive, in fact, to set somebody up to die. If you want a character to get killed off like you're in your own little \"Choose your character and your character's death\" story, then just search for an ending walkthrough and find out how NOT to choose the right character - I guarantee you, you'll have more empty spaces in the Normandy going out than going you did going in. Your ME 3 experience will suffer for it, by the way, since that character, if alive, will add to the mission you see them in, but hey, YOUR LOSS. If you want to have the touching scene where one of your crew dies so the rest can live, then knock yourself out. Me, I'm keeping my crew alive.Then ME3 came out, and until the extended endings DLC was released on June 26th, 2012 I had to wonder what Bioware was thinking. Right out the gate there were so many easy-to-find (just play through the game NORMALLY!) bugs, including the oft-mentioned face glitch, some eye-bugging glitches, among others, which were thankfully patched. The Normandy....&lt;sighs> I don't know why but Bioware saw it fit to make the ship dark. Really, really, really dark. In ME2 you could actually see, but in this game, only the bare minimum was spared for lighting. And there's the whole War Asset/Effective Military Strength (EMS) thing... Bioware stated that it would be possible to get the best ending criteria through single player alone. Well, sorry guys, but I'm not seeing it. I'm a completionist, and I ALWAYS scanned every system, got every asset, and I would still be well under the 5000 EMS needed for the best ending unless I hopped onto XBox Live and improved my numbers that way. The multiplayer's fun, but I fail to understand why I should spend hours playing MP to get a better rating for my single player experience, simply because the bar is set so high that I can't hope to reach it on my own, despite playing through all 3 games with the mindset of seeing everything all of them have to offer. And then, of course, there's that ending. Oh, that ending was awful. There are some people who like to patrol Amazon and Youtube for the slightest HINT of criticism of that ending and then immediately get their NOVELS of \"Why the ending doesn't suck!\" - novels that they've spent hours, days, weeks, even months perfecting - copied and pasted in an attempt to drown out the many cries of justified indignation over what was the most disappointing, broken, meaningless ending in recent history to a series that was about making choices and seeing how those choices would affect the universe as a whole. Simply put, it did the opposite - THE EXACT OPPOSITE - of what an ending is supposed to do. An ending is supposed to resolve the conflict and provide closure, two goals that the stock ending failed to do. You may notice that I'm referring to the stock ending in the singular, and I am. \"Oh, but you're wrong!\" you might say. \"There are endings! Plural!\" you might say. No there aren't. There's one ending, and one ending only. The only thing that changes is which color explosions you see - everything else plays out exactly the same with the stock ending. Oh, and don't worry about your War Asset count, either - that makes no difference, either. Yep, whether you did a speed run or carefully got everything, the ending is exactly the same. For some reason, that annoying as hell narrative voice for the primary codices is still back. Want to shut him off? Well TOO BAD, because you can't! He's been annoying us for three games now. I can read - I don't need somebody narrating to me. And he narrates every primary codex. Every. Single. One.The extended endings DLC isn't perfect (especially since you have to replay the whole Citadel section all over again to see each ending, plus we still don't get to see what happens to Shepard after the \"Destroy\" option, arrrggghhhh!) but it's free (for now, anyway) and several orders of magnitude better than what came with the game. This time, no matter which of three different endings (yep, with an \"s\") you choose, that ending is a satisfying and complete ending. Each ending is also completely different. No matter which one you choose, there are very different consequences, both short and long term. Are any of the endings happy endings? Nope. But they are complete, satisfying endings, and everything is resolved. If you wondered why you see Joker at the end doing what he's doing, how your ground team got to be on the Normandy, how the other fleets will get back to their home systems, etc. you'll find that out with the extended endings DLC. Oh yeah, plus the fact that you get a heartfelt thanks from Bioware at the end for playing through the series, and not a \"Congrats on playing through the game. Now go out and buy more DLC!\" SLAP IN THE FACE is another thumbs up. They even added a fourth ending, although this one is arguably the weakest. It's different, but not as good as the other three. Bioware could've spent a little bit more time working on that ending, or just cut it out entirely. Wasn't really what the fans were looking for here. Believers in the Indoctrination Theory, beware, however - Bioware has made it perfectly clear that they never intended Shepherd's journey to go in this direction; not physically, not mentally, not spiritually, not psychologically or any other -ally you can think of - she did not get indoctrinated, not in Mass 1, not in Mass 2 or in Mass 3. Bioware has taken the clay pot you call the Indoctrination Theory and smashed it on a concrete floor, swept up the pieces, threw them into a landfill and covered them with concrete. You cannot reconcile the Indoctrination Theory with the extended endings in any way, shape or form. I initially had my doubts about the IT when I first heard it, and while it seemed compelling, I was not even remotely surprised that Bioware shot this to pieces. So as interesting and well thought out as it was, it's an incorrect theory, and anybody who tries to work the new endings into the IT would be reaching. And I mean REALLY reaching here. So if you're one of those people who wants to hang onto the Indoctrination Theory, then MAYBE you shouldn't download this, but I would strongly recommend the extended ending DLC for everyone else.So, thank you Bioware, for proving to us that you do have the artistic integrity we once thought you did by providing this game with a proper ending. Kinda wish you gave us this ending to begin with, but late is definitely better than never.In the end, the series is one of the strongest series in recent gaming history, and should be owned by any RPG fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"EpsilonX","summary":"Graphics: great.  Everything else: meh","reviewText":"First off, lemme say that i haven't completed this yet.  I'm at the very end though, one chapter left.Graphics: Graphics are great.  Like, really, they're nearly perfect.  I remember back when I saw the preview videos thinking \"the graphics wont be able to look THAT good\" but they're better.  Oh man. 10/10Sound: The music is great, as is the voice acting, but Vanille's voice sounds a bit phony.  There's only a few songs though that are repeated often.  The main theme/battle theme is starting to get on my nerves, but its a great piece. 9/10Gameplay: The battle system is solid, but it gets really tiring after a while. you can't actually control your character like in FF12, but you can only control one character instead of the whole party.  Plus, the entire map is one straight line except for chapter 11, which opens into a big area full of side quests that consist of only hunt quests.  There are also a lot of large monsters.  Good for grinding, but not much else.  5/10Plot: The plot is extremely mediocre.  Skip this if you don't want spoilers  It seems like the characters were randomly generated.  Some of them are rather annoying, and some of them are good, but none of them are all that memorable like past FF characters.  The entire plot revolves around a bunch of people who were unfortunate victims of circumstance trying to stop an old guy from destroying the world.  So the group of people run around trying to solve a quest that they have no idea what it is so that they turn into a crystal instead of into a zombie.  But the entire time the government is chasing them trying to kill them.  This doesn't sound all to bad, but its basically running through wastelands and forests, which isn't all that exciting.  (now, if they actually had you sneaking around and stuff, that'd be fun, but this is final fantasy)  They try to add all these deep parts, but most of the time they come off silly and annoying, and completely unnecessary.  The whole idea of the Eidolons isn't great either.  Overall, the plot is pretty weak and thin, which is unfortunate because since the gameplay is so shallow, the plot is all this game has.  5/10Overall: It's disappointing to see a game like this, where the graphics get all of the focus and everything else suffers.  It's a perfect representation of the current industry, where people are more concerned with the way something looks than just about anything else.  Plenty of games out there are incredibly fun, but because of the graphics not being perfect, people will think it sucks.  Being pretty doesn't save this game from being shallow in just about every aspect.  The combat, while nice, never really allows for much strategy and simply settles on making you figure out the right order to do things in in order to win.  The sound, while nice at times, never really changes.  The great battle music gets played to death.  The plot is bland and gives you little incentive to care.  There are far more enjoyable games out there, so skip this.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Sloopydrew","summary":"Best side-scroller since the SNES? YES!","reviewText":"Although the original Donkey Kong Country remains in my top three side-scrolling platformers ever made, I held off buying this game. I had been burned by the \"nostalgia bug\" one too many times. Platformers that sort of look and kind of play like those from the SNES/Genesis glory days. I wasn't going to be burned again by a semi-remake designed by fools who had no clue. Had my brother not given me this as an early Christmas gift, I would never have played it. I was that tired of this virus filed under \"nostalgia.\"But my brother did give me this game as an early Christmas gift, and, like Scrooge himself (not the scary looking Jim Carrey version) buying the largest turkey known to man, my heart melted. Why? Because Donkey Kong Country Returns IS a GENUINE sequel. It's not going for nostalgia (although nostalgia's inevitable for old-school gamers), it's going for a sequel that equals the first couple of games. Nostalgia's merely a side effect.This game, as they say, \"has it all.\" But this game never, for one second, feels like it was going through the motions to earn it all. It just feels like the next side-scrolling DK game. Does it live up to the first 2 Donkey Kong Country titles created by Rare? Oh yes! In a lot of ways, it's better. Donkey Kong Country Returns FINALLY takes 2-D platforming into the next generation.It earns its right to be a Donkey Kong Country game, rather than earning a fast buck by ripping off the Donkey Kong Country community, holding out their wallets. It earns the title of the next official DKC title. A 10-year-old could pick this one up and love it from beginning to end, without ever playing another DKC release. That can't be said for many of the nostalgia cash-ins that have been shoved down our throats since platformers made a comeback on handheld systems.I do have a few complaints. The ridiculous motion-control takes away some of the accuracy needed in a platformer. When you meet up with the shielded crabs, you'll know just how obnoxious this can be. DKCR absolutely should have been allowed to be played on a GameCube or Classic controller. It seemed, quite literally, designed for that purpose.Still, you do get used to the motion control and motion control has turned into a necessary evil of the Wii. Without it, would a new Donkey Kong Country been given to us? Especially one this magnificent? Doubtful. So you take the superb with the mildly annoying.DKCR's graphics suffer slightly from the Wii hardware, but, with 480p turned on, the game still manages to truly look beautiful. I have no problem stating that this is the best looking game on the Wii. I'd be surprised if anything manages to beat it, prior to the WiiHD being released. Is it at the level of a PS3 Killzone or a 360 Gears of War? Of course not. But does it do the job -- and then some? Absolutely! This game will not embarrass you visually. Period. It has a \"wow\" factor never before seen on the Wii. And that's coming from someone playing on a 65\" 1080p television screen.The biggest downfall of the game isn't its graphics, but its two-player mode. It's sort of a pain. But the earlier DKC didn't even provide 2-player support, so it's a nice bonus. Two-player has been much improved on DKCR when compared to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, so if you were happy with that, you'll be even happier with this. I'd still recommend single-player, though, if you're a serious gamer looking for hardcore platforming and scores worth bragging about.Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the best games of 2010. There just aren't many games on any console that are as fun as this one. It will have you smiling from beginning to end. It is an honorable successor to the first two Donkey Kong Country games and it absolutely demolishes Rare's final attempt at the franchise with their 3-D \"upgrade\" on the Nintendo 64. If you're a DKC fan, this is the game you've been waiting for!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2010"}

But they are all connected via the PlayStationNetwork, its a pretty nice feeling. Graphics are fantastic, blue-ray quality is still there and they even simplified the menu and general options. The controllers also seem to melt in my hands, they are by far my favorite out of all PS controllers; it also features a nice touch pad in the middle as well as a small speaker. At the moment this is only used in some games, while other games take advantage of the controllers lighting effects (Tomb Raider).

The games that are out for it now arent worth the upgrade but titles will get better later this year. Console has faster loading times, all games are in 1080p and you can stream vids. It still has a few kinks to work out. At times the console will just freeze up and i have to put it in sleep mode or at times unplug it. And at times the PS store doesnt load. The controller is comfy and you can charge it while you play. I just wish this console had more usb ports. It at least needs 4. Accessories easily take up these spaces. Also it needs a bigger hard drive. 500gb its probably enough to download every retail game from launch up until two months afterwards which isnt many. You dont actually get 500 of course. Thats a round off estimate. At least you can change out the hard drive though. I love the share button. So fun using it as a snap shot button for when people get crazy through streams.

And I appreciate what the makers of Asura's Wrath is trying to do.A simple summary for the game: The setting is old world gods mixed with Sci-Fi. The story is about a demigod cast away who vows to make things right his way. Gameplay is nothing like what we are used to. It is an action adventure with shooting elements and a large amount of violent melee. Asura does not have a health bar, but the player aims to fill the rage bar so as to perform a finishing move to proceed. A lot of QTE or PDE (player  dependent events) is required.It is not what everyone is used to. I hear comparisons with God of War a lot but besides the rage, nothing else is similar. The player does not have health bars and magic points. That is why most players get angry and make a bad review or comment. And players who do not like QTE would not like this at all.The game is simply for fun. It has a lot of anime style cutscenes in between. It is humorous.The only regret I have is that there is not enough gameplay and it is over too quickly in 6 - 8 hours.Discounting people who hate asian mythology, anime, QTE and playing something different, this game is made for the small percentage of gamers who would find this game fun. The majority who are used to major mainstream titles will find this very unappealing. So try the demo before buying. Chances are you may not like the game, because honestly, you are probably part of the majority.Nevertheless, this game is original, well-made and entertaining. Hence the 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"Fun Because Of Its Quirks","reviewText":"When it was released with the launch of the Nintendo Gamecube in 2001, \"Luigi's Mansion\" took both praise and criticism for being an a-typical \"launch game\" for the new system.  Both viewpoints are valid depending on what type of gamer you might be.Basically, this game puts you in control of the usually second-fiddle Luigi, who is searching for brother Mario in a haunted mansion full of Boos.  Armed with a ghost-sucking vacuum device, Luigi must suck up all the ghosts and get his fellow plumber out of the house of horrors.In terms of gameplay, this game gets old quickly.  Basically, you just go around sucking up ghosts and getting keys to rooms to...suck up more ghosts.  It's fun for awhile, but gets tedious after about the first 5-6 ghosts or so.The presentation, however, is what makes this game still fun to play even 10+ years after its inception.  The graphics are perfect for this type of game (cartoony yet clean), while the humor of many of the situations is pitch-perfect.  Because Luigi is such a quirky character in the Nintendo cannon, there isn't that \"Mario pressure\" and thus the game developers were just able to let things loose and have a little fun with this one.Overall, \"Luigi's Mansion\" is a fun game because of (not in spite of) its quirkiness.  Younger gamers will especially love this effort, as the gameplay will never feel stale for their skill set.  More seasoned gamers will just laugh at the presentation/atmosphere and take the goofiness all in stride.  I'd give it 3.5 stars to be exact, but it gets bumped up to four full stars here because it is just so innocent and fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2012"}

There is a reward system similar to God or War, where you will learn new more powerful attacks as you earn more points.2) There are also magic attacks. The magic attacks cause the entire screen to change color, and a spirit launches an attack on your opponents. It looks very cool when the spirit makes the entire screen change color.3) This is an exploring game. You can freely roam around each level.4) It has nice orchestral music.Two Bad points of Rygar:1) There is no double jump. You can only do a basic jump which makes it difficult to leap off platforms.2) There are very few enemies to fight.When you play this game for the very first time, the beginning stage seems a bit boring. But as you reach new levels, you'll see very beautiful environments. So bear through the first level, because the visual scenery gets much better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2005"}

In almost 20 years of playing games I never liked multiplayer because it was always mostly 12 year old kids cursing up a storm or people ruining the game by cheating.Last week I thought \"Well, we're in the 21st century, might as well get used to the idea of multiplayer\". I got this game two days ago and have already spend over 8 hours playing. I think I just might call in sick tomorrow as well.In my opinion, this is the best game to get you started in a multiplyer gaming. Unlike online FPSs, this diversifies the game a hundred fold by having so many different types of fighting - Air, Ground, Vehicle. The real fun begins when you start finding unusual ways to getting a kill and it introduces a whole new dimension to the game. Imagine being a lone soldier on foot, with nothing but a pistol and a grenade being chased by a Warhawk into a bunker. Warhawk goes into hover mode and tries to stick its guns into the doorway of the bunker. As he lines up - you toss a grenade at him. KABOOOM! You just took down a fighter plane with a HAND GRENADE!The crowd on the servers seems to be more on the adult side - I have found the people to be polite (One guy apologized twice for running me over accidentally with a tank). I think it has something to do with the fact that the price of PS3 keeps the younger gamers away. That won't last forever, so if you were previously put off by your past multiplayer experiences, this is the right game and the right time to get started.My only complaints are just like everyone elses: The server interface needs work, preferrably like the one R:FOM where you are placed in the game automatically based on your rank/skill level. Also, some people are using \"budget\" headsets, which sometimes generates so much noise that no one else can converse throughout the game. That by the way is not the game's fault.I think this game sets a new multiplayer standart, which is a good thing.

Sonic CD on the Playstation Network, iPhone, Android, and Xbox arcade (I think it's on XBLA) all had an option to switch the music between the Japanese and American version, but all you could have on Gems was the USA version.Sonic CD, I wrote a full review for the REAL Sonic CD, just click 1 Star and look for TDL.Sonic Fighters- 6/10A 3D fighting game that was so bad I enjoyed it. It was a port of some arcade game, so the controls didn't match up (The last time I checked, the Gamecube had no K button.). The game itself was VERY creepy. Tails made the scariest face ever when he won a match, Knuckles stole Amy's hammer and smashed her, and Eggman (who's obesity was extreme due to the poorly made 3D polygons) came and cloned Sonic.Sonic R- 2/10An interesting idea... but it cleary failed. It is another poor 3D pre-adventure Sonic game, with terrible controls that make Sonic 06's controls seem smooth by comparison. The problem with all of these ports is that the Gamecube has a very... \"tough\" controller. A joystick was never on the Saturn's controller, so it just fell apart when it reached the Gamecube's \"C-stick\". Also, the game only has 5 tracks (Did I mention it is a racing game?), so it can't be compared to Mario Kart's 20 tracks, or Sonic Drift 2's 15 tracks (THAT IS A GAME GEAR GAME! Couldn't Sega have found more room ON A 32-BIT SEGA SATURN CD DISC!?). The soundtrack was also wierd, a lady is singing \"Can you feel the sunshine, takin' away the rain?\" while you are racing... not to mention that person sounds almost like the lady who sang \"I want to fly high!\" in Sonic Adventure, and I loved the voiced over music in Sonic Adventure, but it does not belong in a 32-bit racing game that has enough issues.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005NN5A","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Great game for the Simpsons fan","reviewText":"This will definitely not be the deepest game you will ever play. However, if you are a huge Simpsons fan, this game is definitely worth the investment. It is basically a shameful [copy] of Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters. You drive around town as one of 18 playable characters, pick up passengers, follow the arrow to their destination and drop them off before the time expires to earn money. If the trip timer reaches zero, the passengers becomes impatient and jumps out of the car. If your overall time runs out then the game is over.The best thing about Simpsons Road Rage is that it is true to the show. The environments look exactly like they do on TV. You will see the Simpsons' home, the school, the Kwik-E-Mart, the church and the Retirement Castle just to name a few recognizable locations. The characters' voices also sound authentic as they quote familiar lines from the show. There are 18 playable characters (actually 16 since there are two versions of Homer and two of Moe) including the entire Simpsons family, Ned Flanders, Professor Frink, Otto, Groundskeeper Willie, Snake, Apu, Chief Wiggum and Krusty the Klown. They all have their own vehicles to fit their personalities and/or occupations. There are also several other unplayable characters who appear as passengers, like Milhouse, Ralph Wiggum, Hans Moleman and Principal Skinner. Then there are the six huge environments. You can cruise through the Evergreen Terrace neighborhood, the Entertainment District, Springfield Dam, the Nuclear Power Plant, Downtown or the Springfield Mountains.There are four driving modes to play around with. The meat of the game is in Road Rage mode, which is the taxi mode I explained before. You must play this over and over and over in order to earn money to unlock characters and neighborhoods. Every time you play, your money gets added to a cumulative total. Every time that total reaches a predetermined amount (10,000, 30,000, 50,000, 75,000 and so on), you can choose whether to unlock another character or another neighborhood.The other game modes include Sunday Drive, where you can drive around any of the unlocked neighborhoods and get to know the terrain and find shortcuts. There is also a Mission Mode, which includes ten missions, usually involving knocking over a certain number of street signs, light posts, mascots, etc., that you may or may not want to bother playing through, especially since the game takes a long time to reload itself every time you restart or fail the mission. Finally, there is a two player multiplayer mode where the two players are in a race to pick up each passenger. Once the passenger is picked up, the other player can steal the passenger by bumping into the car with the passenger in it. Whoever ends up dropping off the passenger gets the money and the first person to earn a set amount of money wins the game.Of course there will always be some negatives to every game, and this one is no exception. First, the loading times are almost unbearable. There is no such thing as a quick restart. Second, the game can get repetitive very quickly. It starts to feel like a chore playing game after game after game trying to add more money to your pot so you can unlock the other characters. The change in environment can help some, but some of the neighborhoods have huge learning curves. It could take a lot of exploring before you get used to some of the environments. And when you are trying to add money to your pot, it is hard to waste a game earning only 2,000 in Springfield Dam when you know you could earn around 9,000 a game in Evergreen Terrace. Third, I cannot decide whether the dialogue in the game is annoying or entertaining. Each passenger has a number of lines that they might say when they jump in your car, and your character has a number of lines that they will say as a reply. However, more often than not, the two lines do not match up at all and it sounds like a pretty random conversation.Negatives aside, this is a pretty simple game that you can always go back to when you have nothing better to do. It is not likely to keep you occupied for hours at a time, but for any Simpsons fan, this is a pretty entertaining game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1J","description":"This super-slick driving game lets players strap into more than 20 licensed cars and compete on more than 300 circuits in cities around the world. In addition, the game boasts 100-plus individual and wheel-to-wheel challenges, an arcade mode, and a four-person multiplayer option. You may want to put your seat back--this could be a long drive. In a unique twist, players are rewarded with a ratings system that scores their style, dexterity, and placement. Throw on the flare, boast your driving skills, and prove your daring side and you'll be rewarded.UnlikeCrazy Taxi's reward scheme,Project Gotham Racingis a true-to-life racing simulation (no bounding from rooftops here). The tracks--located in global centers such as London, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco--are incredibly detailed, adding a thick layer of realism to the course. The cars are just as nicely rendered, each shining with the gloss of a fresh paint job and driving with the appropriate responses for its particular style. Those looking for a game with speed to match the hardware should add this racer to their list of Xbox must-haves.","reviewerName":"M. S. Hillis","summary":"Looks and drives great, but too difficult","reviewText":"Project Gotham is like a high-performance sports car. It looks absolutely gorgeous, dishing up thrills and giggles in generous portions. But be warned, if you want this as your daily driver, there are plenty of frustruations to live with.Even though it was launched nearly two years ago, the game still has some of the best graphics for an Xbox driver out there, topping newer releases like Burnout 2 and Midnight Club 2. The only one that comes close is Sega's GT 2002, but that title is hampered by repetitive tracks. Project Gotham has dozens of routes through four cities and you'll never get bored of the scenery.There is a wide selection of cars, ranging from sporty compacts like the Mini Cooper to muscle cars like the Camaro and high-end luxury sports cars from Ferrari and Porsche. There is no option to upgrade the cars, though new ones are unlocked as you progress though the levels.The gameplay is really tight, and the cars behave more like a simulator than an arcade game. Forget just gunning it all the way, you'll have to learn to apply the brake and watch the speedo going into corners. But there is a payoff for learning the ropes -- the kudos system that awards points for tricks like slides and catching air.HOWEVER. There is a big drawback to Project Gotham, and that is the difficulty. I admit I'm not great with driving games, but certain races are nearly impossible without complete mastery of every trick in the book. This puts a good number of cars out of reach. I basically got stuck after unlocking a third to a half of the cars. Because you need faster cars to compete better in the more difficult races, if you get stuck on one or two races you will be out of luck as far as the single player mode goes. Fortunately there is a widely known code that lets you unlock all the cars, but that robs you of the feeling of accomplishment for doing it yourself. An adjustable difficulty setting could have solved this.All in all, Project Gotham is a must-have driving title for the Xbox, and gets perfect scores for graphics, cars, and overall feel of the game. But the head-pounding difficulty keeps it out of reach of the checkered flag.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2003"}

It certainly is not a sandbox game but I loved the scale of the warzone, the game really makes you feel as if you're in a war.  To tell you the truth, at times I was more impressed with the sound than the graphics, probably because we got used to the next-gen graphics.  Anyhow, I loved the story in KZ3, the character interactions are more believable this time around, especially within the main characters.  It's like a well written war movie.  Cutscenes are well placed and not too long, unlike MGS4.I'm not good at multiplayer but I'll eventually try it.  Nonetheless, KZ3 is a real good value, even just for the single player mode.

The exercises are intended to gauge and improve 5 abilities that range from movement tracking, hand eye coordination, to peripheral vision. There are fundamental exercises that train you, and there are sports activities designed to both train and entertain you. For the first 2-3 weeks, I felt Flash Focus was kind of fun. I didn't really feel an improvement, although it said I was steadily improving. After awhile, it got very boring especially once I unlocked all of the activities. Most of the exercises do not really test your vision skills but instead evaluate your brain. The number flash, letter count, and a lot of the other exercises test your ability to memorize and regurgitate the numbers you saw. In advanced mode, the game flashes a long number for a split second and demands you to input the exact number. If you transpose 2 digits or miss one, it is considered wrong. I've gone to several optometrists and ophthalmologists in the past and they never had such testing going on. Overall, it is a fun novelty game that may or may not improve your vision with regular use. The novelty wore off quickly in my experience.Pros: Easy way to track, manage, and improve your vision based on the game's parameters. Nifty sound effects, and some of the sports activities are entertaining.Cons: Dated graphics, most of the exercises test your photographic memory capabilities rather than your vision. I never understood the peripheral vision test on a Nintendo DS. The real eye doctors use a much different test for peripheral visionOverall: 3/5 stars","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2010"}

But I think the training pays off!!","reviewText":"Yes, this is like a  \"Brain Age\" for the eyes.  That said, it is NOT easy albeit pretty darn accurate at least for this reviewer as it has my age right around the right neighboorhood (between 39 - 45 when my real age is 40).Nevertheless, a good workout and I do think it is effective in training the eyes to work a little faster.  After having played this over a few months, I discover myself performing better on some of the minigames in both Brain Age (low to high) and Big Brain Academy (the number memorizing game under  \"memory\").My only complaint (and this is only my opinoin):  The new eye age check is based on the last eye age check.  If a player did well on a previous eye check, the next eye check will add more difficulty.  That difficulty may not necessarily be surpassed yet then the game will report that the player had results that  \"dropped dramatically\" when the reason for the drop may be in the increased difficulty level and not necessarily in the skill.  That can be misleading and can give a blow to a player's confidence level.  It would be interesting to know statistically how the score is generated.Nevertheless, with both mundane activities as well as sports activities and explanations as to how certain skills may be beneficial in certain sporting events, the game is very well done.  Stick with it and don't let the game get you down if you don't perform quite as well one time than another.  There are multiple factors that tie in including a player's baseline fatigue, the lighting, the time of day, et cetera.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2007"}

I played a few others since then, but none have really stood out until dirt 2. While I played dirt 1 (borrowed it) I have to say that this one is leaps and bounds over it. The presentation is amazing and it was really smart of them to record peoples names in there, so it feels like they're actually organic. The racing is awesome and there are plenty of variable difficulties to suit your driving abilities. There is rally, rally cross, buggys, and truck/baja racing. The online mode works great and is a lot of fun (watch out for those monster pile ups on the first hard turn) and there are plenty of people playing. There are plenty of achievements to be had from this game which are earned easily. There is a fairly decent variety of cars. The graphics and sound are amazing and there is also plenty of music. I'm not huge into racing games at all but I love this game, I would recommend it to gamers of all types and as a gift for someone else if you're not sure what to get this.

The scores are still outrageous if you do this but I always liked playing longer games.My biggest complaint is paying $60 bucks for a repackaged game from last year. You will notice small upgrades to the graphics and announcers comments but really is this worth full price? I guess that is really up to the eye of the beholder. I personally regret the purchase, I like NCAA better then Madden on the next gen systems but I really wish I had the patients to wait for the price to drop upon Madden's Release. If you are a huge NCAA fan this is of course a must buy but if you are a little tight on money go ahead and wait for a price drop.

The other change is grabbing. You now \"pick up\" the enemy by pressing the button a 2nd time, then a 3rd time to throw them (i.e. in the original game you just pushed in the direction you wanted to throw them). Other than that the game feels and looks identical.The one major improvement I like is the sheer overwhelming number of enemies.

It is a true sequel to the original game, so the story is a continuation and the gameplay doesn't really offer anything drastically new.  With that said, Gears of War 2 slightly improves on all of the Campaign aspects of the original Gears of War.The strength of Gears 2 is definitely the Campaign, whether you play single player or with a friend.  Most of the levels are truly epic and now there's moving and destructible cover.  The weaknesses are the multi-player.  There's some lag and starting a game could take a while.  Also, the chainsaw and mortars (explode in the air and release a cluster bomb) seem cheap ways to kill or be killed.The Story 7/10There is one, it's ok, and doesn't bog down the gameplay.  There are a few dramatic scenes in the story, but not enough build up to make them truly memorable.  However, the action never slows and the story does a good job at setting up the levels in the campaign.  The story is an improvement over the first Gears, although that's not saying much.Gameplay 8/10The gameplay is very similar to the original Gears.  Play single player or co-op.  Duck, Flank, Shoot.  But now there are more enemies and more weapons.  The gun battles are really fun and the wide range of enemies keeps the action interesting.  Battle enemies with mortars, flame throwers, gatling guns, lancers, rifles, machine pistols, grenades, shotguns, sniper rifles... etc.  You can also take shields from enemies and plant them as portable cover and of course, you can grab a wounded enemy and use them as a meat shield.  There are also finishing moves like the beat down, curb stomp, and the chainsaw up the a...There are a few enemies that change the battles strategies like tickers.  They're like jihad-watchdog-suicide-bombers.  You need to shoot them before they get close to you and explode.  They definitely get your attention in battles.There are some vehicle levels where you get to mow down hundreds of enemies at a time with a tank.  This is pretty satisfying.There are 4 difficulty levels for the campaign and the checkpoints are very generous.  Just about anyone can finish Gears and the harder levels offer a challenge for the hardcore gamers.There's also a Horde Mode where you and some friends can battle wave after wave of enemies and accumulate a score.  Horde mode is pretty addicting because the gameplay mechanics are fun and the pacing of the battles are intense.Levels 8/10The first Chapter of Gears 2 showcases some of the best looking battles of all time.  You really get the feeling that you are in a war.  Reavers fly into the battles from above, buildings collapse around you, armies of enemies rush onto the battlefield like a gruesome tide of terror.  Gears 2 raises the bar as far as epic battles are concerned in the same way that Call of Duty 4 raised the bar on intensity.  The battles are are something that everyone should experience, even if you just want to rent the game.However, when the game decides to move away from the duck, cover, shoot gameplay, the levels are pretty awful.  Whoever thought 'driving a tank with poor traction on cracking ice and insta-killing them if they fell through' was a fun idea, should be banished from the game industry.  The great levels outnumber the bad 7 to 1.Art 9/10Gears 2 looks amazing.  They've moved away from the grey enemies and grey backgrounds and added some color and some awe-inspiring views.  The characters, enemies, and effects all look great as well.  The presentation of Gears 2 is through the roof!It's rated M for violence, gore, and language.  The Game is about 12 hours long and 10 of those hours are really good.  The Horde Mode and Online Versus Mode can add hundreds more hours of fun.Avoid this game if you didn't like the first Gears, you don't like M Rated Games, you want great multiplayer, or you want vehicle combat like Halo.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2008"}

A few glitches in the missions as well.  But despite that, it is an amazing game, better than Oblivion and Morrowwind.  Story line was good, love the dragon slaying, it still annoys me that shops open and close, just an inconvenience for gamers, and let me frigging sell what I want when I want, enough with the restrictions.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2014"}

This is a casual game now. It isn't a game for gamers. What I mean is I can remember back in Vanilla WoW when people helped others. When it mattered what guild you were in. You even had to actually be a skilled player to do your job.None of that matters anymore. Most all guilds are 10-man. That was a horrible mistake. No battle feels epic with just 10 people. The removal of real skill points and talent trees. Just dumbed things down for both the player and them.My favorite time in WoW was during BC. WoW has gone downhill since then with each expansion. I thought the end of Cata was bad. MoP has brought WoW to a new all time low. I paid for this game for almost 8 years. Quit in October once my Annual Pass was up. I shouldn't have been able to just up and leave like I did. Blizzard let me leave people I have gamed with for years and not think twice about it.They ruined the game so much even today I still have no want to play. I honestly stopped here to see if the price of the expansion went way down or not. Can't believe it hasn't but I guess when the player base has changed so much to include so many, rude, childish, and ignorant people. Blizzard has people willing to pay no matter how bad the product is. I mean look at how bad Diablo 3 is.So WoW went from a game I couldn't get enough of to a game that felt like a job. If you haven't bought MoP yet I recommend you don't and just move on to the next better game. While they don't have the population WOW does. They also don't have the poor quality player base. People not willing to even give you directions or answer a simple question.The MMO is gone from WoW. It really is just a single player game now with optional multiplayer. So get out now while you still can. The people who worked for Blizzard and made the old games good are gone now. This new generation they got making games and choices is doing a horrible job. Even they don't want a challenge. Again the new skill trees that really are not skill trees made the game 100 times easier for them to balance. That is all it was.Things made simple in MoP ruined the last little bit of challenge WoW offered. Flying mounts and 10 man raiding ruined the rest of it. WoW is done. Nothing left to see here. Please move on and don't waste your money. Speak with your wallet. We need to tell Blizzard we will no longer buy crap just because it is made by Blizzard.Blizzard once said something. It was a level of quality. It said good game to me and many people. It doesn't any longer. It says you bought the last one so you will buy this one also. It doesn't have to be great. You will still pay. You all know this to be true.Truth be told I do miss the people I played with. Not reason enough to support a company that has stopped trying.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2013"}

I'm a fan of the RTS genre in general.  I played SupCom online for a couple months but ultimately I have to confront the fact:This game stinks.  I desperately tried to enjoy it but I can't honestly suggest it to other people.  I played for as long as I did hoping it would improve with patches, and while they fixed a lot of technical problems, the gameplay problems still persist.The game *engine* is fantastic.  It looks awesome.  The battles are great.  The units look fabulous and there are some fun and unique takes on some of the high tech units (the ones always featured in screenshots).The problem is the gameplay is just horrid, both for online and offline play.First of all, you should have dual core to play this game.  They have done a lot of performance improvements since the game's release, but if you want big games on the big maps, you need dual core.  Consequently, trying to do 3v3 games online is a nightmare as no manner how much you stress that everyone in the room needs dual core and they all say they do, invariably one player will not have it and the gameplay will bog down to intolerable levels.  Online multiplayer gaming can frequently become unplayable unless you just stick to 1v1 on smallish maps.The game has Vista problems (or Vista has problems with this game).  It tends to crash on Vista during big games.  So don't use Vista if you can avoid it.  This is just another way big 3v3 matches end up failing -- if someone doesn't bog the game down with their slow computer, someone will crash out because they're using Vista.The economy is unique and horrible.  The economic model in the game is similar to Total Annihilation but with a couple of differences: map control quickly becomes almost completely meaningless and base defenses are vastly improved over what they were in TA.  TA was largely a war of attrition against your enemy -- he builds 2 fusion plants, you kill 1.  He builds 3 more, you kill 2 more.  Due to the improved defenses of SupCom, that doesn't happen.  By the time you can break through your opponent's defenses to destroy his fusion plant, you might as well skip the fusion plant and blow up his Commander instead, ending the battle.So typical long games degenerate into both sides hunkering behind their defenses until one side can launch a single, fast, devastating attack that breaches the defenses and immediately ends the game.  The long, continuous back and forth battles of TA are gone, I am sad to say.On smaller maps, you won't get to that point, and you can have some good gameplay, but then you're not playing the game that was sold to you on the box and in the screenshots.  You're doing low tech rushes on small maps and you're not going to reach the cool units proudly displayed to you in the magazine reviews.All of this leads to a shrinking community, too.  I made it as high as top 50 for my 1v1 ranking and it got to the point where I just couldn't find a ranked game to join.  I sit there for literally 10 minutes \"searching for game\" and there's no match, because nobody near my rating is playing ranked games anymore.  They all quit or they're all playing non-ranked games because ranked games on small maps honestly aren't that fun and don't represent the gameplay sold on the box.  There are top players who have posted screenshots of themselves with 1 hour timers or more, waiting for a match.This review makes me sad, because I loved TA and I wanted to love SupCom, but it's just not happening, and I don't think you're going to see any further sweeping changes to this game that will ever bring Ranked gameplay back into popularity.  You can find people playing custom player-made modifications and maybe you can get some enjoyment out of that, but regular ranked gameplay is DOA and that's too bad.Maybe the next game, Forged Alliance, will fix some of the problems, but I probably won't bother at this point.  Between the way this game released and the company's reaction to gameplay suggestions on their official forums (bans), I don't see myself trying another GPG product until they can prove they've really turned things around.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00JQHU9RC","description":"","summary":"Weird, Cute Game","reviewText":"There is a lot to do in this game. Mining, digging, chopping wood, managing animals, building shelter ... lots to do, and it's a bit complicated to learn how to do it. Fortunately, there is an extensive tutorial that teaches the basics of crafting and building. You run around in first-person perspective, chopping, digging, and doing all sorts of other stuff. I would describe it as a sandbox game -- you're free to do what you like, and the game will not stop you from doing stupid things like digging yourself into a hole so deep you can't get out without building a staircase. (Not that I totally did that, or anything!)The blocky graphics are cute, especially the boxy 8-bit animals. I was not crazy about the fact that you must kill animals to get certain resources (leather, bacon). What can I say -- I'm soft-hearted when it comes to animals.My 13-year-old nephew is completely hooked on this game. I can see why.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001BP4JY6","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Not a fun game","reviewText":"Poor controls, poor camera and cheap enemy AI combine to make a game that's mostly unfun to play.  Normally, I'd just rate it low and move on without a review, but this game is un-fun in a very special kind of way: It is extremely fun at its core, but has extra \"features\" that take it all away.This is a game based entirely around intense combat; you're a seriously bad-ass ninja, and you're going to kick the door in and kill a couple million other ninja before you have breakfast.  The story is laughable to annoying, and that's to be expected (and I don't hold it against the game).  The graphics are pretty (except the FMVs, which would be sub-par on a PS2; did they not upgrade these from the xbox version?).  Ok, lets get on to the gameplay.You are provided with a variety of weapons and a ridiculous number of combos for each of them.  You're extremely quick and agile and acrobatic.  What could possibly go wrong?1)The Camera.  The final boss of this game should be the freaking camera.  It's almost cliche to complain about the camera in a 3d game, but its particularly bad here.  You can rotate it around with the right analog stick, and that would be great except:- You can't control the zoom distance, which means oftentimes rotating it will simply allow you to be 3 inches from Ryu's backside instead of 3-inches from his stomach.  This is especially troublesome because they like you to have long protracted fights in tiny cramped environments.- The game is not content to let you have complete control over it.  Oftentimes it just won't let you rotate to a specific spot, other times you have to fight with the camera control as it tries to go off on its own do god knows what (but certainly not anything like getting you and your enemies on the screen).- Everytime you enter a room (aside from every door entry being an annoying 6-second in-game cutscene) the camera faces you and the door you came in from.  This leaves you in poor position the fight the 3 enemies that are rushing you while you're standing still trying to fight the camera to get behind you so you can see the enemies.  IT INTENTIONALLY SETS YOU UP WITH THE WORST POSSIBLE CAMERA ANGLE (180 degrees from what you'd want) EVERYTIME YOU ENTER A ROOM.2) Next, the controls.  Combos work fine (well sorta; to be discussed below), it's mostly movement and Aim that suffer.  Subtle changes in movement direction just aren't acknowledged.  Instead of the analog stick, you'd be just as well off with the D-pad (except the D-pad does something else, so you can't use it for movement).  This is important when you want to attack the guy that's ever so slightly to the right and in front of you...you'd think being a ninja this would be possible.  It's not.  You're about as maneuverable as one of those arcade crane games.  You will attack dead ahead, oblivious to the guy 3 inches from where your blade goes.Further more, I know ninjas are supposed to be dedicated and all, but this game takes it too far.  Anytime you want to swing your weapon/attack, you dedicate yourself to this completely.  This means you lose the ability to block, dodge or redirect your attacks for 2-6 seconds depending upon what the attack you're doing.  At the end of any combo you'll also frequently stand there in some menacing ninja pose for a second or so before you can re-take control of your character again.  You even do this when you dodge, which kinda of ruins the whole idea of being \"evasive\".About the combos.  Assuming you don't get hurt in the middle of it, most combos are fairly easy to pull off.  That's a big assumption though, and one that will prove false in most occasions.  There's about half-dozen moves that are worthwhile with each weapon, and the rest will see precious little use because 99% of combat is blocking for a couple seconds and then making a single quick attack.  The situations where this is not the case are:- It's a solo boss-type enemy, in which case you will be doing more evading than blocking.  Any attempt at a long complex combo will leave you hurt because they are not \"stunned\" by your attacks and will attack you right back if you're not evading.- It is the last enemy from a horde, in which case he is easily dispatched without the need for any sort of combo.3) Enemy AI.  This game is difficult, and the enemies are no slouches.  A handful of hits from almost any enemy will kill you.  This leaves very little room for error in battles, even with minor foes.  Enemies are extremely quick, evasive and aggressive.  They work well as a team: one will often perform a guard-blocking move right when others are attacking you so as to screw you.  They also scatter off camera like cockroaches when the lights come on.  Thats right: the AI doesn't make them get behind you, above you, etc; it makes them get off-camera where they charge up and do power-moves/charges or powerful ranged attacks like rockets, magic, etc.  If they're not performing guard breaking moves, they're hitting you with moves that just plain ignore your blocking.  When you drop your own block to attack (or if you use a counter attack move) they're right there to hit you the millisecond your guard drops.  It's really more of a Cheap AI than a particularly good one.  They have computer-perfect reaction time and massive damage.4) Loading and Bad Environments: The loading in this game is annoying.  Outdoor areas will frequenyly have to \"load\" for a few seconds, and the places where they do this are almost always at an enemy respawn point you'll have to trek past multiple times.  For extra-happy fun, when it is done loading (anywhere from about 3-10 seconds) usually about a second's worth of combat will pass by that you didn't get to see or interact with.  It's free time for the enemy to beat-down on you.Another thing: combat frequently takes place around doors or intractable objects.  Coincidentally, the same button used to interact with them is one of your two \"attack\" buttons.  This will leave you examining objects, or worse, going through doors and resetting encounters.  You could have picked a different button for this one guys; R2 isn't used for anything I don't think.Save points frequently have respawning enemies on them.  This means, anytime you load a game from that savepoint, you will be ambushed the second (literally) you get in game.  That's just mean.All of this combines to be a mostly frustrating game play.  Every now and again they'll get it right.  The camera will manage to have both you and the enemies on screen, your attack will actually make contact with the enemy instead of missing because he's 3 degrees to your right, and there won't be a loading screen in the combat arena.  When this happens, its very rare, but it's also really really fun.  This is why the game is such a let-down.  The potential is right there staring you in the face.  The execution, however, was very, very poor.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2009"}

Even if that is the best thing it's got going for it... well that and the dismembering spinning disc of death that's attached to your arm.  You know, that old thing.Visually, this game is very tight.  The bleak, grey, stone walls that surround you.  The faded yellow of the soldiers' bio-suits.  The slick, metalic, gunmetal black with blue tints of the infected enemies.  It's a color palette that's tight without being boring-- which is saying something when your three primary colors are grey, charcoal, and freaking BLACK.  Its all pulled together by haunting music and ambient voices (I still here the scracthy voice box of those creepy Russian soldiers in my head from time to time) to create a one of a kind environment that's memorable, noteworthy, and lots of other positive things.Unfortunately, gameplay will trump visuals any day (it is a game, meant to be played afterall), and that's where darkSector starts to trip up. ...that and a middle-of-the-road story that is serviceable and ultimately forgettable and probably not even worth mentioning (super-virus, bad russians, government cover-up, blah blah blah).You've got a good variety of enemies to deal with, ruthless and deadly enemies who will murder you to the point of frustration.  So it's dissapionting that your bio-enhanced super-soldier is kind of a spaz.  He sticks to walls unreliably, he's not too quick on his feet.  It's not a crippling problem, but does make the tougher points more frustrating than they needed to be.  Where it really unravels, though, is in your lack of self-defense options.  You've got a decent amount of guns to pick from, and your glaive (oh, that glaive!) but everything worth using is middle distance.  Sniper rifles are all but useless and melee... well, I wouldn't bother with it other than to go in for some of the (beautifully brutal) instant kills: anything else is suicide.  So you're spending the entire game either machine gunning or dual wielding a pistol and the glaive (!)  trying to keep the baddies at an awkward middle-distance.  Too far away?  They'll pick you to pieces.  Too close? Splat!  It's a frustrating little dance that makes you feel impotent more than immortal and that shoots fun in the knee and dares it to get up.But when it's fun...  Can I talk about the Glaive?  Just for a bit?  Brutal, man, and worth sitting through anything else you don't like.  Frustrating enemy in cover?  Bounce that thing off the wall behind him and watch the blood fly.  Bad guys all lined up?  Let 'er rip and see how many heads you can take off in a row.  Charge it with electricity and watch 'em dance to death from the slightest touch.  And try, TRY not to grin as they run and SCREAM in slow motion when they see that spinning death coming.  Try, TRY not to laugh when you catch his arm and it GOES FLYING!  It's an incredibly satisfying physics-driven attack and the only time you get to truly feel awesome in darkSector.  It's so successful, actually, that I'm suprised I haven't seen a few clones of it tucked into other games.Still, though: only a middle-distance weapon. ::Sigh::","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}

Just Cause 2 is a sandbox game that brings explosive action and physics to the table and lets you decide the level of carnage you want to cause.  Because of that this makes Just Cause 2 a must have for any Sandbox junkie while giving the casual fan plenty of reasons to stick around.GAMEPLAYJust Cause 2 starts off with a bang showcasing you much of what it has to offer in a short linear sequence.  Here you will learn how your grapple hook works, parachute, how to mount cars, leash them into trees or into one another etc.  After the initial introduction to the carnage you can bring the game becomes the sandbox style.  Areas of the map will be marked showing there is \"something\" there but what it is... that is for you to find out!  Hijack cars, climb mountains, or become your own transportation by combining the grapple and your parachute.  There of course is story missions to do but there is no time limit for them. You can take as long as you like before starting them and odds are you might find 5-6hrs of random stuff to do before you even arrive at the destination.  Often I found myself traveling to a location only to stumble across an airport or military base and just had to blow it up!  I mean the chaos level was 0% that just isn't enough!  Chaos is rewarded to you the more you cause.  Blowing up structures and completing missions grants more Chaos... more Chaos brings you closer to unlocking more main missions (like 15,000 chaos might unlock faction missions, 7000 chaos more you unlock the next storyline)  This leads to a small problem I ran into which I will explain in the negatives portion below.  Ontop of storyline missions , side objectives aka blowing up anything that moves you also have faction missions. Securing a faction base is like securing a respawn/reload point.  More you got the less painful dying will feel as you don't have a crazy distance to travel.GRAPHICS / SOUNDThe graphics in this game are actually very very good. The physics is impressive and the background and interactions are amazing. When falling 1000 meters you actually feel like you are falling and could almost feel the wind and speed.  The real time environment is pretty sick also as it uses a day/night cycle.  Just stand around in game and you can watch the Sun move across the sky and slowly set.  while the \"world\" graphics are spot on when you zoom in on the action aka cut-scenes you clearly can tell the graphics dropped like 3 notches.  While it isn't bad, a little more polish might of made for more eye friendly cut-scenes.  *** Audio wise the game is pretty good.  The voice acting is a bit stereotypical almost as if they were faking the accent on the characters.  The gun, car, explosions etc all are awesome! The audio effects help keep you immersed rather than become an annoying distraction. If anything the cut-scene dialogue might be the only thing that irked me.STORY / REPLAYJust Cause 2 is a Sequel to Just Cause, storyline wise I never played Just Cause so I am not sure if this is a continuation of the storyline or a brand new storyline; I just know Rico was in both games.  Story wise the game has an average storyline at best.  I didn't find myself rushing to continue it pondering what the next turn of events might bring.  The storyline just felt like it was there to guide you to new areas of the map to cause more destruction(and I'm all for that!).  As for replay value, unless you are going for trophies I don't see why you would even need to start a brand new game unless you want to re-blow up the hundreds of areas to invade all over again. There is enough content here to last well over 50 hours.  By the 18hr mark I was barely 20% done with the game.OVERALL (88% 8.8/B+)Just Cause 2 is a fabulous game that brings plenty of gameplay and action to the table.  The map is absolutely massive to the point that I stole a fighter jet and it still took me 10 or so REAL TIME minutes to travel from one end to the other w/o using the drop system to save time.  While JC2 isn't a perfect game, and some dialogue and events get repetitive there is just so much to do that you can't really hate on the fact stuff got reused.  A must buy for the sandbox lover and even for a casual fan of just maximum carnage causing ^_^PROS- Open world and then some. Just an ungodly mount of stuff to do.- Lots of variety to the ways you can destroy or accomplish certain objectives- 3 different sets of faction missions, plus storyline missions help give a 'change of pace' from hours upon hours of mindless destruction- Grapple hook is nonstop fun; especially when you grapple a soldier to a moving car ^_^- Simple upgrading system by finding armor, weapon, vehicle parts and can use them to improve  armor, weapons or vehicles- Lots of collectible items for the factions for those who just gotta get 100% !CONS- As said above, one small bug I ran into was if I did an insane amount of CHAOS after everything was capped (unlocked the next faction missions, storyline etc) All the chaos I began to earn didn't carry over into the next upgrade bar which made it harder for me to unlock the next stuff (since all the extra splosive stuff was now sploded :( )- Cut-scene dialogue irked me (probably the fake accents)- I would get sad when I'd parachute into an area that was 0% only to find out all I had to do was pick up 2 armor crates and 1 weapon crate.  q_q nothing to blow up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2011"}

It's not a recycled Mortal Kombat reskined with DC superhero costumes. Injustice is so much better than Mortal Kombat. It's Injustice Gods Among Us. You get to play as over 20 of your favorite DC superheroes and villains, and every characters' combat feels different, which is a good thing because it makes everything interest. For example, Batman can use grapple and batarangs in combat, Green Lantern uses his ring, Superman has laser vision, ice breath, and super strength! Not to mention the super moves are super awesome for every individual character. Plus, it has an amazing and interest story to play through where your favorite DC superheroes end up in an alternate universe where Superman became an Injustice Lord, or you can say dictator ruling Gotham City and they must help their dopplegangers to stop him. It's also fun to play this online and with a friend.

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"Rocky","summary":"Great Game, but Too much to do","reviewText":"While this Fire Emblem game brings numerous improvements to the handheld SRPG market, it also has a rather 'fatal' flaw.There is literally so much extra side-crap to do in this game that the main plotline becomes completely insignificant. Indeed, you start to forget why you even care anymore (if you still care) about getting all the right classes and skills on all the right characters and characters' children.This 'problem' is created due to the following factors:1) Infinite re-classability (which also means infinite level capping, which also means literally everyone can stat cap, and get skilsl from multiple classes)2) Sudden influx of new (and better) characters all at once, rather late into the game3) Repeatable DLC missions4) Sacred Stones-style overworld map, with infinitely respawning enemy groups for you to fight.5) Permanent learning of skills (The ability to equip and swap them at will)6) Special free dlc maps that unlock right before the final chapter7) Paid dlcThe bottom 6 all become problems only because of #1.Truth be told, I made it to the final story level, and suddenly had so much extra (harder) s*** to do, I just never got around to finishing the game.Also, the pair up system trivializes the traditional FE support system, and most maps. Pair up would have been fun if it wasn't your default action, but every single map you will fuse all your units into pairs of 2 units, often exactly the same 2 to each pair every time. It doesn't make any sense not to. The tradeoff for not pairing up is that wont have as many untis on the field. This is never an issue on any maps. So its not an intelligent choice... Not strategic, just stupid not to do.Would have been more fun if more strategy was needed than pair up my 2 favorite units into one, block entire passageway with them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jimmy Kim","summary":"Read before Purchase! RENT IT, Too many PROBLEMS ingame.","reviewText":"I love the Resident Evil Franchise but this game has TOO many problems. They changed up the formula too much and made it a gunblaster game and not a survival horror game. I generally give games a lot of slack for their shortcomings but PLEASE read carefully and think about what I have written.CONS:-First of all, there are TOO MANY quick time events, you literally have to press, move, or smash your controller every once a couple of minutes during cut scenes. HOW is a man to enjoy the cinematic cut scenes or eat a chip with all this nonsense. I understand they are trying to make it more interactive but the first 20 minutes alone required constant attention. Felt like I was with my girlfriend at her mother's.-Another issue with the game is the fact that you CANNOT kill enemies that you clearly know will give you trouble later. They make them invulnerable until the 'right' moment. Very opposite of Resident evil 4.-This game is trying hard to be more action oriented and not horror survival despite the zombies. Are the makers of this game trying to make you rambo?-The shooting system feels so inaccurate and lackluster. You can hold FAR too many gun types which doesn't make sense.  The inventory doesn't focus on capacity management but rather just ammo, which they clearly give you too much of on any of the difficulty levels.-Guns are nameless and just called by their category. Lame.-Your melee attack is ungodly broken and overpowered.- The coin point system is pointless and only helps marginally- There are far too many stupid puzzles that aren't realistic or seem more like you're wasting time than challenging.- When you're knocked down and if an enemy is attacking, you will be forever stuck in a loop of an enemy hitting and knocking you down. So stupid.- The physics of shooting the enemies in the leg or shoulder do not make sense. Even Resident Evil 4 had a more accurate system.- Game has glitches and stupid repetitive moments (Please check the video gameplay I posted up where the game glitches out)- The pacing of the game feels fast and short at random times throughout the game and then other times SUPER dragged out.- Story was so cliche it made me puke.- There were no instructions on how to use the health tablets via herbs, one of the load screens tells you about it when you're already deep into the game.- How come people become zombies in the blue gas but when I dance around inside I only lose HP? Hmmmm.Pros(not many):- Voice acting is nice and believable (They made Leon have a deep raspy voice to show you he's serious).- The Dodge, slide, and 'shoot-on-your-back' system is nice. Great for gunfights and killin' zombies.- I did like the melee system despite how ridiculously strong it is- The user interface is actually a nice change and I can use all my weapons and healing items on the fly which makes a lot more sense than asking the zombies to STOP and let you heal.I don't mean to sound like a cynic because I really do love the resident evil games and I play them through multiple times but this one just has too many issues. I would suggest not purchasing this game and rather to rent it. You can also watch playthroughs or 'let's play' it on youtube.I beat the game but the game beat my heart...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}

This game uses the enviroment and gives a number of options to complete  most goals using magic, stealth, or brute force. It is rather amazing to be able to utilize so much of the world as opposed to the usual eye-candy other games give you but no interaction.The bad. This game is short, very short. I bought it recently and would have been seriously angry to have paid the original retail price for this game. There are serious technical issues going on with this game which include audio stuttering, slowdowns, and hard crashes and some hotkeys just stop working. Much of this is related to the source engine and is found in other games using that source engine, but that's no exuse. The game also has a bit of challenge issue, in that it moves from incredibly easy to moments of frustratingly hard. It wouldn't be so bad if it was consistent. Also, in this date and age, games should not be this linear (there is no deviating from the main game except a few minute quests) and there is only one single male character (what no female story line?). Also the do it this one way or reload approach is not a next generation game methodology... especially when the loading times are pathetic.Lastly, the multiplayer game doesn't play anything like a the singe player. If they could have create a game that was thoughtful and challenging like the single player as opposed to the quick brawling fests of the multiplayer... then i would have given it more stars. At the price the game sells for now, sure its worth it.Hopefully, in the future the company will put more effort and technical expertise into their products... this could have been incredible.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2007"}

Enabling &ldquo;Ninja Vision&rdquo; will allow players to detect and analyze potential enemy weak points, secret paths, and hidden information within the environment. Beware though, while using &ldquo;Ninja Vision,&rdquo; characters become susceptible to excess damage.

I'm a casual gamer, not looking for a eject-and-throw-the-disc-at-the-wall experience, and when a game has an easy setting I expect it to be just that.  Perhaps the God of War series has spoiled me?  I lost around $12 after buying this waste-of-money, then quickly trading it in so as to not end up tossing my controller through the TV.  And, creators of Ninja Blade, if Bioshock lets you save whenever you want, why not give that same functionality to your game?

{"product_name":"B0053B7ICO","description":"","reviewerName":"BAH","summary":"Grindhouse style + shooting zombies = Great game!","reviewText":"I have always enjoyed shooting games at the movie theaters as a child so when I saw House of the Dead: Overkill came out for PS3, I somewhat became interested in getting the playstation move. I recently found a great deal for the the doomsday playstation move w/sharp shooter and finally purchased it and this must have-game. I have to say this feels like a great arcade port. First, the aiming control is great with the motion controller and my playstation sharp shooter/mad catz 3d shot handgun. I actually prefer to use the mad catz handgun because it is smaller, lighter and more comfortable for rail shooters like this game. Second, the grindhouse style is done with perfection with the grainy footage, crazy storyline (better than Uwe Boll's movie), excessive violence, silly comedy and the sexual nature. If you like those sort of movies, you will like how this game used that style. Third, you are SHOOTING ZOMBIES! I like realistic military shooters and sci-fi shooters but I prefer survival zombie horror genre more. My only gripe after a couple days of playing is that there is too much unnecessary cursing. They should have had just a few curses and also had an option in the menu to \"bleep\" out the bad language. I would give this game a 4.4 stars out of 5 and would highly recommend it for shooter fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

Hmmm, wait, maybe that isn't quite true, but then again... eh.  Yeah, 3 stars is stretching it a bit.  This doesn't quite hit &#34;I Like It&#34; territory, but then it doesn't completely fail either.  Just a middle of the road offering in too many ways to truly count, though I'll include a couple here.First up, the graphics on the PS4 edition aren't bad.  In some ways they are pretty impressive, but then... oh, yeah, then.  There's the coaches walking around on the sidelines doing an &#34;Aw, shucks...&#34; type motion.  (For example Shanahan from the Redskins)  It just looks so cheesy and unimpressive and so cartoonish to be laughable and irritating.There's also the repetitive block of characters that are seen in the end zone when a field goal is being attempted.  Shown behind the &#34;screen&#34; or &#34;net&#34; so as to make it look more realistic, except, well it doesn't look that way at all.  The fans there are moving in blocks that repeat so much as to also be distracting, making it obvious that you are playing a &#34;video game&#34; rather than something that might be considered a somewhat realistic simulation of the NFL game.The graphics also lead one to believe, as they have over the last few years of Madden games, that players don't just turn on a dime, but can quickly slide the lower portion of their bodies left or right in an instant and then be off to the races as they dart around on the field.  Unrealistic to the point of being laughable again.  Yes, I know there are players that can spin move, juke, and leave the defensive players with egg on their faces, but it isn't nearly as many of them as we see in this game on a yearly basis.Something I do like is that it does seem that EA's team has gotten the audio team involved in the production of this game.  Scoring a TD for the Redskins (as an example) results in hearing 'Hail to the Redskins' sung by the crowd as one would actually hear at FedEx field (or hear on the TV broadcast those times when the Redskins actually do score TDs this season :-p :-D )  That does tend to add back in a little more realism, but it hardly makes up for the other places where Madden NFL 25 just doesn't quite shine.In the end, like others, I long for the time when there is no more exclusivity for NFL football games on console systems (or elsewhere) as I would like to think that competition would lead to better games for everyone to enjoy.  Fan boys of the Madden series will surely enjoy this game.  Others will likely wish for something different.  An OK entry to the next generation platform, but not much better than OK.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

I feel reviewers are expecting too much out of developers these days. If it isn't besthesda, bio-ware, infinity ward, or naughty dog... it shouldn't be played. The problem is my fellow gamers. We are playing the same games over and over again with graphical and interface improvements. I enjoy a new experience. And while Alpha Protocol blends elements of Splinter Cell and Mass effect... it does so ambitiously. It's like Deus Ex with a Bourne Identity story line. True branching narrative unlike anything on the current market and true freedom of mission progression. You have to accept that graphics are not everything. You have to look beyond the common texture pop in and RPG shooting mechanics. Once you take this game in spite of those two very insignificant flaws. You will find yourself engrossed in an amazing narrative and loving every minute of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

Can work with Consoles!","reviewText":"The sound quality on these are fantastic (for music, movies, and pc games).  I have a number of headphones and only my older Sony headphones compete with the quality of sound (but they aren't wireless like these).  The range is great too...I can hear audio coming from my bedroom clearly in the kitchen (about 25-30 feet away).  I don't do a lot of online gaming, so I can't comment on the mic yet.I use these headphones in my bedroom with my computer, Roku (netflix, amazon on demand, etc), original xbox, and ps2.  Initially I was a bit disappointed that these don't work with my consoles, but then found a way to make them work.  You have to have a computer nearby.  I have my PS2, Roku, and Original XBox hooked into my television...then I connected a stereo RCA to 3.5 cable (Red and White) from my television audio output to my line in plug on my computer/sound card.  I use software (audio repeater or virtual audio cable..VAC) to map my line audio in to my G930's and it works like a champ!  Now I can watch movies and play games in bed without waking my wife.  So this same setup would work if I had my 360 or PS3 hooked up to this television.  The only downside of this method is that it outputs stereo sound rather than 7.1 that the G930's can play.The battery life is excellent.  I can fully charge them up overnight and they last a good 7-9 hours of play.  I never play more than a couple of hours at a time so one charge lasts several days for me.The only negatives I have is that the headphones makes a good bit of disruptive noise when you turn your head or adjust them and they are a tad heavy for long gaming sessions...otherwise comfortable.I would highly recommend these for anyone who plays pc games and/or doesn't mind quality stereo sound coming from their console games without the need for a long headphone wire.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"A great (and greatly overrated!) game.......","reviewText":"I've never understood why critics (and gamers) consider the GTA series to be artistic. Sure they're fun and have certainly reinvented the sandbox genre, but really you're ususally just some thug-of-choice running around shooting and driving. Maybe it's the stories (chuckle chuckle).Well whatever it is, you're usually in for a fun, wacky time when you're playing a GTA title. The stories over-the-top and you can have fun driving over, shooting, and/or beating up pedestrians and police....at least you could before GTA 4 came out.Now, don't get me wrong. GTA4 is a technical marvel from the A.I. of the pedestrians to the little grimmy details of damage on cars and vehicles. But as a game, it just didn't engage me like the first three did (GTA3, Vice City, San Andreas). The story is kinda cool, but ultimatly feels like a modern gangster flick with questions about morals and family etc. This isn't a bad thing, but when it makes it seem like every pedestrian/cop/criminal is a real-life character it takes a bit of the fun out of killing them in creative ways. It's like, they'll give you a choice on which character to kill but then they'll show you a cut-scene that shows why you should feel bad about what you just did. This wouldn't be so bad, but when the game forces you to do this to progress the story then slaps you omn the hand for it it kinda sends the wrong message.Another thing I didn't like was the lack of custimization. In San Andreas you could go to any number of clothing stores and car shops to change your character' and your cars appearance. In GTA4 there's only three clothing stores with VERY limited selections.Also it seems helicopters are your only mode of air transportation. I realize this is more realistic (which sucks!), but it would've been nice to have more variety in vehicles.The combat in this game is much improved from the previous titles, from covering to targeting specific body parts. The controls themselves can be a bit clunky (and VERY sluggish), but you can generally get your character to do what you want them to do.In closing I don't think GTA 4 is a bad game at all. In fact it's one of the most technically impressive titles to come out this year. But as far as the game-core goes, it feels like a HUGE step back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

I enjoy running from the police, the handling, overall it is a lot of fun and before I know it, a few hours go by - that's the sign of a great game.However - I am not very good at this game at all. Racing on streets versus designated race tracks really messes with my brain. I cannot keep track of the route that easily and often find myself crashing myself out of the race. This game is very easy to pick up and drive cars. It is NOT easy to actually compete in the races. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to beat the most wanted, but I plan on giving it the old college try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

Intially I was put off by the tonning down of the rpg elements, the complete overhaul of loot/inventory system as well as the combat system. Overtime the more I played ME2 the more I realized it was done for the better. The orginal ME1 had in my view a bloated loot/inventory system with mobs dropping too many things to keep track off and money really mean't nothing as almost any item of significance came from drops. The talents trees in the original also felt too redundant and not specific enough which was also addressed in ME2 and the talents now gives you fewer but more powerful meaningful abilities. In all I now agree with the overhaul the game mechanics went from ME1 to ME2.Mass Effect 2 with its save-the-universe plot, its conversation options, tightly knit high quality cut-scenes, and a more robust combat system truly makes the game feel like an interactive sci-fi movie. I will say games like ME2 given 4-5 years more and subsequent advancements in computer hardware/software technologies will make movies eventually obsolete. Why watch a movie when you can virtually star in it controlling the actions as well as story-line than rather watch someone else do it for you.In all the game is bigger in scope in almost every way from ME1 including the climatic finale at Omega 4 relay. I literally couldnt put the game away once I started the final mission all the way to its ending. I don't agree with others that it didnt match the scope of the orginal. In my view it exceeded the orginal game ending in almost all aspects; graphically, plot wise and had lot more emotional trappings to the mission which will make you regret or ponder at some of the choices you made during the finale; in all the finale is lot more involved than the orginal. (*SPOILER* if you are dont carefully think over how you allocate your team members for the final mission you might end losing some really valuable members which actaully had me play the ending thrice to undo some of the choices I intially made.)In a nut-shell highly recomended. ME2 just like a true hollywood blockbuster sequel is bigger in almost all aspects from the orginal and I am really looking forward to ME3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cadieux","summary":"Interesting experiment outside of the box","reviewText":"First, there has been a lot of speculation that this game is causing permanent damage to PS3 systems through some unproven mechanism.  I had no problems at all.  I have a 80GB model, original design (not slim), and did not even have a single freeze during my playthrough.This game is an interesting experiment in video game genres, much as Heavy Rain was.  I'm a huge fan of Heavy Rain, despite its enormous plot holes, so I thought I'd give this a try.  For the most part, I liked it, but I'd say the game is more \"interesting\" than \"fun\".  You're not likely to have a big smile on your face while you play this, as you might when playing a game like Uncharted, but it is still good.The Good:1.  Excellent display of what I'm told is new facial animation technology.  It looks really, really good.  The expressions match the emotions better than anything I've ever seen.  I'm anxious to see this tech in other games.2.  Very good voice acting to compliment the facial tech.  The actors really took this gig seriously, in my opinion.3.  Good story, even though I think it had a chronology problem or two.  You can tell that they put a lot of effort into the writing, as the game is story-driven.  They did a good job tying the individual cases all together to make a single larger story.  No enormous plot holes like in Heavy Rain, though I may have missed something.The Bad:1.  The game offers a lot of cars besides police cars, but there is no incentive to drive them.  The police cars have a couple of major advantages, the most important being the siren which causes other cars and pedestrians to stop at intersections and try to get out of your way.  I avoided driving other cars whenever possible.2.  Controls for the on-foot action sequences are pretty bad.  This game isn't going to win any awards for its shooting or even its walking controls. The cover mechanic is there but is not well-done.  The game seems to know this, because it offers you an option to continue with the story while skipping all of these shooting and stealth scenes completely.  Rockstar has never been good at this aspect of their games, and nothing changes here.3.  There are some illogical results from interrogations.  (minor spoiler coming) For example, on 3 separate occasions, the game makes you choose between charging one of two suspects.  If you choose \"incorrectly\", the captain chews you out and calls you worthless.  So you go back and do it again, accusing the \"correct\" suspect.  Then you find out later that in all 3 cases, both suspects were innocent.  So the game wants you to wrongly accuse Suspect A, not Suspect B.  Wrongly accusing suspect A gets you a good result, wrongly accusing Suspect B gets you screamed at.  It doesn't make much sense.  They should have just allowed whichever suspect you choose to be \"correct\", let you think you'd done a good job and be all proud of yourself and your skills, then told you later that you had it all wrong.Overall I think this game is an excellent start in what is likely a new franchise, and I'm anxious to see where it goes from here and what improvements can be made.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

The graphics are very bland and average and honestly are substandard for a game that had this much hype.  Multiplayer is atrocious as the levels are too big.  What really makes multiplayer so bad is the spawning:  you literally spawn right in front of the enemies, so be prepared to go 5-25 or 3-18 repeatedly.  I played multiplayer for two days then got so pissed off I never touched it again.  The campaign mode is actually pretty interesting and different, but way too short.  Even on Veteran you're looking at 6-7 hours TOPS.  The loadouts for your characters are extremely confusing, having up to 10 characters and 10 slots per is just overkill.

This is easily the best PS3 stand!","reviewText":"I don't understand how this PS3 stand is getting like 3.5 stars when it is the most stable PS3 stand and looks the best. Lot of these user reviews are loving the PS3 stand but then giving it a low score simply due to the higher price. I was looking around for a PS3 stand and I had a few options. At first, you could put the PS3 slim on the side without any stand but I think that is way too risky to tipping a $300 game system. Forget that! I looked at the very cheap Pega PS3 stand. Great price but it doesn't have the protective foam on the bottom so pega may scratch the PS3. It looks like plastic on plastic. Most importantly, it doesn't have the lock in feature so the PS3 can still easily tip pushing it to the right. I looked at Nyko PS3 stand and noticed that it doesn't match and it has no locking feature either. I saw some other generic PS3 stands with some type of lock in feature on the side and it still didn't lock the PS3 to the stand correctly as the PS3 can tilt out. I researched this and actually saw videos comparing the stands. This Sony PS3 stand is definitely the best as it keeps it the most stable and looks great. You can get this Sony PS3 stand for pretty cheap too as I got it for $10 less than the retail price. You don't have to pay the retail price if you look around at one of the most obvious stores and I'm not talking about B.B. or wallyworld charging full retail price.Most stable stand + Best looking + Lock in feature + Protective foam = 5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

You spend a lot of your time killing enemies without being detected, and if you are detected you're in deep s***. The game has an incredibly creepy environment to do your hellish deeds and eliminate the enemy. The game can get incredibly difficult, especially when you're trying to fight more than one enemy which will in many cases cost you your life. You can lead enemies into traps by making noise by banging your weapon against a wall. Then, when the enemy comes and doesn't see you and walks away you can kill him in macabre ways(via suffocation with plastic bags or stab him with a piece of glass, which is made more brutal when you hold down the attack button). You will only be terrified throughout this game because you don't know what will come for you next and how will it try and kill you. The game has problems though.

{"product_name":"B00D96BORK","description":"","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"Mediocre","reviewText":"It almost seems like I got a different product entirely from the other reviewers judging by their 5 star reviews, but I have to be honest even if it means I disagree with everyone else.I'm guessing that most people looking for a gaming headset are neither a game collector nor an audiophile, but as I am both it may give you some interesting perspective. I am a headphone hound of the highest caliber, and end up buying a new set every few months it seems like. I've tried everything from Radio Shack to Sennheiser to Klipsch. I LOVE headphones. Recently, I've begun investigating gaming headsets, using the logic that something design specifically for games should make games sound better than they would through a normal set of headphones (I don't chat so I have no use for microphones).I've wanted to give Turtle Beach a try for some time because they are everywhere and seem to be the most popular brand. So I was really looking forward to giving these a try.SetupThe instructions for this headset are terrible. Difficult to read, mostly just pictures. If you aren't a techie good luck figuring it out. If you have connected lots of headsets in the past you likely won't need them.Overall DesignThe headset is quite sturdy, and feels like it could really take a beating. The headset is barely give enough to fit my head extended all the way and pinches the top of my head slightly. Only mildly uncomfortable due to the pinching. The ear-cups are made out of what feels like cheap form that is designed to be rugged, but not very comfortable. Lack-luster I would say. The headset itself is pretty, but the control box strikes me as ridiculous in a bad way. Instead of just a volume control and a microphone volume control, you have a bass control, a treble control, a microphone switch, and an auxiliary audio control. With the net effect that when I want to turn the sound up or down I cannot find the dang volume dial! If you are person who loves having extra dials just for the sake of having extra dials, this will be right up your alley.Sound QualityAnd this is what knocks the device from four stars to three. I am, as I have stated, an audio enthusiast. I have high standards for sound. I listen to the built-in speakers on my plasma TV, some Genius speakers on my PC, and a set of 15-year-old Bose Desktop Speakers for my projector in the living room. What that means is, while I love the 250.00 Sennheiser headphones I own, I also love their 30.00 ones. While I love a good surround sound from a home theater, I can make do with \"decent\" TV speakers. But these...aren't even decent.If anything, the sound is slightly sub-par. As in you can get sound this good from a twenty dollar set of headphones from Radio Shack. The bass is lacking and so is the treble. The sound is not smooth, warm, or clean. There is static distortion at every volume level. Turning up the bass and treble does not improve it, it distorts it. If you turn the treble all the way up it sounds overly bright and screechy.OverallThis isn't a bad headset. It's just nothing special. There no surround sound (virtual or otherwise). It's passably comfortable, passable sounding (if you aren't too demanding in your taste of audio equipment), and passably easy to use. On the plus side, it looks really, really durable. I will hang onto these to use in my living room on the PS3 (which I use less than the 360 I'm giving a better headset to). They will do until something better comes along.I have a feeling I won't be satisfied till I get a Sennheiser gaming headset.*Update 11/11/13*Something very odd has happened. I moved these headphones into the living room and cut them between the A/V cables that feed a switch-box into my desktop speakers. Now, normally adding more components to your line will increase distortion, so I was expecting that. But very oddly, the exact opposite happened. The headset is now powered by my Playstation 3, and is between a Saturn, Dreamcast, Genesis, Sega CD, Wii, and PS3 and the desktop speakers, and yet...the static distortion has GREATLY decreased, to the point where it's no longer incredibly irritating, but just a minor annoyance. Very strange. On the 360 it was absolutely awful.As the headset continues to break-in through use, the earcups are not as stiff as they were before and less uncomfortable. Unfortunately the pinching on my head is getting even more uncomfortable, but I have a feeling that this will be less pronounced with further use (I should be able to get the headset to bend a bit outward to loosen it's vice-grip on my head).The other criticisms still stand (sound is still mediocre, bass and treble are not smooth), but overall, my experience has improved a bit and I wanted to mention it. For me this headset has gone from \"sub-par\" to \"acceptable\". Star rating has not changed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Surprisingly great","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting a lot from Second Son, as I'm not a huge fan of the franchise. I was never interested in the first Infamous, but I couldn't resist grabbing it when it hit $20 without being relegated to crummy Greatest Hits packaging; it had only been out for a few months. I liked it more than I expected I would... enough that I played through it twice, just to see the full range of both karma move sets. I was mildly excited when Infamous 2 came out, but I didn't like it as much as the original. It was basically more of the same in what I personally thought was a less appealing setting. Emprire City from the first game might have been a generic metropolis, but I guess I prefer that to a run down s*** hole armpit of a town like New Marais. Flood Town... difficult for me to believe anyone actually enjoyed running around in that dump. I appreciate the political commentary on Katrina, that doesn't mean I want to play a video game set there. Like many other Infamous fans, I didn't approve of the new and improved Cole redesign, turning him from a skinhead bad ass into a metrosexual pretty boy. Sucker Punch immediately pussed out and cowtowed to us whiners, ran back to the drawing board and whipped up a new \"original formula\" Cole instead. He looked so lame that I wondered if there was some spite behind it. He ended up looking like some kind of not-yet-fully-formed man-sized foetus. It was a perfect lesson in \"be careful what you wish for,\" I really wish SP had stuck to their guns. I thought Infamous 2 was the definition of a tepid, phoned-in sequel. I finished it once with good karma, but I could only stomach about half of a second play through. It wasn't terrible, though... I can't say I regret playing through it the one time.So when Infamous SS was announced back in Feb 2013, I shrugged. It was clearly going to be a nice bit of PS4 eye candy, and I suppose I assumed I'd buy it at some point if only for that. Well, about a week before it came out, I read somewhere that Jamie Griesemer was the lead game play designer. *THAT* got my attention. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a diehard Halo fan, specifically for the single player campaigns. And that's where Jamie made a name for himself as a game play designer. Suddenly SS had become a \"must play on day 1\" title for me. I spent the entire last weekend playing it and am now almost finished with my second play through. All I can say is that this is by far my favorite Infamous game. The game play is indeed great. It very much keeps to the spirit of the first two, but it's considerably expanded and much more polished. Easily the best city so far, both in terms of looks and being fun to explore and run around in. I don't really detect any of Griesemer's fingerprints specifically... it's just good fun to play. Some of the traditional franchise elements have been discarded, like \"riding\" along rails and lines throughout the city, but they've been traded in for major upgrades- e.g. light speed running up walls and across rooftops, or literally flying up and over them. Combat has been seriously tuned and tightened up compared to previous games. The graphics are at least as good as expected, if not better. The characters are likable, unless they're not supposed to be. Troy Baker's been getting on my nerves lately simply due to his sheer ubiquitousness... but I didn't mind him one bit in this game.The only downsides I can think of are that the game is relatively short compared to the first two. It took me at least two or three full days worth of playing to finish them, but SS took me just over one day. And it does fall into a rut similar to games like Assassins Creed 1, where you get to do the same small handful of mini-missions over and over and over as you clear out the separate sections of the city one by one. Repetitive or not, they're still fun for the most part... so I don't see this as a major gripe.Truly great game, nice to finally have another PS4 showcase to go along with Killzone Shadow Fall. I can't imagine any PS4 owner would want to pass on this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

I love all Zelda games, and i gotta say this is one of my favorites along with Twilight princess, A Link to the Past, and of corse both of the 64 ones. Well I like the more realistic type of zeldas better than these with toon link but i still really LOVE this game. I could write a whole walkthrough on this but i wont. So i will just go over the basics. When you first start, as link. You are on your home island \"Outset island\" and on a tower looking over the sea. Your little sis gives you a telescope and tells you that grandma \"you live with her\" has something for your birthday. You get some new clothes that you wear the rest of the game. Its green and has a hat. After you explore your smallish home island, this huge bird comes down and drops this girl in the forest on your island. You will find your sword in your house and go rescue her. She is a pirate and you want to go with her on an expidition and she doesnt want you at first. When she does she tells you that you will need a shield of some sort than you can go. The reason you want to go is because the bird that dropped the pirate in the woods took your sister and the pirates are going after it to get back their whatever the bird took from them \"i forgot, it was quite a while ago\" As you go with them you have to complete tasks and stuff to get things, as soon as you get to the place the bird took you sister. You have to complete the first main part of the game. As the game goes on you get a boat named king which comes very helpful. Without him there would be no game. You travel around the Great sea to big or small islands and each big island has a perl to get when you beat the boss of it. Well there is only three islands but a great story for each one. In each place you battle you will find some usfull items to help beat the bosses. Later after the perls and stuff you need to get the triforce shards. Eight of them to be exact. And to find them you need to find the maps to them, and to get the maps. You need to beat things and find them. And to read the maps you will need LOTS of rupees to give to tingle to read them for you. Yes lots of steps. When you find them you complete it and you are ready to go to Hyrule and find and beat Gannondorf. You really have four stages of him to bead and each one gets harder. I beat him with one hit away from being completly dead. Well thats the main points of the game. I took me probably around 30 to 40 hours to beat it completly. 100% done. There are many hidden things and stuff to do in this game that are very fun to find. After you beat the game it will ask you if you want to save a special slot. When you restart it on that special save some things will be different, like Links' clothes will be different and so on. But this is one of my favorite games i have ever played in my life, excellent storyline, it has one of the best story out of all Zeldas. So if you never have played this game, at least give it a chance. If this was the only game made for the GameCube, i would buy it and the GameCube for big bucks just to play this.

The story is ridiculous, I don't know why they chose North Korea as the country that invades and conquers America. They try to make it more believable by fast-forwarding a couple decades, but I still found so stupid and completely unbelievable. There are a few futuristic weapons in the game, but in the end they are only a machine gun strapped to a searchlight that can be destroyed with a grenade, and a vehicle (they for some reason don't ride in) that shoots things you point at. The Modern warfare games have more futuristic weaponry than Homefront, a game set decades in the future. The AI is a little goofy, along with the checkpoints, where many times you have to sit through conversations or slow random actions after dying. There's also some weird parts where you can't go through a doorway or up a ladder until everyone else has done it. I mean the game is passable, I had a modicum of fun while playing it, but it just wasn't worth my time, or anyone else's.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"space_hamster\"","summary":"Compelling and addictive fun for the Casual Gamer","reviewText":"In acknowledgment of the SECUROM issues I had installing this game on my PC, I've removed one star from my review rating. I sincerely hope the publishers can find a less invasive method to protect their customers from the perils of software piracy. Now, onwards to the review of the actual game.Firstly, let's get the negatives out of the way. Those expecting open-ended gameplay (like Stalker: Shadow of Cherynobyl), will be severely disappointed. Bioshock is a very linear game that follows the tried-and-true scenario of \"obstacle blocks the players path, so they have to take the long way around\". Unlike System Shock 2 or Deus Ex, hacking doesn't really require any true skill. Just shuffle the tiles fast enough and you'll succeed easily. Resurrection chambers means you won't be penalised for dying. Oh, and hardcore FPS veterans will find combat shockingly easy. I went through the game the first time on Normal Difficulty and it was a cakewalk. And I'm probably the least-talented FPS gamer you'll ever meet. This should make the game very attractive to casual gamers. As for grizzled veteran FPS campaigners - you have been warned!Now, the positives. if you have a powerful gaming rig the graphics are indeed jaw-droppingly incredible. You can spend several minutes gawking at the scenery out a window before you remember you're supposed to be playing the actual game. The sound design and voicework in this game is excellent too. I found the storyline to be one of the best aspect of the game - there are so many compelling characters, and you want to see what happens to all of them. The other aspect that kept me coming back from more was the world itself. Despite it's linear level design, you really do get the feeling that Rapture is a living, breathing world.In conclusion, Bioshock isn't the Second Coming of the Gaming Gods. Neither is it manna from heaven. I think the gameplay is geared towards Casual gamers rather than Veteran FPS players. But it has excellent graphics and sound design, and a compelling storyline that will enthrall you right to the end. If it weren't for the SECUROM issues, I would definitely rate it as a must-buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2008"}

It's as if they just ran out of money or time. Or there was some kind of corporate decision to cut it off and release the rest as downloadable content.On the whole the critics are far too harsh on this game. The game grows on you the better you are at adventurous combat. For example, yes you can shoot the enemies on the ground behind cover. But then you'd be playing Halo! But you're the Rocketeer!

Graphics/Visuals (4/5)This is really the strength of Tools of Destruction.  Even at 720p, this game looks very impressive.  No, it's not like an interactive Pixar movie, but you could see why people might compare this to playing in a Dreamworks Animation movie.  This game is just full of bright colored, smoothly animated objects/environments/characters, that it is really fun to just watch.  The cut scenes are well made as well, and give a cinematic feel to the game.  There are a lot of moving objects in the background, especially in the cities, that give a vibrant and more realistic feel to the environments.  Breaking boxes/containers is especially fun to watch (and hear).2. Sound/Music (4/5)The sound as well is excellent.  Great game music and sound effects that can really be appreciated if you have a decent 7.1 speaker system.  The sound of breaking/destroying objects/containers is great, and the effects when you pick up various objects/bonuses considerably add to the fun of this game.Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.The Mediocre:1. Story/Acting (2.5/5)Comparing this game to a generic animated film, like Ice Age or Happy Feet would be understandble, but to compare this game to a Pixar movie is just ridiculous.  You will not find Pixar quality writing in this game.  The characters are not interestingly designed and the writing is not very humorous or clever.  Kind of like any non-Pixar animation studio movie, which is not to say that it is horrible, just mediocre, as one would expect from a video game of this type.The Not So Good:1. Gameplay (2/5)True, I did not finish the game, and only played through the first few levels before I packed it up and sold it on the most popular auction site.  However, the gameplay left me rather bored after awhile.  Initially, it was fun running around, hitting or shooting enemies, picking up objects, jumping up walls, and sliding on rails/tracks (which thankfully are not accompanied by visual cues of which buttons to press while sliding, as in Uncharted and Heavenly Sword).  But after awhile, it became extremely tedious and boring.  From the beginning, this game plays as an arcade game, with non-stop hack and slash action.  Not until you pass a couple of levels is there even a spot where you are not constantly fighting.  The fighting, also, gets tiresome quickly.  You can slash with your melee weapon or shoot a variety of guns/projectiles/etc.  But you'll find that it is far too easy to just use the same attack (slash attack when midair for a huge, circumferential attack) to kill all enemies in the first few stages.2. Linearity (1/5)This is a gameplay issue as well, but deserves its own section because it is so extremely linear that it significantly and negatively affects gameplay.  This game basically is running/jumping/gliding from point A to point B and so on.  You do not get a sense that this is a real world, but rather just a series of hiking trails in a variety of environments.  This makes it easy to navigate yet extremely boring.  Between the linear stages are cut scenes, that while nice, give you the feeling that you are watching an interactive movie where you can control the characters but that ultimately everything is following a pre-written script.  There is zero free exploration in this game, essentially it is as open-ended a world as you would find in a classic 80s side-scrolling game.3. Lack of anything to do but hack n' slash (1/5)Also a gameplay issue, but there is nothing to do in this game but continuously hack n' slash.  No exploration, no real puzzle solving (at least in the first few levels), no figuring out what to do next.  Just following the pre-scripted levels one tedious level after the next.The Bottom Line:Basically, this game has great presentation and production values, but the gameplay just flat out sucks.  So boring unless you are the type of gamer who enjoys linear gameplay with mindless hacking and slashing.  I would not recommend this game to anyone I know except as a demo to demonstrate the visual/audio capabilities of the PS3.Overall rating is a 2/5 stars, because the excellent presentation does not compensate for the extreme linearity and tedious nature of this game, which in the end, should be fun, not just fun to look at and listen to.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2008"}

I recently completed it, and I'm here to tell you that the hype is justified--this is an incredible game.  It instantly makes it into my all time top 5.  Planescape contains one of the most unique and interesting settings and the best writing and plot I have ever seen in a video game.  It's possible there are some adventure games that can hold a candle to it (I've heard the story in the game The Longest Journey is mind blowing), but I haven't played them.In terms of gameplay, this game is similar to the Baldur's Gate series, although it lacks some of the interface elements found in those games (or at least in the second one; I haven't played the first very much).  The combat here is not quite as tight as found in Baldur's Gate, but it gets the job done just fine.  This game is more focused on dialogue than combat, so if you like a very combat heavy game then you might not like it quite as much.  That said, it's pretty hard to imagine anyone who enjoys video games and a good story not enjoying this game.  You should also not get the idea that this is just a point and click adventure game with no real combat.  There is still plenty of combat, and you must do some heavy fighting to get through a number of sequences in the game.Although there isn't a ton of it, the voice acting is another major strong point in this game that I wanted to mention.  Another thing I like is that you level up A LOT in this game.  You start out as sort of weak, but by the end of the game you are a bad, bad man, and that's something I always like in my RPGs.Graphically, this game looks pretty ragged on a widescreen computer at its original resolution, but this doesn't matter because there is an easy to use mod that allows you to play it in widescreen.  Using the mod, it looks fantastic in widescreen.  The artwork for the levels is quite detailed and lovely--it made me long for the days of 2d graphics to be honest.  I found full on widescreen at 1280 x 800 to be too zoomed out, so I made a custom resolution for 960 x 600 and found that to be just about right.  In fact, there are a number of good mods that people generally recommend you get for the game which you can find using google.  Most of these simply fix bugs and things of that nature rather than adding entirely new material.A gameplay tip I would like to mention is that most people say that to get the full experience you have to put a lot of stat points in intelligence and wisdom because this opens up more dialogue options and story elements.  I am not sure how much is necessary to get everything, but just thought I'd pass that along.  I created a mage and had them both very, very high.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2011"}

The best D&amp;D-based game ever","reviewText":"Planescape Torment is the ultimate role-playing game that uses the D&amp;D system -- a great balance of combat, quest-fulfilling, and most of all, storytelling.  I played the old Pool of Radiance game, Baldurs Gate, and Icewind Dale.  Planescape: Torment is better than them all.  But the game is not just a great D&amp;D game.  It is a great role-playing and adventure game.  Every character trait matters.  Higher intelligence gives you access to more dialog options.  Higher wisdom allows you to accumulate memories and experience faster.  It is very rare to find a game that puts this kind of value on intellectual traits.As I mentioned, the biggest strength of this game is the story. It is eerie, dark, humorous, creative, compelling, exciting, and unpredictable, all at the same time.  It gets interesting in the first scene and stays that way until the excellent ending.  It is supported with brilliantly written dialogue and elaborately painted characters.  Unlike most games, the dialog is one of the highlights of the game.  Each character that joins the main character is deep and contributes value to the story.  The story in most games is hit-or-miss.  This one was a home run.  It's too bad that there aren't more like it out there.The graphics, more than two years after the game came out, still look good (although they are not cutting edge anymore).  The cinematic scenes are great, and the music is excellent too.If there is a shortcoming to the game, then it is the combat system itself.  The feedback during combat isn't very good, which sometimes leaves you wondering why one of the characters is taking damage, or why your spell didn't work.  The variety of weapons and especially spells is decent, but nowhere close to the variety offered by other D&amp;D games.  For instance, there are only two fifth level priest spells in the game.  The combat is still fun though, and there isn't an excessive amount of it.If you are looking for a great story-driven, role-playing game, and not just a hack-and-slash game, then this is the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2001"}

I wish I could explore the mall at my leasure as opposed to being rushed all the time. Also, if you're having a tough time with the difficulty, kill Adam in Wonderland plaza (one of the first Psychopaths in the game) and get his chainsaws (and save the guy so you get the shortcut) and there are 3 books (I can't remember what they are, look on GameFaqs or something) and that Chainsaw will last forever and kill just about anything in 1-2 hits (bosses maybe 6-7).

Several years have passed since Kyle avenged his father's death and saved the Valley of the Jedi from Jerec and his band of Dark Jedi. Allowing his Force powers to languish for fear of falling to the dark side, Kyle entrusted his lightsaber to Luke Skywalker, vowing never to use it again. But when a new and menacing threat to the galaxy emerges, Kyle knows he must reclaim his past in order to save his future.LucasArts is developingJedi Outcastin partnership with Activision's critically acclaimed Raven Software. Players assume the role of Kyle as they employ a unique mix of weapons, Force powers, and the lightsaber in both single- and multiplayer modes.Jedi Outcastfeatures expanded and enhanced use of the lightsaber, with new attack and defense moves. Tap into the powers of the Force, including jump, push, Jedi mind tricks, and more. Employ combat or stealth, depending on the situation. When a fight is necessary, be at the ready with an arsenal of weapons: stun baton, Bryar blast pistol, and blaster rifle to name but a few.Explore breathtakingStar Warslocales such as Cloud City, the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4, Nar Shaddaa, the smugglers' moon--plus some never-before-seen locations. Multiplayer options include deathmatch, saber-only deathmatch, and team capture the flag.","reviewerName":"AntVector","summary":"A force to be reckoned with...","reviewText":"Ingredients:30 years of film cultureBig shiny laser swordsMix thoroughlyAvid fans of Mr Kyle Katarn will have been charting his progress for a few years now, in his ongoing quest to shoot stormtroopers and avoid being crushed in big imperial crushing devices.  To bring the newbies up to speed, you play as ex-imperial agent Katarn, fighting your way through assorted Star Wars themed worlds and locations.  Initially a smuggler and spy, Kyle takes up the path of the Jedi, batttling dark Jedi and swamp beasties, and generally having a good time.In this latest (and greatest) chapter, we join Kyle in another bout of sci-fi intrigue, a spot of platform hopping, lots of shooting and some rather nifty lightsaber duels.  Kyle needs to relearn the Jedi skills he apparently turned his back on at the end of this games's prequel, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, all on his way to another 'save the universe' confrontation with some naughty Jedi.So, on to the game.  Playing in either first of third-person, Kyle explores the SW univererse, hitting switches, solving puzzles, sneaking past lazy stormtrooper sentries, and a lot of other things we've come to know and love in 3D shooters.  Where this game becomes unique is in the application of Kyle's Jedi force powers, which you gain as you delve deeper into the game.  Fans of the movies will recognise several of them...Force jump, speed, pull and push (to throw enemies around, or tug the weapons from their hands) lighting (\"and now young Skywalker, you will die!\") plus a few new ones invented for the game.  Often you will have to use your powers in specific ways to solve puzzles or bypass obstcales, but you are also free to apply them to other game situations, meaning that there's often multiple ways to defeat traps and enemies.  Why fight that squad of troopers when you could use Force Persuasion to sneak invisibly past them?  Surrounded?  Push your foe off of cliffs or into walls; choke them with your Grip powers, hurle you lightsaber, boomerang style...use your force speed to slow everything down, matrix style, and vault over them, saber flashing.The graphics are top notch, and true to the visual themes and styles of the movies.  Likewise the sound, from the blaster fire to the glorius 'vwhoooom' of your lightsaber is as close to playing the movies as you can get.  The saber combat is brilliantly realised, and you'll get lots of practise squaring off against evil Jedi.  You can fight using three different saber stances, enabling you to perfom lots of different and deadly moves...combine this with your force skills, and you'll feel like one badass Jedi by the time you're done.On top of this already stunning single player game, the online multiplayer allows you to take your skills to the net, and engage in team battles, one-on-one saber duels and lots more.All of this is wrapped up in Lucas Arts famously lavish presentation, with plenty of cut-scenes, crisp menus and loving fan art.May this game be with you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2003"}
{"product_name":"B004L4AZ7Y","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"An extremely lazy port of a nostalgic classic","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying thatRayman 2is one of my all-time favorite childhood games. In fact, back in the day I had both thePS1 versionAND theDreamcast version, which was and still is the definitive version. It had the best graphics, and utilized the greater power that the Dreamcast held in comparison to the Playstation and N64. This is both good and bad because what you're paying a full price for in Rayman 3D, is Rayman 2: The Great Escape (the Dreamcast version), with only minimal, near non-existent additions and tweaks.First off, Rayman 2 itself is a fantastic, classic platformer. It was and still is considered one of the greatest, most imaginative platforming experiences of the late 90's, early 00's, and rightly so. Ubisoft's beloved Rayman franchise has always been known for humor, imagination, excellent, dreamlike art design, a silly, fantastical story, and solid platforming. Rayman 2 contains the pinnacle of all of these traits and is undoubtedly the best of Rayman's adventures (untilOriginsandLegendscame along and blew everybody's mind, that is). Unfortunately, what was considered pretty awesome in terms of control and platforming execution in 1999, may seem pretty irritating, maybe even broken in today's gaming landscape (ie. finicky camera, rough-around-the-edges gameplay mechanics, etc). If you approach Rayman 3D with an open mind, however, you'll have more than enough here to entertain you. It really is a classic for a reason, it's an awesome game.The ONLY new addition here in Rayman 3D is ... well... 3-D. It definitely isn't the best implementation of 3-D on the system, but it is adequate and actually enhances the experience, even if only by a marginal amount. Butterflies, particle effects, and just those small, very imaginative touches that are characteristic of a Rayman title, are all complimented by the 3-D.As much as I like Rayman 3D, however, I do have quite a few qualms with it. In comparision to 3DS remakes likeThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3DandStar Fox 64 3D, Rayman 3D comes across as extremely lazy. There are absolutely no additions or enhancements besides a decidedly average, sometimes even mediocre, 3-D effect. There are no new graphics or audio. There are no improvements to the controls. There are no enhancements to the sound, visuals, gameplay, nothing. This is literally a 1999 Dreamcast game slapped onto a 3DS cartridge, given a 3D option, and then given a new name to pretend it's a new game, along with a new game price. That's just plain insulting to Rayman fans, and a poor treatment of loyal customers by Ubisoft, in my humble opinion. Keep in mind that I'm not like those trolls that just bash a game simply because it is a remake. I thinkOcarina of Time 3DandStar Fox 64 3Dare exceptional examples of what remakes could and should be and would never hesitate to recommend those games to others. Again, Rayman 3D seems hideously lazy in comparison. There are even problems in this version that don't exist in others, like big frame-rate problems that can really mar the experience with lag, which is unfortunate.Considering the fact you can get basically get this very same game on the PlayStation, Playstation 2, Playstation Network, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PC, iOS, DS, and now the 3DS, it's hard to justify recommending purchasing this particular version new. Such lazy efforts by publishers should not be encouraged, in my opinion. If there were notable enhancements to the visuals, audio, and gameplay aspects, then I would say this is a definitely good purchase to make. This is a tough dilemma for me though, as it is genuinely hard not to recommend Rayman 2: The Great Escape, which is truly worthy of its place as one of the better video games of its time. If you have never played Rayman 2 and you have a 3DS, then I say get it now. If you have played it before, but don't have a copy, I'd say get this. If you're like me and love Rayman 2: The Great Escape, even then I'd recommend this game. However, I would say to all that if you do buy this, buy it used and cheap, because that is all this version is worth.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2011"}

Definitely a top contender for shooter of the year.  The visuals, especially the island, look amazing.  The action is intense, varied, and extremely fun.  There are so many options on how you tackle a situation.There are plenty of things to do on the island to raise your money and xp.  The money can be spent on more powerful weapons(which there are plenty of) and the xp can be spent on upgrades and abilities for your character that really enhance the way the game is played.I will admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the FC2. It was fun at first but quickly became repetitive and boring due to many flaws in the game.  Thankfully, FC3 contains none of these flaws.

I felt like my weapons sucked, I had no ammo, no stimpacks, and couldn't cause enough damage to enemies to kill them.  I spent most of the time looking for ammo, money, and health.  Then I got hooked into the game and now Fallout 3 has become one of my favs. You will start kicking but once you start finding the laser and plasma rifles.Some tips to get you into the game:BTW, If your playing a character with good Karma, this prob wont apply, but check some FAQS to see that doing the things below wont kill some future side quests.Start with the main missions first.  Play until you reach around level 9 and after the galaxy news radio mission.  Right around the tranquility lane quest is where I got hooked.At this point you should be able to kill raiders with little effort.  It also helps to get the locker in Megaton after completing the Power of the Atom quest.COLLECT EVERYTHING YOU FIND and sell it to the vendors.  The fist three places I went to do this was the Super-duper Mart, Paradise Falls, and Evergreen Mills.  Collect tin cans, plates, empty bottles, EVERYTHING you find, and sell it to the vendors for caps.  It all adds up.  If the Talon guys in Paradise Falls shoot at you, kill them and take their weapons and armor.  Loot that ENTIRE place.  there are lockers you can use in P.F. to put all the stuff you find, and then start making cargo trips to sell the stuff or stash it in your locker.If you have a buddy with you, you can give him things to carry as well, doubling your carrying capacity.In Evergreen mills, there is a vendor inside the tunnels.  You can loot all the garbage in his shop as well as the cave and sell it to him until his money runs out, then buy some things you need from him so you can sell him more stuff, keep doing this. HINT* that vendor has a weapon that  is one of the most powerful small arms in the game, I always have it on me.  But you have to kill him to get it.It helps to have a high repair skill so you can get more money for equipment that is in better condition.  You will have MANY duplicate weapons and armor.The locker in Megaton seems to be infinite.  whenever my partner and I are full, I go back to Megaton and stash the stuff in my locker.  I sell the excess stuff like extra armor and weapons, and junk like plates cups bottles, pre-war $, cigarettes and cartons.There is endless looting in this game, houses, tunnels, enemies, cities, etc.  It didn't dawn on me that I could stock up on bottles and cans and the vendors would buy them. You can sell the junk to ANY vendor, Moira in Megaton, the traveling merchants (the guys outside megaton, canterbury Commons, Arefu, etc), doctors,the diners, the merchants in Rivet City, even if they only sell medicine or food, if people can sell you anything, you can sell THEM anything.  After a while you will find so much ammo from looting, you wont need to buy it anymore.  Ammo is the one thing I don't sell because you never know when your going to pick up a weapon that uses it and it doesn't weigh anything.I payed attention to the following stats:Strength- so I can carry moreBarter- to get more $ from the vendorsScience and lockpick skills - so I can get into more places for more lootrepair skill- to have better equipment and to yield a higher price selling it to vendors ( a single, good condition laser or plasma weapon will net you close to 800c)I realized the plasma weapons were very powerful, so I raised my energy weapon stats as well.I found there aren't a lot of main missions, and if you just do the main ones the game will be over very shortly.  The side quests, looting, collecting, and exploring are the bread & butter of this game.The one thing I didn't like about Oblivion was that the enemies got harder to kill as you leveled up.  I thought, was is the point in leveling up then?  In Fallout 3, the enemies do scale slightly, but once you reach around level 10, they get super easy, even the Behemoths.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"BRUTALLY UNCIVILIZED","reviewText":"The working relationship between a game designer and his publisher is never a simple one. So I would not know where exactly to place the blame, Sid Meyer or 2K GAMES. But in the end, it does not matter. Because it is simply sad to see a great gaming franchise came to this.THIS IS NOT A CIVILIZATION GAMEA great number of major features of this beloved series have been simply removed. A fellow gamer called this \"Civilization For Dummies\" and he is absolutely right.There is no trading maps or technologies. There is no claiming resources outside your borders by building a colony. There is no need for transport ships as units apparently are now all..amphibious (and they need 15-20 turns to cross an ocean!). There are no city-growth milestone requirements (granary, aqueduct, refrigeration). There is no culturally conquering an enemy city (detonating a \"culture bomb\" by consuming a Great Artist will only get you extra territory tiles but no cities). There are no spies nor health/pollution balance. And there are no armies (please read on).ARMY CASTRATIONSomeone please tell me what was so wrong with armies that had to be yanked out? Napoleon almost conquered Europe with one army. Germany almost conquered the eastern hemisphere with three and the US still holds a two-and-a-half armies doctrine. How can a turn-based game be called Civilization unless one can emulate, well, a real civilization? Building an army, seasoning it on minor conflicts and then going for the enemy's capital was one of the most fun parts of any Civilization game. Why Sid, why?YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE YET CANNOT CLIMB MOUNTAINS?!Movement should be hindered by rough terrain. Units that have 3 or 4 moves on the plains should not be expected to do more than 1 or 2 on a mountain, right? Well, no. Mountains seem to be those magical places no unit can climb or pass through (not even ...helicopters of jet fighters!). And I cannot see how this makes for more complicated strategic decisions than timing your movements, claiming the high ground and having a bonus for elevated artillery?UNIT STAMPEDEA major issue for me, this was what really ruined the game. For some unfathomable reason units cannot be stacked. A worker can coexist with a military unit but that's it. Artillery and shock-cavalry are very vulnerable to attacks and (with the new hexagon layout) one would need ...six defensive units to protect a single artillery battery.As a result, units keep getting on each other's way (especially when ordered to move for distances that require more than a turn), they refuse to even pass through friendly units (!) and the \"tactical\" considerations that result from this are trivial. And whenever besieging an enemy city, one has to endlessly maneuver his units around it (while exposed to its bombardment) whereas wounded units are never easy to withdraw.You cannot even garrison more than a single unit within a city. Not that it would make a difference, since the garrisoned unit is not automatically awaken to fight back when the city is under attack(!), the city is left to defend itself.CAN YOU REALLY COMMAND WITHOUT A...CENTRAL COMMAND?The economy is nose-diving into the red and you want to reduce the percentage going into research for a while to avoid having units of yours deleted one by one? The fickle people of your civilization are unhappy and you want to placate them by increasing their entertainment allocation? You have discovered conscription and you want to upgrade all your musketeers into recruits? Well, TOUGH LUCK! There is not central command screen to do so. Only advisers that you have to thank for annoying you.You have zero control of both your cities resource distribution and your national economy. And units have to be hunted down and upgraded one by one.Speaking of the economy, when are going to see a Civilization game where one can run and manage a national debt?NO FREE EYE-CANDY IN THIS UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN A STALE ONE.The game does look new and polished and the units are well designed but not cutting edge and not without a steep hardware price. If you expect anything comparable to STARCRAFT II crispiness you will be disappointed - at my 1280x1024 resolution it is not easy to discern roads from railroads.The system I am running my copy was top of the line about a year ago and still I had to tweak the video settings with a mix of high and medium to get it running. Even then, whenever I scroll to a different location of the map, I can see the image fleshing out, just like zooming in a Google-Earth map.So one can only wonder: why should one need a...Cray to run a Civilization game at full?STEAM OF WARThe game requires OnLine Activation (and rumored perpetual reactivation every few days) and has to be tied to a STEAM account. Effectively this means that the game is a piece of rentware the buyer never really owns and yet it is sold at full price. I realize that to some people this may not be a serious issue so, in case you are wondering, I deducted a single star from my overall rating of the game because of its DRM scheme. To every other gamer however, you can now make an informed decision.This was a major disappointment. I never though I'd say this but I while playing the latest Civilization game I caught myself wondering if they would ever make...CALL TO POWER III.New gamers, steer clear of this mess, this is NOT what a Civilization game plays like.Seasoned gamers, we know better than to call this a Civilization game.Sorry Sid, EPIC FAIL.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"David Rey \"dmajor\"","summary":"30+ hours in the game Review","reviewText":"Well I just reached Anor Londo, am at level 44 and think I can safely give a review for this game.First of all let me say that Demon's Souls was one of my favorite games of all times.  I spent 80 hours on it.  And that with a full time job, 4 classes and a relationship.  So sleep got sacrificed. But that game was so addictive I had to loan it to a friend to get it out of my house so I could sleep.  LOLThat being said, part of the reason I'm rated this game so high is because I loved the first one so much.Here are the PROS and CONS of this game so far:PROS:1. LONG:  This game is basically Demon's Souls with like 2 times the content.  I'm only almost at halfway I think in this game and I've already spent 30+ hours.  So content wise, you have enough here to get more than your money's worth.2.  Graphics: Very nice.  The environments are beautifulT and the game has no loading screens other than after you die.  Considering how big this game's map is, that's an accomplishment in and of it's self.3. Music: Just like Demon's Souls, it plays only in boss fights or in in the particularly safe area.  The soundtrack to this is really good in my opinion.  The music can really get your blood boiling in a hard battle.4.  Character Design:  The enemies are vary a lot and the models look great.  The AI is done in a way to make to keep you on your toes a lot and very slow to approach and enemy you haven't met before.5.  Weapons: Wow, there are so many to choose from. And this time they added a feature that explains the little icons for the stats.6.  Multiplayer:  You can still summon people into your game like before to help.  You can also invade other ppls games.  They also added a new feature called covenants that make things even more interesting.  You can also report an invader if he kills you.7.  Bosses: So far they have been all really cool and tough.8. Hard: I love a challenge and wanted this game to be hard.  It delivers this VERY WELL.  But what makes it really a good thing is because it adds to the dangerous feel of the atmosphere and the world. It's easy to get lost in the world and feel a fear of dying and progressing due to this relentless difficulty.9.  You can see the areas you need to reach in a distance.CONS:1. Cheap:  In my 30+ hours of play I only met a couple of bosses that were a bit cheap.  The main problem is that the game doesn't give you much time to assess whats going on and.. you are dead.  This is taken to the highest degree with the Stray Demon.  But they made him and \"optional\" boss so i can forgive that.  The Capra Demon was another one that was ridiculous.  Also, the treasure chests that eat you and kill you with no warning.  That is cheap.  But it did scare the crap out of me so again, I forgive that.2.  Lag:  The frame rate will drop really low in some areas and also the controls will have a big lag in the middle of a fight sometimes. It doesn't happen enough to piss you off and make it unplayable.  It just happens every now and then... Its annoying cause that can get you killed, but it is rare. Still they should fix that.  I didn't have that problem in Demons Souls ever.3.  Hard: Yeah, I know i say this in the pros section.  It's here as a CON because some times it feels a bit too much.  It's almost like they are skirting a thin line between healthy very hard, and unfair.  For example, you can get cursed in this game and it takes half your health.  That is fine but they don't tell you much on how to cure it and also, there are some areas, The Hollows, where it can happen in a VERY inopportune spot where getting a cure would be almost impossible.  Nothing is impossible in this game, but sometimes it can seem that way.4.  Lack of explanation of weapons and items like the Fire Keeper Soul or how to equip magic or how humanity works, etc.  I don't want them to hold our hands but a little more basic explanation through NPC's would be nice so we don't have to guess or look on line.5. Can't meet up with someone you know to play with. I know that breaks the atmosphere but lets face, we are sharing notes with each other and summoning anyway, why not let us invite people we know to play too?  I don't think it would hurt anything.Over all this game is very solid and addictive to play.  In a way Demon's Souls was a bit better as it wasn't as hard as this game.  But it offers WAY more content and that is really all i wanted from Dark Souls.. and they more than delivered.  The areas and the design is so good and the combat is so addictive that you will wannna keep playing it.Also, though I said it was a CON, in a way it is nice that you are not told EVERYTHING cause it makes you surprised when you accidentally find something. :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2011"}

For me, that ending would've bumped this game from a 3 star to a 5 star for me.  But the other problems with gameplay and dialogue are just too much to fully ignore.Me, I was horrified and appalled by the demo, which had some awful dialogue and that stupid contrived kid thing with Shepard.  But looking back, I think the dialogue has always been this kind of average/below average since the first game, and I only started noticing now.  I may have missed the fact due to my shouting my own dialogue at the screen, which I think is better, and I know is wittier.***********I do realize the ending is controversial, but I never had any idea it would cause such a vicious backlash amongst reviewers.  Personally, I loved it, yet it's also frustrating because it's the end, with no further explanation, and yet I love it because it's left like that without a whole lot of pointless explanation.I don't think the ending alone is worth people giving it 1-star and complaining so loudly, and I don't know why they'd be complaining so viciously about it.Since gameplay is my biggest problem, I'll start with it:I'd like to start by thanking the in-game war criminal and enemy of all sentient life who thought it was a good idea to get rid of guns that had INFINITE AMMO with a brief few seconds to vent heat, with a new system of SEVERELY LIMITED AMMO with heat sink clips, because they make \"clicky noises now!  CLICKY NOISES!!!!\"This had existed since Mass Effect 2, but it's exacerbated in this game, as bullets do far less damage against enemies that are souped up as thick as Gears of War steroid guzzlers, and some wearing armor so insanely thick and heavy, they literally need engines in their suits just to manage the tremendous weight.  An entire clip from an assault rifle can't even take down the most basic, low-level foot soldiers anymore.  I've literally found myself in situations where I ran out of ammo (THANK YOU AFOREMENTIONED WAR CRIMINAL; I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT AFTER THE WAR) and ended up dead, or having to rush enemies and pop them in the head repeatedly, or distract them with biotic powers while scouring for heat sinks around the barely visible map.And of new gameplay features; the cover-based combat takes on a new importance with the insanely high armor and insanely low weapon damage, as well as with new options allowing you to roll around.  I have never encountered a situation where this roll has not been a detriment or served no purpose other than to botch my attempt at hitting cover, and instead roll against the cover, and stand back up out in the open.  Similar such rolls from cover to cover provide a great way to go nowhere in the middle of a firefight or get caught in a near-infinite loop because you're too clumsy to handle the controls to get out of rolling around back and forth, or just awkwardly stepping back.  This stupid roll system has even caused me to stop sprinting through most levels, because I will get caught in corners from an unintended roll, and end up smacking against it into cover.THEN COMES the end of the game... We all lose, Earth and then the entire galaxy is destroyed, and everyone loses... because Shepard is too stupid to jump or climb a weird-looking pile of debris.Okay, so that's not really the end, but that was the first time in the entire Mass Effect series, even ahead of the first game's sloppy ground rover, that I had to re-load a save because I got stuck.Mild spoiler:On London, after clearing out the Reaper forces as part of the mission to take out a Hades cannon to secure landing ground for Hammer, I come across that cracked-open building, with the empty bookcase in front of me and the fire on the right.  After I found the chest-high wall to get up on, and it plays the cutscene of my shuttle being shot down, I somehow fell off that height, back to where I started.And I could not get back up.  There was no chest-high wall to crawl over, and I could not jump or climb atop the small debris pile to get back up to that position.  I spent a full 10 minutes wandering around trying to find a way around before reloading, and realizing that the game REMOVES the chest-high wall after this cutscene, meaning \"*** YOU IF YOU SLIP OFF - Love Bioware\"Leading up to the ending, nothing in the story impressed or inspired me.  I could barely gather up enough interest or care to do most of the side missions, most of which were incredibly short (thankfully) and involve a lot more loading than actual gameplay.  Other main storyline missions seemed to lead me around in circles, with no real plan other than \"Do this, bend over backwards, and do a flip for this shady criminal person so that they will pledge support for the final assault\".  And so early on they dug up a Big Magic Macguffin in the form of a magical superweapon that we JUST DISCOVERED RIGHT NOW to completely wipe out all the Reapers, maybe.Another new feature that I thought would serve some purpose is a SUPPORT system in dialogue.  At random areas, two people will be arguing, usually about some ethical or moral or legal issue, and you have the option to support one or the other and end the argument.  Some of them seemed to be important, and potentially have an effect on the end-game (such as whether to triage wounded more harshly due to the potential of dwindling medical supplies) but ultimately don't.Another part of the story that frustrated me was the stupid DREAM SEQUENCES!  I won't say anymore on them, because they aren't that frequent and they're not a huge nuisance.Another issue I have involves bugs and glitches.  Compared to the previous two games, this one is loaded with lots of odd glitches and bugs.  Very frequently the game has frozen during loading sequences (compared to Never with the last two), and I've had triggers either fail to start (such as on Thessia, when the Asari told me to man the mounted gun, then after I kill everything, nothing happens, and the Asari captain keeps screaming for me to man the gun, even though nothing is coming at us) or be delayed long enough for me to think something has gone wrong.And the music; up until the ending, I barely noticed it.  I thought it was weak and insignificant, a huge step down from the previous games, the way Modern Warfare 3's music was barely-there compared to Hans Zimmer's work in Modern Warfare 2.But then there's the ending...I won't spoil it, but I spent an entire hour just playing through all possible endings, shocked and awed and every other stockphrase for blown away and shaken.  For those who've already played it, I ultimately went with the middle choice, the one with the beam and the green light.The ending was something utterly colossal and phenomenal.  It was ascensional, if that's a real word, and if not, then I make it a new word.  It was the sort of event that doesn't just change things forever like an \"Independence Day\" type ending, but completely changes everything for everyone forever.  It reminded me a lot like the endings of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and the book sequel.  The next stage of sapient life.And that epilogue was something.  It makes me wonder about what happened with the Normandy at the end, the Mass Relays, and who is Buzz Aldrin's Stargazer?!  And what stories does he have to tell about The Shepard?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2012"}

One ending for a game about choices, so basically your choices don't matter and it doesnt change anything in the end. I really don't understand how Bioware could let this happen. They have such a good rep, and now all fans will be questioning if the games they put out will be worth investing in. This series was excellent, a truly beautiful gaming experience, until the end.

It was MUCH different then any game I ever played, after all. Even today, being an RPG fan, this still gets a place in my heart.The game was released near the SNES's last breath. And Square and Nintendo worked together to make this game.GAMEPLAY: Very fun! It's an RPG with style. You can even jump. Their are lots of areas, and tons of secrets, and mini-games! The battle system is neat, and easy. You even get Peach/Toadstool and even Bowser in your team! You are going to love it.GRAPHICS: Whoah! This is one of the best looking SNES games out there.

{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Fun Game, Zapper Feels Cumbersome and Lacks Ergonomics","reviewText":"As a target shoot that competes, I love to play Wii games that help me refine me eye-hand coordination and response times.  That said, I was happy when Nintendo released their designs for the Wii Zapper, however, something bothered me.  The trigger was in the front while the grip was in the back.  This goes against most firearm setups as most target shooters place the grips in the front while the trigger is in the back.  This way, it feels more natural using your dominant hand as the trigger hand otherwise if you put it in reverse you either are forced to use your non-dominant hand or flip the hands around and are forced to keep the firearm pressed against your chest to keep your eyes down the sights.  The latter is an extreme no-no for anyone who has fired an actual firearm as the butt of the rifle should go against your shoulder, NOT your chest.That said, firearm practitioners will find the Wii Zapper extremely non-ergonomic and somewhat cumbersome.  Anyone who has not fired a rifle will not notice the difference and adapt.  It is understandable why the Wii Remote must be placed in front since the forward laser needs a clear line of sight, however, it takes away from the feel of the zapper.  I bought the Zapper and quickly purchased the Nyko Perfect Shot as it feels more natural as a sidearm than the Zapper as a rifle or carbine.This is not to say that the Zapper is not worth getting.  Link's crossbow training is very useful at practicing your usage of a standard Wii Remote and Nunchuck as it is with the Nyko Perfect Show.  I use my Perfect Shot on Link's Crossbow Training every now and then to improve my reaction time as well as eye-hand coordination.  The game hosts several excellent exercises to maximize efficiency with any firearm-type Wii device so it is worth paying the money over.All in all, the game makes the Zapper, not the other way around.  Get the game but get the Nyko Perfect Shot to compliment the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2008"}

So you do not have all of the blood, guts, carnage or profanity (if a game has to have that for you to like it then you will not care for this one).I went into this game with high hopes and it started out fun but the fun quickly sizzled out and turned to aggravation and it is very redundant with a story that has been played over and over. At the start of each level you start out as small Knack because for one reason or another at the end of each level Knack looses all the relics he has gathered throughout the level and becomes small again. This was part of the aggravation, all the time spent hunting for and gathering relics only to keep loosing them all. The second part came from treasures hidden throughout the game, nothing offered an immediate perk as you had to find each piece of said treasure to get the perk and chances are you won't complete any of them until you are nearly finished. Even with the perks these items provide they do nothing to change or improve the game play.There are not many games that are family appropriate so if that is what you are looking for then this would be a good game to consider but I do not think this game will be pleasing to most gamers.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

The idea that stealth and not shooting takes precedence was and still is a revolutionary concept in the video game industry. Now over a year and a half since Metal Gear Solid 2's release on the Playstation 2, Knonami has served up a healthy dosage of supplemental material for this disc.One of the things that makes this title stand out is the enormous variety in gameplay. There are various modes of play you can engage in. Hold up modes, VR missions, bomb difusals, elimination, alternate missions, over 500 in all. There's enough here to help you stave off bordom for quite a while. One of the standout features of this game are the Snake Tales. A side story feature that details Snake's mission during the main body of the game ( the full version of Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty is also included in this game). As you complete each set of challenges you unlock more playable characters, each with a varying degree of difficulty of use. Hideo Kojima has put alot on the table for you do that it doesn't feel like an \"addon\".The graphics are essentially the same as the original game for PS2. But for those who feared some of the graphical problems that were associated with the XBox version, do not fear. There is no noticiable slowdown or drop offs in the framerate ( this has given PS2 owners the nuclear sized bomb to drop on XBox owners of \"Gee, it runs fine on MY console). One thing that is different is the thermal goggle mode. The red background and bright red images has been replaced by a more \"thermographic\" scope showing degrees of heat emitted by objects.The controls are very intuitive. It takes mere minutes to become familiar with them. And if you've played any of the previous Metal Gear games for the PS2 or PS1, you'll be able to jump right in and play with no problems.The fact that this game didn't sell well on the XBox is an absolute travesty. Fortunately for PS2 owners, Metal Gear is back where it belongs, on the Sony Playstation 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2003"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An epic sequel that surpasses the original","reviewText":"Resistance 2 is the first game this generation that has truly surprised me.  I'd heard mixed reactions to the game, the negative being mostly from fans of the first game, Resistance: Fall of Man (a game I greatly enjoyed), who had alluded to the fact that Resistance 2 had lost its identity that was so well established with its predecessor.  Also, the removal of two key features of the first game, the weapons wheel, and the way in which the narrative was told (which was through narrated flashbacks), seemed to bring particular ire to these same fans.  Now that I've had the chance to play through and complete the campaign myself, I can confirm that Insomniac did make some significant changes with the second game, and it does feel quite different from the first game in several ways.  But you know what?  Insomniac has made the game bigger, badder, louder and completely epic in every way.  Resistance 2 is a much better game than its prequel, and is one of the best action first person shooters I've ever played.Let me address two things...even though I'm completely accustomed to playing FPSs that only let you carry two weapons at once (most FPSs these days), I did miss the weapons wheel from Resistance: Fall of man....a little.  The story here is very much along the same lines of the first game, but it doesn't have the same charm that you get when a British female narrator is guiding you through the tale via 1950's-esque cut scenes.  With these two things aside, in pretty much every other area, Insomniac has upped the ante.  BIG is the key word here.  Insomniac seems like they set out to make the biggest game they possibly could.  And for this gamer, they succeeded with flying colors.  Resistance 2 boasts some of the most incredible set pieces I've ever seen in a video game.  There were several moments (such as seeing the Golden Gate Bridge circa 1955 in a Chimera-occupied San Francisco) that literally left me stunned at how incredible they were.  Creature and set design seems like its coming from some of the best science fiction visionaries alive (those Chimeran ships....WOW).  The huge battles between humanity and Chimera forces are back and even larger and more chaotic this time. The scope of some of the boss battles was bewildering.  Insomniac clearly set out here to blow the minds of gamers.  If it doesn't work for you, then I can understand how the game might almost seem obnoxious at times.  But it worked for me.  When it comes to delivering a sensory experience, this game was stunning and did just that with the very best of them.The gameplay feels like a slight upgrade from the first game, similar but a little better in the right places.  The main difference I noticed is that the weapons feel more powerful and meaner (not to mention the addition of some incredible new weapons, and the scrapping of some of the lamer ones found in the first game).  The game is a technical marvel, with incredible graphics and art design, and crisp, powerful sound.  The story continues directly after the events of the first game and like its predecessor's narrative, succeeds in being intriguing and keeping you interested in what happens next.  Like everything else in Resistance 2, the story culminates into the epic, with caps it off with an ending sequence that you'll never forget.  Another area of note that I have to mention is the new enemies in the game.  They are simply awesome!  One of them, known as the Grim, attack in fast-moving hordes and conjures up eerie feelings of the running \"infected\" in 28 Days Later, except now, they're actually coming after you!I think that your reaction to Resistance 2 will depend on whether the changes Insomniac has brought to the series work for you or not.  For me, I feel that what they've done here is some brilliant work, and that Resistance 2 is a significant step up from Resistance: Fall of Man.  If Insomniac can take the best parts of both games can combine them into the upcoming Resistance 3, it could end up one of the best action FPSs we've ever seen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

I did not grow up with him, I never played any of his previous games, and I was only peripherally aware that he existed.  Having said that, however, this is a pretty fun platformer.By way of plot, Rayman owes much to Sonic.  He wanders the jungle freeing captured Teensies and beating up bad guys by punching, kicking, or bouncing on them.  Fun premise, but it's nothing really new.  As far as gameplay is concerned, Mario and Sonic have been doing this for 30 years.  3/5The visuals, however, are outstanding.  The backgrounds are lush, the foregrounds are bright and vivid, and there's always something buzzing, swooshing, flying, or crawling past the screen.  I found myself distracted several times by the beautiful environments.  5/5The character design is very fun.  Again, not having any history with Rayman, I had to read up on his origins (and lack of limbs), but his design only makes him a bit more endearing.  The bad guys - especially the mini-bosses - are fun to watch as they threaten and roar and stomp their feet.  4/5Level designs are pretty good.  I never felt cheated by the levels - something that has really turned me off platformers over the years.  As long as I paid attention to the environments and timed my jumps and kicks, I've been able to find my way through the levels.  While I haven't yet completed the game, I have yet to feel like there's any sharp difficulty spike - again, a problem that plagues many modern platformers.  The levels have gotten harder, of course, but by logical increments.  4/5Overall, this is a fun game.  A bit obscure if you know nothing about the game's history, but still a fun way to waste an evening.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2013"}

I had played KOTOR on my original Xbox and didn't find it to my tastes but with the huge outpouring of great regard for this game I placed my dollars down and jumped in.Initially I found the game very tedious, probably in part to my ignorance of the canon of the ME universe but also because I wasn't expecting ME2 to be quite so verbose. It's one long cut scene after another whereby my language choices seemed uninteresting to me and not really affecting anything initially. You see in ME2 there's two basic components of gameplay; firstly and most predominantly you have huge amounts of in-game rendered cut-scenes which you can influence via question and statement selection and thus gain important info on based on your choices, and secondly there is quests via exploration and combat. If you don't like the idea of listening to many hours of dialogue then the combat is really all that's left and frankly neither worked for me.With regards to the chat I found the voice acting of the main character Shepard horribly monotonous which is a problem as you'll be hearing him a lot. You have to interact with NPCs as that's how you derive most of the missions and side-quests and the lead actor chose the most flat and dull delivery possible; never raising his voice, never sounding sad... just no ability to drum up sufficient emotion at all. And if the main character doesn't care then why should I? Thankfully other roles are performed with more adeptness.Another problem I felt was I was never sure how important a choice would be. For example after many hours of not really interacting with anyone significantly, one simple selection I made without much thought had a huge effect on things and it caught me totally off-guard. Maybe that's what the developers were going for, but it meant I felt I had to be on point all the time never able to relax with the game and just make choices that I wanted but instead having to make choices that would benefit the flow of the game.But I persevered and found things picked up once I could explore the few planets in each sector. Occasionally by scanning a planet an anomaly would be detected and I was able to land on the planet and have a bit of fun exploring and fighting. Unfortunately these side excursions are very few and far between and it's during these fights though that you realise how limited the fighting element is. Sure you have lots of weapons and 'biotic' powers but what's the point when a sniper rifle does the job just fine? I played the entire game using it rarely needing to select a different weapon.Perhaps that's the problem - ME2 gives you about as much as you put into it. If I were to try to use the varied weapons and powers or attempt to get more engrossed with the story line, and the many branches that the story offered I might have enjoyed it more. Maybe...But after 29 hours of cut scenes and having completed it (without dying) I felt I'd given ME2 all I could and it just was boring. The main gameplay mechanic in ME2 is something from a by-gone era, it's an electronic version of those choose-your-adventure books - almost like Burn Cycle on the Philips CDi. And it's a step back.Now I realise I'm in the minority. I know a lot of people will strongly disagree and vote on my review accordingly - but ME2 for me was trite, too self-important, lacked true gameplay and I for one won't be visiting the universe of ME3. If everything I've listed as negative sounds positive to you then you'll obviously love it but do be prepared for a lot of sitting around, your controller in your lap, listening to a bored actor deliver his lines.Ugh!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

This is about as good as it gets to the feeling of the old west. When you play it, you get the feeling you are really there and know what it felt like back then. The movements as in the horses are dead on. You can be as good as you want or as bad. They leave that choice entirely up to you, none of it is forced on you. This is basicly a simulation of a western. You can rent rooms, buy whatever in the stores and choose what mission you want to do in any order or just skip them. Theres no real set path, its all up to you as it would be in real life. You decide what happens next, thats the best thing about this game. And just as in life as an example, suddenly you get rebels that come blasting through town guns blazing and you can either just stand there and do nothing or go after them and blow them away. You will be very impressed with it all especially the graphics. Doesn't get much better than this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0001I9YE4","description":"Call Of Duty: Finest Hour leads you back into the World War, where you will experience epic battlefield moments in the war&apos;s most legendary conflicts. Fight alongside ordinary men who fought and died for freedom and changed the world.","reviewerName":"Jaha","summary":"Beautiful graphics and not much else.","reviewText":"I am a casual FPS gamer and felt like having some fun with an older title.  So I picked up Call of Duty because I kept hearing how great this game was.  At first glance the game was very beautiful.  Very similar to Medal of Honor with a lot going on to overwhelm your senses.  I liked the fast pace gameplay and crazy action going on everywhere.Unfortunately this novelty wore off way too fast.  The game gets extremely intense very fast and it is easy to get lost in all the action.  The levels are linear but when battles are screaming on you can lose your bearings and targets very easily.  The controls also are pretty clunky which I thought was odd.  The Xbox controller is perfect for fast paced games but in CoD I found aiming to be a constant frustration.  Couple this with exceptionally HORRIBLE allied A.I. and your in for a major curse fest.  I have never seen such a blatant misuse of allied characters in a game.For instance in one of the first missions you must protect a tank stored in a warehouse while Germans swarm from all over with rifles, machine guns, and Panzerfaust.  Sounds pretty exciting so far...  Well, once you get to the second story windows the fun begins.  Germans swarm out and take cover behind crates and vehicles.  Your job is to snipe them before they get too close.  The key targets are the bazooka men and the machine gunners.  Let a bazooka in and the tank is doomed.  Let a machine gun set up and your toast.  Well it sounds easy enough and you have good ol' Commissar Sokolov to bark orders at you and where you need to concentrate your fire.  Here's the rub.  Sokolov's orders sometimes give you plenty of advance warning to set up where you need to be and to get the crucial targets.  But later in the battle he starts rattling them off at lightning speed.  Good thing you have several AI soldiers covering you right.  Wrong.  As far as I can tell all these guys are for is to get in your way when you are trying to duck in a window.  They must know how much I enjoy getting pelted with hot lead while reloading my 5 round single shot bolt action sniper rifle.This causes a tedious nature of repetition in the game.  You are an army of one among many.  AI never serves any point but to bark orders at you and get shot.  In that same very mission I must have had to replay it at least half a dozen times on EASY just to get the hang of it down.  Once I finally bested the pesky German attack I was immediately gunned down outside the building in the second stage of the mission.  Not to worry, I'll just continue from the end of the last objective right...  WRONG!CoD offers nothing in the way of in-game checkpoints.  That meant when I left the factory after having so much fun getting shot and laughed at by my comrades, I had to, yup!, do it all over again!  Wow talk about gamer satisfaction!  And what the heck was the insanely realistic reload times!  Especially on the sniper rifle.  It takes at least a good 5 seconds to reload the thing and when you have to hit a target as fast as possible the game won't let you reload just one round.  You always have to reload 5.Now, don't get me wrong, I am all for challenging games, but I am a casual gamer and don't want to replay a lever 20 times.  A game like that will only frustrate me to resell the game at a drastically discounted price.  What truly enrages me about CoD is that the game is ridiculously hard on EASY so I can't even handicap the game to help me through the tough parts.  Add in the fact that Xbox has virtually no cheat codes for like invincibility I guess I am going to have to go all gamer-geek on this one and actually try and master an FPS.  A skill I have no desire to learn.So my advice is for the casual gamer or those who actually like to have fun playing a game.  If you must play a WWII shooter pick up Medal of Honor or something else with not as steep a learning curve.  This game is clearly designed for hard core players who have little else to do but replay a mission all day long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2005"}
{"product_name":"B008AU4YEA","description":"","reviewerName":"Marshall W. Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"Great addition to the Rayman franchise & still 2D (like Rayman ought to be).","reviewText":"I first encountered Rayman the better part of 17 years ago on the Atari Jaguar. The original Rayman was a visual treat at the time, with a level of animation that you simply hadn't seen in earlier 2D titles on 16-bit systems. In a lot of ways, it showed that 2D visuals (and solid, tightly-controlled platforming gameplay) were still relevant in a time when the gaming world was going ga-ga for 3D and polygons.Sadly, UbiSoft and Rayman would follow the 3D suit with Rayman 2 and its home console sequels. These were good games in their own right, but lacked some of the magic and heart of the original. It wasn't until Rayman Origins hit the major consoles in 2012 that the limbless protagonist would see a proper return to form and it was a great return, basically reimagining the 2D platforming of the original while taking advantage of all the bells, whistles and eye-candy that the current-gen consoles could muster.I expected Rayman Legends to be more of the same. If it had just been that, then I would have been satisfied (because Origins was very, very good). Ubi Soft was apparently not satisfied with just recycling Origins, and it's obvious from the get-go that they upgraded their Framework engine in subtle ways, such as incorporating 3D elements into the 2D levels (used extensively with the bosses) and a new lighting system that lightens or silhouettes characters on the fly based on the environment (which seems to make the 2D visuals have a lot more &#34;pop&#34; onscreen than in Origins).Technological improvements would have basically amounted to nothing other than flash if Legends didn't also have some substance behind it, and again, Ubi Soft delivers. Level design is great, and while it's a typical platformer on the surface, environmental puzzles are seamlessly incorporated and the boss battles are likely the highlight of the affair. Offline multiplayer is present and is good fun, and seems like more of a natural extension of the single player game instead of the often-chaotic and frustrating gameplay found in some other 2D platformers of late.Rayman Legends is basically a joy to play. It's a great single player game and it's just as great when more people are involved (a rarity). It would make a great family game for players at different skill levels. It should be noted that the Wii U version is probably the best way to go thanks to the Wii U Gamepad options, but you can't go wrong on the other platforms either.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

Tons of collectibles, literally pitch perfect platforming, incredible amounts of stages and extra content, bonus levels, and widely varied gameplay. Graphics look amazing, and the Wii U version uses the gamepad in pretty cool ways that never seem gimicky.

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Great game if its' unique flavor is indeed your cup of tea.","reviewText":"I got SH 2 years ago. For its' time the graphics were great and the story was definetly something original no other game developer team had tried before. If you were to ask which I found more scary..being attacked by flesh eating mutants or receiving a genuine letter from a deceased loved one written AFTER they had died I'd be inclined to say the later.Regardless that is the Dilehma James is faced with. His dead wife has lured him back to Silent-hill and you know THAT is not going to be a happy walk in the park.First of all let me say I think this game really made people \"re-think\" the survival horror genre. It tried being witty, intelligent, and chalked with macabre symbolism as opposed to zombie arms that broke through windows. Even the side characters were more than simply devices to move the plot along. Eddie and Angela have their own interesting inner demons too and Maria looks just like James's deceased wife though her personality is drastically different. If that is not enough to sell you on this premise I could simply say \"Oh yeah this game introduces Pyramid-Head\". That alone will have people lining up in droves.Now putting everything good about the game aside I'm going to be brave and talk about why I think while it deserves \"praise\" it still is not all that and a side order of extra big fries. Yes, I know this is the game the elite Silent Snoots put on a pedestal. The one game no other SH can compare to. The Holy Grail of team silent. Is it that earth shattering?  For me anyway it was not.As with the other games there is a suspenseful build up. First it is sounds. Then it is fleeting shadows. Finally it is full blown creatures. The only problem is often there are not enough monsters and instead you are forced to aimlessly wander around trying to collect keys or pieces of an obscure puzzle. Now I admit sometimes its' fun to run around an enviorment without fear of dying to see those little details. However in a survival horror game you should never begin lulling into a calm sense of security and that's the biggest flaw of the game. In most areas I felt \"safe\" and that the monsters were easy to manuever around. Every once in awhile an eager lurching Pyramid-Head made my heart race a bit but besides for the beloved apron adorned big guy no other creatures instilled in me any amount of dread.The true disturbing factor comes from interacting with Eddie and Angela. I will not divulge why they are so psychologically unstable but talking with them alone requires a few steel nerves. These are normal people that \"snapped\" and you get the feeling you are a participant in their  horrorifying delusions. Things get stranger when you meet Maria, the sultry Dopple-ganger of Mary who embodies all Jame's sexual fantasies given flesh. Is she Jame's wife's ghost? Sadly Silent Hill never makes an explaination that easy so you have to keep playing to find out.As the game slowly drags on it picks up when we find out James has his own dark secret. When you finally get that revelation everything comes together and you know why Silent Hill's foggy streets beckoned to him.Now there is one thing I like to make clear to the fans. Pyramid Head pursued James because James subconciously wanted to be punished for his past misdeeds however  a few references from the other games prove the executioner has been apart of the town history for a long time. PH was not manifested from James, he was merely drawn to James. This is why it is OK PH was in the movie and ok he is in SH V.Examples1. In origins the gillespie house had a picture of PH. Origins took place way before Jame's arrival.2. The Room talked about \"the red devil\" and Jimmy stone. This story ties into PH if you read it carefully.3. Another document in Origins talked about \"the executioner\" as well.4. In SH 3 there is a picture of one of Alessa's past goddess incarnations with PH in the background amongst a few other people. You can view it in the cathedral.I just wanted to clear that up because there is a HUGE DEBATE raging PH should be confined to only this game which I find to be a waste of breath.As you can expect the music in this game is haunting and very befitting of Jame's sad tale and descent into madness to find his redemption. If there is one thing SH 2 gets right it is estabalishing a powerful thought provoking mood.Combat is what you expect from SH. You are not going to be able to fight like a marine. A plank with nails in it is your first weapon. That should tell you something right there. Eventually you get a few guns and a few other melee weapons besides your buddy \"Plank-zorz\".  Aside from stomping on monsters when they're down you are not a golden glove brawling champion. Perhaps it is for this reason it is good why most of the monsters are so gosh darn pathetic. Besides for the acid spewing of the patient monsters and the sheer size of the abstract daddies nothing made me feel over-whelmed that often.So in the end I'll say this game is great for atmosphere and a brilliant story. If you can stomach a horror game with more emphasis placed on wandering around, solving puzles, and talking to crazy lunatics to glean disturbing revelations you can likely over look the fact the combat engine is uninspired and the monsters are more scarce than the items in your inventory.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2008"}

While Rock Band and Guitar Hero have the excitement, there just is also the gimmicks of playing with more than just guitars. Well Nintendo has shown that recently with Sambe De Amigo with songs to download to, and now they are about to show that all over again with a little help from your favorite Mii's and just a little imagination, you can jam to any musical instrument, and anyway you like to play is here on the Wii, with Wii Music.Wii Music, one of the more surprisingly hyped games showcased at the E3 Video Game Expo earlier this year, is finally available for the Nintendo Wii. The game features no outrageous gimmicks like a guitar controller or a dance mat like the ones from Dance Dance Revolution, but just the simplicity that anyone can play and make your own music. The graphics look great and bring in a more natural way of playing to your favorite songs from Nintendo's past like the themes from Super Mario Brothers and The Legend Of Zelda, or classical standards, and even guilty pleasure pop songs like Wham!'s Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.There are over 60 different kinds of insturments to jam to from conga drums and violins, all the way to cow bells, yes I said cow bells. There also are great games to play with including Mii Maestro, where you can conduct your way through the simplicity of an orchestra, and drum solo mode, which you could play to the beat of a drum. But, you'd need the balance board from Wii Fit to play for that game, and improv jams you can custom make and record and save for your Wii viewing pleasure. Also, you can play alone, or with others to your favorite songs online through the WiiConnect online, which is a treat die hard Wii fans had wished for that even Rock Band couldn't deliver.All in all, while hard core music video gamers are more aniticapated for the releases of Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero: World Tour for the Wii, Wii Music is a unique musical experience for young and old gamers that is sure to please your wallet and the casual gamer alike, at a affordable price. It really takes my breath away, and is a fun and unique musical game that is well worth the money and in more than one musical note after another with all the different ways to can strum your heart away.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo player; A 1/2- for multiplayerOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2008"}

Immediately after finishing the demo, I preordered it.If you like action rgps or games like Fable, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, Fallout, Dragon Age, etc, you will definitely enjoy this game. If you dislike action rpgs or any of those games mentioned above, perhaps you should turn to a more turn based action.However, do not be tricked into thinking that kingdoms of amalur is all about whacking the enemy and killing everyone in your path. You have a lot of customization to do. Throughout the game, you can change the way your character looks or plays. That is, you do not have to be stuck being a mage, rogue, or warrior for the rest of your gameplay. You can change it up ANYTIME. The world within Kingdoms of Amalur is very massive, and there are many quests that you can do aside from the main story quests. I have only played 15 hrs, and I feel like I'm not within a quarter of the game. They are a lot of fun and are not linear either. Most importantly, although the game does have a lot of customizations, weapons, alchemy, blacksmith, sage crafting, etc., the game was very easy to pick up. I did not feel lost like I did with Oblivion. It felt very easy to pick up and explore.If you are looking to have many hours of fun with lots of customization involved, this game is for you.

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"A Dying Breed","summary":"Could have been so much better","reviewText":"I've been a fan of the Mortal Kombat games since playing MK1 on my Sega Genesis. Since then, I've ssen them evolve into something I never could have imagined. It seems the general consensus around harcore MK fans is, the newer 3D ones are disappointing and in some respects, I'll agree but there are some things are an improvement. Anyway, not to go off on a tangent here...MK vs. DC sounds like a great idea (after it sinks in for awhile). When I imagined how it would look and what the gameplay would be like, a smile came across my face but that might have been my own undoing with this game. I imagined a brutal gore fest where Scorpion is impaling Batman with his spear and tearing him in half, Baraka is chopping Wonder Woman to pieces with his blades, Superman is melting Liu Kang into a gooey, bloody pool with his heat vision and The Flash is hitting Jax so hard and so fast that his limbs, head and other body parts start flying off of him one by one.Unfortunately, the result was actually a watered down MK fighting game. No real brutality, no real blood and even the fatalities are just not very impressive. For instance, Baraka jumps on top of people and impales them but no close up, no pool of blood and no visible post puncture wounds. Sub-Zero body slams people after turning them into a block of ice and they explode but you only see ice chunks, instead of meat, organs and blood like one would expect. Now I understand that the addition of DC characters is going to demand accessability to a certain younger market than MK is used to and had this been a dominantly DC game, it would've worked. This game however, had all the calling cards of an MK game, minus of course those elements that make it a true MK game. Also, where are the acid pool, the human devouring trees, the spiked ceiling and all the other death traps? In the end, the lack of the mature rating did really hurt this game's ability to be truly awesome.Now. there are some good points, or I wouldn't have given it 3 stars. The graphics and animation are truly stellar, exactly what I've been waiting to see in a next gen MK game. My only beef there is, the MK characters look a helluva lot better then the DC ones. Also, they stripped down the fighting itself and took out the annoying aspects like multiple fighting stances and 15 button combos (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating) that are virtually impossible to pull off. There are still combos but you can easily get by knowing a couple or a few and the special moves. The Klose Kombat feature is really cool but the test your might, freefall and rage modes are just not that good.It's safe to say that this isn't what I was hoping for. Maybe there's another \"pure\" MK game in store in the not too distant future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2008"}

(Thanks to high noon studios.) Not only is the multiplayer fun but also the story mode in which you play from both autobot and decepticon perpectives.WFC  puts epic's unreal engine to task with very impressive graphics and layout design and the animation during transformation is very fluid.The gameplay itself is all too familiar with Epic's Gears of War,but with Robots.  From what little I have played in multiplayer mode, you can customize your very own autobot or decepticon from a range of different classes that can help or hinder your success in battle.No gripes whatsoever,Other than the somewhat bland soundtrack.But hey, that's why I prefer this game for my 360 as I can play theThe Transformers: The Movie - Original Motion Picture Soundtrackduring battle. To be honest, I had way more fun with this game than both of Michael Bay's lacklusterTransformers (Two-Disc Special Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray] films. At least the developers have paid close attention the the franchise's source/canon without the silly hi jinks or toilet humor.it's good to know that Peter Cullen is getting more recognition as the iconic Optimus Prime (And yes, you have the option to play as prime in the game along with a few other notable characters)and the voice overs are great.A must for Transfans and hardcore action gamers alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"NANCY L.

I fully expected to enter the castle after defeating the dragon but alas, cut, that's the end.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"Not the best metal gear game.","reviewText":"MGS 4 is a long winded story that occasionally lets you play. There has been a lot of discussion recently concerning the issue of cinematic elements in games such as Uncharted. The line is being blurred between the two mediums, and while I don't think this is a bad thing, it seems as though MGS 4 is an example of what is this issue is about. At the very least, it is a shining example of how video games are an art form as well. However, this game certainly has it faults.For one thing, the story is incredibly convoluted. This is its own adventure but is also wrapping up details from the previous three games. If you have not played those games, you will certainly be lost on a lot of the sub plots and references. But even if you have played them, you may not remember them. I played all three but never beat any of them. I later went back and beat MGS 2 and 3. I like MGS 3 the best. However, I must applaud the developers in sticking with their project and making this a game for true MGS fans and not dumbing it down for people who are new to the series. That being said, there is still some fun to be had in the game. The game play is pretty good despite feeling somewhat limited at times. Even some of the outdoor areas, especially towards the beginning feel no different than being in corridors. They give you a wide array of tools to use. Your  suit can reflect any surface you touch. Staying invisible is not a chore and often fun and easier to do than past games. You also can change your camo to some disguises as well and change the color of your camo suit to if you want a solid color (maybe your in bushes and just want to be all green). The weapons system is one where you collect money by picking up other guns and using the points to buy newer guns or upgrade. I found that by the end of the game, I had not even hardly used most of the possible upgrades and had plenty of points. So their is not a huge need to be conservative here and it dosn't take too long to get points. And you will always have more than enough ammo.The bad part about this game are some of the cut scenes which are really long and distract from the game. Often you might find yourself caught up in a fun sequence and then advance only to find yourself watching a 20 minute plus video. Some are more interesting others and some are just quite boring. The voice acting is good, but does not feel as animated as other games like the Uncharted series. Snake spits out words in that grizzly voice except now, because of his age, he sometimes chokes on them almost. Every character has one tone of voice, and it can be annoying to watch especially if your not a huge MGS fan and don't really care that much. These cut scenes make up a huge part of the game. Without them, the game is probably only around six hours. The last cut scene is almost an hour and a half. They are ridiculously long and this loses some points for me.There is online in this. It is the exact same gameplay as the single player and is surprisingly fun. You can sneak up on guys and there are a variety of different modes. The downside is that you have to create an additional two accounts besides your psn to play this. You need a Konami and MGS account. It is not user friendly and pain in the you know what.MGS 4 is a fun game that has its exciting moments. Too often the game is halted and the story is told through cut scenes that can run way too long. The last boss battle is memorable, but the ending cut scene is not. This game would be easy to find now for a cheap price. I would recommend playing it if you like action/stealth and have enough patience for the cut scenes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2011"}

Bejeweled twist is no different as it is a blast to play.

Many times I pull this out while on a plane to make the time go faster or I will pull it out while waiting for my wife to try on clothes at the department store.The big difference or \"twist\" with this version of bejeweled is that you can rotate 4 gems in a clockwise manner to help you make matches.  This adds a unique take on the bejeweled game and actually makes it more fun than the original in my opinion.  You can play in Classic mode and Zen mode.

I enjoyed it so much that I bought the first two games and a GAEMS G155 which allowed me to play them on the road! So when there is a portable Uncharted available that is a full length game and seemingly have equally good graphics as with the first Uncharted, I just got to play it!And the game definitely did not disappoint. The game has a good story, similar type of humor and style of play. There are a lot of cut scenes, which blend well. I love to play games in story/campaign mode.The controls are pretty much the same as PS3, thanks to the dual analog sticks. The touch screens are very nice additions. There are times on PS3 that I always mess up on jumping due to perspectives of the screen and the way I use the analog sticks. On Vita, I just need to touch the area to climb or jump. It minimized a lot of my frustrations of killing Drake due to mechanics. Same with fighting a person. Nice to just be able to swipe in direction of swing the fists!Besides using the touch screen to make certain actions more intuitive, there are few novelties that I found very intriguing! First is the charcoal scratch. In the spirit of scratching a lottery ticket, this is very cool to uncover clues! Second is manifestation of invisible symbols on a \"blank\" scroll. This requires me to put up vita with a lamp behind, and move around to show each symbols! I assume the developers use the rear (video) camera to recognize light source (blind spot?) Another new control (for Uncharted games) is using the Vita as controller to avoid rocks in a raging downstream river. Any how, as a technologist and a gamer, these novelties are definitely VERY COOL!The graphics is darn good for hand held. The level of details for water fall (white water) is quite good. I love seeing the sun (during sunset) project soft but defined brightness on one side of a castle, and yet cast shadow on others. And there is no latency as I rotate my 360 viewing! This is a testament to the power of Vita.The sound is best if you put on a good set of stereo headphones. I get a good amount of bass, and directional (left/right) feel when rotating around a scene. A good example is near water streams,All in all, it's fabulous to play a full Uncharted game(30+ chapters taking me 12+ hours) on a portable console! It was fun and worth my time! The price is reasonable for game of this caliber and I will likely replay many of the chapters to do better than before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

The controls are standard fair GTA, and the game feels like it is taking itself less seriously than GTAIV did by going back a bit on its emphasis of realism. The missions aren't redundant, but much of what was done in this game has been done in previous GTA games, except for heists. Heists are larger missions that require preparation, and are soul source of genuine profits that let you expand you single player empire - unfortunately, there are a fixed number of these missions and what could of been expanded into a very interesting concept was left as a mechanism of the story.Online multiplayer isn't as great as people would think it would be. It is really single player with different styled missions (races, team-deathmatch, other missions) that grow tedious over time. There is potential there, but yet again Rockstar does not deliver.Graphically, the game is disappointing. Textures are rough, and the resolution on PS3 is only 720p.

I never really felt like I was missing out on anything not having a specialized gaming mouse, and I still don't really feel like I'm missing out on much. The Sidewinder does have a nice list of features, but nothing really stood out as features I really needed to enhance my gaming experience.I will admit, at first I didn't think I would like the way the side buttons stick out so much and was used to the buttons on my Logitech Revolution even though they weren't necessarily intended for gaming. After using the Sidewinder, I very much prefer the buttons to stick out. It doesn't feel as comfortable for some reason, but it the buttons are much easier to access. Other than that, I am not overly concerned about it's 10 million click lifespan. And moisture resistant coating? Maybe I don't game enough, but I don't have a problem with wet mice. ;) I've had three mice in my entire life and none of them ever broke, I just wanted to upgrade to newer technology. Also, being that they're fairly inexpensive, I don't fret over having to buy a new one every 5+ years.As for it's other features, the quick turn is nice in certain situations but most of the gaming I do, the quick turn is ignored. And I honestly don't notice any difference with it's \"2000 DPI Laser Tracking Engine\" and \"Engineered for Speed\" design. I don't feel any faster than with my old mouse! The rubber scroll wheel is standard on most mice and didn't notice anything special there either. And regarding it being called \"wide\", I can't say it's but a tiny bit wider than a standard mouse wheel. The ability to create macros out of game was an interesting touch, but I honestly didn't dabble into it much. There's really no reason not to just make your macros in game. That's what I'm used to and that's how I like it.Overall, for it's current price I'd say it's an excellent buy and definitely delivers in every aspect. Don't expect it to somehow make you better at gaming or make your gaming easier. It just doesn't do much for me to make it an obvious choice for gaming over any other premium mouse on the market.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"The best FF game ever (in my opinion) has a GBA port. Unlike the other two GBA ports, this version of the game doesn't really have any enhanced graphical backgrounds. The reason I consider this to be the best one in the series is because the fact is that there really isn't no main character (like Cloud of FF7) that the game mainly focuses on. you get to have 12 or 14 characters as all main characters (2 who are secret characters) and you get to have any of your favorite characters as a group of 4 (like Locke, Sabin, Shadow and Cyan are my favorite group) even though I like all of the characters in this game anyway. There isn't too many graphical changes in this version but just a few. when a main character is talking, they have a picture of that character in the talking box (You even get to see Kefka's face which is creepy) and Non-exeistent load times with battles and Character menus (unlike the PSone version which I also have). If you don't have FF3 for the SNES, or FF anthology (which has FF5 and FF6), then get this game. Seriously, this is the best one ever created and you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2007"}

God of War has gotten quite alot of hype which got me thinking \"is the game really THAT good\"?  So I decided to rent the game and I must say, It IS a bit overrated but the game is overall a winner.  God of War features awesome platforming and alot of array of different combos to kill your enemies.  One awesome thing about this game is the contex sensitive parts were you have to hit a bunch of buttons that appear on screen and lead the main character to do some pretty nasty stuff.  The Platforming never gets old and the puzzle are acctually...GREAT!!!  Simple and at the same time abit frustraiting.  There are alot of awesome memerable moments in the game like the very beginning where you have to fight the hydra, that part was freaking awesome!  The controls are just great, and they fit well for every combo button, did I mention there is ALOT of em'??  But of course, you have to unlock most of them.  Other then great visuals, great controls, the SOUND is like listening to a soundtrack from a motion picture, it's THAT GOOD...  Lets get to it...The Good-Best looking Ps2 game so far-Great Controls-Awesome Voice Overs-Classic Puzzles, Platforming-awesome combos/upgrades/weapons to gain-A great storylineThe Bad-A bit overhyped-Game is TOO short!!!-Did I mentionit's TOO SHORT!!!...Devil May Cry 3 takes like almost20 hours!!!...this is about......8 hours?....I also forgot...this game is VERY MATURE!!..It contains full Nudity, Sexual Content, Extreame Violence and is really for people ages 17 and up....Other then that God of War is a great yet very short action adventure game that should suit well for people new and no so new, I've mentioned already the great things about this game above so I'll just cut to the chase....God of War for the PS2 gets a..4.5 out of 5....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2005"}

The gorgeous, flowing world that changes almost seamlessly from desert to plain to forest will take the breath of even the hardest critic of VG graphics. The soft background music adds a nice touch as you gallop on horseback from one exotic locale to the next.Then there are the opponents themselves, which are awe-inspiring to say the least. While their defeat is has been described as formulaic (stab them in their weak point) how else would one fight a walking mountain? The colossi are each unique, with different movements and even personalities, which you can start to sense as you play. Some of the battles can be rather frustrating, but all of the paths forward are intuitive and can be figure out.The story is also beautiful. While it is a take on the normal \"save your loved one\" premise, it is delivered and handled expertly and originally. You don't even start off with a certain goal in mind, as the best you can hope for is that saving Mono (whom you bring into the game to bring back to life) \"may not be impossible.\"Simply put, if you liked Ico, you'll love this game.

Just watch out for the guy at the party that wants to moon the camera or make obscene body gestures during your mini-game so they can see it on the recording after your game. Games such as Bowling, Soccer, and Track and Field you play one at a time, while Table Tennis, Boxing and Beach Volleyball can be played with 2 at a time.

For the first few days I played the game I had no problems with any major bugs. Sure there were the floating objects and NPCs stuck in walls, the ground, etc and there were some scripting issues with dialog but hey this game is awesome, who cares! And then the game started to have problems with it pausing for a second or two. It wouldn't freeze, it would just pretend to freeze then be fine. Hey I can deal with that. And then it happened, less than a week into playing the game crashed, and at that point I knew I had made a mistake in purchasing this title.Since then, it has been downhill. I try to play for two to three hours a session, and the last ten sessions have ended prematurely with the game freezing, forcing me to do a hard reset on my PS3. Last night in fact, it froze after about 45 minutes of game play. I decided to reboot and keep going but only got another hour in before it froze again.Its not just the freezes - though they are infuriating when you've traversed across the open wasteland for a long time only to have the game freeze - its the combination of all the issues. I've had problems with several quests becoming bugged where I am unable to complete them. Sometimes dialog options do not show up that should (confirmed by looking up the quest solutions online when I got stuck). For one quest, I've done everything I'm supposed to and only have to talk to one NPC to get my reward - but the NPC is bugged and won't talk to me!What pains me the most about having to give this game 1 star is that when the game is working fine its fabulous RPG Fallout action. It is an incredibly entertaining game. However, given the frequent freezes, quest glitches, and pauses the game is no longer fun. I'm constantly having to save due to the risk that the game will freeze and force me to replay sections. The pauses make me anxious that the game is frozen, taking me out of the moment playing - I'm not engrossed in the game because I'm worried it will freeze.And don't even get me started on the load times, sometimes I feel like in an hour of gaming I spent the majority of the time waiting for the next section to load (an exaggeration of course but the load times are horrendous).All in all, if they patch the game to not freeze, pause, take so long to load constantly, glitch quests and NPC dialog then this would have gotten 4 stars easily. Buyer beware, frustration lies ahead.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2010"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way. Parents should note that this  game carries a Mature rating for its blood, violence, and gore.--Raymond M.

When they do as good a job as they do on Grand Theft Auto III, then there is a masterpiece let loose upon the gaming world. State of Emergency is one such game, Why? you ask. The concept of the game is essentially that the country has been seized by an evil oppressive corporation and you have to do missions throughout in order to cause chaos and havoc. The game is essentially mission-based taking away from the free-roaming that was given in GTA III. But, the fact that there can be about 200 people on the screen at once adds to the fun of being a face in the crowd...but still a dangerous one. The graphics are cartoonish, but still impressive. The Entertainment and Playability are good as the controls respond really well when you fight among the rioters and it's fun to play. The replay value is rather moderately high as it is a quite enteraining game. But, the bottomline factor is the game is still quite violent and Gory and not for the youthful gamer or the weak of heart.

McKenzie","summary":"A Brilliant Original (and/or) Frustrating Mess","reviewText":"There's a lot I want to say about \"Heavy Rain\", and this will be a lengthy analysis and dissection of my experiences with it.  But if you want a quick review, I recommend renting \"Heavy Rain\" first, because the game ranges from stunningly brilliant to unbelievably frustrating.  I both love this game and hate this game, with an overall feeling of \"It's-good-but...\"***** WHAT I WON'T TALK ABOUT HERE? *****First and foremost, I'm going to say as little about the plot as I can.  Even though I will analyze it, you deserve the chance to experience it fresh, especially since \"Heavy Rain\" depends on a first impression more than any other game I can recall.  I don't want to take too much time explaining how \"Heavy Rain\" is played, because there are plenty of detailed reviews and web videos that you can look up.______________________________________***** GRAPHICS AND ART DIRECTION *****The look of this game is stunning overall, with only some minor blemishes.  Characters are very well-animated, and it's obvious that a lot of time was spent on the motion-capture work with the actors.  Oddly enough, my biggest gripe is that some smiles look very creepy, with only the top row of teeth being visible in some characters.  The dark and dreary world of \"Heavy Rain\" is completely convincing.  Most of the time, you truly feel like you are there with the characters.  The framerate stutters a bit now and again, especially when there is split-screen activity going on, but it's very tolerable considering how much work the PS3 is doing.  On the whole, \"Heavy Rain\" is a great looking videogame, with only a few issues.______________________________________***** SOUND - MUSIC & ACTING *****I'm no expert on surround sound and home theater experience, but \"Heavy Rain\" sounds fine in terms of environmental and prop effects.  I'm referring to effects like gunfire, noisy crowds, the loud music in a nightclub, the intense chase sequences, the rainfall, etc.  The music and voice acting are what will leave more of an impression on gamers.  The music is pretty good, although the tonal style lends itself to repetition.  The acting is one area of the game that deserves the highest compliments and the harshest criticisms.  The quality of the voice work is all over the map, and it drove me crazy.  The opening act is a perfect example, when a father is waking up and enjoying a day with his two kids.  But when one of them goes missing, the inner thoughts and cries for help you can make are dreadful.  \"Origami Killer\" is pronounced two different ways throughout the story.  The French accents of a few characters slip in and out, especially with the police department.  And with the few children who appear in the game, it's 50/50.  Now, on the whole, \"Heavy Rain\" is a well-acted story.  But you don't need do a lot of research to discover that this story is a foreigner's perspective of an American story, and when it slips up, it really sticks out like a sore thumb.  Considering how much strong work there is in the game and the amount of recorded dialogue, mistakes are bound to happen.  But like everything else in \"Heavy Rain\", you notice it a lot more because the gameplay takes a sidestep to the drama.______________________________________***** CONTROLS & GAMEPLAY *****When the game enters the quick-time cinematic style --- where you quickly push the button that appears on the screen to succeed or fail at a task --- it's a first-rate thriller.  You get to participate in some of the most exciting action sequences ever put in a videogame, regardless of how implausible a few of them are.When the game asks you to simply ask and/or answer questions with only one-word clues to help you, those are good enough because your gut reflexes can make or break a strategy, which is true to human nature.When the game allows you to freely roam a given room and interact with various objects, \"Heavy Rain\" can be an aggravating experience.  These third-person controls are a mess, with camera switches derailing your character and button prompts literally disappearing just because you're at an awkward angle.  Also, the game asks you to perform some of the most mundane tasks (opening cabinets & doors, etc) just because it wants you to use the controller.  However, I have to give credit to the simple-yet-effective investigation scenes you control as FBI agent Norman Jayden.  He has the technology to detect different clues at a crime scene, which will enable you to help Norman work the case in isolated VR examinations.  I understand that writer/director David Cage wanted you to feel like you're controlling the entire experience.  But you know what, there are only so many cabinets and refrigerators that I feel like opening.  In simplest terms, \"Heavy Rain\" is too afraid to let the players WATCH the experience, and it results in some tedious sequences.  And why can't these people run!?  You'll beg for a run button at some point in \"Heavy Rain\", and you'll never get one.There are moments when \"Heavy Rain\" is a great experience, and as I'll explain in my Story comments, it is worth the trouble.  But it's a really rough road in some spots.______________________________________***** STORY *****With the exception of the \"Metal Gear Solid\" series, there is no other videogame that has been hyped, praised, and experienced for its story more than anything else.  \"Heavy Rain\" is driven by the plot, and it's likely to be the main reason that people check this game out.  I bet people who hate this game still finished it because of its simple controls, just because they wanted to see if it was worth it.  In short, \"Heavy Rain\" is worth playing through.  Let me start off with the positives before I get really nasty.\"Heavy Rain\" is the story of how a few become involved with the Origami Killer.  You have the chance to make choices that can affect the story.  They're mostly tiny details, but they make you feel like you're playing your own mystery/drama.  There are some events that can have huge consequences on the ending, mainly a few scenes where playable characters can be killed off!  Although these grand decisions don't appear for a while, their appearances give gamers a chance to see different outcomes, a rarity in story-driven titles like this.There are four lead characters in \"Heavy Rain\".  Ethan Mars is a father who undergoes an emotional crisis when his second son is kidnapped, possibly by the Origami Killer.  Scott Shelby is a private investigator hired by the victims' parents, whereas Norman Jayden is the FBI agent assigned to the latest murder.  Madison Rayne is a journalist who inadvertently becomes involved with one of our lead characters.  For some reason, it took me a while to get used to each of these people, except for Scott Shelby.  From the beginning, he's a warm detective who's seen some rough things happen to good people.  But when things go sour, you realize just how driven he is.  I warmed up to everyone soon enough, less so with Madison.In fact, this is the perfect time to tell you that as engaging as the \"Heavy Rain\" plot is, there are some serious holes that are inexcusable.  You won't see all of these on your first playthrough, but there red herrings all over the place that don't pay off, and certain scenes of violence that are completely ridiculous.  Madison Rayne doesn't have a logical reason to get involved in the story.  I tried everything from total sympathy to keeping your distance --- Madison Rayne's motivations never clicked for me.  How the Origami Killer was able to commit the crimes he/she did is a stretch.  There are a couple of chase scenes that can end in very unlikely fashion just so that your hero can continue his path.  I also love how many people can be killed, yet the police are hilariously absent:You're at the scene of the crime? >>> \"Just don't leave town.\"Had to shoot down a suspect after you harassed him? >>> Feel guilty for a sentence or two; nobody asks about it.Had to shoot down about 20 people because they harassed you? >>> Literally no follow-up whatsoever.I don't expect \"The Wire\" or \"All The President's Men\" when it comes to investigations in videogames, but there are some serious logical gaps in \"Heavy Rain\".My favorite gripe with the story is how a deadly path is set if a man wants to find a clue to the Origami Killer's location.  What's the test?  Crawl through a tight pipe maze with glass laid across the floor if you want to succeed?  So...did the killer literally crawl through this whole maze, even at the wrong turns?  I'm sorry but that is borderline impossible!Keep in mind, some of these nitpicks aren't just because of my personal storyline of \"Heavy Rain\".  I feel bad pointing these faulty threads out, because \"Heavy Rain\" has some brilliant scenes that rival other top-notch videogame stories.  I felt true pain when Ethan was trying to relate with his son after he'd already lost one child.  Norman's technology and tactics come at a price, and I desperately feared for him because of the close fights he gets.  Scott has some tender scenes when visiting parents who will never see their child again, no matter what Scott tries to do for them.  Even Madison had a few great scenes for me; her introductory scene is truly terrifying.______________________________________***** FINAL THOUGHTS & RECOMMENDATION *****I played the living hell out of \"Indigo Prophecy\" (aka \"Fahrenheit\" in other markets), Quantic Dream's spiritual predecessor.  I had never seen a game that relied on a simple interface at the service of the story.  Although it had some problems, the general consensus was that it could create a new adventure genre.  Four years later, we have \"Heavy Rain\".  Although it's more technically impressive and more diverse with its choices, this follow-up still suffers from some of the same problems: inconsistent voice-acting, repetitive music, clunky controls, occasional slowdown, and plot points that are either unexplained or implausible.  \"Heavy Rain\" surpasses \"Indigo\" in terms of opportunity and presentation, but its greater ambition makes its faults more noticeable, which we don't want from a PS3 title in development for over 4 years.I'm gonna give \"Heavy Rain\" an 8.0 / 10.  Some people are gonna give it the highest recommendation because of its unparalleled attention to the story and simplistic gameplay.  Some people are gonna hate it because of its uneven pacing and its clunky controls.  In the end, I chose to forgive \"Heavy Rain\" for its missteps.  Because of its uniqueness, it deserves to be tried.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2010"}

Red Faction II takes this technology a step further and enhances the graphics as well.Where Red Faction was set on Mars, and you were a miner fighting against a corrupt mining company, Red Faction II is set on Earth and you (named 'Alias') are fighting against SOPOC. SOPOC is very '70s Soviet' like with lots of thick accents and heavy [politics].Again, the geomod technology really shines in the game. Just about anything you see, you can shoot off the outer layer and even blow the entire object up. An enemy is blocking the end of a hallway? Blow a hole in the wall nearby and go around the back way. Want to take down a bridge? Blow out the supports beneath it and then put grenades in the exposed core.The game bills itself as team-based combat, but it isn't nearly as smooth as Halo. You do have one or two friends that fight alongside you in certain areas, or who pipe in on your communications system to give you suggestions. In generaly though it's really you against the enemy. You can act as gunner in several missions, and there are one or two that you can steer a given vehicle in.The graphics are good, but not stellar. The lighting is nice as spotlights shine down in the dark or lights glow overhead, but it's still a bit flat when compared against the top of the line console or PC games.  The music is OK, but a lot of the 'immersion' things you watch for - footsteps, shadows, ambient noises - are missing.You can probably get through the game in a few days, and once you unlock various features with bonus achievements you can have a blast (heh) in the various deathmatch and multiplay modes. Eventually you can use all the models you encounter in multiplayer, plus a wide variety of weapons, maps and situations.If you're a fan of shoot-em-up gameplay that sometimes needs a bit of thought behind how to achieve the objective, this is the game for you. You can replay each mission several times to see if alternate routes through walls, floors or ceilings make a difference. The graphics aren't perfect, but the geomod technology gives them a leg up on the competition. Once they get the graphics to shine like some of the top-runners in the market, they will be unbeatable!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2002"}

As it stands now, I may have to buy a controller extension cord to correct this design flaw, which is irritating when I already paid for the MultiTap.It works, it's first party, and it's reliable.

I, perhaps ignorantly, assumed that the reason for the delays in the N64 days was due to the system's cartridge format, and difficult development field. Apparently Nintendo didn't see things that way, as they passed on the opportunity to buy Rare outright, and make them an internal development house, since then Microsoft has purchased Rare, LTD, and all of its licenses. Aside from Nintendo owned properties like Star Fox and Donkey Kong, Microsoft now has control over everything that made Rare LTD so great, from Conker to Perfect Dark Microsoft owns it all. It is with a great swell of sadness that I write this review, as it will be the last Rare game released on a Nintendo console. I own an Xbox, but Nintendo was a part of the magic of Rare, and vice-versa. It won't be the same, ever again. To be honest though, I firmly believe that Rare is loosing more loosing Nintendo, than Nintendo is in loosing Rare, but still, for Rare's final offering this is the icing on the cake of what has been a great software line up on what I still believe is the greatest console to date.I am one of those gamers who don't care if the game \"rips off\" another game as long as the story is original, and the game is fun. Star Fox Adventures began as a game called Dinosaur Planet for the N64. Apparently Nintendo was working on a similar game in house and decided that it would be best to combine efforts and so Star Fox Adventures was born.Rare has never been about innovation as much as perfecting already established engines, that's why they worked so well with Nintendo. Nintendo would develop an engine (In this case the Zelda Engine) and Rare would perfect it. Although the game engine is not perfected, as Zelda was executed better, this game is a joy and a wonder to behold. While some may criticize its engine as being unoriginal, or even less efficient than the Zelda original it works brilliantly, making this game just plane fun to play. Every aspect of this game is enjoyable, from the exploration, to the cheat tokens; even Tricky (Fox's side kick) is enjoyable. The game is nearly (note nearly) flawless.Graphically Star Fox is above and beyond what other games of this genre have tried. Microsoft boasted that its version of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex would sport fur. To be honest the fur didn't look very good, in Star Fox; however, the fur is not only there, but looks very real and very convincing. Individual strands of fur seem to blow individually in the wind, and react on their own, independent of each other, which is a huge technical feat. The graphics are arguably better than Resident Evil. The only feature I would have liked to see is the effects of water on the fur, as this was the only thing lacking. With as good as this game looks it makes me feel very ripped off by Eurocom's port of Crash Bandicoot, and its lack of fur. The GCN proves once again that it is more than capable of handling the same sort of high graphics being pulled off on XBox. If only third party developers would realize that!The story is enjoyable, and complex. It has a Disney quality feel to it, with that Rare and Nintendo magic thrown into the mix. I don't know why the game has a \"T\" rating, as the back of the package has a \"mild animated blood and violence\" label, but there is not a drop of blood anywhere in the game. Parents wondering if its safe to get this game for their kids can be assured that the game is perfectly child friendly, however, young children likely won't appreciate or enjoy this game as much as someone in their teens, or older.Rare has gone the extra length to make sure that you don't need a guidebook for this game. This is greatly appreciated as not having to buy guidebooks means I have more money to buy the games themselves. There are moments that will have you stumped, but like Eternal Darkness before it, there is a solution in sight, and not something that is so over the top and nonsensical that you need a guidebook to explain how to do it. You can get through this game on your own. Even the secrets are pretty easy to find once you figure out what you're looking for.The only area that this game takes a hit with me is the music. While many of the tunes are enjoyable I do feel strongly that the age of MIDI music in games is obsolete, but it's forgivable. I just wish that the game would have had orchestrated tunes.All in all there's about 20-25 hours worth of an epic game here, and while it feels more like a Zelda Game than a traditional Star Fox game its well worth the price of admission. At least Rare is leaving Nintendo with a bang, and for that I thank them. I only wish that Microsoft would stop buying everything in site.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2002"}

The series was also shown in both \"Super Smash Brothers\" games.The Hero of the story is Fox McCloud, leader of the mercenary Space Fighter Squadron, Star Fox. This consists of five people: Fox, the leader, Slippy, the frog mechanic, Falco, a Punk Falcon, and Peppy, a hare who knew Fox's father.In both of the original games, the player, as Fox, was hired by General Pepper of the planet of Corneria to take down the mad scientist Andross, who was responsible for the death of Fox's father, James McCloud. Along the way, you are fought by Andross's ships, planet-based hazards, and a rival Mercenary band hired by Andross: Star Wolf.This game takes place eight years after the second game. The team has not had a job in a while, they are low on money, Peppy and Slippy have taken up non-flying positions in the team, and Falco has left without a trace. So when General Pepper calls, saying he has a job for them, they gladly take it. Their mission: Save Dinosaur Planet!Meanwhile, in a converging plot, a blue girl-fox named Krystal, while searching throughout space for her parents, hears a distress call from Dinosaur Planet. She goes to it, and discovers that the Evil General Scales and his minions, the SharpClaws, have chased the Kranoa away from their shrine. The Kranoa are powerful spirits that in the right hands bring peace, but in the wrong can bring terrible destruction. So, of course, Krystal goes and looks for the Kranoa. Unfortunately, she is accidentally pushed into a magic beam and gets sealed inside a (surprise!) giant crystal!Back in Fox-Land, Fox meets the Queen, who is looking for her son, the Triceratops Prince Tricky. After you find him, he becomes your companion, able to do useful skills like breathing flame and finding secrets hidden in the earth. You take him back to his mother, who tells you that Dinosaur Planet has a powerful magic field that is constantly pulling it apart. To counter this, four \"spellstones\" were created, but General Scales scattered them and the planet is being ripped apart.So, you must fly in your Arwing fighter craft to the different chunks (four in all, with one per spellstone) and recover them. Flying to the different chunks brings back memories of the other Star Fox games. You must fly through Gold Rings, you collect laser powerups, you blast enemy ships, and you get to the area. Unfortunately, you can't warp back to places you already visited, so you must keep doing flying scenes. To counter the boredom of this, there is a \"Best Times\" scoreboard, keeping track of fastest trips to different areas.The gameplay in this is very much like the Legend of Zelda games. You attack with the A button, you collect money, you buy stuff, you get magic powers. Fox finds a Magic Staff, which is his main weapon and can be enchanted to shoot fire, rocket upwards, etc. Most of the game is spent this way, with the occasional puzzle thrown in, like mazes, some \"Shoot this spot\" puzzles, and so on. One of the most annoying puzzle/action sequences involves a ramp, a barrel that you must bring to the top of the ramp, and other explosive barrels flying down the ramp towards you. Donkey Kong, anyone? But the ground-based gameplay, despite some minor annoyances, is still very good. This, combined with the Flying sequences, combines two great games of the N64 and brings them even further.The Graphics in this game are great, from the skin of the dinosaurs, to the fur on Fox, to the warts on Slippy. The staff that Fox finds glows and burns with a bluish light, and the effects of that are done very well. The Great Fox (Star Fox's Mother Ship) and the Arwings (Star Fox's Fighter Jets), which were white and polished in the original games, are now gray, dark, and dirty, showing the state of poorness Team Star Fox has fallen into. The cutscenes have the same quality as the in-game graphics, but you don't notice because the in-game graphics are very good anyway. When an enemy dies, they don't stay on the ground, or lie for a little while. They fall backwards and at the same time disintegrate (or something like it) into a bright, white light. The overall effect of it is amazing, and it looks cool without having bodies everywhere.The sound of the game is also done incredibly well. The voices are better than the last game. Slippy, who in Starfox 64 sounded like a girl (high, whiny annoying voice), now sounds recognizable as a boy (though he still does have a high, whiny annoying voice-just one recognizable as a boy). The dinosaurs' growls and roars sound incredibly real. The warpstone, a giant stone creature that sends Fox to different areas, has a rich Scottish accent. Why, I don't know, but it's kind of funny anyway. The music is very beautiful, with far-off dinosaur cries punctuating the haunting music. The lava music, as one might expect, is very rocky and hot sounding: Rumbles, sounds of fire being blasted upwards, and low drum beats. It makes a very real experience, and if you play this game without sound, you are missing a lot.Overall, this game was incredibly good. I could not find any major errors with it, so I will rate it a 10 of 10. The sound, graphics and gameplay combined beautifully, with no errors, problems or bugs. I congratulate the team who made it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

Johnson","summary":"Just OK,  Its too DARK!!","reviewText":"This is an update to my previous review entitled, \"I suppose it would be great if I could play it\". After loading the Doom 3 patch, the game seems to be running better and no longer locks up after 45 minutes of play. At least for the time being. Honestly, I never play it longer than 30 minutes at a time anymore because I really can't get into the game. This is mainley because the game is too dark!The graphics in this game are extraordinary. Crisp clean, textures, fluid movements, spectacular lighting and shadows. Graphics wise this is the best game I have played on the PC to date. I looked hard and did not notice any dullness and graininess in the graphics ANYWHERE. The only place where some improvement is needed is in the rendering of characters faces. If you look closely enough you will be able to see jagged edges on their faces. But you probally won't even notice unless you are looking VERY closely. Keep in mind I am playing this on high detail at 1024X768 so that may be a factor; I imagine a lower resolution and/or detail level will affect the graphic quality. Alternatively, if you play at ultra high detail and a even higher resolution, then the graphical quality will more than likely improve.The sound in this game is creepy as its supposed to be. Nothing groundbreaking in this department, but it does what its supposed to do; keep you jumping after you hear every little sound. You can actually hear enemies sneaking up on you by hearing muffled zombie moans, or giant spiders' eight legs lightly tapping on the ground behind you. This keeps things very suspensful.Storyline: Like others have mentioned, the storyline is weak. Basically, you are one of the final survivors after the base was attacked by demons. *YAWN*.Gameplay: While the graphics are near perfect and the sound is adequate, the main thing that hurt this game is that ITS TOO DARK! This game can be real hard on the eyes because you are straining them all the time trying to see in this game. While granted much of the power was knocked out after the attack, there is still no excuse for me to have to switch between my flashlight and gun just so I can see enemies creeping up on me in a pitch black room or hallway. Like another reviewer stated, you don't really get a chance to see the monsters because its so dark. Often times you find yourself shooting in the dark at enemies that you hope are still there. It is very cumbersome having to switch back and forth between the flashlight and gun to stay alive. If a monster sneaks up on you quickly, then many times you will find yourself hitting it with your flashlight instead of shooting it, because you forgot to switch back to your gun! There is no excuse for this. Even today there are helments that have lights on them. You mean to tell me that in the 22nd century that they no longer exist?Also the enemies can be very cheap. I particurarily hate the imps because they can teleport closer to you and pounce on your before you even have a chance to fire your weapon. Additionally, it takes forever to kill them, even two well placed shots from the shotgun will not kill it, it usually takes three or four shotgun blasts to kill it. It is also very annoying that enemies can randomly appear out of nowhere when you reach a \"trigger point\". Reach a certain point on the map and you will find that a room you previously cleared is now full of monsters appearing behind you, in front of you and anywhere else you can imagine. Expect to die a lot in this game becuase of this. My advice is to SAVE OFTEN to avoid replaying the same thing over and over and over again.This game is above average but nothing compared to all the hype is was getting. It is worth completing, but I really see no replay value because all the levels are exactly the same and boring. Hopefully the later levels will offer more variety, but for now all it is is basically running the the dark shooting at enemies. If the game weren't so dark, than maybe I could find myself getting into it more. But after getting killed by an unseen monster for the third time, it really gets old.And no, I am not too scared to play this game, this game is not at all scary. In fact I actually found the original Doom and Quake more scary than this! I even found Castlevania 64 for the N64 to be much more scarier than this game and that game was made five years ago! The only thing scary about this game is the possibility that I will eventually go blind because I have to strain my eyes so hard in order to play. Turning up the brightness on my monitor and in the game helps a little bit, but for the most part it does not help in very dark areas; instead of walking down a pitch black hall, I am walking down a pitch gray hall!I won't go into online play because I haven't played it, and don't know if I will. Its no fun to play a game with other people online because there are always people that cheat ruining the game for everyone else who chooses to play fair.Keep in mind you need a pretty powerful system to play this game. The game requires a 1.5Mhz pentium or Athlon 1500+ processor with AT LEAST a 64 video card and 384MB of RAM. These are bare minimum requirements and I honestly don't think you'd be able to run this game smoothly with the minimum specs. Upgrade your videon card to 128MB and boost your RAM to at least 512.Below are my system specs, and I am able to play the game very smoothly on high detail at 1024X768 resolution.  I may be able to even run it on ultra high resolution, but haven't tried because like I said, I don't play the game very long at one time.My system=====================AMD Athlon64 3000+MSI K8N Neo PlatinumATI RADEON 9800 PRO 128MB1GB Corsiar PC3200200GB Maxtor 7200RPMSound Blaster Audigy 2 ZSSamsung DVD+-RWSamsung CD-RWAs far as recommending this game, I can't really say. To me its just another FPS, but if you absolutely love and must have every FPS that comes out, then by all means get this game. If you don't have any other game to play at the moment and are bored, then this game may be recommended as well. If you are looking for a ground breaking title that will make history as one of the greatest FPSs of all time, then Doom 3 is not it. The original Doom was an instant classic when it first came out, its too bad Doom 3 falls of matching the greatness of the original.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2005"}

With $20 to spare, you'll find that this offering from Logitech is perhaps the best that you can find in a sea of PSP protection cases released by several companies.The key selling point of the PlayGear Pocket is its functionality. When you buy a case to protect something, the attribute that most concerns you would be how well it actually protects. The PlayGear Pocket does this well. Made of clear polycarbonate, the case looks, and most importantly, feels tough. The inner walls of the case are clothed in rubber, providing a firm grip that holds your console nicely in place. If you're justifying your purchase soley in terms of its ability to offer protection, it's pretty obvious that the PlayGear Pocket will serve your requirement. The case also has several cut-outs that allow you to access the \"L\" and \"R\" buttons, the power and WI-FI switches, and the earphones and charger jacks at the four corners of your PSP. This means that you can essentially use your PSP without removing it from the case. That's pretty useful, I think. But yet, the PlayGear Pocket is more than just that.Still on the area of functionality, the PlayGear Pocket also provides good value by providing a makeshift visor and transforming into a cradle for holding your PSP. These are made possible with a friction hinge, which allows the cover of the case to stay in place in any angle up to 270 degrees. Lifting the cover up slightly allows it to filter off glare, and pushing it all the way back turns the case into a stand, which is ideal for purposes such as movie-watching. Now, that sounds like some good multi-tasking.Apart from satisfying your need for functionality, the PlayGear Pocket is also nicely designed. Despite having a thick outer layer, the case is designed to fit the shape of your PSP, making the size of it is just slightly bigger than the console itself. This will please buyers who want a cool-looking case without too much excess baggage. The combination of clear plastic and black rubber also makes the PlayGear Pocket appears sleek and stylish. If you're easily appealed by appearance, you'll fall in love with this product. What's more? The case is also customizable, so you can even make your own skin for the cover. This should please gamers who prefer to have their own unique identity.The down side of the PlayGear Pocket is obviously its weight. It adds considerable package to an already heavy PSP, making it quite like holding a brick at times. Also, despite allowing access to your buttons and switches, the design of the case also means that it's impossible to attach a USB cable from your computer to your PSP when it's in the case. These are not major issues though, and should not be seen as forms of deterrence.So, eventually, I didn't manage to keep this short. Nevertheless, I hope that I've done enough to impress you to get this product. The PlayGear Pocket is streets ahead of most, if not all its competitor, and having it with allows you to finally kiss the dodgy sleeve that came with your PSP Value Pack goodbye. It didn't take me a long time to buy this, and I think you should too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2005"}

Both Spyro fans and those who didn't play the first game will revel in the  exploratory greatness that isSpyro: Ripto's Rage. Gone are the impossible tasks,  unbeatable enemies, and fragmented game flow. This game sports superior controls, more  colorful and faster graphics, a tighter story, achievable goals, and plenty of gameplay  variety.Don't be fooled by Spyro's cuteness--this isn't a kid's-only game. With multiple goals  and side quests, a fantastic soundtrack by ex-Police band member Stewart Copeland, and  a veneer of understated humor,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis highly addictive. The  playfulness of the main character comes through in the exploration of the otherworldly  levels using the new moves, including super high jumps, rapid underwater swimming,  and extended flight and hovering maneuvers.Determined explorers are always rewarded--sometimes with an ice hockey match or other  sub-game, sometimes with riches enough to learn a new move or uncover a new area.  Simply put,Spyro: Ripto's Rageis one of the best action/adventure games for the  system. Despite the fact that this game is a sequel, it manages to bring a fresh new look  and feel to PlayStation gaming.--Jeff YoungPros:Massive, fun levels are completely navigableCute and quirky sense of humor will appeal to all agesResponsive controls are an extension of Spyro's upbeat and exacting personalityCons:Camera angles can be problematic, but are completely adjustable","reviewerName":"Richard Bryant","summary":"Spyro 2 is great!","reviewText":"This game is great!

{"product_name":"B004XGN8W4","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"my completely unbiased experience with this product, suffered multiple defects and craftmenship is questionable","reviewText":"Firstly ignore the score and read what I have to say. I bought this product on Amazon because i wanted a console on-the-go. As far as doing that, it seems like it is an accomplishment. The screen does show a strong 720p image, and it keeps the Playstation 3 very secure in the Straps. You can use this for mobile gaming...the issue comes in when you try to use it for anything more than a quick fix on the go.Now lets get into it. I'm going to imediately point out my model was \"defective\" as the screen was suffering from water damage. I contacted support (their only support is by email) and they responded in roughly 20 hours by saying that some models suffered water damage during the natural disaster in japan. I wanted to get my money back as it was unusable, they told me send it back to amazon first, and if they wont take it to return to them second, and they have a return policy set up with Amazon. I did Amazon's exchange program for the first time and my second model came. This was a hassle and most people might quit here and say the product sucks but im fair. The second product came in and also had water damage, but to a much lesser more manageable degree. While the first had severe water damage mid-screen, the second model had minor water damage along the top of the screen edges in the form of bubbles lining the entire top portion of the screen. It only shows through white and grey screen making PSN games like Flower annoying and bothersome. The screen itself is crisp 720p but the viewing angles are very bad. You will need to adjust your chair a certain way, generally looking straight forward at the unit gives you the only working angle, where it doesnt end up too dark. PS ONE games can be unplayable unless you use the highest brightness and contrasst, the settings on this thing are really wacky and the screen itself (other than it's hd imagery) is low quality and they definately cut corners. There are ghosting issues and the screens very thin, pressing on at all it WILL cause physical pressure damage. It seems to hold everything sturdy and work well for gaming, scratches are either all over the screen boarder and unit or at a minimum its a gamble when you buy it. my first defective unit had scracthes all over the screen boarder, this one has none. All in all it works for portable gaming if thats all you want and are willing to go through multiple units if it does have water damage (it sounds like most do) good luck as it seems to be a crap shoot. If you are using this as your main gaming machine and are bothered by craftmanship defects such as screen bubbles, scratches, and difficult viewing angles, you will want to buy a regular TV. Since this product is fairly cheap i'll recommend it to those looking for a cheap way to play games while traveling and that's it. its a one star for anyone else, because of defects, poor lighting and viewing angles, and general cutting corners to keep the price low If they worked on making a better product and upped the price it would be better, but they didnt want to charge higher prices, so that's how it is unfortunately.having to keep a unit because i dont feel like jumping hoops that has minor water damage lining the screen, and fumbling with bad viewing angles isn't what i should have to do at all, so i cant recommend this product to most people... but as i said it does do what it is suppose to do other than that. its a 720p hdtv in a suitcase.I also wish they had a number for tech support, email only is bad, although they do respond and are helpful. I feel very limited here, so whatever they tell you in email, goes. your best way to get your money back is entirely through amazon so their tech support most likely wont be needed.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"One of a kind","reviewText":"I can't say enough good things about this game.  It's unique in many ways and has inspirations from many sources without ever feeling like a rip-off or copycat.  The story is kind of a zombie apocalypse/ drama but it doesn't feel like a Walking Dead sibling.  I has survival horror elements without feeling like Resident Evil or Silent Hill.  It has adventure elements without feeling like an Uncharted game.  Stealth is a major aspect but it doesn't play or feel like Metal Gear.  And so on.  Ammo is sparse but you will never fully run out if you play smart.  Your individual weapons can't hold many rounds but there's a good variety of guns and you can upgrade your clip capacity on most of them.  You can hold enough guns so that if you run out of ammo on one, you usually have enough ammo for another to finish the job before finding more and re-stocking.  You find components in your environment to craft weapon upgrades, special weapons (like a nailbombs), med kits, etc.  The game draws you in so much that it feels a lot longer than it is.  It's not a 40 hour+ epic but it's not a 6 hour rental either.  Depending on how you play, like how much time you spend searching for loot, you can spend between an average and a pretty decent amount of time on it.  There's even a New Game+ mode  that allows you to continue to upgrade.  That's always the icing on the cake for me.  I enjoy one-time playthrough games like Bioshock, where you can pretty much fully upgrade everything the first time around, but the replay and overall value is much higher for me on games like Resident Evil 4 and most of the Ratchet and Clank series.  Overall, this is a top notch game with amazing graphics, a great story, and incredibly fun gameplay.  I highly recommend it to any kind of gamer, old enough to handle mature content at least.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

This game stands in my top 10 list of games ever made. A rather gripping and emotional journey of lara`s origin and excellent near perfect controls and gameplay with a little bit of rpg leveling system that while not innovative is still a welcome addition. If i had to have a problem with this game it would be a bug i ran into 2 times in the game of there being no enemy body but i could see there weapon floating as they moved and shot at me.

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"M. Daneker","summary":"A little less exploration a little more action","reviewText":"There's no doubt, Uncharted 2 is no slouch and a worthy follow-up to the original, no one should be disappointed. The characters are fun, the dialogue is at time hilarious, the graphics are, really nice for the most part and the game is impossible to stop playing as it moves with breakneck speed and death will never set you back more than five minutes.There's no point in going over the story here, so lets get down to the details:Pros:Fluid story and linear action keeps you constantly moving forward.Great scenery, dizzying graphics excellent sound (try the 5.1 PCM if you can with full dynamics!)Witty, sarcastic, and absolutely hilarious cut scenes with Oscar worthy voice-acting.Easy to navigate controls and weapons.Nice autosave, no loading times.Great story complete with twist.Cons:Simple, way too simple, obvious puzzles are tedious rather than challengingNPG's all look the same. Really generic, shame next to the great backgrounds.Animated cut scenes lack great animation, the faces are lifeless and stiff, the story and voice acting deserve better (see FFXIII)Camera hits walls! Try jumping on a vertical slope looking at a 3/4 view! You can't rotate the camera behind the character in many cases, so the game compensated by just having him \"make it\" when he jumps, or let's you fall over and over.BUGS!!! This game locked up several times, at one point I kept falling \"through\" the train, I got stuck a few times and had to restart the game, twice I had to turn off the PS3 and reboot.Over long, tedious fights. I like action fine, but ALL games should take a look at Halo 1,2,3 and notice that challenging and unending are two different things!Logically flawed: From a huge city with NO PEOPLE!!! to a tiny village LOADED WITH PEOPLE! What?Overall. The first uncharted had more exploration for the main quest, though, even that eventually gave way to being an endless shooter, this game is mostly endless shooter with a little exploration on the side. Yet the story is engaging, the graphics are lush, the sound is top notch, voice acting is excellent, dialogue is well written and the game is highly enjoyable and addicting. Unfortunately the exact same armed enemies come out of the woodwork in swarms of clones, unrelenting clones who spew clich&eacute;'s in bad, gay-German accents (what's that all about?)Hitting someone point blank in the face with an AK47 doesn't kill them, yet a one-arm dangling leap across a nine-foot expanse 500 ft in the air works with no effort? I really enjoy this series, but that's just silly.Regardless of the cons, I couldn't stop playing, enjoyed 98% of the time and will anxiously await part three.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

You can play the single player story mode if you want to see the story or you can play free-mode where you can roam around doing whatever you want.

So, you play some old assassin guy who goes around, threatening people, collecting info, evading \"cops\", and killing off certain people.  Big whoop.  This game is quickly boring.

They may know how to say some of the works So for your little ones, It's a challenge some of them just may not be ready for.The only fun any of us got were out of the mini games.So Unless your young ones are really good at reading, by the time their able to read this well, this type of game won't appeal to them as much. To Me, the age group this seems for are pre-kindergartners who are just learning to read, while the words used in this game seem too difficult to read unless you're a couple years older. My grand nephew's 5 year old cousin struggled on some words and just gave up.When you're recording your vocals, there isn't a computer helping you out, which is what takes the educational experience out of it for me. They just expect your young ones to know every single word. it records anything, which is the main problem.If you have Rock Band 2, Use that microphone and rent this. It's not worth 40 bucks. Maybe if it had a voice recognizer rather than just recording anything, it'd be a little more useful","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2010"}

This game is like...the only reason I have a Wii (well also Okami, Animal Crossing and Twilight Princess). I never got a chance to play the first smash brothers as a kid because my father only gave me the Sega Console and that was it. But I will say playing Melee was freaking amazing and it introduce me to the idea that Smash Brothers is fun. So when Brawl came out that was the only thing on my birthday list, this game is incredible on some many levels. Sadly they remove my favorite and crush Roy but kept Marth -.-(I don't know why), and the cool Mewtwo is gone along with Pichu but that's okay. What I really love is how the developers tried to be a little different when it came to Brawl, they have a story mode which is amazing, introducing new characters, more stages, the music is epic, even if this game looked the the N64 version of smash brothers I will still play it!

Over time, you'll do battle on the front lines of both sides as this shift reveals high-stakes arms threats and a terrifying glimpse of the future.HAWX: The Elite, High Altitude Warfare eXperimental SquadronYou'll begin the game as former U.S. Air Force Pilot David Crinshaw, assigned to provide air support for the well-known Ghost Recon team. You and your fellow HAWX pilots are some of the most highly-trained specialists in the world. Based out of Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, you're tasked with everything from testing secret and experimental aircraft weapon systems to carrying out combat and recon missions, training other top pilots, and attempting to capture enemy technologies.With the rise of the PMCs, your unique skills in higher demand than ever before.

When you're getting started, you can ease into the rigors of flight and gain confidence by using a special assistance mode that offers support through the E.R.S. This mode can be switched off at any time, deactivating safety features and allowing you to perform advanced maneuvers.Cutting-Edge Realism and Innovative Multi-Player ModesWhether you're in a classic F15 Fighting Falcon or a new-generation Gripen, the controls and flight graphics are designed to keep you on your toes.

I'm not really sure you can call this a flight sim, since most of the planes handle exactly the same, there's not really anything difficult about flying no knowledge of airplanes or military is required. If this can be called a flight sim then I would compare it to something like NFS: Undercover being a driving sim. I know enough to know that an F-22 Raptor would dominate a bunch of old MiGs and helos and it does but then again so does everything else, get it? Don't purchase this game if you're looking for a realistic military flight sim because I don't think this is particularly realistic, insofar as the planes are concerned. I mean these things, even on hard difficulty, carry a missile payload of over 100. But I think it was a sacrifice in realism for fun which I don't mind at all. The multiplayer is pretty decent, although it's getting old as a game so theres not that many players online whenever I check but I've had some pretty decent team deathmatches and some satisfying co-op games. I also liked all the little nods to other Tom Clancy series' contained in the game, you provide air support for Mitchell and the Ghosts from Ghost Recon AWF a couple times, and are provided intel by one of Third Echelon's Splinter Cells, which was pretty cool because I'm a big fan of both those series' too. Anyways, if/when they make a sequel I'll definitely buy it. I'm really happy with this game, I think most people will be as soon as the get over being scared of the big nasty flight sim that it's labeled as and realize it's a simple easy to pick up and play action game even if you've never played anykind of flight game this is still going to be easy to learn.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Steve S.","summary":"The legend.","reviewText":"This game was awesome when I was little and owned my original N64, and it's still awesome to this day.

First, it takes a beloved franchise and removes many of the elements that made it great. It also features a previously mute character become a poorly-written, horribly-acted wuss in the face of the same dangers she's faced before. In many ways, it's a step back for the Metroid franchise after the excellent Prime games.I guess since everyone else does, I need to talk about the story first. Metroid: Other M's story is an abomination. Its script is one of the worst ever written. It contains moments that make no sense in or out of the game's context. Its twists are obvious and handled poorly. Points made hours ago are repeated endlessly. A murder mystery plot is brought up and left completely unresolved. Many have pointed out the fact that Samus Aran, previously an amazingly competent female bounty hunter, is now reduced to a simpering mother figure who must be subservient to a man who doesn't outrank her. There's something to that, and, yeah, it's amazingly sexist even apart from how clunkily it's handled, but I'm more concerned about what it does to the feel of the game.Previous Metroid games were all based on exploration. They contained labyrinthine worlds, and the gameplay was based around the gradual widening of those worlds once new weapons and tools became available. They became series of revelations that built upon one another, culminating in boss battles and discoveries. This feeling of accomplishment is here replaced with the arbitrary edict of a bureaucrat that Samus doesn't even work for. And the implementation stinks; for some reason, this guy can't be bothered to authorize the Varia suit the second Samus steps into an environment that hurts her, no, he needs to wait awhile while this independent woman suffers for no reason at all. Beyond that, an explanation is given as to why certain types of weapons can't be used, which makes a certain amount of sense, but what possible reason could there be to not authorize the use of a suit that does nothing but protect its wearer? What about the grapple beam, which isn't a weapon at all, or the speed booster? This is never really explained because there's no way it could be made to make sense.The gameplay of Other M is better than its story, though still containing many odd decisions. One of the strangest is the ability to scan some objects but not others; the game constantly contains things that look like they should be useful, but aren't. This is a departure from the Prime series, in which nearly everything could be scanned for useful information and world-building. That's all gone here in favor of being able to scan objects that can be blown up and, very occasionally, story-relevant objects. The game also contains annoying sections in which it shifts to first-person until you scan the correct thing, which isn't labeled. More than once, I had to spin around until something looked interesting.The core gameplay is similar to a 2.5-d version of Super Metroid, with less exploration. This is by far the most linear Metroid game, and I think that's a mistake in a series known for its exploration-based gameplay. The decision to use the Wii's D-pad instead of the nunchuk's analog stick leads to some imprecision, though one gets the impression that the game was designed with this in mind, so problems with it rarely come up. In addition, the decision to wrest the decision of when to use missiles away from the player leads to some very frustrating moments. The elimination of power-ups is an odd omission as well; instead of getting them, simply hold the Wiimote upwards and hold A until your missiles refill, or when you're low on health, until a bar fills, restoring some of it. One could argue this was done to avoid the problem of collecting power-ups in a pseudo 3D environment, but the original Prime solved this problem in 2002 by letting the charge beam attract the power ups. I don't understand why this couldn't have been done here, too.BUT, and this is a big but, one can't really blame Nintendo or Team Ninja for refusing to simply make another entry in the Prime series. As someone who preferred the control scheme of the Gamecube controller to that of Metroid Prime 3's imprecise aiming mechanisms, I can see why someone would want to move away from it. While the game on the whole may be a mistake, it at least took some chances with the formula of Metroid in an attempt to streamline it instead of just adding features. Nintendo has been playing it safe for so long with some many of its franchise, it's kind of nice to see them take a chance with a major label. The chance doesn't pay off as well as it should have, but hey, this is how progress gets made.The compliments I can give Other M are actually kind of numerous. Despite the control problems, the team made them work pretty well for the boss battles, which are often pretty spectacular. The fight with Ridley (despite immediately following one of the game's most insulting moments) is one of the best encounters with him in any of the games, comparable, I think, to the encounter at the end of the first Prime. The game's functional final bosses are both great as well, if a little short. The game's difficulty curve is about dead-on for these, too; I think the final boss may actually be the most difficult to kill.The game benefits from extremely brisk pacing as well. Just when I thought I was about to get sick of the game for stagnating, it introduced a new weapon or an interesting section, which kept things fresh throughout. Or, to put it another way, if Metroid Prime was this series' Jurassic Park, this is its Jurassic Park 3. Dumber, more action-oriented, but briskly getting the job done. The fact that I finished the game in about 8 hours is actually a point in its favor; it comes in, does what it needs to do and gets out before one can really get too tired of it. Think of it as the 90-minute franchise threequel that doesn't compare to the original but is entertaining nonetheless, and I think your expectations will be set about right.The game looks just fine and sounds just fine too. The music isn't too memorable, and the woman voicing Samus is just awful, but the rest of it is functional on an aesthetic level. I would have like a couple of tracks that paid tribute to classic Metroid tunes, but above I criticized Nintendo for stagnating, so whatever. I'm loathe to criticize a Wii game's graphics- why beat a dead horse?- but there's nothing wrong here.Does that spell a recommendation? Just barely, and only for the price currently listed on Amazon (I got it for $10). If you can't get past the sexism (I can't say it bothers me too much compared to the storytelling fumbles), then by all means stay away; you'll be fully justified. But take Metroid: Other M for what it is- a dumb action game. Maybe later we'll be able to write off the story as non-canon, too.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2012"}

You finally get the story of Samus' origins, as juvenile and nonsensical as it is. I always liked the mystery of Samus: a female bounty hunter who rarely gives you dialogue and instead is surrounded by music that really sets the mood of her games. All that is taken away in this one: Samus is a chatterbox and the ambiance music is nowhere to be found (except for the general Metroid theme that's heard in a few boss fights).Another thing I was disappointed in was the fact that you don't re-collect your power-ups throughout the game; instead, your commander \"authorizes\" you to use them when he feels it's necessary. It's pretty frustrating when you have a grapple hook right above you, and you know you have the equipment, but a stupid storyline arc is preventing you from using it. I'd rather have just re-collected the items throughout the game.But that's not to say this is a bad game. I can forgive dumb storylines and bland music; I was just disappointed because of Metroid's past track-record of excellence here. But overall, this is a great game, as is any game in the Metroid series. Playing in third-person is a nice shift, and the controls are very fluid. You start the game without being able to change the difficulty level, but I found the difficulty to be perfect: the entire game presented countless challenges, but nothing was impossible to beat. And, as usual, there's a lot of value in finding all the energy tanks, missile tanks, etc. after you beat the game. In fact, they even have a cool \"epilogue\" sequence after you beat the game.If you decide to pick this game up, I do have to warn you about a glitch that is said to affect 50% of all \"Other M\" Wii discs. There are two points in the game (right after you get the ice beam, and right after you defeat a boss for a third time) where, if you decide to backtrack at those points, about 2/3's through the game, you'll find a locked door. Your game ends right there, unfortunately, as you have no way to open the door. Well, there IS a way to open it: you have to call Nintendo customer service and explain your problem, then they'll send you a UPC bar code, and then you have to mail in your game disc and wait up to 4 weeks before the game is fixed. So, if you get this game, I just caution you to research where the glitch is so you don't have this happen to you. How this got beyond the \"bug test\" phase is beyond me, a real slap in the face from Nintendo.But, don't blame Samus for Nintendo's failures. I suggest for any Metroid fan or Nintendo fan to pick this one up when you have about 15 hours to kill.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

It does feature some realism, like cars blowing up while you're trying to hide behind them (nice touch), but, you find yourself sometimes going up against TONS of bad guys with literally no end in sight. I mean, shooting at 90 bad guys in one room is a bit of a reach, and they just keep coming!!! Same with some of the other levels. I found some areas incredibly hard, while other areas, were very easy. Sometimes you're killed and you don't even know why, who did it, or where it came from!!!There is one area where you have to reach a helicopter at the \"LZ\", and you have 3 minutes to do so.....Well, that's all fine and dandy, and you even have air support to do it.....EVEN BETTER! Well, what I found totally stupid was, when you call for air support, tons of bombs are being dropped right on TOP of the bad guys, yet, 79 bad guys are still running around!!! COME OOOOOOOONNNN!!!!!! Are you kidding me?????? Or the bombs miss the bad guys entirely, and hit YOU!!! And this entire review was based on the EASIEST SETTING!Now, as much as I found some of the bits of this game V-E-R-Y unrealistic, I suppose it's got it's \"fun factor\", and it did have some great moments, but, I still find myself going back to my old favorites: Sniper Elite, and the SOCOM series I, II, 3 & 4 for my military gaming fun. They're still better and (to me) they offer more realism than this game offers!PROS: I love that you can use walls, cars, buildings, for cover, shooting through wood crates & thin metal walls to kill a person (which is very realistic), the ability to throw grenades back to the bad guys, the weapons are quite realistic, sniping is fun...etc...CONS: Many areas could have been improved on. Way too many bad guys in many areas, certain sections were just way too hard, yet, others were quite easy. If you set a game on \"Easy\" or \"Hard\" it should be the same throughout the entire game. Not INCREDIBLY hard, and easy at the same time.Now, I can not review the online game play, since I do not use any of my PS systems for online play, (I just don't have the time) heheI would however, like to see a new PS3 version of SOCOM (please!) and bring back the \"blood\", please!!!!!! I guess until that happens, I'll keep playing my original SOCOM games for my military game addiction.....I guess I really love the slow, stealthiness, that you need in SOCOM, to complete missions. Maybe, this game is a bit too fast paced for me? Who knows....Again, this was a fun & decent game, worth the money, great graphics, some areas were awesome, some areas were realistic, and some were definitely NOT! Really good game overall, but on the easiest setting, this game should not have been this hard to beat. However, even with all the things I did not like about it, I do feel that it was worth the money, and it's still a fun game to play, but I feel that it could have been improved upon a bit more before it was released.Just my .02c worth!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2008"}

Bottom line is if you like Call of Duty games, you'll like this. It's got everything you'd expect: Over the top single player, variety of weapons and levels, and an addictive multiplayer. And zombies.The single player game is maybe not as strong as far as gameplay goes as it's predecessor, Modern Warfare 2, but it's not quite on the same grand scale. However, as far as characters and story go, this is probably the best Call of Duty campaign of the whole series. The game has numerous twists and turns you won't see coming, and it all comes to a satisfying conclusion. I don't want to talk too much about the story as to avoid spoiling it. Also, the varied time periods and player characters keep the game very interesting. The voice acting, featuring Sam Worthington, Ed Harris and Gary Oldman is also very strong.The multiplayer has been overhauled from Modern Warfare 2, and some of the changes are great, others not so much. Instead of completing challenges to upgrade your guns and equipment, there is now an in game currency used for customization. This is great as you can pick and choose what weapons and upgrades you get and in what order, but it's not quite as exciting as the old system. \"3 more kills and I get the tactical knife\" is much more interesting than \"3 more kills and I get a couple of hundred call of duty points.\" Still, it works, and is very addictive. The addition of wager matches, where you play customized game modes to win points (or lose them) is very exciting and having these modes to play as alternatives to standard modes adds a lot of life to the game.Zombie mode is a lot of fun, if too similar to the mode in World at War. It's a great time with friends, but solo zombies is a little flat. This game really could have used a Special Ops mode like Modern Warfare 2, as that could be a lot of fun alone.Overall I'd recommend it if you like Call of Duty games or other fast paced action shooters. There's nothing revolutionary, but there's lots of fun to be had.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

I thought it was pretty original and fun when it came out. I wanted to love P2, but found it very repetitive, and too much like the original. I'm mainly a PC player, but rented Prototype 2 for my son's Xbox to preview it. I can't say it wasn't any fun, and their is a story line, but I found myself skipping the story to get to the action. I would say to rent the game, and don't pay $50.00 for basically the same game as Prototype 1.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2012"}
